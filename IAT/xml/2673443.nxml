So far, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> EngA is reported to bind the 50S ribosomal subunit in the guanosine-5&#x02032;-trihosphate (GTP) bound state. Here, for the first time, using mutations that allow isolating the activities of the two G-domains, GD1 and GD2, we show that apart from 50S, EngA also binds the 30S and 70S subunits. We identify that the key requirement for any EngA&#x02013;ribosome association is GTP binding to GD2. In this state, EngA displays a weak 50S association, which is further stabilized when GD1 too binds GTP. Exchanging bound GTP with guanosine-5&#x02032;-diphosphate (GDP), at GD1, results in interactions with 50S, 30S and 70S. Therefore, it appears that GD1 employs GTP hydrolysis as a means to regulate the differential specificity of EngA to either 50S alone or to 50S, 30S and 70S subunits. Furthermore, using constructs lacking either GD1 or both GD1 and GD2, we infer that GD1, when bound to GTP and GDP, adopts distinct conformations to mask or unmask the 30S binding site on EngA. Our results suggest a model where distinct nucleotide-bound states of the two G-domains regulate formation of specific EngA&#x02013;ribosome complexes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Guanosine-5&#x02032;-trihosphate (GTP) binding proteins or GTPases make use of conformational changes associated with GTP binding and hydrolysis and thereby switch between three distinct nucleotide-bound states, i.e. an &#x02018;empty&#x02019; nucleotide-free state, a GTP-bound &#x02018;ON&#x02019; state and a guanosine-5&#x02032;-diphosphate (GDP)-bound &#x02018;OFF&#x02019; state. In doing so, several well characterized GTPases act as molecular switches and impart a tight control over important biological processes ranging from signal transduction, translation, intracellular transport and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). On the other hand, little is known about the function of 11 universally conserved bacterial GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Although initially thought to be present in prokaryotes, some of these are well conserved in eukaryotes too. Several recent reports suggest that these GTPases bind ribosomal subunits and possibly play key roles in their biogenesis or assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">4&#x02013;14</xref>). Of these, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Obg is implicated in the process of ribosome assembly where it interacts with both the 30S and 50S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). HflX was recently shown to bind the 50S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Of the circularly permuted GTPases, YjeQ and YloQ bind the 30S ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), RbgA or YlqF participates in the late step of 50S subunit assembly in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and YqeH binds 30S in the GTP-bound form (B. Anand <italic>et al.</italic> unpublished results) to participate in its assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Era is known to bind the 30S ribosomal subunit in a nucleotide-free state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). EngA has been shown to bind the 50S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>) and it has been reported that YphC (EngA homologue in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) and YsxC function together in 50S assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Of the aforementioned proteins, EngA is unique as it is the only GTPase known to possess two contiguous G-domains, GD1 and GD2. A KH-domain that follows the G-domains is usually known to be involved in RNA binding or participate in protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Based on the crystal structure of Der, an EngA homologue in <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic>, it was postulated that the KH-domain participates in protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). A recently determined structure of YphC from <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, suggests its role in binding the ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). As several prokaryotic GTPases bind ribosomal subunits, we began our investigations to find out if EngA too would bind the ribosome. Reports by Hwang and Inouye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), Bharat <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and Schaefer <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) concur with our observation that EngA binds the 50S ribosomal subunit specifically when bound to a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue, guanosine-5-[&#x003b2;,&#x003b3;-imido]triphosphate (GMPPNP). Bharat <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) further suggest that both G-domains are important for ribosome binding. The crystal structure of YphC too, suggests the involvement of GD1 in ribosome binding, wherein a large conformational change (&#x0223c;60 &#x000c5;) is observed in GD1 between its GTP and GDP-bound forms. By comparing structures of Der (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and YphC, Muench <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) hypothesize that the GTP-bound state of GD1 exposes a positively charged RNA-binding region on the surface of KH-domain, which is masked due to the large movement of GD1. Schaefer <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) indicate that the ribosome exits YphC in its GDP-bound state. On the whole, these studies indicate an importance for the two G-domains of EngA in binding the ribosomal subunits.</p><p>Hitherto, EngA was shown to bind the 50S ribosomal subunit. Here, for the first time, we show that <italic>E. coli</italic> EngA not only binds the 50S but also 30S and 70S. We identify two distinct ribosome-bound states of EngA&#x02014;one where it binds 50S alone and another where it binds 50S, 30S and 70S. We associate this differential binding to the different nucleotide occupancy states of GD1 and GD2, based on co-fractionation experiments with ribosomal subunits using EngA mutants, which either disable nucleotide binding or change specificity from guanine to xanthine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Surprisingly in a very recent report BipA, a highly conserved prokaryotic GTPase, was also shown to bind 70S and 30S subunits, although the latter is achieved in presence of ppGpp, an alarmone synthesized during stress. The 70S binding to BipA is realized in presence of GMPPNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In contrast, here we show that EngA achieves the two distinct ribosome-bound states by varying the GTP or GDP-bound states of the two G-domains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The gene coding for EngA (503 amino acids) was amplified using forward (CTAGCTAGCGTGCGTTGTCTGATGAT) and reverse (CCGCTCGAGTTATTTATTTTTCTTGATGTG) primers from <italic>E. coli k12</italic> genomic DNA, using <italic>Pfu</italic> DNA polymerase (Fermentas).

The <italic>rrmJ</italic> null mutants lead to significant accumulation of ribosomal subunits at the expense of functional 70S particles, which are restored to normal levels upon overexpressing EngA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This suggests a functional relationship between EngA and 23S rRNA or the 50S subunit. We first wanted to examine if EngA binds 23S rRNA, as RrmJ does.</p><p>EngA, cloned in pQE2 and pET28A vectors to produce His<sub>6</sub>-tagged protein, led to highly insoluble aggregates, upon overexpression. The GST fused EngA proteins produced in pGEX vector, increased protein solubility significantly (see Materials and methods section). Hence, GST&#x02013;EngA was used for further experimentation. The GST&#x02013;EngA overexpressing (<italic>E. coli</italic>) cells were lysed in an RNase-free environment and the protein (GST&#x02013;EngA) was purified by GSTrap affinity purification. When this was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography experiments, it eluted in the void volume fractions (data not shown). A phenol&#x02013;chloroform extraction of the fractions containing GST&#x02013;EngA suggests that both 23S rRNA and 16S rRNA co-elute with the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lane 1). The identity of the rRNAs was verified using RT-PCR employing primers specific for 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA and the co-eluted rRNA as a template. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lane 2 shows the DNA amplified using 23S rRNA primers and lane 3 shows the DNA amplified using 16S rRNA primers. Size of the amplified DNA fragments was found to be 2.9 and 1.5 kb, respectively, in accordance with the sizes of 23S and 16S rRNAs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A thus reveals that not only 23S rRNA co-elutes with the protein, as we had anticipated, but also the 16S rRNA. In agreement with this observation, Hwang and Innoye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) also found that <italic>der</italic>-depleted cells accumulate 16S and 23S rRNA precursors.</p><p>EngA belongs to the family of universally conserved bacterial GTPases, of which some like Era have been shown to bind the 16S rRNA, but not 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Most members of this family are now known to interact with ribosomal subunits in a specific nucleotide-bound state of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">4&#x02013;15</xref>). These observations, together with the co-elution of 16S and 23S rRNA, suggested that EngA would bind the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits. To verify ribosome binding, co-fractionation experiments were designed using cells overexpressing GST&#x02013;EngA. Prior to this, to rule out any additional effect the bulky GST-tag may have on the biochemical behaviour of the protein, we analysed the enzymatic activity, i.e. the ability to hydrolyse GTP, of GST&#x02013;EngA and EngA using the malachite green assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B shows that GTP hydrolysis by both GST-tagged and untagged EngA are similar.</p><p>The co-fractionation experiments designed to verify interactions of EngA with ribosomal subunits, were carried out with cells overexpressing the GST vector alone (as a negative control) and the cells overexpressing GST&#x02013;EngA. The cells were lysed in the presence of appropriate nucleotides, whenever indicated. The immuno-blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, using an anti-GST antibody, identify the protein present in the various fractions obtained following a sucrose density gradient centrifugation (see Materials and methods section). The negative control, i.e. cells expressing GST alone, shows no interaction with the ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, D1) and thus negates the possibility of the GST-tag generating interactions with the ribosome. In addition, the pGEX vector employed here was modified to have a TEV protease cleavage site following the GST and thrombin cleavage site, resulting in a large linker region (&#x0223c;15 residues) between GST and the protein. This allows sufficient domain movements between the two. Therefore, GST&#x02013;EngA was employed for all further experiments. EngA, from here on, implies GST&#x02013;EngA.</p><p>The experiment with cells overexpressing EngA reveals that it co-fractionates with the 50S subunit only in presence of non-hydrolysable GTP analogue, GMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, D4), but not GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, D3) or in absence of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, D2). In concurrence with existing reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) EngA seems to be a GTP-dependent 50S binding protein. As the strength of ribosomal interactions can be assessed by increasing the amount of salt used in the co-fractionation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), we employed the same to assess EngA&#x02013;50S interaction in presence of GMPPNP. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D (D5 and D6) show that the interactions are stable even at 150 and 350 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl.</p><p>While 50S binding accounts for 23S rRNA co-elution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), 16S rRNA co-elution remains unexplained. Hence, further experiments were designed to explore conditions that promote EngA&#x02013;30S interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>GTP binding to GD2 is a primary requirement for ribosome binding</title><p>The two G-domains of EngA have contrasting nucleotide binding affinities and GTP hydrolysis rates. Robinson <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) suggest that GD2 binds nucleotides with higher affinity and has slow GTP hydrolysis rates in comparison to GD1, which has lower nucleotide binding affinity and faster GTP hydrolysis rates. Hence, it could be that the two G-domains of EngA render distinct affects towards ribosome binding. To investigate the same, ribosome binding by EngA was tested while varying the nucleotide occupied states of the two G-domains. From hereon, for enhanced clarity, the GTP or GDP-bound states of GD1 and GD2 are denoted as GD1:GTP, GD1:GDP and GD2:GTP, GD2:GDP, respectively. Similarly, the nucleotide state of EngA, which is a consequence of the nucleotide-bound states of its two G-domains, is denoted as follows: for example, EngA[Apo:GTP] indicates that GD1 is in a nucleotide-free state and GD2 is in a GTP-bound state, while EngA[GDP:GTP] implies GD1 is in a GDP-bound state and GD2 is in a GTP-bound state, and so on.</p><p>In order to assess the significance of the two G-domains towards 50S binding, we generated single mutants K28A and K228A. These residues are present in the P-loops of GD1 and GD2, respectively. Typically, the lysine residues in the P-loops (GxxxxGKS/T) of GTPases coordinate the phosphates of GTP and GDP and their mutation is known to disrupt nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In the crystal structure of YphC (EngA homologue in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) too, these lysines show similar interactions with the nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Hence, GD1 or GD2 can be arrested in a nucleotide-free state, by single mutants K28A or K228A, respectively, while simultaneously controlling the nucleotide-bound state of the other G-domain (without a mutation) by supplying appropriate nucleotides during cell lysis.</p><p>However, to confirm the nucleotide-free states of GD1 and GD2 in K28A and K228A mutants, respectively, fluorescence nucleotide binding experiments were carried out using mant-nucleotides. The mant-nucleotides are sensitive fluorescent probes which show an increase in fluorescence when present in a hydrophobic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) i.e. when the mant-nucleotide binds to the protein in our experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A shows a decrease in mant-GDP binding by mutants K28A and K228A in comparison to wt-EngA that has two intact G-domains to bind the nucleotide. Interestingly, mutant K28A, that disrupts nucleotide binding at GD1, shows a higher binding in comparison with K228A, in which binding is disrupted at GD2. This is in agreement with the reported higher nucleotide binding affinity of GD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). These experiments confirm the nucleotide-free states generated by K28A and K228A.</p><p>Co-fractionation experiments were carried out with cells overexpressing mutants K28A or K228A, and lysed in presence of GMPPNP to ensure either the EngA[Apo:GTP] or EngA[GTP:Apo] state. Compared with the fluorescent nucleotide binding experiments where the protein is in excess (protein:nucleotide ratio 20:1), in all the co-fractionation experiments, the nucleotides (&#x0223c;1 mM) were provided in excess (over the protein &#x0223c;&#x000b5;M) to ensure that a majority of protein molecules attain the desired nucleotide-bound states. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D (D1), corresponding to K228A mutant, representing EngA[GTP:Apo] state, in presence of 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, shows no interactions with the ribosome. This suggests an importance of GD2:GTP in ribosome binding. In contrast, the K28A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, D2) representing the converse state, i.e. EngA[Apo:GTP], shows an interaction with 50S at 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. It is surprising that while the wt-protein retains 50S interaction even at 350 mM salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, D6), K28A mutant representing EngA[Apo:GTP] state, shows no interaction at 150 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, D3), suggesting a weak interaction. Hence, these experiments suggest that it is GTP binding to GD2, but not to GD1, which is a primary requirement to observe any 50S interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>GTP binding to GD1 stabilizes 50S binding</title><p>The above data suggests that EngA&#x02013;50S interaction requires a GD2:GTP state. However, the strong interaction seen for the wt-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, D5 and D6) suggests that the weak interactions found in EngA[Apo:GTP] state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, D2) may be further stabilized in the EngA[GTP:GTP] state, i.e. when GD1 also binds GTP. To substantiate this, we designed the following mutants that allow simultaneous variation of the nucleotide-bound states of GD1 and GD2, as the lysine mutants K28A or K228A only lead to a nucleotide-free (Apo) state.</p><p>Five conserved signature motifs (G1&#x02013;G5) in the G-domain participate in stabilizing the bound nucleotide and its hydrolysis. Of these, a conserved Asp in G4 motifs (N/TKxD) renders specificity to bind guanine nucleotides by making bifurcated hydrogen bonds to the guanine base of GTP/GDP. In the structure of YphC too, the corresponding residues D134, D337 in G4 motifs make similar interactions with the guanine ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Hence, D134N and D337N mutants of GD1 and GD2, respectively, were generated, as they would change specificity from guanine to xanthine nucleotides [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and references therein]. Like with the lysine mutants, D134N and D337N mutants were employed in fluorescent nucleotide binding experiments using mant-XDP and mant-GDP to verify nucleotide binding and change in specificity towards xanthine nucleotides. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B indicates D134N to bind mant-XDP at GD1, where the mutation was created and mant-GDP at GD2, which is not mutated. Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C indicates binding of mant-GDP at GD1 and mant-XDP at GD2, in D337N mutant. The selective binding to xanthine nucleotides by these mutants was further confirmed by measuring mant-XDP binding in presence of excess GDP (GDP:mant-XDP = 100:1). This does not affect mant-XDP binding significantly, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C. This verifies that the single mutants D134N and D337N allow for isolating nucleotide binding events at GD1 and GD2 and provide the ability to control the nucleotide states of both G-domains simultaneously, whereas wt-EngA preferentially binds mant-GDP (see Figure S1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp107/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>). In these, the domain carrying the mutation would bind xanthine nucleotides (when supplied) and allow guanine nucleotides to selectively bind the other.</p><p>When D134N mutant was tested for 50S binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, D4) in a co-fractionation experiment carried out at 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and in presence of GMPPNP but not XMPPNP (i.e. EngA[Apo:GTP] state), it shows interactions with 50S, like the K28A mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D (D2). As anticipated, upon increasing NH<sub>4</sub>Cl concentration to 150 mM, the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, D5) was completely abolished like in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D (D3). Interestingly, the 50S interaction can be restored, as in the wt-protein, if XMPPNP is also provided to achieve EngA[GTP:GTP] state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, D6). This restoration was also verified using D337N mutant in lieu of D134N in a similar experiment. Here too, 50S binding is restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, D7) as above. These experiments lend support to the observations made from K28A, K228A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, D1&#x02013;D3), that GD2:GTP initiates EngA&#x02013;50S interactions and GD1:GTP further stabilizes it.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of GD1 in binding specific ribosomal subunits</title><p>The above experiments show that both GD1:GTP and GD2:GTP are needed for efficient 50S binding. Since the D134N and D337N mutants additionally facilitate varying nucleotides occupied by the two G-domains, we questioned if doing so would alter ribosome binding. The EngA[GDP:GTP] analogous state was achieved using D337N mutant, in co-fractionation experiments containing GDP and XMPPNP. At 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, this state, surprisingly, shows interactions not only with the 50S, but also with 30S and 70S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, A1). To determine if the 30S and 70S interactions are specific to GD1:GDP, EngA[Apo:GTP] state was generated with the D337N mutant. Here, when GD1 is devoid of GDP, no interaction is observed with 30S and 70S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, A2), suggesting the importance of EngA[GDP:GTP] state for these interactions. These interactions could be restored upon supplying GDP at 150 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl too (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, A3), indicating stable binding.</p><p>So far it appears that EngA, by employing the GD1:GDP state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) generates additional interactions for binding 30S. To further understand the role of GD1 in regulating EngA&#x02013;ribosome interactions, we generated a construct &#x00394;GD1&#x02013;EngA, in which GD1 was truncated. When &#x00394;GD1&#x02013;EngA was employed in co-fractionation experiments, the protein bound 30S, 50S and 70S, even at 150 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, B1), like EngA[GDP:GTP)]. Interestingly, another construct, &#x00394;GD1&#x02013;&#x00394;GD2EngA, where both GD1 and GD2 were truncated (i.e. only the KH-domain was present), largely bound the 30S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, B2). Possibly, this experiment suggests that KH-domain possesses sites for 30S interaction, and taken together with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A (A&#x02013;A3), it appears that the 30S site is accessible only in the GD1:GDP state.</p><p>For ease of presentation, we define the EngA&#x02013;ribosome interactions (discussed thus far) examined from the cells overexpressing EngA, as <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. On the other hand, interactions described from now on, carried out using purified EngA and ribosomal subunits, would be referred as <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Unfastening inter-domain interactions facilitates EngA&#x02013;ribosome interactions</title><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> EngA&#x02013;ribosome interaction assays using purified EngA and ribosomal subunits, were carried out in presence of appropriate nucleotides. Surprisingly, the full length EngA constructs i.e. wt or the D to N mutants, failed to show any interaction in the EngA[GTP:GTP] or EngA[GDP:GTP] states. This led us to suspect the presence of an unknown factor in the cell lysate enabling these interactions in the <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies. To examine this, the whole cell lysate devoid of ribosomes, was added to the reaction mixtures. However, this too did not result in any EngA&#x02013;ribosome association (data not shown).</p><p>Surprisingly, &#x00394;GD1&#x02013;&#x00394;GD2EngA, where both GD1 and GD2 were truncated (i.e. only the KH-domain was present), or a construct &#x00394;GD1&#x02013;EngA, where GD1 was truncated, when incubated with the purified ribosomal subunits, interacted with specific ribosomal subunits, as in the <italic>in vivo</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In these studies, &#x00394;GD1&#x02013;&#x00394;GD2EngA associated with the 30S and &#x00394;GD1&#x02013;EngA with 30S, 50S and 70S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, C1&#x02013;C2). These experiments suggest that EngA needs to be devoid of GD1 to restore interactions with ribosomal subunits in the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. We reasoned that, in the full length protein, the inter-domain interactions provided by GD1 may lock the enzyme in a conformational state inappropriate for binding the ribosome. Often, mild concentrations of urea, guanidium hydrochloride or SDS loosen inter-domain interactions, which may be facilitated, <italic>in vivo</italic>, by a factor present in the cell lysate. To examine this, the full length D337N mutant was incubated on ice for 20 min with increasing concentrations of urea (from 500 mM to 2 M). From this, 100 pmol of protein was added to the crude ribosome in presence of appropriate nucleotides. The final concentration of urea in reaction mixtures, following this dilution, was &#x0223c;15&#x02013;45 mM. Surprisingly, incubating D337N mutant in 1.5&#x02013;2 M of urea, restored interactions with 50S in the EngA[GTP:GTP] state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, C3) and with 30S, 50S and 70S in the EngA[GDP:GTP] state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, C4). However, it appears from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C that only a small fraction of the protein molecules associate with the ribosomal subunits, as most of the protein remains in the top fractions. Perhaps this could be associated to the mild urea concentrations (&#x0223c;15&#x02013;45 mM) employed here. To clarify if urea interferes with nucleotide binding, fluorescent nucleotide binding assays were conducted in the presence and absence of 1.5 M urea. Emission spectra show that guanine and xanthine nucleotide binding to the protein (D337N mutant) remains unaltered even at 1.5 M urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>Role of GD1&#x02013;KH interactions in ribosome association</title><p><italic>In vitro</italic> experiments with urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) made us examine interactions at the domain interfaces of EngA, which may be disrupted by urea to achieve an appropriate conformational state of EngA that binds the ribosome. In the crystal structure of YphC (EngA homologue in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>), GD1, bound to GDP, provides hydrophobic interactions for the GD1&#x02013;KH interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). GTP binding to GD1 disrupts these interactions as evident from the large conformational change (&#x0223c;60 &#x000c5;) in the position of GD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). This hydrophobic nature of GD1&#x02013;KH interface is conserved in several homologs of EngA. We, therefore, reasoned that in the aforementioned <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), urea may disrupt these interactions at GD1&#x02013;KH interface and allow ribosome binding. To examine this, Tyr134, a key residue contributed by GD1 to this interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), was mutated (see Figure S2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp107/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>). A His-YphC double mutant (Y134A, D297N) and the wt-His-YphC were employed in the <italic>in vitro</italic> interactions. In YphC, D297 is identical to D337 of <italic>E. coli</italic> EngA and hence its mutation to N would alter the specificity of GD2 from guanine to xanthine. When wt-HisYphC was incubated with purified ribosomal subunits, it did not display any interactions in EngA[GTP:GTP] state as noted for GST&#x02013;EngA in the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. As anticipated, the YphC double mutant restored interactions with the 50S in EngA[GTP:GTP] state and also with 30S, 50S and 70S in the EngA[GDP:GTP] state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). These results are in accordance with the <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions displayed by GST&#x02013;EngA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>D and 3A). The mant-XDP and mant-GDP binding to wt-HisYphC and the double mutant were verified, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>EngA is essential for bacterial cell growth. Cells depleted with <italic>engA</italic> show slower growth patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Current reports show that it interacts with the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and participates in its biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). EngA is particularly interesting and distinctive due to the two tandem G-domains, GD1 and GD2, it possesses, apart from the KH-domain. The results provided here demonstrate that by the use of distinct nucleotide-bound states of the two G-domains, EngA regulates ribosome binding.</p><p>A previous report has shown that a null mutant of <italic>rrmJ</italic>, an rRNA methylase, displays an increase in the level of unassembled 30S and 50S subunits and a decrease in 70S. This effect was restored upon overexpressing EngA or Obg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), indicating their role in ribosome assembly (formation of 70S). Apart from this, Obg and EngA are known to be involved in ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and Obg is also known to bind both 30S and 50S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Similarly, we found EngA to co-elute with both 23S and 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), although RrmJ only binds and modifies the 23S rRNA. However, like other investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), we too found EngA to interact only with the 50S subunit in a GTP dependent manner, but not with the 30S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, D4&#x02013;D6). 50S interaction accounts for the co-elution of 23S rRNA, while 16S rRNA co-elution remains elusive. Driven by these facts, we reasoned that EngA would bind both 50S and 30S ribosomal subunits if appropriate conditions were provided and that the two G-domains have a role in generating these.</p><p>The importance of the G-domains is underscored by their contrasting GTP binding and hydrolyzing activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Also, Brown and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) suggest that both G-domains play critical roles for the cellular function of EngA. By using single mutants K28A or K228A that arrest GD1 or GD2, respectively, in a nucleotide-free state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), we deduce that GTP binding to GD2 is a primary requirement for any EngA&#x02013;50S interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, D1&#x02013;D2).</p><p>The significance of GD1 is revealed in experiments where it is held in a GTP-bound state. Using salt-sensitivity of an interaction as an estimated indicator of the binding strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), we infer that a weak interaction with 50S in EngA[Apo:GTP] state, is further strengthened in EngA[GTP:GTP] state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). It appears that 50S interactions are initiated by the GD2:GTP conformation, but both GD1:GTP and GD2:GTP result in an efficient and sustained EngA&#x02013;50S interaction.</p><p>The importance of nucleotide occupancies of the two G-domains is further revealed by mutants D134N and D337N, which allow specific binding to xanthine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). By segregating nucleotide binding events at the two G-domains using guanine and/or xanthine nucleotides with these mutants, we could identify conditions where EngA not only binds the 50S subunit but also the 30S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, A1&#x02013;A3). The 30S interaction thus rationalizes 16S rRNA co-elution found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A. In addition, it also accounts for the recent observation that EngA interacts with the structural protein S7 of the 30S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). However, the most significant finding based on these experiments is that EngA exists in two distinct &#x02018;ribosome-bound states&#x02019; as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. The first state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) provided by EngA[GTP:GTP)] or EngA[Apo:GTP] binds 50S, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D) and the second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B) provided by EngA[GDP:GTP] binds 30S, 50S and 70S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). These two ribosome-bound states of EngA are distinguished by the GTP and GDP-bound forms of GD1 indicating an important regulatory role for it.</p><p>A recently determined crystal structure of YphC reveals a large conformational change (&#x0223c;60 &#x000c5;) of GD1 between its GTP and GDP-bound forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Based on structural similarity to the C-terminal domain of S3 ribosomal protein, the authors define an ON state for EngA, where it binds rRNA via a region contributed by KH-domain and GD2 (indicated by a circle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). They speculate that EngA switches to an OFF state in GD1:GDP and results in a large conformational change (of GD1), which makes this region inaccessible to RNA. The proposed ON state is EngA[GTP:GDP] and the OFF state is EngA[GDP:GDP]. In contrast, our work shows that when GD2 is devoid of GTP, EngA does not bind any of the ribosomal subunits. Given this, the implications of the structural similarity and the proposed rRNA binding site observed by Muench <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) are intriguing. Interestingly, we find that when GD1 is truncated, the construct &#x00394;GD1&#x02013;EngA binds 30S, 50S and 70S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, C1), essentially behaving like the EngA[GDP:GTP] state. Hence, this construct seems to provide analogous interactions and accomplish a state similar to the &#x02018;second ribosome-bound state&#x02019; of EngA. However, &#x00394;GD1&#x02013;&#x00394;GD2EngA, where both GD1 and GD2 are truncated, binds the 30S, implying that KH-domain alone is sufficient to provide the 30S binding interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, C2). As &#x00394;GD1&#x02013;EngA and EngA[GDP:GTP] bind 30S, while EngA[GTP:GTP] does not, it is possible that GD1, upon GTP binding undergoes a conformational change (see arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) and masks the 30S site on the KH-domain.</p><p>In addition to this, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, carried out using <italic>E. coli</italic> EngA and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> YphC, indicate a need for the disruption of GD1&#x02013;KH interface to promote ribosome binding, together with GTP hydrolysis at GD1. The wt-proteins, GST&#x02013;EngA and His-YphC, fail to interact with ribosomal subunits, unless supplied with a mild concentration of urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) or till the inter-domain interactions are compromised by mutating Tyr134 at the GD1&#x02013;KH interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Perhaps, this indicates the need for an additional factor in the cellular environment to facilitate the disruption of GD&#x02013;KH interface and appropriately position GD1 to promote ribosome binding.</p><p>Together with the inferences drawn based on this study, and the available structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), the rRNA binding proposed by Muench <italic>et al.</italic> may be further clarified as follows. Assuming there would be no large conformational change between GD2:GTP and GD2:GDP, the site proposed by Muench <italic>et al.</italic> is likely responsible for 50S binding, as it is proposed to be at the interface of GD2 and KH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Furthermore, GD1 makes use of GTP binding to mask the 30S binding site provided by the KH-domain and also stabilizes 50S interaction. The GTP hydrolysis at GD1 would then result in unmasking the 30S binding site (see arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). On the other hand, Muench <italic>et al.</italic> do not find any other exposed and conserved region to bind rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) that can account for a 30S site, necessitating further crystal structure analysis.</p><p>Our work, for the first time, presents evidence that EngA binds both 50S and 30S, and most importantly, depicts two distinct conformational states of EngA with varied specificity for ribosomal subunits. Taken together with the large conformational change in GD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and the role of EngA in ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that EngA, having completed the 50S assembly in the EngA[GTP:GTP] state, promotes 50S&#x02013;30S interaction in the EngA[GDP:GTP] state to assemble the complete 70S particles.</p><p>Evidently, rigorous experimentation will be needed to examine the biological significance of GD1 in enabling EngA to switch between the two &#x02018;ribosome-bound states&#x02019;. Determining the crystal structures of EngA in the various nucleotide states of its G-domains could relate the large conformational changes to the function of the protein, i.e. ribosome biogenesis and/or assembly. Our attempts so far have led to poorly diffracting crystals and efforts are underway to improve their quality to elucidate the structural mechanisms prevalent in EngA.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp107/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Wellcome Trust, UK (in the form of International Senior Research Fellowship to B.P., grant number 73616); Department of Biotechnology, Government of India; CARE funds, IIT Kanpur.
