In painful neuropathies, intraepidermal TRPV1 nerve fibre expression is low or absent, suggesting that pain generated is not directly related to sensory nerve fibres. Recent evidence suggests that keratinocytes may act as thermal receptors via TRPV1. The aim was to investigate epidermal TRPV1 expression in patients with neuropathic conditions associated with pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results:</title><p>In a prospective study of distal small nerve fibre neuropathy (DISN; <italic>n</italic> = 13) and diabetic neuropathy (DN; <italic>n</italic> = 12) intraepidermal nerve fibre density was assessed using the pan axonal marker PGP 9.5 and epidermal TPVR1 immunoreactivity compared with controls (<italic>n</italic> = 9). Intraepidermal nerve fibres failed to show TRPV1 immunoreactivity across all groups. There was moderate and strong TRPV1 reactivity of epidermal keratinocytes in 41.8% and 6% for DISN, 32.9% and 2.9% for DN and 25.4% and 5.1% for controls, respectively. Moderate keratinocyte TRPV1 expression was significantly increased in DISN compared with controls (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Our study suggests that in human painful neuropathies, epidermal TRPV1 expression is mainly in keratinocytes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>diabetic neuropathy</kwd><kwd>epidermis</kwd><kwd>idiopathic small nerve fibre disease</kwd><kwd>keratinocytes</kwd><kwd>neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>transient receptor potential vanilloid 1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Capsaicin, the primary pungent compound in &#x02018;hot&#x02019; chili peppers, produces pain and inflammation when placed on skin or mucous membranes.

Although one study in a patient with postherpetic neuralgia has shown increased TRPV1+ intraepidermal nerve fibres (IENF), a recent study in patients with painful neuropathy found that TRPV1+ IENF were reduced and sometimes completely absent, suggesting that TRPV1 in epidermal axons is not primarily involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> Rather, it has been suggested that the skin as a whole may act as a polymodal nociceptor which undergoes functional changes in painful conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> We set out to study the expression of epidermal TRPV1 in human skin by investigating two different types of neuropathy compared with healthy controls. Idiopathic small nerve fibre neuropathy was chosen because spontaneous heat pain is one of its primary characteristics, diabetic neuropathy (DN) because this is a common cause of sensory neuropathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In a prospective study, hypothenar intraepidermal nerve fibre density (IENFD) from healthy subjects and from subjects referred for investigation of neuropathy was assessed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> In the subgroup reported here, the distribution of TPVR1 in the epidermis of the human skin is described.

One neurologist (E.P.W.-S.) examined all healthy subjects to exclude neuropathy based on the absence of clinical features of sensory and motor symptoms and a normal sensory motor examination. Inclusion was furthermore dependent upon a negative history for diabetes, alcoholism, radiculopathies, ulnar or median nerve entrapments and no previous exposure to chemotherapy or other neurotoxic medications.

Sections were mounted on glass slides, washed in five to six 1-h changes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 1 h in a solution of serum (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) to block non-specific binding of the antibody. This was followed by incubation overnight in affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to neuropeptide protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 or TRPV1. PGP 9.5 is found in vertebrate neurons and neuroendocrine cells and is commonly used to detect intraepidermal nerve fibres.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> The antibody to TRPV1 was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO, USA). The sections were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a 1:200 dilution of biotinylated goat antirabbit IgG (Vector), followed by three changes of PBS to remove non-reacting secondary antibody. The sections were then reacted for 1 h at room temperature with an avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex. The bound antibodies were visualized by treatment for 5 min in 0.05% 3,3,diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.2% nickel ammonium sulphate in Tris buffer with 0.05% hydrogen peroxide. The colour reaction was stopped with several washes of Tris buffer, followed by PBS. Sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, dehydrated and lightly counterstained with methyl green before cover-slipping. Control experiments replaced the primary antibody with PBS or non-immune rabbit IgG serum fraction. The experiments were performed on the skin of the hypothenar region and showed lack of immunoreactivity.</p></sec><sec><title><sc>intraepidermal nerve fibre density assessment</sc></title><p>IENFD assessment was achieved by staining skin obtained from the hypothenar region with PGP 9.5, as previously described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref></p></sec><sec><title><sc>quantification of trpv1 receptor staining in keratinocytes</sc></title><p>Assessment of immunoreactivity with TRPV1 was performed using a previously described and standardized semiquantitative assessment of photographs taken from antibody-labelled sections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> Using Image-Pro&#x000ae; Plus software, the colour image was converted into a black-and-white image with eight levels of monochrome grey tones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). This picture was termed the &#x02018;filter&#x02019;. The operator then selected the cut-off level of the perceived limit of TRPV1 staining. The operator was aided in this selection by a diagrammatic scale of the range of staining intensities seen in the &#x02018;filter&#x02019;. The software program arbitrarily attaches a number ranging from 0 to 225 across all intensities of immunoreactivity, with absent (visually perceived as white) reactivity being ranked 225. The chosen numerical values used to assign intensity of reactivity with the Image-Pro&#x000ae; Plus software were 155&#x02013;225 for absent staining (equivalent to immunonegativity); 154&#x02013;124 for moderate and 123&#x02013;0 for the highest level of immunoreactivity. Moderate and intense reactivity was selected by the operator at levels thought to represent moderate and intense immunoreactivity of cells. The 155&#x02013;225 range (equivalent to immunonegativity) was assigned a red colour, 154&#x02013;124 (moderate reactivity) yellow and 123&#x02013;0 (highest immunoreactivity) green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). The Image-Pro&#x000ae; Plus software was then used to calculate the areas of the different intensities of TRPV1 reativity of the epidermal tissue. The data were formulated as the percentage of epidermal tissue without and with moderate and strong immunoreactivity for TRPV1. Measurements were performed for five fields per patient chosen at random from two sections oriented longitudinally (425 &#x003bc;m). The operator delineated the field of epidermal skin to be assessed by the software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). The percentage area of TRPV1 keratinocyte immunoreactivity was then automatically derived for the whole epidermal region as well as separately for the suprabasal and basal compartments. This subdivision was designed to assess separately the more actively dividing basal cell layers from the more differentiated keratinocyte cells located higher in the epidermis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> The suprabasal epidermal compartment was taken as the top 2/3 region in the absence of anchoring papillae extending into the dermis. For anchoring papillae two cell layers superior to the basal laminae were included. The mean suprabasal and basal epidermal regions of absent, moderate and intense TRPV1 reactivity were obtained for each subject and subsequently summarized as means for each of the three groups.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A</bold>, standard skin transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) immunoreactivity in a patient with distal idiopathic small nerve fibre disease. <bold>B</bold>, the same image converted to black and white with eight levels of monochrome grey tones. <bold>C</bold>, the same image further converted into colour coding: green represents the most intense immunoreactivity, yellow moderate reactivity and red immunonegativity.

The authors propose that pain is maintained by a peripheral nociceptive maladaptation located within the skin, a theory apparently supported by neuropathic pain directly and drastically responding to excision of the painful skin.</p><p>The association of increased keratinocyte TRPV1 in human conditions with pain has recently been demonstrated in women with breast pain, in patients with rectal hypersensitivity and faecal urgency, as well as in pruritic skin of patients with prurigo nodularis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> We recently described a patient with steroid-responsive small nerve fibre symptoms of burning feet and hands, where keratinocytes showed strong TRPV1 expression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> On follow-up skin biopsy after steroid administration, keratinocyte TRPV1 expression was drastically reduced in parallel with remission of clinical symptoms (manuscript in preparation).</p><p>The semiquantitative technique employed in this study has shown that in the epidermis of the healthy human glabrous skin about one-third of the keratinocytes show moderate TRPV1 expression, around 5% intensely so. The suprabasal epidermal area showed highest expression across all three groups, suggesting that expression may be linked to greater differentiation of keratinocytes, which is least in the basal epidermal region.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> This contrasts with the study by Stander <italic>et al.</italic>, which found the highest expression in the basal keratinocytes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> This may be due to differences in TRPV1 antibody specificity, in addition to the different skin type (glabrous) examined in the present study.</p><p>Our study has several shortcomings. Because of small numbers, it was not possible to perform statistical analysis to analyse the effect of burning compared with no burning across the groups or within groups. This would be of considerable interest in future studies. Furthermore, neuropathic pain or thermal hypersensitivity was also seen in some of the patients with DN. This overlap of clinical symptoms may help to explain why the mean keratinocyte TRPV1 expression in the DN group was also higher compared with controls.</p><p>In conclusion, our data show that increased keratinocyte TRPV1 expression in patients with small nerve fibre neuropathy and, to a lesser extent, in DN may play a role in explaining some of the typical clinical features of increased sensitivity to noxious stimuli.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations:</title><def-list><def-item><term>DISN</term><def><p>distal idiopathic small nerve fibre disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DN</term><def><p>diabetic neuropathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSFN</term><def><p>distal idiopathic small nerve fibre neuropathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IENF</term><def><p>intraepidermal nerve fibres</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IENFD</term><def><p>intraepidermal nerve fibre density</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBS</term><def><p>phosphate-buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGP</term><def><p>protein gene product</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TRPV1</term><def><p>transient receptor potential vanilloid 1</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><ack><p>This study was supported by Singapore National Medical Research Grant 0520/2001.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Szallasi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Vanilloid (capsaicin) receptors and mechanisms</article-title><source>Pharmacol.
