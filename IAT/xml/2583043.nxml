It consists of five different subunits, &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, &#x003b4; and &#x003b5;, (also referred to as subunits 1&#x02013;5) at a 1&#x02236;1 ratio. Subunit 5 is catalytic, whereas subunits 1&#x02013;4 are regulatory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Kimball1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The eIF2B complex serves as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor of eIF2, another major translation initiation factor that is activated by binding GTP. eIF2-GTP binds and loads the initiator Met-tRNAi onto the small ribosomal subunit, to form the 43S pre-initiation complex that binds to the mRNA. Upon AUG recognition at each round of translation initiation, GTP is hydrolyzed and eIF2-GDP is released. Inactive eIF2-GDP is then recycled by eIF2B to eIF2-GTP, which can serve again to establish another initiation event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Sonenberg1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. eIF2B activity governs the rate of global protein synthesis in the cell. Upon a variety of stress conditions such as starvation, viral infection, oxidative and ER-stress, eIF2 is phosphorylated by one of four kinases (HRI, PKR, GCN2 or PERK) on Ser51 of its alpha subunit, generating a phosphorylated form of eIF2 that functions as a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B. The ratio of eIF-2B to eIF-2 is approximately 0.6 and 0.3 in rat liver and reticulocytes, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Kimball2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and 0.3 in rat oligodendroglial-derived cells (Elroy-Stein, unpublished). Therefore, phosphorylation of only part of the total cellular eIF2 could potentially sequester all of the eIF-2B into an inactive eIF2-eIF2B complex. Due to its essential role in protein synthesis under normal and stress conditions, it is surprising that mutations in each eIF2B subunit, rather than being lethal, specifically lead to a neurodegenerative disease in humans. This disease, termed eIF2B-related leukodystrophy, is also known as Childhood Ataxia with CNS Hypomyelination (CACH) or Vanishing White Matter (VWM). The classical form of the disease is characterized by progressive loss of myelin in the CNS, leading to motor and cognitive neurological symptoms that deteriorate upon physiological stress, such as fever and mild head trauma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Schiffmann1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-vanderKnaap1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. For obvious reasons, brain glial cells from patients are not available for research. Therefore, cultured primary fibroblasts from patients were used instead, revealing that the eIF2B-mutated fibroblasts are hypersensitive to ER-stress induced by a pharmacological agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Kantor1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The current study focused on the effect of eIF2B5 mutation on the ER-stress response of an oligodendroglial-derived cell line. The mutation used here (R195H in eIF2B5) is associated with a particularly severe form of the disease, prevalent in the Cree Native American population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Fogli1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The generated oligodendroglial-derived cells expressing eIF2B5(R195H) exhibited heightened ER-stress response demonstrated by hyper-induction of ATF4, GADD34, Bip, PDIA1, PDIA3, PDIA4 and PDIA6 proteins, in response to Thapsigargin, a pharmacological ER-stress agent. The current study provides evidence that oligodendroglial-derived cells are forced to elicit their adaptation capacity in order to survive in the face of a mutation in eIF2B5, since even under normal conditions they express high basal levels of ATF4, GADD34 and ER-associated Bip, PDIA1 and PDIA3.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To study the molecular consequences of eIF2B5 mutation in a cell type that is physiologically relevant to the CNS, we generated a cellular model for CACH/VWM disease using DDR1 cells, a rat cell line of the oligodendroglial lineage. This goal was achieved by a two-step approach. First, the expression of endogenous rat eIF2B5 gene was down-regulated by stable expression of siRNA directed against its 3&#x02032;UTR. DDR1 stably expressing the pSuperRetro/si2B5-3&#x02032;UTR plasmid were termed sh2B5 cells. This cell line was then stably transfected with a plasmid expressing a mutated eIF2B5 cDNA lacking the 3&#x02032;UTR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> shows the lower level of eIF2B5 protein in sh2B5 cells compared to DDR1 controls.

To investigate the effect of eIF2B5 down-regulation on cell viability, a time-course experiment was performed in the presence of Tunicamycin (Tun), which blocks the first step of glycoprotein synthesis, thus inhibiting the synthesis of all N-linked glycoproteins and leading to ER-stress. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> shows the slight decrease in survival rate of sh2B5 cells compared to DDR1 controls upon 3&#x02013;24 hr exposure to Tun.</p><fig id="pone-0003783-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003783.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Effect of eIF2B5 down-regulation.</title><p>A.

Therefore, sh2B5 cells were stably co-transfected with a vector expressing the Zeocin resistance gene (Zeo) and a vector expressing flag-tagged mutated eIF2B5 cDNA. The R195H mutation of eIF2B5 was chosen because it is associated with a severe form of CACH/VWM disease in human patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Fogli1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

The effect of eIF2B5 mutation on ER-stress response was tested by monitoring ATF4 and GADD34 protein levels at different time points after treatment with Thapsigargin (Tg), which inhibits intracellular calcium pumps and thereby depletes ER calcium stores. In agreement with the kinetics of the unfolded protein response (UPR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Novoa1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Kojima1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, an increase in ATF4 and GADD34 protein levels in DDR1 controls and sh2B5 cells was preceded by an increase in eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation.

Also noteworthy is the presence of ATF4 and GADD34 proteins in sh2B5&#x0002b;2B5(R195H) cells even in the absence of a pharmacological ER-stress agent, indicating that mutated eIF2B5 enforces a constant stress state in cells of the oligodendroglial lineage. To further demonstrate the detrimental effect of R195H mutation, the cells were exposed to a low concentration of Tg for 24 h and PARP cleavage was monitored as a marker of apoptosis. Whereas PARP level did not change in DDR1 controls and sh2B5 cells, it was markedly reduced in the mutated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), further demonstrating the increased vulnerability of oligodendroglial-derived cells that express mutated eIF2B5.</p><fig id="pone-0003783-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003783.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>ER-stress response.</title><p>A.

All cells were analyzed in the absence of exogenous pharmacological stress as well as following 12 and 24 hours incubation with 1 &#x000b5;M Tg. Pairs were created such that experimental cells and SILAC labeled DDR1 control cells were matched at 0, 12, and 24 hours of Tg incubation, under identical experimental conditions. Cells were harvested and mixed with the corresponding labeled DDR1 control cells at a 1&#x02236;1 ratio for subsequent ER fractionation. The ER fractions containing labeled and unlabeled proteins were further separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by trypsin digestion of sliced gel bands. The resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for identification and quantification of proteins. Identified peptides were required to have a matched peptide partner of 6 Da greater for arginine-terminating peptides and 8 Da greater for lysine-containing peptides, in addition to other proper combinations for missed cleavage peptides. Only proteins with two or more identified peptides in at least one data set were retained for analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g004">Fig. 4</xref> reflects the proteins status under normal conditions, e.g. shows the basal level of some ER resident proteins in sh2B5 and sh2B5&#x0002b;2B5(R195H) cells compared to DDR1 controls. In sh2B5 cells, the level of Bip (also known as glucose related protein 78, GRP78) and four members of the protein disulfide isomerase family (PDIA1, PDIA3, PDIA4 and PDIA6) was not dramatically changed. However, in sh2B5&#x0002b;2B5(R195H) cells, Bip and PDIA3 were significantly above basal levels as compared to DDR1 control cells (2.0&#x000b1;0.09 and 1.54&#x000b1;0.06 fold up-regulation, respectively). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g005">Fig. 5</xref> reflects the ER-stress response, i.e. shows the change in the levels of the above proteins at 12 and 24 hours of mild ER-stress (1 &#x000b5;M Tg, compared to 3 &#x000b5;M Tg used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In sh2B5 cells, the levels of Bip as well as the four PDI proteins were similar to that of the control cells at each of the three time points, indicating that eIF2B down-regulation did not have a significant effect on the response to long-term mild ER stress. However, although the basal levels of Bip, PDIA1 and PDIA3 were high to begin within sh2B5&#x0002b;2B5(R195H) cells, it further increased compared to DDR1 cells under mild ER stress (2.65&#x000b1;0.06, 2.2&#x000b1;0.03 and 1.7&#x000b1;0.08 fold up-regulation at 24 h; 2.1&#x000b1;0.16 and 2.0&#x000b1;0.01 fold up-regulation at 12 h for Bip and PDIA1, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).

The ER is an essential cellular compartment for protein synthesis and maturation, and a Ca2&#x0002b; storage organelle. Interference with Ca2&#x0002b; homeostasis, inhibition of disulfide bond formation or protein glycosylation, as well as hypoxia and oxidative stress can all result in accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins, leading to ER stress. An impaired ER-stress response is associated with neurodegeneration and other diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Marciniak1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a pro-survival adaptive pathway responsible for restoring perturbed ER homeostasis. The ER chaperone Bip is involved in protein folding and assembly and serves as a key guardian for ER disturbances. It monitors the folding status of proteins, thus controlling the activation state of the three UPR transducers PERK, IRE-1 and ATF6. Active PERK phosphorylates eIF2&#x003b1;, thereby leading to inhibition of global translation. ATF4 mRNA is specifically translated under these inhibitory conditions due to regulatory sequences in its 5&#x02032;-untranslated region. The induced ATF4 protein, together with the products of activated IRE-1 and ATF6, trans-activate the transcription of ER-stress target genes, including a variety of ER chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Harding1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Bip and other ER-resident quality control proteins, such as the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family that catalyzes the formation, cleavage, and rearrangement of disulfide bonds, are induced during ER stress to handle the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Hendershot1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Mintz1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

IFN-&#x003b3; activation of PERK in mature oligodendrocytes was shown to prevent demyelination in a mouse model for multiple sclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Lin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to this rationale, increases in the rates of Bip and PDI mRNA synthesis in rat exocrine pancreatic cells precede extensive mRNA expression of secretory proteins induced by glycocorticoid hormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Hensel1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Neuronal overexpression of PDI has also been shown to promote survival in response to stresses that induce ER dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Perfect timing of translational recovery along the stress response is crucial for stress resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Boyce1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Stress-induced gene expression requires programmed recovery from translational repression, a process induced by GADD34, which recruits protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) for removal of the inhibitory phosphate group on eIF2&#x003b1;, thereby reversing the shutoff of protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Novoa1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The high basal level of GADD34 in the absence of exogenous stress in sh2B5&#x0002b;2B5(R195H) glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, time zero) is consistent with the notion that these cells suffer from an intrinsically low threshold of protein synthesis, which is supported by lower proportions of heavy polysomes, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>. Therefore, the activation of GADD34 as a cellular rescue mechanism may serve to maintain the minimal protein translation rate critical for survival. The induction of GADD34 expression by transient cerebral ischemia in resistant cells, but not in specific vulnerable neurons, is in line with this notion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Paschen1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although the cell line of the oligodendroglial lineage used in this study do not myelinate nerve axons, the increased levels of proteins responsible for ER quality control under normal conditions strongly suggest that sh2B5&#x0002b;2B5(R195H) cells suffer from elevated burden of occasional ER overload with client proteins. Although their adaptation capacity enables survival even in the face of mutation in eIF2B, their hyper ER-stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g003">Figs 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g005">5</xref>) suggests that increased ER burden imposes a bona fide threat. The vulnerability of the eIF2B-mutated glial cells to such threat is evident by their propensity to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003783-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) albeit a heightened stress response. The consequence of such a feature on actively myelinating oligodendrocytes in the brain may be deleterious. Supporting the above concept is the active unfolded protein response (UPR) state demonstrated in mixed glia of CACH/VWM patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-vanderVoorn1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-vanKollenburg1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Oligoengine&#x02122; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003783-Brummelkamp1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> was employed to design oligonucleotides for long-term gene knockdown following cloning into the pSuperRetro vector (Invitrogen).
