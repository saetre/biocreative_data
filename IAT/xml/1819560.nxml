This study profiled and investigated functionally candidate genes mediating this switch between cell survival and death during an acute inflammatory reaction subsequent to the absence of glucocorticoid signaling. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed that following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intracerebral administration at striatum level, more modulated genes presented transcription impairment than exacerbation upon glucocorticoid receptor blockage. Among impaired genes we identified ceruloplasmin (Cp), which plays a key role in iron metabolism and is implicated in a neurodegenative disease. Microglial and endothelial induction of Cp is a natural neuroprotective mechanism during inflammation, because Cp-deficient mice exhibited increased iron accumulation and demyelination when exposed to LPS and neurovascular reactivity to pneumococcal meningitis. This study has identified genes that can play a critical role in programming the innate immune response, helping to clarify the mechanisms leading to protection or damage during inflammatory conditions in the CNS.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The presence of infection is recognized by receptors for specific elements called the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are produced by microorganisms.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, is the best-known target of innate recognition and induces a robust inflammatory response by antigen-presenting cells. The endotoxin activates a transient innate immune reaction via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the rapid interaction of its Toll/IL-1R homology domain with myeloid differentiation factor 88 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000310-Poltorak1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000310-Xu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interaction of LPS with its cognate TLR4 can also activate interferon pathway through other adaptor and signaling molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000310-Akira1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively, these signaling events and transcriptional processes are essential for eliminating pathogens and preparing the transfer to a more specific acquired immune response.</p><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are potent endogenous anti-inflammatory molecules. Activated GC receptors (GRs) are able to interfere with the transactivation potential of the p65 NF-&#x003ba;B subunit as well as AP-1. Other mechanisms explaining the effects of GCs on gene transcription have been proposed, including the competition between GRs and NF-&#x003ba;B for nuclear coactivators, such as CREB-binding protein and p300 (CBP/p300) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000310-DeBosscher1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanisms involved in the effects of GCs on gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) remains largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000310-Glezer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Intracerebral LPS administration causes a strong and time-dependent transcriptional activation of inflammatory genes in microglial cells ipsilateral to the site of injection and this acute reaction is not associated with neuronal damage or demyelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000310-Nadeau1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000310-Glezer2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

These data provide evidence that without a proper inhibitory feedback by GCs, an acute inflammatory response may have serious detrimental consequences for the brain.</p><p>Here we aimed to determine the genes that are differentially regulated by LPS in the presence or absence of the GR signaling. We took advantage of this unique <italic>in vivo</italic> model to identify the key players involved in the delicate balance between cell survival and death during a natural innate immune reaction in the CNS. While the use of neurotoxins is limited to access the contribution of the innate immunity to brain damage due to either direct or indirect microglia activation by their ability to cause neuronal death, the model used in the present study is unique and appropriated in this regard. The comparison between LPS alone and LPS combined to RU486 offers an adequate paradigm because the deregulated innate immune reaction is directly responsible for the cell fate. Functional analysis of the differentially regulated genes between the two conditions led to the selection of ceruloplasmin (Cp) as a candidate protective gene and to the investigation of its role in neuroinflammatory contexts, providing a model to illustrate the beneficial mechanisms engaged by the CNS innate immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Functional analysis of the differential neuroinflammatory gene expression in presence or absence of endogenous GCs</title><p>Our design allowed the detection of 345 probe sets representing 286 different genes (gene IDs) significantly modulated 12 h after intrastriatal LPS injection in the ipsilateral side of the injection (no significant changes were observed in contralateral side). These probes are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000310.s001">dataset S1</xref>. The 12 h time-point was selected to avoid early gene expression noise caused by mechanical damage and late confounding patterns originating from potential damage subsequent to the LPS/RU486 treatment. Approximately 86.3&#x00025; of the genes modulated by LPS were upregulated while &#x0223c;14.7&#x00025; were downregulated. Among the upregulated genes, many were linked to the inflammatory signaling. In addition to these expected data, genes induced by LPS in CNS are linked to various biological processes that range from acute-phase response to cell differentiation and angiogenesis. Downregulated genes by the endotoxin included mainly transcription factors and those encoding proteins related to brain development, metabolism, myelination and transport. This information can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g002">figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000310.s001">dataset S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000310.s003">figure S1</xref>.</p><p>Regarding gene expression comparing LPS effects in presence or absence of RU486, 235 probe sets (representing 200 different gene IDs) were selected according to our strategy (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000310.s002">dataset S2</xref>). It should be noted that these probe sets do not overlap with genes that are modulated by RU486 independently of LPS and/or side effect interactions (GR-blockage main effect; 47 probe sets-see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000310.s003">figure S1</xref> C). As depicted by the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g001">figure 1D</xref> (ipsilateral side), most genes differently expressed when evaluating the effect of RU486 on LPS-treatment (LPS/RU486&#x02013;LPS contrast) were those wherein LPS upregulation was prevented (or partially prevented in at least 50&#x00025;) by GR blockage. This gene subset represents approximately 54.9&#x00025; of the LPS modulated genes (upregulated and downregulated). In general, genes with such behavior were found across many categories of biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Unexpectedly, genes related to host response against pathogens and remarkably, viral and interferon response, were also upregulated by LPS in a manner that is prevented by RU486 (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000310.s003">figure S1</xref> A, B).</p><p>In contrast, only 18 genes presented a GR-mediated repression on LPS-induced gene expression, many of them detected as differently expressed in the contralateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). These genes can be divided into: a) those already upregulated by LPS, such as chemokines, cytokines, JAK-STAT pathway, regulators of transcription and others; b) genes only induced when LPS is combined to RU486, namely a cell-surface antigen of activated dendritic cell (Cd83), a GTPase of the RGK family (Gem) and a transcription factor of the CNC-bZip family (Bach1).</p><p>Similarly to the transcripts that were upregulated following LPS administration, RU486 prevented the dowregulation of 25 out of 42 genes, implying that endogenous GCs are required for both upregulation and downregulation of a considerable number of genes. A comprehensive exploration of microarray data is illustrated by the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000310.s003">figure S1</xref> (A&#x02013;F), while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g002">figure 2</xref> shows the main findings related to biological process according to Gene Ontology (GO) classification.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Validation and anatomical distribution of representative genes modulated by GR and LPS signaling in the CNS</title><p>Several genes were selected for validation by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization according to transcript behavior and functional relevance. These included acute-phase reactants (APRs) (Saa3, Lcn2 and Serpina3n), genes with GR-mediated repression on LPS induction (Gem, Cd83 and Tnfsf9) and other transcripts modulated by GR signaling. In this particular case, RU486 essentially prevented gene upregulation (Cd44, Stat1, Ch25h and Il1b) or downregulation (C1qa and Hexb) by LPS. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows representative examples of Saa3, Lcn2 (N-GAL/24p3), Serpina3n, Gem, Cd83 and Tnfsf9 (4-1BBL) transcripts in the dorsal basal ganglia of mice that received saline injection, LPS or LPS/RU486; wherein the different pattern of expression is quite evident among transcripts. Interestingly, Gem expression localized over cells lining the meninges, while Cd83 and Tnfsf9 transcripts were distributed across parenchymal elements of the brain. Moreover, Cd83 shows convincing constitutive neuronal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g003">Figure 3B</xref> illustrates the dose-dependent effect of RU486 on brain reaction to LPS.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g004">Figure 4</xref> depicts results for the validation of Cd44, Stat1, Ch25h, Il1b, C1qa and Hexb. The anatomical distribution of Cd44 (probed for the five first exons) and Ch25h was quite identical, but very different from Stat1 (neuronal-like) and Il1b. Unlike Cd44 and Ch25h, Stat1 did not seem to response to RU486 in a dose-dependent manner and Il1b gene expression was not significantly different among groups (ANOVA). For the latter transcript, a significant linear trend between induced mRNA levels and increasing doses of RU486 was reached (p&#x0003c;0.05; trend analysis). Noteworthy, the cRNA probe used was designed to hybridize the same target region present in affymetrix gene chips.</p><p>The expression pattern of C1qa and Hexb is highly suggestive of ubiquitous constitutive expression, which was selectively repressed by the endotoxin in the ipsilateral side of injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Because LPS-gene profiling indicated repression of the complement classical pathway &#x0005b;C1qa, C1qb and C1qc downregulation and Serping1 (C1-Inhibitor) upregulation&#x0005d;, we further characterized the temporal dynamic of this process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000310.s004">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>According to our double labeling procedure, Cd44, Tnfsf9 and Cd83 are expressed mainly by microglial cells, Lcn2 by endothelial cells and Saa3 transcript by microglia and few astrocytes.

As depicted by the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g001">figure 1D</xref>, many genes had the desired behavior and we looked for those that had been previously linked to neurodegenerative disorders. We found ceruloplasmin (Cp) that was strongly induced by LPS (neuroprotection) and completely inhibited by the GR blockade (a neurotoxic condition). <italic>Cp</italic> gene encodes a protein with ferroxidase activity and loss of function mutations in this gene leads to accumulation of iron and human neurodegenerative disease (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">discussion</xref>). We then postulated that induction of Cp might be a potent neuroprotective mechanism during acute inflammation.</p><p>The regulation of that transcript was quantified by different complementary approaches. Quantification of <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization data indicated that RU486 significantly prevented LPS-induced Cp gene expression, but only at the higher dose tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). Nevertheless, this effect of RU486 was confirmed with a lower dose by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g006">figure 6D</xref> shows that the four different probe sets used in the gene chip generated the same data, which all together provide very solid evidence that GR blockage is able to prevent LPS-induced Cp gene expression. We then determined the type of cells that synthesize this protein during an acute immune challenge and found co-localization of Cp mRNA with IBA1-, GFAP- and CD31-immunoreactive (ir) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). Confocal laser microscopy was also used to accurately distinguish the different types of cells with positive Cp-ir signal. As depicted by the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g005">figure 5F</xref>, Cp protein strongly co-localized with endothelial cells and IBA1-postive microglia and co-localization with GFAP-astrocytes was rare. MAC-2 is frequently used as a marker of a subtype of activated microglia, but it failed to express Cp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>). It is worth mentioning that the shape of MAC-2-positive cells was quite different from that of IBA1-positive microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000310.s006">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting the possibility that Cp is produced by the resident ramified microglia (IBA1) and not amoeboid-like or infiltrating myeloid cells (MAC-2).</p><p>A robust extracellular CP-ir signal was detected in the CNS of LPS-injected mice at time-point 2 days post injection. Such a staining largely declined 3 days later suggesting a rapid and transient secretion of this protein during inflammation. As expected, <italic>Cp</italic>-/-mice failed to exhibit any CP-ir signal following similar treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000310.s007">Figure S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Neuroprotective role of Cp during an acute inflammatory reaction</title><p>Due to the involvement of Cp in iron metabolism, we measured iron accumulation in the mouse brain following a single intracerebral LPS bolus. As depicted by the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g006">figure 6A, B and C</xref>, LPS was able to increase iron III deposition in the ipsilateral side of injection in both <italic>Cp</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; and <italic>Cp</italic>-/-mice. Interestingly, the cells containing iron III had a different morphology over time, being frequently round at 2 days post-injection and changing to a ramified shape at 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). <italic>Cp</italic>-deficient mice had a dramatic increase in iron III deposits following LPS administration, especially at time-point 2 days.

Thereafter, we evaluated whether Cp may play a role in protecting the CNS white matter from an acute inflammatory challenge.

These data were corroborated by the myelin SBB staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g006">Fig. 6I, J</xref>), which all together provide evidence that the endotoxin can indeed provoke demyelination, but only in mice that bear a mutation in the <italic>Cp</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Role of Cp in Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced meningitis</title><p>Since blood vessels are strategically positioned to produce Cp protein during systemic infection, we evaluated whether this APR modulates gene expression in vascular-associated elements during meningitis. <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection was used to test a possible role of Cp in this context.

In contrast, Selp transcript was mainly induced in large blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g007">Fig. 7</xref> D, E, F) and its expression level was higher in the brain of <italic>Cp</italic>-/-mice. The time point 48 h was used for this comparison, because the variability among mice was high from day 3 and the number of animals that exhibited clinical signs was irregular between the genotypes and this variability complicated the interpretation of the results. Forty-eight h after inoculation, the number of animals with clinical signs was equivalent in both <italic>Cp</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) and <italic>Cp</italic>-/-(n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7) group, but not in the group of <italic>Cp</italic>&#x0002b;/-mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3). Since the highest variance was associated with <italic>Cp</italic>&#x0002b;/-genotype, we removed this group from the statistical analysis to avoid misrepresentation and substantial reduction of power. In this regard, Selp mRNA levels were significantly different between <italic>Cp</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; and <italic>Cp</italic>-/-according to student's t-test (p&#x0003c;0.05), but not when ANOVA is used to compare the three genotypes.

Surprisingly we found that blocking endogenous GR signaling exacerbated the expression of a small and restricted set of inflammatory genes induced by LPS in the CNS. Curiously, most of these upregulated genes were found in the contralateral side, probably reflecting saturation in the ipsilateral side and spreading to distal sites. Genes with this behavior belong to the chemokine network and then to an increased recruitment of inflammatory cells. Interestingly, the effects of RU486 and LPS was found for genes linked to adaptive immunity Cd83 and Tnfsf9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000310-Kwon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000310-Zinser1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

These data do suggest that genetic profile is no longer respected in the absence of GR signaling on the cerebral immune system.

Many recent studies pointed that GC exposure may increase CNS inflammation and Sorrells and Sapolsky suggested a conciliatory manner to interpret both anti- and pro-inflammatory effects of GCs based on early, delayed, acute or chronic regimen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000310-Sorrells1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. We suggest careful attention in order to dissociate gene expression from inflammation. Several genes that depend on GR to be induced by LPS play important roles in terms of cell differentiation, acute phase response, extracellular matrix organization and interferon response, all of which potentially helping to resolve inflammation rapidly. The lack of this gene subset in association with the exacerbated expression of genes identified here as GR repressed (chemokines, Tnfsf9, Cd83, etc.) can clearly result in increased inflammation at latter time-points and in the emergence of a detrimental microglial/macrophage phenotype.</p><p>It is interesting to note that many regulated genes that exhibited a particular profile (i.e., RU486 prevented their downregulation to LPS) are related to brain development and not necessarily to myeloid functions. These data suggest alternative mechanisms underlining the actions of GC and TLR4 signaling on gene repression in the CNS. Our factorial design also allowed us to report a list of genes that follows a GR-blockage main effect, revealing genes that respond to RU486 and are not changed by the inflammatory reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Anatomical findings regarding GR-modulated inflammatory gene expression</title><p>As depicted by the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g003">figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000310-g004">4</xref>, a very distinct anatomical distribution was found for most regulated genes by the treatment combining RU486 to LPS.

The data that LPS caused CNS injury in <italic>Cp</italic>-/-mice and not their control littermates are quite interesting, because they underline the critical neuroprotective role of Cp in an inflammatory context. We propose that Cp produced by microglial cells is released to the extracellular space for controlling iron homeostasis in this critical period, when white matter elements are more vulnerable. Hence, these findings support an important new role for Cp in mediating neuroprotection in the course of an acute innate immune process. Such neuroprotective properties of Cp are not associated with changes in microglial reactivity to LPS.</p><p>We also observed that Cp is highly expressed in cells lining the blood vessels. In consequence, it was attractive to test the hypothesis that Cp could be a mediator of barrier function, protecting the brain against circulating pathogens or potentially damaging molecules derived from their infection. <italic>S.

All the analyses were carried out with SPSS software version 11.0, except for Logrank test and Logrank test of trend to compare survival curves, which were performed using Prism 4 software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000310.s001"><label>Dataset S1</label><caption><p>Excel Spreadsheet; LPS modulated genes</p><p>(0.06 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000310.s001.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000310.s002"><label>Dataset S2</label><caption><p>Excel Spreadsheet; LPS Vs LPS/RU486 differential gene expression</p><p>(0.06 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000310.s002.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000310.s003"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Gene expression exploration data</p><p>(2.86 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000310.s003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000310.s004"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>C1qa and Serping1 expression profile</p><p>(0.19 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000310.s004.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000310.s005"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>Cellular site of transcript synthesis</p><p>(0.42 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000310.s005.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000310.s006"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>Cp expression and IBA1-Vs MAC2-positive cells</p><p>(0.44 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000310.s006.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000310.s007"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><p>Time-dependent extracellular Cp expression</p><p>(0.31 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000310.s007.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000310.s008"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Supplementary Materials and Methods</p><p>(0.18 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000310.s008.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr. Ezequiel Luis Calvo, the specialized technicians, Annick Ouellet for critical help and support to perform gene chip hybridization, Dr. Jean Morissette for allowing computational analysis support and Dr. M.
