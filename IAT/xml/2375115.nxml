We assessed if gene expression profiles could distinguish between <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> pathogenic truncating and missense mutation carriers and familial breast cancer cases whose disease was not attributable to <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations (<italic>BRCAX</italic> cases). 72 cell lines from affected women in high-risk breast ovarian families were assayed after exposure to ionising irradiation, including 23 <italic>BRCA1</italic> carriers, 22 <italic>BRCA2</italic> carriers, and 27 <italic>BRCAX</italic> individuals. A subset of 10 <italic>BRCAX</italic> individuals carried rare <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> sequence variants considered to be of low clinical significance (LCS). <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation carriers had similar expression profiles, with some subclustering of missense mutation carriers. The majority of <italic>BRCAX</italic> individuals formed a distinct cluster, but <italic>BRCAX</italic> individuals with LCS variants had expression profiles similar to <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation carriers. Gaussian Process Classifier predicted <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic> and <italic>BRCAX</italic> status, with a maximum of 62&#x00025; accuracy, and prediction accuracy decreased with inclusion of <italic>BRCAX</italic> samples carrying an LCS variant, and inclusion of pathogenic missense carriers. Similarly, prediction of mutation status with gene lists derived using Support Vector Machines was good for <italic>BRCAX</italic> samples without an LCS variant (82&#x02013;94&#x00025;), poor for <italic>BRCAX</italic> with an LCS (40&#x02013;50&#x00025;), and improved for pathogenic <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation carriers when the gene list used for prediction was appropriate to mutation effect being tested (71&#x02013;100&#x00025;). This study indicates that mutation effect, and presence of rare variants possibly associated with a low risk of cancer, must be considered in the development of array-based assays of variant pathogenicity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Inherited mutations in the genes <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> increase risk of breast cancer and contribute to a proportion of breast cancer families. However, more than half of the reported sequence alterations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> are currently of unknown clinical significance. We analysed gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from blood of patients with sequence alterations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> and compared these to lymphoblastoid cells from familial breast cancer patients without such alterations. We then classified these lymphoblastoid cells based on their gene profiles. We found that <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> samples were more similar to each other than to familial breast cancer patients without <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations, and that the type of sequence change in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> (missense or truncating) influenced gene expression. We included in the study ten familial breast cancer samples, which carried sequence changes in <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic>, that are believed to be of little clinical significance. Interestingly these samples were distinct from other familial breast cancer cases without any sequence alteration in <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic>, indicating that further work needs to be performed to determine the possible association of these &#x0201c;low clinical significance&#x0201d; sequence changes with a low to moderate risk of cancer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately 7&#x00025; of breast cancer cases occur in women with a strong family history of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Claus1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> account for a considerable proportion of these familial breast cancer cases, with the average cumulative risk in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation carriers by age 70 years estimated at 65&#x00025; and 45&#x00025;, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Antoniou1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/">http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/</ext-link>) currently has more than 1400 and 1800 unique sequence variants listed in the <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> genes, respectively. These include frameshift, nonsense, missense, splice site alterations and polymorphisms. Greater than a third of the <italic>BRCA1</italic> and greater than half of the <italic>BRCA2</italic> unique variants are &#x0201c;unclassified variants&#x0201d; without compelling evidence of pathogenicity or functional significance. The majority of unclassified variants recorded in the BIC database are predicted missense changes (more than 400 <italic>BRCA1</italic> and 800 <italic>BRCA2</italic>). However other variants which may be categorised as unclassified variants are in-frame deletions or duplications, variants that may disrupt splicing, or variants in the 3&#x02032;UTR that may affect RNA stability (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kconfab.org">www.kconfab.org</ext-link>). <italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> unclassified variants represent a problem in the clinical setting as it is not known which variants are associated with the high risk of disease reported for classical truncating mutations.</p><p>Several functional assays may be used to determine the significance of unclassified variants, including transcription activation and complementation assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Ishioka1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, but a disadvantage of biochemical assays is that they rely on the functions of specific domains of the protein, require specialized laboratory skills, and are time&#x02013;consuming to perform. Other methods for classifying variants include the analysis of clinical and histopathological data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-GomezGarcia1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, loss of heterozygosity analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Osorio1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and bioinformatic analysis to predict the effect of the amino acid change on structure and multiple sequence alignment strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Mirkovic1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Abkevich1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Tavtigian1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Integrated evaluation of unclassified variants which combines several approaches, such as the analysis of co-segregation of the mutation with disease, co-occurrence of the variant with a deleterious mutation, sequence conservation of the amino acid change, severity of amino acid change, tumor loss of heterozygosity, and tumor histopathology classification, provides a quantitative tool for the classification of variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Goldgar1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Spurdle1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. This multifactorial method was developed to classify such rare unclassified variants into two categories, variants with features of classical high-risk mutations (termed pathogenic), and variants that do not have the features of a high-risk mutation (termed neutral or low clinical significance (LCS)). While the availability of appropriate biospecimens (e.g. number of families and tumors) for inclusion in likelihood prediction is a major factor determining the classification of any single variant, another major caveat of the multifactorial approach is that it is not appropriate for the evaluation of possible moderate or low risk variants, since it uses high-risk mutations as reference for the underlying assumptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Goldgar1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-ChenevixTrench1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Osorio2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the current multifactorial method cannot exclude the possibility that rare variants classified to be of low clinical significance may be associated with a moderate or low risk of cancer.</p><p>Gene expression profiling has increased our understanding of the molecular events in breast tumor development, has been used to predict prognosis, and has characterised breast tumors into subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-vantVeer1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Sorlie1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The value of expression profiling for identifying underlying high-risk gene mutation status is indicated by a number of studies. A distinct gene expression profile has been reported for breast tumors of <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-vantVeer1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Hedenfalk1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Sorlie2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, expected to be homozygous for loss of BRCA1 function at the somatic level. In addition, the existence of distinct gene expression profiles for heterozygous loss of BRCA1 and BRCA2 function is supported by accurate separation of short-term cultures of fibroblasts carrying a germline mutation in the <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> genes, compared to healthy women undergoing reduction mammoplastic surgery with no family or personal history of any cancer or sporadic breast-cancer-affected controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-KoteJarai1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-KoteJarai2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) have also been shown to have distinct mRNA expression phenotypes for heterozygous carriers of <italic>ATM</italic> mutations, some of which are known to be associated with an increased risk in breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Watts1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Waddell1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings suggest that germline gene expression signatures, including those from fibroblasts or LCLs, may be used to define <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation status and to assist in assessing the clinical significance of <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> unclassified variants.</p><p>In this study we compared LCL gene expression signatures of breast cancer cases carrying pathogenic mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2,</italic> to familial breast cancer cases with no known <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations (<italic>BRCAX</italic>). We also considered the possibility that <italic>BRCAX</italic> individuals with a <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> sequence variant classified to be neutral/low clinical significance (LCS) using multifactorial likelihood analysis may differ in gene expression profile from <italic>BRCAX</italic> individuals without such sequence variants. In addition, since truncating alterations comprise the majority of known pathogenic mutations but most <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> unclassified variants are predicted missense alterations, we compared profiles from individuals with known missense or truncating mutations to determine if mutation effect will affect the mutation-associated expression profile for each gene. We derived gene lists to predict mutation status defined by gene and mutation effect, and then tested the efficacy of these gene lists to predict the gene mutation status of LCLs. We provide evidence that gene lists differ according to gene and mutation effect, and according to the presence of sequence variants of low clinical significance. We also demonstrate that the use of appropriately-derived gene lists improves the prediction of pathogenicity of known mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Differences in LCL Post-Irradiation Gene Expression between <italic>BRCAX</italic> Individuals with or without a Sequence Variant of Low Clinical Significance</title><p>The ultimate aim of this experiment was to establish if gene expression profiles could distinguish between <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> pathogenic mutation carriers and familial breast cancer cases whose disease was not attributable to <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations (<italic>BRCAX</italic> cases). <italic>BRCAX</italic> breast cancer families are likely to result from mutations in several other genes, and thus represent a heterogeneous group.

A relatively early time-point of 30 minutes post-irradiation was chosen to capture gene expression initiation, and minimize possible downstream compensation effects.

We found that the <italic>BRCAX</italic> samples with such LCS variants were separated from the majority of <italic>BRCAX</italic> samples without such LCS variants using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. This result indicates that LCS samples differ in expression profile as a result of their <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> sequence variant, and was substantiated by the class prediction methods: GPC prediction of the <italic>BRCAX</italic> samples decreased in accuracy when <italic>BRCAX</italic> samples with an LCS were included. In addition, SVM to detect <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation-related gene lists yielded differences in the significant genes for comparisons to <italic>BRCAX</italic> samples without an LCS variant, compared to <italic>BRCAX</italic> samples with an LCS variant. Accordingly, prediction of <italic>BRCAX</italic> subgroup status based on the more robust gene list derived from comparisons to <italic>BRCAX</italic> individuals without an LCS variant was generally poorer for <italic>BRCAX</italic> samples with an LCS (40&#x02013;50&#x00025;) compared to those without an LCS (82&#x00025;&#x02013;94&#x00025;). These rather provocative results indicate that the possible effect of all rare variants should be considered in development of assays to assess which variants have features of high-risk mutations. Moreover, the similarity in expression profile of these variants to other <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> pathogenic mutations suggests that at least some of these LCS variants may confer small-moderate risks of breast cancer, presumably acting in concert with alterations in other genes in the <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> pathway to lead to breast cancer. Given the rarity of these variants, alternative statistical approaches will be required to assess the risk of cancer associated with them.</p><p>The assay conditions used in this study could not distinguish between samples with pathogenic <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations and those with pathogenic <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations.

We compared <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> cases to familial <italic>BRCAX</italic> cases as an appropriate reference group for familial breast cases likely to be identified as carriers of <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations or unclassified variants, we used LCLs instead of fibroblasts, we selected a lower IR exposure (10Gy vs 15Gy), and we chose a relatively early time point of 30 mins after exposure to IR in order to gain a better understanding of the functional differences in response to IR between the <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic> and <italic>BRCAX</italic> cell lines. Some or all of these factors may explain the difference in the ability of this study to distinguish <italic>BRCA1</italic> from <italic>BRCA2</italic>, both of which are involved in DNA damage repair. However, differences in post-irradiation response between <italic>BRCAX</italic> individuals and <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation carriers are supported by alternative analysis we have conducted of the subset of genes reported to be involved in post-irradiation response, comparing mutation-negative normal female controls to <italic>BRCAX</italic> individuals without an LCS variant, or to <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> truncating mutation carriers.

In the clinical setting, individuals generally present with full sequencing of both genes, and presence of a variant in one gene or the other. We thus assessed the ability to distinguish <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic>, separately, from <italic>BRCAX</italic> individuals. Importantly, since most unclassified variants are predicted to cause amino acid substitutions, we also assessed the relevance of mutation effect for expression profiles. We found that the genes which significantly differed between <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> and <italic>BRCAX</italic> LCLs were dependent on mutation effect. Accordingly, the SVM prediction for each mutation effect was best if the appropriate gene list was used, in terms of both accuracy of prediction (<italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> vs <italic>BRCAX</italic>) and confidence in the classification as determined by the distance of the prediction from the SVM plane. Thus we strongly urge that mutation effect is taken into account if this type of assay is to be developed for use in predicting the clinical significance of <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> variants. The current challenge is that few missense variants have been classified with respect to their clinical significance, with the only 23 individual missense variants termed clinically important by BIC, 17 in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and six in <italic>BRCA2</italic>. Moreover, these are restricted in terms of the domains/regions in which they occur, residing in the BRCA1 start site (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2), ring finger (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4) or transactivation domains (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;11), and the BRCA2 CDK2 phosphorylation site (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) or at one codon (2336, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) in a region of unknown function. It will thus be difficult to accrue a panel of known pathogenic missense variants for use in such predictive assays, and will require a concerted collaborative effort. Assuming sufficient pathogenic variants are identified, the successful execution of such a study may eventually distinguish missense-associated gene expression patterns that are generic to missense mutations, and/or those that are specific to the domain location of missense mutations. In addition, a possibly greater challenge will be identifying assay conditions (cell type, perturbation, time-point etc) that can also identify gene expression differences between patients with rare variants of low clinical significance in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and/or <italic>BRCA2</italic> and those with truly high-risk pathogenic mutations (truncating or missense) in these genes. Our study, using conditions that were not optimal for separating <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations nevertheless identified gene expression differences between <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> pathogenic mutations and LCS variants, suggesting that larger sample sizes and further experimentation may identify a more robust gene list to separate pathogenic mutations, variants of low clinical significance, and individuals with no sequence alterations in <italic>BRCA1/2</italic>.</p><p>Pathway analysis confirming altered expression of cancer, cell proliferation and cell cycle pathways in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation carrier groups is consistent with the known functions of <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Boulton1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Joukov1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The pathway differences by mutation type such as cell death and development may reflect that the majority of truncating mutations result in activation of the nonsense mediated decay pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-PerrinVidoz1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and complete loss of protein, whereas most missense mutations are likely to result in more subtle effects through ablation of individual functional domains. Some pathways identified were unexpected and are only present in a single mutation type, and it is thus likely that at least some of these pathways were generated by chance alone.</p><p>In conclusion, we have provided evidence that carriers of <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> variants considered to be of low clinical significance have array profiles distinct from other non-<italic>BRCA1/2</italic> familial cases, but resembling profiles of pathogenic <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> cases, indicating that further work will be required to evaluate their possible association with a low-moderate risk of cancer. We have also shown that it will be important to consider mutation effect when developing array-based assays for predicting the clinical significance of <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> unclassified variants. Lastly, our findings demonstrate the ability of array profiling of immortalized lines derived from lymphoblastoid cells to detect germline mutations in genes that result in breast and ovarian cancer, and thus have relevance to the investigation of other genetic diseases irrespective of the organs or tissues they affect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Subjects and Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines</title><p>LCLs were derived from breast cancer-affected women recruited into the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation for Research into Breast Cancer (kConFab), a consortium which ascertains multiple-case breast cancer families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000080-Mann1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

The cell number was normalised and fresh medium was added to cells 24hr prior to irradiation with 10Gy, using a calibrated Cs137 c-source delivering 1 Gy/1.5 min. Total RNA was harvested 30min later using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Doncaster, VIC). The Illumina Totalprep RNA amplification kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used to amplify and biotinylate 450ng of total RNA. Biotinylated RNA was hybridised overnight at 55&#x000b0;C to Illumina Human-6 version 1 BeadChips containing &#x0003e;46,000 probes (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). The microarrays were washed, stained with streptavidin-Cy3, and then scanned with an Illumina BeadArray Scanner. Duplicate arrays were performed for eight cell lines across the different groups for quality control purposes, with duplicates performed on different days. All duplicate arrays showed highest correlation with each other (correlation &#x0003e;0.98). Duplicate samples were not included in analysis.
