We have investigated the metabolic consequences of altered growth hormone signalling in mutant mice that have truncations at position 569 and 391 of the intracellular domain of the growth hormone receptor, and thus exhibit either low (around 30&#x00025; maximum) or no growth hormone-dependent STAT5 signalling respectively. These mutations result in altered liver metabolism, obesity and insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The analysis of metabolic changes was performed using microarray analysis of liver tissue and NMR metabonomics of urine and liver tissue. Data were analyzed using multivariate statistics and Gene Ontology tools. The metabolic profiles characteristic for each of the two mutant groups and wild-type mice were identified with NMR metabonomics. We found decreased urinary levels of taurine, citrate and 2-oxoglutarate, and increased levels of trimethylamine, creatine and creatinine when compared to wild-type mice. These results indicate significant changes in lipid and choline metabolism, and were coupled with increased fat deposition, leading to obesity. The microarray analysis identified changes in expression of metabolic enzymes correlating with alterations in metabolite concentration both in urine and liver. Similarity of mutant 569 to the wild-type was seen in young mice, but the pattern of metabolites shifted to that of the 391 mutant as the 569 mice became obese after six months age.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The metabonomic observations were consistent with the parallel analysis of gene expression and pathway mapping using microarray data, identifying metabolites and gene transcripts involved in hepatic metabolism, especially for taurine, choline and creatinine metabolism. The systems biology approach applied in this study provides a coherent picture of metabolic changes resulting from impaired STAT5 signalling by the growth hormone receptor, and supports a potentially important role for taurine in enhancing &#x003b2;-oxidation.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Growth hormone (GH) is both the major regulator of postnatal growth and an important metabolic regulator, influencing many aspects of lipid, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Harvey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. GH exerts its anabolic actions by increasing lean body mass and decreasing adiposity.

Treatment with GH also affects hepatic glucose metabolism, mostly through the stimulation of gluconeogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Moller1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A large number of other physiological processes are affected by GH, including drug and xenobiotic metabolism through the regulation of P450 cytochrome expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Schuetz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>GH acts through its receptor on the cell surface, which is a cytokine class I receptor with multiple tyrosines on the intracellular domain. Binding of the hormone to the receptor induces receptor tyrosine phosphorylation with intracellular signaling through a number of pathways, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Herrington1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Lichanska1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, leading to differential gene expression and changes in physiological response. While the role of GH in metabolism has been studied in a number of animal models and in humans undergoing GH therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Bouillanne1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-TolletEgnell2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, the contribution of individual pathways to metabolism remains unclear. Treatment of GH-deficient adults or the elderly has been shown to normalize the altered body composition seen in GH deficiency, including increased fat mass, decreased muscle mass and decreased bone mineral density. Transcript changes associated with these metabolic alterations have been studied in animal models, but the full extent and physiological consequences of the altered transcript profiles are not clear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-TolletEgnell1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Olsson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-FloresMorales1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, we have described growth hormone receptor (GHR) mutant mice, with truncations of the intracellular domain of the GHR at position 569 and 391 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Rowland1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. These truncations lead to altered signaling through the GHR in response to hormone binding and allow us to study the contribution of particular GH receptor signaling domains to gene expression and metabolism. In particular, these mouse strains exhibit variable levels of STAT5 signalling in response to GH stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and show substantial alterations in hepatic gene expression, together with growth deficit and later onset obesity.</p><fig id="pone-0002764-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002764.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structure of the intracellular domain of the Growth Hormone Receptor (GHR).</title><p>The mutations in the GHR have been made in the intracellular domain (ICD) of the receptor.

We identified sets of genes regulated by particular signaling pathways with a major focus on STAT5 targets. However, there was little analysis of how this differential gene expression affects metabolism in the GHR mutant mice. As GH regulates metabolism in many ways, we were interested in identification of the actual metabolic changes that relate to the development of obesity and insulin resistance in our mice. However, changes in gene expression do not directly measure metabolic changes, and mapping of the differentially expressed genes onto metabolic pathways only provides an indication of pathways that can be affected, without defining the actual metabolic consequences. Therefore there was a need to use an alternative method to assess the global metabolic changes and their time course to determine the likely causes of observed phenotypic changes in our mouse model.</p><p>Any significant perturbation of metabolism, such as the one caused by the GHR mutations, is reflected in the composition of body fluids such as urine, blood or saliva, which yield a different &#x0201c;metabolic fingerprint&#x0201d; for each metabolic state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Nicholson1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, valuable information about metabolic changes can be obtained by monitoring global changes in the composition of biofluids of various populations or individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Nicholson1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The experimental approach enabling this is metabonomics and has been defined as &#x0201c;the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Nicholson2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. As it is able to analyze global metabolic changes in biofluids it is an appropriate tool for comparing GHR mutant mouse models and allows us to integrate metabolite data with our previous microarray study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Rowland1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the major techniques used in metabonomic studies. The advantage of using NMR over other techniques such as mass spectroscopy is that it requires only minimal sample preparation, is non-destructive and inherently quantitative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Nicholson1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. NMR spectra possess a wealth of metabolic information, containing signals from thousands of individual metabolites that are observed simultaneously and that can partially overlap. Because of the information density of NMR spectra, data are routinely analysed by a combination of data reduction and pattern recognition methods using multivariate statistical analysis, such as principal components analysis (PCA) or partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Holmes1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. This strategy results in identification of groups with similar metabolic patterns. In addition, individual metabolites discriminating between these experimental groups can be identified.</p><p>The aim of this study was therefore to identify metabolic changes in our GHR mutant mice by analysis of urinary and hepatic metabolites and to correlate these changes with transcriptome-based pathway analysis to establish metabolic pathways affected by the extents of differential STAT5 signalling. This is to our knowledge the first study linking the analysis of transcriptional changes based on microarrays with metabonomic analysis of actual metabolite changes in strains of receptor mutant mice. Our approach has allowed us to identify key metabolites and altered pathways, which provide a coherent and complementary picture of physiological changes at the level of the whole organism in relation to the metabolic role of GH.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Growth hormone receptor (GHR) modifications <italic>in vivo</italic>:</title><p>In this study we used animals previously generated in our laboratory with characterized mutations in the intracellular domain of the GHR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Rowland1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Our previous study showed that their hepatic response to GH administration is impaired in relation to the extent of STAT5 signalling, with mutant 569 showing 30&#x00025; of the wild-type response, while mutant 391 has no STAT5 signalling response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Rowland1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. At the same time both mutants have shown normal activation of JAK2, MAPK and STAT3 signalling, and microarray comparison with mice harboring complete GH receptor deletion showed most GH-regulated transcripts do not involve STAT5 signalling. Thus, in this study we determined the metabolic consequences of the loss in GHR signalling from the distal portion of the GH receptor, including total loss of STAT5 signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Adipose accumulation:</title><p>The most striking physiological and phenotypic change in the mutant animals is a dramatic increase in weight, resulting from obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g002">Figure 2B&#x02013;E</xref>). The weight of all mutants and wild-type littermates up to 21 days of age was not significantly different <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Rowland1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The body weight differentiated in the following 2 months, and was in both sexes significantly lower for each of the 569, 391 and GHR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutants than for their wild-type littermate controls at 2 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Rowland1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). However, over the next 4 months the weight of the mutant 569 mice increased, so that at 6 months the difference with the wild-type was no longer statistically significant, and later mutant 569 mice became significantly heavier. While the weight of the 391 mutant mice was essentially lower than that of the wild-type at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), they were also significantly shorter than wild-type mice as evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, and thus became severely obese at a lower body weight. The observed increase in weight reflected an increased fat deposition for all mutant mouse strains. Indeed, when the fat accumulation was analyzed over time at 2, 4, 10 and 13 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g002">Figure 2D and E</xref>), there was a significant difference between the mutants and the wild-type. This difference is especially pronounced in the subcutaneous fat deposits, which is expected, as subcutaneous fat pads have been shown to be the deposit most sensitive to GH regulation in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Berryman1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. While the wild-type mice showed only a small increase in subcutaneous fat up to 13 months of age, the 391 mutants began to accumulate subcutaneous fat from early in their life reaching a maximum at 10 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The 569 mutant showed a slower, more constant increase of subcutaneous fat and by 13 months of age almost reached that of the 391 mutant. The picture changes only slightly when the perirenal fat deposits are viewed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). While the wild-type exhibited only a slow increase in the percentage of dissectable body fat, all mutants accumulated fat very rapidly after 2 months of age, with the 569 mutant displaying a rate of perirenal fat accumulation that was similar to the GHR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mutant and slightly faster than the 391 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002764-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002764.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Identification of marker genes differentiating between the groups and physiological characterisation of GHR mutant mice.</title><p>(A) A heatmap of classifier gene expression in liver tissue of wild-type and GHR mutant mice at 42 days age from the GeneRaVE analysis, clustered according to similarity of expression.

These were subsequently analysed by ANOVA to identify predictor genes able to separate the four classes of microarray data (wild-type, mutant 569, 391 and GHR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Rowland1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This generated a list of 20 genes regulated concordantly in all mutant mice and additional 31 genes differentially expressed between the individual mutant groups. However, as this analysis was a supervised approach, we wanted to use an unsupervised multivariate statistical method similar to the tools used in metabonomic analysis. In a second round of analysis we therefore used GeneRaVE as a method to identify the classifier genes differentiating the groups and explore gene interactions using network analysis.</p><p>GeneRaVE identified three genes as differentiating the groups, <italic>RCK/p54</italic>, <italic>Hsd3b5 and Es31</italic>, whose expression levels can separate the four classes with 84&#x00025; accuracy.

and functional annotation were pointing consistently to differences in metabolic responses between the mouse groups, they did not indicate which individual pathways were affected. Therefore we used pathway mapping to identify these. In addition to functional classification, DAVID mapped the genes successfully to pathways (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002764-t003">Table 3</xref>). In addition, we also performed pathway mapping using Pathway Miner (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biorag.org">http://www.biorag.org</ext-link>). This analysis indicated major changes in multiple pathways, including xenobiotic metabolism, complement cascades, glutathione, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid metabolism and others (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002764-t003">Table 3</xref>). It is clear that some pathways were identified with both tools, while others were only identified with one. One of the reasons for such discrepancies is that both tools have not managed to map many of the differentially expressed genes. DAVID has mapped only 33&#x00025; of input genes to the pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) data base, while Pathway Miner mapped 17&#x00025; of input genes to the KEGG pathways. This highlights the insufficiencies in analysis using pathway mapping and GO analysis and a need for an alternative method of analysis of metabolism.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0002764-t003"

The technique is particularly suited to the analysis of a set of data where each individual measurement contains itself a multitude of data &#x02013; as is the case in a series of NMR spectra, containing signals from hundreds of individual metabolites. PCA compares all measurements with each other and explains the variation inherent in the data set in terms of artificial components called principal components (PCs). The first principal component (PC1) is reponsible for the largest amount of variation in the data, the second principal component is orthogonal to PC1 and explains the largest amount of yet unexplained variation, and so forth with higher PCs. In effect, the first two PCs explain the vast majority of variation present in the data. In the resulting scores plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), each data point corresponds to one NMR spectrum, and the position in the plot is determined by the difference of that spectrum with respect to the average of the respective PC. Essentially, the closer points are to each other the more similar the corresponding spectra are. This feature allows one to recognise easily if the data form several distinct groups or are all similar to each other. In the corresponding loadings plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) each data point corresponds to one spectral region (&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;bucket), and the position in the plot is equivalent to the correlation coefficient of that bucket with the corresponding PC. This means that it is possible to identify from the loadings plot which spectral regions and thus which chemical compounds are responsible for any grouping of data points observed in the scores plot. Loadings coefficients (&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;correlation coefficients) of 0 mean no correlation, and loadings coefficits of 1 mean total correlation is observed between a particular bucket (&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;chemical compound) and the variation in the corrresponding dimension. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, the loadings coefficients for most spectral regions cluster around zero, indicating that concentration changes in the metabolites corresponding to these regions are insignificant. However, a number of spectral regions are clear outliers in the loadings plot, indicating that concentration changes in the corresponding metabolites are significantly associated with the variation/separation observed in the scores plot in the corresponding PC. Due to their nature as correlation coefficients the loadings coefficients are not directly associated with fold changes. They rather indicate, which concentration changes are significant, irrespective of the actual magnitude of change.</p><fig id="pone-0002764-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002764.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Statistical analysis of metabolites in mouse urine.</title><p>(A) <italic>Principal components analysis - scores plot of PC1 versus PC2.</italic> Each data point represents one mouse urine sample, and the distance between points in the score plot is an indication of the similarity between samples.

A preliminary PCA showed that the urine samples were contaminated by ethanol, possibly from sterilisation of the urine collection vials (data not shown). Thus, a second data reduction and PCA was performed, in which the spectral regions containing ethanol signals were excluded. The PCA scores plot of the first two principal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) showed considerable clustering of the three groups, albeit with some overlap between the groups. Notably mice from the 391 strain were clearly separated from wild-type mice, with mice from the 569 strain exhibiting a distribution in between these two extremes. The separation between the three groups was mostly along PC2.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis of urinary data</title><p>To maximise separation between the three mouse strains a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed. In contrast to PCA, which is an unsupervised multivariate statistical classification method that works to explain maximum variation between samples, PLS-DA is a supervised method that explains maximum separation between pre-defined classes (<italic>e.g.</italic> genotype or health state) in the data. Thus, the class membership of each sample must be known and is provided in form of a Y-table. PLS-DA then performs a regression of the original data against the Y-table to maximise separation between the individual classes. In our case, the group identity of the three mouse strains was used in the Y-table. The PLS-DA scores plot of the first two partial least squares (PLS) components, PLS1 and PLS2, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) showed improved separation of the three mouse strains compared to the PCA. Again, mice from the 391 strain are completely separated from the wild-type strain, with mice from the 569 strain exhibiting a distribution in between these two extremes. The separation between the three groups was mostly along PLS1, suggesting that this PLS component contains metabolites associated with differences between the three strains.</p><p>The equivalent loadings plot showed several spectral regions that exhibit significant correlation with PLS1 and/or PLS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The chemical compounds corresponding to the NMR signals in these regions were identified as described above.</p><p>The components most strongly associated with PLS1 and PLS2 are taurine, trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Taurine was less prominent in the spectra of the 391 and 569 mutants than in the wild-type mice. In contrast TMA and TMAO were present in higher concentrations in the spectra of the mutant mice as compared to the wild-type.

While both metabonomics and microarray approaches are very different, both allowed identification of groups of animals according to their genotype. This was achieved by using multivariate statistical tools, which identified markers (metabolites and genes) correlating with a particular genotype. As the strains of mice used in this study have the same C57Bl/6J background and differ only in the GHR sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Rowland1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the metabolic differences observed can be exclusively attributed to the effects induced by mutations in the GHR associated with differential signalling in response to GH. While the altered transcripts identified by microarrays are useful, it was important to understand how they affect the physiological outcome of the mutations in the GHR mutant mice. This aim was achieved by combining Gene Ontology analysis, pathway mapping and metabonomic data to generate a global image of metabolic changes in these mice (Supplementary Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002764.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>The observed separation of the mouse strains in PCA, PLS-DA and GeneRaVE, reflects the observed phenotype and gene expression, with the 569 mutant locating between the wild-type and the 391 mutant. The 569 mutant, possessing only partial STAT5 signalling ability, was generally not well separated from the wild-type or the 391 mutant. Moreover, while the metabolism in mutant 391 is clearly different from that of the wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) at 4 months of age and stays different up to 12 months of age, the metabolism of the 569 mutant mice changes with the age of the mice. The younger 569 mutant mice with an age up to 6 months have a metabolic fingerprint close to the wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), which is consistent with their microarray profiling at 42 days of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). On the other hand, the metabolic fingerprint in the older 569 mice between 9 and 12 months has changed to resemble the 391 mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). At this time they also became visibly obese (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

Thus, an analysis of predicted metabolic changes based on microarray data alone does not provide the full picture, especially when changes in physiology are subtle or appear later in life.

Decreased taurine levels will thus lead to increased cholesterol retention. This links taurine biosynthesis with the cholesterol and steroid metabolism, which are also affected in the GHR mutant mice (Kerr, Lichanska, Rowland, Waters, in preparation). In addition, taurine levels are decreased in diabetic patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Franconi1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Most significantly, a vicious cycle involving obesity and taurine has recently been discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-TsuboyamaKasaoka1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, implicating low levels of taurine in the continuing maintenance of this condition.

Thus, decreasing blood taurine levels lead to less CDO, further decreasing the taurine concentration.

It is likely that both liver and kidney contribute to urinary taurine under the control of GH, since both tissues possess responsive GH receptors. Indeed, the metabonomic analysis of liver tissue shows the same changes in taurine levels as seen in the urine, <italic>i.e.</italic> taurine levels are reduced in liver tissue of 391 mutant mice when compared to lean wild-type mice (Figure 5BC). This result demonstrates directly that the reduced urinary taurine levels in the mutant mice reflect decreased hepatic taurine biosynthesis. In contrast, taurine levels are increased in obese (fat fed) wild-type mice compared to their lean counterparts (Figure 5BC). This shows that the effects of GHR mutation are clearly different from the effects of obesity and that the obesity in the mutant mice is likely to be a consequence of the low taurine levels and the GHR mutations rather than the converse. It is plausible that the increase in hepatic taurine levels seen in fat-fed wild-type mice is a compensatory mechanism to overcome the increased supply of dietary triglycerides by promoting &#x003b2;-oxidation.</p><p>Indeed, while a reduction in &#x003b2;-oxidation would be expected in obesity, we have observed an increase in expression of a number of genes involved in fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation. Similar observations were made previously by other groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-TolletEgnell1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Olsson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-FloresMorales1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> in animals deficient in GH. Most of these transcripts are normalized by GH treatment. The changes observed by ourselves and others are generally small, 1.5&#x02013;2 fold between the wild-type and mutants or GH-deficient animals, and may reflect the hepatic response to increased lipid load resulting from upregulation of the CD36 transporter and lipoprotein lipase expression evident in the microarray analysis (19), leading to steatosis in older animals.</p><p>The increased lipid transport in the GHR mutant mice is likely to create an increased demand for lecithin, which can be satisfied by increased lecithin synthesis via glycine and choline, causing an increased flux through the choline metabolism. This interpretation is corroborated by increased urinary levels of TMA, dimethylamine (DMA) and TMAO. Indeed, these three metabolites are the second-most significant metabolites in the metabonomic analysis after taurine. They can be made either via endogenous pathways from choline or from dimethylglycine (Supplementary Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002764.s001">Figure S1</xref>), or via exogenous pathways involving gut flora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Asatoor1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Baker1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. The increased flux through the endogenous glycine-choline pathway is further substantiated by increased transcriptional levels of FMO3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Lang1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Lang2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, the enzyme catalysing the conversion of TMA to TMAO, and this enzyme was identified as one of our marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002764-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>The increased flux through the choline metabolism is likely to be further facilitated by the decreased taurine production. Due to the feedback inhibition of CDO and the decreased levels of <italic>Csad</italic> levels, the taurine precursor cysteine can be shunted through alternative pathways, by being converted via serine to glycine and then further into choline and lecithin as outlined above.</p><p>However, the metabonomic data suggest that the majority of the cysteine is shunted into the biosynthesis of creatine, which undergoes breakdown to creatinine (Supplementary Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002764.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The urinary levels of both compounds were increased, which can indicate an overflow of the serine to glycine pathway, alteration of muscle metabolism, kidney function, or all of those. Indeed it has been previously suggested that increased cysteine synthesis is associated with hypercreatinuria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Clayton1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Creatine is also an important metabolite of energy metabolism because a phosphorylated form of it (phosphocreatine) is able to phosphorylate ADP to ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Bessman1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, thereby generating energy reserves. The excretion of creatinine is a sensitive marker for lean muscle mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Heymsfield1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, which is in turn highly influenced by GH, and thus it could be argued that the observed changes in creatine/creatinine excretion are a result of changes in the muscle mass as result of the disrupted GH signaling. However, the percentage of lean muscle mass decreases in the GHR mutant mice, while excretion of creatine and creatinine increases, meaning that the first interpretation is more likely.</p><p>We anticipated abnormal energy metabolism, as 21&#x00025; of differentially expressed metabolic genes are involved in generation of energy and precursor metabolites. The NMR analysis demonstrated changes in the urinary levels of TCA cycle metabolites, with decreased urinary concentrations of citrate, succinate, oxaloacetate and 2-oxoglutarate. These changes can have a variety of reasons and are not straightforward to interpret, as TCA cycle metabolites are also central metabolic branching points for biosynthesis or breakdown of fatty acids as well as for biosynthesis and breakdown of amino acids. A reduction in urinary citrate can also indicate metabolic acidosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Simpson1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Correlating with the metabonomic observations, the microarray analysis indicated alterations in the TCA cycle, albeit at low levels. GH is known to regulate a number of TCA cycle enzymes, in particular NADH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinate CoA ligase and fumarate hydratase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-TolletEgnell1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-FloresMorales1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One of the other categories changed in Gene Ontology analysis was the metabolism of nucleic acids and its components (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002764-t001">Table 1</xref>). While we were unable to match the changes in gene expression to a single pathway, there were indications of changes in pyrimidine and to smaller extent in purine metabolism. The metabonomic data showed increased urinary levels of allantoin, which is an intermediate in purine metabolism. This is most likely the result of an increased flux in purine metabolism, possibly due to increased DNA breakdown and excretion via the xanthine-allantoin-urea pathway. Alterations in this pathway would not be surprising, as it has been described previously that in GH-deficient patients there is increased excretion of urea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Norrelund2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Norrelund3">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> in fasting individuals, which is overcome by GH replacement. Relevant to this is a large increase in transcript levels of hydroxylamine oxidase (<italic>Hao3</italic>), for which transcript levels were increased from 3.8 fold in mutant 569 to 11 fold in mutant 391 and GHR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This would lead to an increase in nitrite levels and consequently ammonia levels, which can enter the urea cycle, further increasing urea excretion.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this paper we have shown that truncations in the intracellular domain of the GHR that impair STAT5 signaling in particular cause dramatic metabolic changes, leading to obesity, and involving the metabolism of the whole body, as evidenced by their consistency between liver tissue and urine. The most prominent hallmarks of these changes are a decrease in taurine levels and changes in choline metabolism, characterized by increased levels of TMA, TMAO and DMA. Both changes are connected via lipid transport pathways and amino acid metabolism and support a potentially important role of taurine in regulating &#x003b2;-oxidation.</p><p>We have also has shown how various parts of metabolism interact with each other in response to altered hormonal levels. The effects of GH on metabolism were always described as complex, but they can be unraveled when global metabolism analysis methods are used.</p><p>The multivariate statistical techniques analysing metabonomic and gene expression data implicated the same biochemical pathways. The convergence of both methods on the same biochemical pathways underlines the complementarity of both techniques and exemplifies the power of this combined approach. Our results demonstrate that metabonomic data can be successfully linked with microarray results to develop a coherent picture of physiological changes in response to a varying genetic background, allowing a deeper understanding of systems biology. Future studies combining more detailed genetic expression profile data with established data of metabolic fluxes in tissues, metabolic modelling, and metabonomic data will be useful in developing a more detailed understanding of how changes in gene transcription lead to the observed metabolic and systemic changes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Animals were housed in an approved facility and treated as per university guidelines with ethics approval from the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee and the Australian Office of the Gene Technology Regulator.

In addition, the 2&#x003c3; standard deviation from the mean PLS1 scores was calculated to indicate the possible bandwidth of the metabolic trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Identification of metabolites</title><p>Metabolites were identified in the NMR spectra by comparing their <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts and coupling patterns with corresponding values of metabolites from previously published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Holmes2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002764-Connor1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and from publicly accessible data banks, such as the BioMagRes data bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu">http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu</ext-link>), the Metabolomics Database of Linkoping (MDL) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mdl.imv.liu.se">http://mdl.imv.liu.se</ext-link>), or the Human Metabolome Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hmdb.ca">http://www.hmdb.ca</ext-link>).
