A large cleavage and polyadenylation complex containing the major poly(A) polymerase Pap1 produces mRNA 3&#x02032; ends, whereas those of nonpolyadenylated snoRNAs in yeast are formed either by endonucleolytic cleavage or by termination, followed by trimming by the nuclear exosome. We show that synthesis of independently transcribed snoRNAs involves default polyadenylation of two classes of precursors derived from termination at a main Nrd1/Nab3-dependent site or a &#x0201c;fail-safe&#x0201d; mRNA-like signal. Poly(A) tails are added by Pap1 to both forms, whereas the alternative poly(A) polymerase Tfr4 adenylates major precursors and processing intermediates to facilitate further polyadenylation by Pap1 and maturation by the exosome/Rrp6. A more important role of Trf4/TRAMP, however, is to enhance Nrd1 association with snoRNA genes. We propose a model in which polyadenylation of pre-snoRNAs is a key event linking their transcription termination, 3&#x02032; end processing, and degradation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synthesis of mature RNAs in eukaryotic cells is a multistep process. Accumulation and function of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) require correct transcription termination, 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; processing, and assembly into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, two classes of snoRNAs, box C/D and box H/ACA, act in preribosomal RNA processing and modification. They have distinct secondary structures, associate with different sets of proteins, and guide unrelated modification reactions (2&#x02032;-O-ribose methylation versus pseudouridylation) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kiss, 2002</xref>). They are synthesized as larger precursors by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) from independent transcription units, polycistronic precursors, or excised introns. Following transcription termination, cleavage by endonuclease Rnt1 (RNase III) or release from introns, their mature 3&#x02032; ends are generated by the exosome, a complex with the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (<xref rid="bib2 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Allmang et&#x000a0;al., 1999; van Hoof et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Transcription termination of snoRNAs involves a complex of two RNA-binding proteins, Nrd1 and Nab3, and a putative RNA helicase, Sen1. Nrd1 interacts with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II and with the exosome to link termination with processing (<xref rid="bib27 bib39 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kim et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Steinmetz et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Vasiljeva and Buratowski, 2006</xref>). Some components of the mRNA 3&#x02032; end formation apparatus, including subunits of the mRNA cleavage factor IA (Rna14, Rna15, Pcf11), subunits of the Pti1-associated cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) subcomplex APT (Ref2, Ssu72, Pta1, Swd2, Glc7), and the PAF complex, also contribute to snoRNA termination (<xref rid="bib11 bib15 bib16 bib19 bib20 bib33 bib35 bib36 bib37 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Dheur et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Dichtl et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Fatica et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Ganem et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Morlando et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Nedea et&#x000a0;al., 2003, 2008; Sheldon et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Steinmetz and Brow, 2003</xref>). This process has been proposed to occur in a cleavage-dependent manner (<xref rid="bib19 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Fatica et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Morlando et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>), but the potential nuclease has not been identified. CPF component Brr5, a yeast homolog of the mRNA 3&#x02032; end-processing endonuclease, was shown not to be involved. Nucleases, such as Rnt1, the exosome, and particularly Rat1 that participates in termination of mRNAs, are also not important for snoRNA termination (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kim et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>A bipartite signal directing termination of snoRNA transcripts was identified for snR13, snR50, snR65, and snR47. It consists of a Nrd1/Nab3-binding region (site I) and a sequence resembling the mRNA cleavage/polyadenylation signal (site II) (<xref rid="bib19 bib33 bib38 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Fatica et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Morlando et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Steinmetz and Brow, 2003; Steinmetz et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Mutations in these elements, as in <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, lead to transcriptional readthrough of the terminators. Efficient termination requires cotranscriptional recruitment of Nrd1/Nab3 and cleavage and polyadenylation components to snoRNA genes. In addition, the Nrd1/Nab3-dependent pathway involves interaction between Nrd1 and the phosphorylated Ser-5 of CTD and direct binding of several Nrd1 and Nab3 molecules to multiple sites in the RNA (<xref rid="bib21 bib27 bib38 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Gudipati et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Kim et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Steinmetz and Brow, 2003; Vasiljeva et&#x000a0;al., 2008b</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear exosome, and above all its nuclear component Rrp6 and cofactor Rrp47, has long been known to participate in the formation of snoRNA 3&#x02032; ends. The absence of exosomal subunits leads to accumulation of 3&#x02032; unprocessed forms, carrying either a few additional residues or longer polyadenylated extensions (<xref rid="bib2 bib29 bib32 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Allmang et&#x000a0;al., 1999; LaCava et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Mitchell et&#x000a0;al., 2003; van Hoof et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Although some polyadenylation of pre-snoRNAs by the classical mRNA poly(A) polymerase Pap1 has been reported (<xref rid="bib43 bib48" ref-type="bibr">van Hoof et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Wyers et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), major activities accountable for addition of these poly(A) tails are the highly related poly(A) polymerases Trf4 and Trf5 (<xref rid="bib18 bib23 bib29 bib42 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Egecioglu et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Houseley and Tollervey, 2006; LaCava et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Vanacova et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Wyers et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Together with RNA-binding proteins Air1/2 and an exosome cofactor, DEVH ATP-dependent RNA helicase Mtr4, they form TRAMP complexes, which activate the nuclear exosome and polyadenylate a large number of defective, superfluous, or regulated RNAs such as unmodified tRNAs, unprocessed rRNAs, and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) (<xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib24 bib25 bib26 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Ares, 2006; Dez et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Houseley et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Kadaba et&#x000a0;al., 2004, 2006; Wyers et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Trf4/5-mediated polyadenylation is believed to mark the bulk of RNAs for degradation and thus acts as a nuclear surveillance mechanism.</p><p>Although polyadenylation of intrinsically nonpolyadenylated sn/snoRNAs was attributed to the RNA quality control, polyadenylation-driven processing of precursors cleaved by Rnt1 has also been suggested (<xref rid="bib18 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Egecioglu et&#x000a0;al., 2006; van Hoof et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). We have therefore investigated the relationship between snoRNA 3&#x02032; end formation and polyadenylation and the extent of Pap1 and Trf4/5 contribution to this process. We find that 3&#x02032; ends unprocessed in the absence of Rrp6 contain uncoded adenines that probably represent vestiges of the initial poly(A) tail. Our experiments show that snoRNA termination at both sites is followed by polyadenylation by Pap1 that initiates 3&#x02032; end processing by the nuclear exosome/Rrp6. Trf4 contributes to the association of Nrd1 with snoRNA genes and adenylates pre-snoRNAs to facilitate their processing. During the final steps of maturation, snoRNA fate is decided, and incorrectly processed or misassembled molecules are degraded by TRAMP and the exosome.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>3&#x02032; Ends of Box C/D snoRNAs Are Oligoadenylated in the Absence of Rrp6</title><p>The last step of 3&#x02032; end processing of independently transcribed and intron-encoded snoRNAs involves trimming by the nuclear exosome component, Rrp6, with the cooperation of Rrp47. In their absence, box C/D snoRNAs contain short 3&#x02032; extensions that have been assumed to represent the last undigested nucleotides of the precursor (<xref rid="bib2 bib32 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Allmang et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Mitchell et&#x000a0;al., 2003; van Hoof et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). We have re-examined 3&#x02032; ends of box C/D snoRNAs snR13, snR50, snR65, snR68, and U18 in the <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> strain. Circular RT-PCR (CR-RT-PCR) followed by sequencing shows that they carry one to six additional residues, of which only the first few overlap with those in the precursor, the remaining ones being one to four adenosines not present in the sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B). In contrast, in the wild-type strain only mature 3&#x02032; ends are reproduced for all snoRNAs tested except intron-encoded U18. A similar analysis for box H/ACA snoRNAs snR3 and snR43 reveals the same mature 3&#x02032; termini in both strains. The untemplated adenosines at 3&#x02032; ends of box C/D snoRNAs in the <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> strain probably represent incompletely processed precursors. As 3&#x02032; extended and adenylated sn/snoRNAs are stable and functional (<xref rid="bib1 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Abou Elela and Ares, 1998; van Hoof et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>), it raises the possibility that snoRNA processing may involve addition of 3&#x02032; poly(A) tails.</p><p>3&#x02032; extended species were also observed for intron-encoded box C/D snoRNAs in mutants in a core snoRNP protein, Nop1 (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lafontaine and Tollervey, 2000</xref>). We have tested 3&#x02032; ends of snR65 and snR13 in the <italic>nop1-2</italic> temperature-sensitive mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). Inactivation of Nop1 results in a gradual depletion of mature snoRNAs, as reported, and accumulation of short heterogeneous species. They correspond to oligoadenylated snoRNAs that probably failed to be properly assembled into the RNP and, as a result, became inaccurately matured by Rrp6 and eventually degraded. This result points to the correlation between final processing steps and snoRNP assembly.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Polyadenylated snoRNAs in the <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> Strain Are Precursor Species</title><p>Longer polyadenylated snoRNA forms that accumulate in the <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> strain were examined by northern analysis of the poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction selected on an oligo(dT) column. Two poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> populations were detected for box C/D snR65, snR13, snR64, snR68, and U14 as well as box H/ACA snR46 and snR33 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D and see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref> available online). The shorter set starts at the height of the primary precursor (shown with an arrow in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D). Both poly(A) tails span approximately 70&#x02013;80 nt as estimated by comparison of the untreated and deadenylated snR65 by RNase H in the presence of oligo(dT) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E). In the deadenylated sample, two polyadenylation sites are visible, located &#x0223c;30 and 180 nt from the mature 3&#x02032; end, which agrees well with the positions of the two terminators. Assessment of poly(A) sites for snR65 and snR13 precursors by RT-PCR against the poly(A) tail, followed by sequencing, shows that they are located in terminator I and II (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D). In wild-type cells, polyadenylated species were mapped to terminate at the same positions in region I (data not shown). One of the sites in snR13 lies 4&#x000a0;nt upstream of the potential cleavage (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Morlando et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). An additional mRNA-like element, which conforms well to the Py(A)<italic>n</italic> consensus, is present in snR13 downstream of known region II. The exact location of poly(A) sites and the number of added adenines in terminator II of pre-snR65 were determined by CR-RT-PCR. Of 13 sequenced clones, all contain from 3 to 107 As at different positions within this region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>F). For technical reasons, it was difficult to apply this approach to RNAs derived from site I.</p><p>These data show that snoRNA species are not polyadenylated at random sites but at two discrete regions corresponding to terminators I and II. We predict that they do not represent stabilized exosome degradation intermediates but snoRNA precursors that are generated by polyadenylation linked to transcription.</p><p>To test this possibility, transcriptional pulse stop induced by galactose and stopped by glucose was performed for snR65 expressed from an inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (<italic>GAL1::SNR65</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). Owing to a certain leakage from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, there is a background level of snR65 before the pulse. Two classes of newly synthesized pre-snR65, with significantly different sizes (130 nt for species labeled I<sup>&#x02217;</sup> and 280&#x02013;340 nt for species labeled II-pA) are visible after 30 min following the pulse. The heterogeneous II-pA is polyadenylated, as attested by deadenylation with RNase H and oligo(dT) (data not shown), and matches precursors resulting from termination in region II. The shorter RNA, which resembles species in <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> cells shown with arrows in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D, does not carry a poly(A) tail but may well be oligoadenylated, as some diffused forms are visible. A more abundant third species, marked as M<sup>&#x02217;</sup>, also accumulates, only a few nucleotides longer than the mature snR65. It represents semimature snoRNA that is normally trimmed by Rrp6 and is predominant in its absence (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Accumulation of two polyadenylated heterogeneous pre-snR65, I-pA and II-pA, and of the adenylated I<sup>&#x02217;</sup> species is much stronger in the <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). I-pA is not seen in the wild-type by northern analysis, but both polyadenylated forms are detected using RT-PCR against the poly(A) tail (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>), showing that in wild-type and <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> cells I-pA and I<sup>&#x02217;</sup> correspond to major precursors generated at terminator I. Following transcription inhibition, all precursors and intermediates in the wild-type (II-pA, I<sup>&#x02217;</sup> and M<sup>&#x02217;</sup>) and II-pA RNAs in the <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> are shortened and disappear with slightly different kinetics. This is accompanied by the buildup of the mature or semimature (M<sup>&#x02217;</sup>) snoRNAs in wild-type or <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> cells, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C, see also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>), suggesting that they arise from the processing of these precursors. Surprisingly, I<sup>&#x02217;</sup> and I-pA persist, and I-pA becomes hyperadenylated in the absence of Rrp6. These species are probably not converted to mature RNAs, showing that their processing or decay strictly depends on Rrp6. Different behavior of I-pA and II-pA suggests that they are produced as separate precursors, while I<sup>&#x02217;</sup> and I-pA are interrelated.</p><p>Assessment of the transcript kinetics allows us to conclude that snoRNAs are processed from polyadenylated precursors by independent termination at site I or II, immediately followed, either co- or posttranscriptionally, by the addition of poly(A) tails at both terminators. In wild-type cells, snoRNAs are generated from either precursor but preferably from polyadenylated site I-associated transcripts processed by Rrp6 to M<sup>&#x02217;</sup> intermediates, which in turn are trimmed to mature species, also by Rrp6. The turnover of II-pA RNAs is much slower and is not carried out by Rrp6 alone, except for the final digestion. In the <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> mutant, semimature snoRNAs are produced from II-pA precursors independently of Rrp6, possibly by the core nuclear exosome (see below). I<sup>&#x02217;</sup> and I-pA RNAs are synthesized but remain dead-end products that are not chased into mature snoRNAs. Digestion of adenines is not carried out by the CCR4-NOT and Pan2-Pan3 deadenylase complexes, as <italic>caf1&#x00394;/ccr4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ccr4&#x00394;/pan2&#x00394;</italic> mutants do not show any accumulation of poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> snoRNAs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>), designating the nuclear exosome with the specific involvement of Rrp6 for this function.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Contribution of Trf4/5 Polymerases to snoRNA Polyadenylation</title><p>Trf4/5 polymerases polyadenylate Rrp6-dependent RNA targets, including snoRNA Rnt1 degradation and processing intermediates (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Egecioglu et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Polyadenylation status of box C/D snR65, snR13, and U14 and box H/ACA snR46 not processed by Rnt1 was therefore analyzed in <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> strains lacking Trf4 or Trf5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A). High-mobility RNAs, which are strongly enriched in the poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction and probably end at terminator II, visibly accumulate in <italic>rrp6&#x00394;/trf4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rrp6&#x00394;/trf5&#x00394;</italic> mutants, whereas site I polyadenylated species decrease in <italic>rrp6&#x00394;/trf4&#x00394;</italic> cells. Note that this phenotype is observed for both snoRNA classes. In contrast, poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> forms of pre-U18, generated by lariat debranching or Rnt1 cleavage, are not equally affected by deletion of <italic>TRF4</italic>, confirming that polyadenylation of other precursors is related to their termination. When deletion of <italic>RRP6</italic> is combined with a <italic>trf4-236</italic> catalytic site mutant with the abolished poly(A) polymerase activity (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Wyers et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), both polyadenylated populations are missing, while a <italic>trf4&#x00394;-</italic>like ladder of poly(A)<sup>&#x02212;</sup> intermediates and major site I precursors accumulate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B). These short species migrate faster in the <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> strain with a <italic>trf4-236</italic> allele than with the wild-type <italic>TRF4</italic>, suggesting that they may lack oligo(A) tails. These results are consistent with participation of Trf4, possibly by oligoadenylation, in the poly(A) tail synthesis of site I transcripts and, when Trf4 is missing, by shifting termination to site II that is polyadenylated by another polymerase. Weaker effects in cells lacking Trf5 point to a minor role of this protein.</p><p>Similar accumulation of longer poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> pre-snoRNAs was observed in <italic>trf4&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). Since deletion of both <italic>TRF4</italic> and <italic>TRF5</italic> is lethal, Trf5 was depleted in the <italic>trf4&#x00394;/GAL1::TRF5</italic> strain by the transfer to media containing glucose. Polyadenylation of snR65 and snR13 precursors at terminator II persists following depletion, showing that Trf4 and Trf5 polymerases are not, either individually or in a redundant fashion, required for the synthesis of this poly(A) tail. Some accumulation of site I poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> species is visible for snR13 in <italic>trf4&#x00394;/GAL1::TRF5</italic> grown on galactose, where overexpression of Trf5 partially rescues <italic>trf4&#x00394;</italic> phenotypes (<xref rid="bib23 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Houseley and Tollervey, 2006; LaCava et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). RNaseH treatment of snR65 in the presence of oligo(dT) shows that in <italic>trf4&#x00394;</italic> cells poly(A) tail of the average length of 70 nt starts approximately 200 nt from the mature 3&#x02032; end (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D).

Thus, as reported for other processes, the core exosome and Rrp6 have distinct impacts on accumulation of polyadenylated pre-snoRNAs.

The most relevant question is whether it is the normal or secondary pathway of their synthesis. To address this, a transcriptional pulse of the inducible <italic>GAL1::SNR65</italic> was carried out in wild-type, <italic>pap1-2</italic>, <italic>pap1-5</italic>, and <italic>trf4&#x00394;</italic> strains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>). SnR65 synthesis in wild-type and <italic>pap1-5</italic> cells at the permissive temperature proceeds as already described (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A), via accumulation of polyadenylated II-pA and oligoadenylated I<sup>&#x02217;</sup> precursors as well as Rrp6-dependent M<sup>&#x02217;</sup> intermediates, followed by the buildup of the mature RNA. After transfer of <italic>pap1-5</italic> cells to 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min prior to the pulse, precursors derived from both terminators are markedly reduced and accumulation of mature species significantly inhibited (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>E). The pulse in the <italic>pap1-2</italic> strain at both temperatures was very weak, yielding little, if any, polyadenylated precursors and no increase in mature snR65 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C and 6E). The effects in <italic>pap1</italic> mutants are analogous to induction of hypoadenylated mRNAs (<xref rid="bib22 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hilleren et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Milligan et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>) and are not due to the inhibition of Pol II, as transcription is not affected (<xref rid="bib7 bib12" ref-type="bibr">Birse et&#x000a0;al., 1998; Ciais et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). These facts point to a direct role of Pap1 in the synthesis of snoRNAs. In the <italic>trf4&#x00394;</italic> strain, II-pA species readily accumulate, but I<sup>&#x02217;</sup> and M<sup>&#x02217;</sup> are totally absent, which confirms that they derive from I-pA and not II-pA precursors. Despite the presence of polyadenylated precursors, mature snR65 is not produced efficiently: only after 4 hr of the pulse did the snoRNA level show a moderate increase. As transcription rates are similar in <italic>trf4&#x00394;</italic> and wild-type cells&#x000a0;(<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>), this outcome probably results from a slower, ineffective processing. The appearance of a characteristic ladder of nonpolyadenylated intermediates in the absence of Trf4 indicates that it may be involved in the synthesis of mature snoRNAs via rounds of adenylation followed by exonucleolytic trimming.</p><p>These data strongly suggest that polyadenylation by Pap1 and Trf4 polymerases linked to transcription termination is an intrinsic step in the snoRNA pathway that stimulates 3&#x02032; end formation by the exosome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been puzzling for many years how two different kinds of RNAs, mRNAs that sport functionally important poly(A) tails and sn/snoRNAs devoid of such a striking feature, are produced by the same Pol II in yeast. Our work corroborates that snoRNA termination is carried out by two complexes and occurs in two regions: a major Nrd1/Nab3/Sen1-dependent terminator and a fail-safe terminator governed by the mRNA 3&#x02032; end formation machinery. More importantly, data presented here reveal that termination at both sites is followed by polyadenylation of precursors by Pap1 with contribution by Trf4 that is essential for efficient synthesis of mature snoRNAs and for RNA quality control. These findings also ultimately clarify that all Pol II transcripts in yeast, terminated by either mechanism, become polyadenylated by default and only the subsequent mode of the 3&#x02032; end processing defines the final form of the RNA.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Which Poly(A) Polymerase?</title><p>Out of the two classes of poly(A) polymerases, Pap1 or Trf4/5, the latter option is consistent with observations that sn/snoRNAs polyadenylated in the <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> strain lose their poly(A) tail in the absence of Trf4 or Trf5 (<xref rid="bib18 bib23 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Egecioglu et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Houseley and Tollervey, 2006; LaCava et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, Pap1, too, was reported to polyadenylate several snoRNAs in <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">van Hoof et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Our data support both findings, but not&#x000a0;in a wholly straightforward manner. Lack of Trf4 inhibits polyadenylation at site I, shifts termination toward the second region, and&#x000a0;severely delays 3&#x02032; processing, while mutations in Pap1 abolish addition of poly(A) tails at both terminators and completely inhibit the synthesis of both precursor forms and mature snoRNAs. Thus, Pap1 appears to be a principal enzyme in this process.</p><p>Addition of poly(A) tails to transcripts terminated at the mRNA-like site by Pap1 is consistent with the well-established function of Pap1 as a component of the CPF in the context of cleavage and polyadenylation machinery. In wild-type cells, only a minority of precursors undergo termination through this site, but they are relatively stable, possibly through heterogeneous nuclear poly(A) RNA-binding proteins, Nab1 and Nab2 (<xref rid="bib3 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et&#x000a0;al., 1993; Wilson et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>). The length of the poly(A) tail at terminator I (&#x0223c;80 nt) and the analysis of <italic>pap1</italic> mutants point to the activity of Pap1 also at this site. We envisage that Trf4/5 may initiate the process by addition of short oligo(A) tails that are further extended by Pap1 to ensure effective recruitment of exonucleases. This hypothesis would explain how Pap1 recognizes substrates terminated by the Nrd1/Nab3 complex that has no apparent connection with Pap1 but interacts with Trf4. Similarly, both forms of <italic>SRG1</italic> CUT, of which the shorter <italic>SRG1<sub>S</sub></italic> is generated by a Nrd1/Nab3-dependent termination, undergo Pap1-mediated polyadenylation (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Thiebaut et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Also, ncRNA IGS1-R from the intergenic rDNA spacer region is polyadenylated by Pap1 (<xref rid="bib24 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Houseley et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Vasiljeva et&#x000a0;al., 2008a</xref>). This illustrates that transcripts produced via the Nrd1/Nab3 pathway can be Pap1 substrates.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Cooperation between Nrd1/Nab3, TRAMP, and the Exosome</title><p>Nrd1/Nab3, the exosome, and TRAMP interact and function in termination and turnover of several RNAs, including numerous CUTs, snoRNAs, and their intermediates and even some mRNAs (<xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib18 bib21 bib24 bib41 bib44 bib45 bib48" ref-type="bibr">Arigo et&#x000a0;al., 2006a, 2006b; Egecioglu et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Gudipati et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Houseley et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Thiebaut et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Vasiljeva and Buratowski, 2006; Vasiljeva et&#x000a0;al., 2008a; Wyers et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). The major role of Trf4 in these processes is to adenylate RNAs targeted for degradation, and binding of Nrd1/Nab3 has been suggested to stimulate recruitment of TRAMP/exosome to their substrates. Addition of adenines, however, is not the only function of Trf4. During snoRNA termination, lack of TRAMP components, Trf4 and Mtr4, affects the association of the Nrd1/Nab3 complex with snoRNA genes, contributing in this way to efficient termination. The mechanism underlying this connection is unclear, especially since Trf4 was not reported to interact with Pol II at snoRNA genes, and we also failed to detect such contacts (our unpublished data). It is more likely, then, that TRAMP secures Nrd1/Nab3 binding to nascent transcripts. Alternatively, as Mtr4 preferentially binds to poly(A) RNA (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), its helicase activity may be employed not only to recruit the exosome and facilitate its passage through RNA-protein structures (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Houseley and Tollervey, 2006</xref>) but also to dissociate or remodel RNP complexes to release and recycle Nrd1/Nab3 following termination.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Why Are snoRNAs Polyadenylated?</title><p>It has been established that poly(A) tail has a double, somehow antagonistic role in RNA stabilization and function and in RNA surveillance. Polyadenylation of snoRNAs, as well as other stable RNAs and CUTs, has been most often attributed to the mechanism of RNA quality control, though it has also been suggested to contribute to snoRNA processing (<xref rid="bib18 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Egecioglu et&#x000a0;al., 2006; van Hoof et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Our data allow us to link these functions and show unambiguously that the poly(A) tail is required for efficient 3&#x02032; end processing of snoRNA precursors by the exosome/Rrp6. We propose a model for this process, illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>. Both Nrd1/Nab3/Sen1 and mRNA 3&#x02032; end formation complexes are recruited to the CTD of Pol II early during transcription initiation, as reported. Owing to the RNA-binding capacity of Nrd1 and Nab3, these proteins assisted by TRAMP recognize the first terminator cooperatively and with a high specificity. Termination at this site is followed by the synthesis of the poly(A) tail by Pap1 with the contribution of Trf4 and subsequently by a very rapid trimming by Rrp6. Some fraction of transcripts that escaped termination reaches the second site and is released by the mRNA 3&#x02032; end formation machinery. These precursors are undoubtedly polyadenylated by Pap1, and their maturation is carried out by the core exosome together with Rrp6. When approaching the mature snoRNA 3&#x02032; end, and more specifically bound RNP proteins, the progress of exonucleases is slowed down and Rrp6 takes over the digestion of final nucleotides, including extra adenines. Progression of the exosome through the RNA is facilitated by the adenylation activity of Trf4.</p><p>Where, then, is the place in our model for the connection between polyadenylation and RNA surveillance? It is still an unsolved riddle how TRAMP/exosome recognizes defective RNA molecules. In the case of hypomodified tRNAs, their abnormal structure contributes to this process (<xref rid="bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kadaba et&#x000a0;al., 2004, 2006</xref>). For snoRNAs, their functionality is reflected by correct RNP composition; defective molecules will not assemble into proper particles. Hence transpires the possible role of polyadenylation-driven processing that allows sufficient time for remodeling of pre-RNP to mature RNP and the recognition and destruction of damaged molecules. Only RNAs assembled into proper RNPs during maturation will have their 3&#x02032; ends accurately processed and will be protected against degradation by advancing exonucleases. This view is supported by observations for the mutant in the core boxC/D snoRNP protein Nop1, which affects snoRNP stability and leads to the defect in transcription termination (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Morlando et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>) and to the accumulation of oligoadenylated intermediates that failed to be trimmed to mature species by Rrp6 (this work).</p><p>Our model also accounts for the generation of two classes of precursors that are processed with different kinetics. The second terminator may not only act as a fail-safe signal for the escapees but also ensure a pool of precursors, pending the need for further mature molecules. If the required level of snoRNAs is synthesized, and RNP proteins are limiting, these precursors are directed to the discard pathway.</p><p>One remaining question is where these processes are localized within the nucleus. In the <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> mutant, snoRNAs and poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNAs accumulate in a discrete nucleolar domain distinct from the nucleolar body (NB) or in nucleoplasmic foci in <italic>rrp6&#x00394;/rna14-1</italic> and <italic>rrp6&#x00394;/rna15-2</italic> strains (<xref rid="bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr">Carneiro et&#x000a0;al., 2007, 2008</xref>). The authors reason that these spots are not sites of transcription but &#x0201c;surveillance centers&#x0201d; where aberrant RNAs are degraded by the exosome. It is possible, however, that these foci contain polyadenylated snoRNA precursors whose processing is slowed down in the absence of Rrp6. The fact that nucleolar poly(A) domains depend on both Pap1 and Trf4 argues that this may be the case. SnoRNA processing involves passage not only through NB, which is probably the site of final maturation (cap hypermethylation and final 3&#x02032; trimming), but also through other regions within the nucleus and nucleolus. We envisage that &#x0201c;processing&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;surveillance&#x0201d; centers are closely related, if not identical.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Yeast Strains and Media</title><p>Strains used in this work are listed in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>.

Released pre-snoRNAs are adenylated by Trf4/5, further polyadenylated by Pap1, and rapidly processed in subsequent rounds of adenylation by Trf4/5 and exonucleolytic digestion by Rrp6. Transcripts that had passed site I are terminated by components of CP at site II, while the Nrd1/Nab3 complex, marked as semitransparent, is released or inactive. Site II precursors are polyadenylated exclusively by Pap1 and processed by the core exosome/Rrp6. The&#x000a0;last few nucleotides are trimmed by Rrp6. Readthrough transcripts and defective snoRNPs are degraded by the exosome/Rrp6 in the course of processing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig></floats-wrap></article>
