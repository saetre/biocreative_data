Infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among the diabetic population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Diabetes is associated with vascular and renal dysfunction characterized by hypertension, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria and glomerular mesangial expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are implicated in the etiology of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. MAPKs are serine-threonine protein kinases involved in cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Three MAPK subfamilies have been well characterized: extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38-MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. ERK1/2 is involved in the growth response of cell while p38-MAPK and JNK are associated with cellular response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and vasoactive mediators such as endothelin-1 (ET-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Also p38-MAPK activation stimulates inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in serum-deprived RAW 264.7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These observations suggest that signaling mechanisms can regulate various vasoactive molecules and vice-versa. However it is still not known if progression of diabetes produces a time dependent activation of p38-MAPK in vascular blood vessels and kidneys. We speculate a differential regulation of p38-MAPK and ERK1/2 in thoracic aorta and kidneys depending upon the duration and severity of diabetes.</p><p>We have earlier demonstrated that diabetes during coronary artery bypass grafting, and chronic peritoneal sepsis produced an imbalance in the myocardial and systemic ET-1 and nitric oxide (NO) profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the profile of ET-1 during progression of diabetes is unclear. Diabetes, both <italic>type 1 </italic>and <italic>type 2</italic>, is associated with decreased NO bioavailability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Conflicting reports (i.e. increased, unchanged and decreased) exist regarding the state of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) during diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We have earlier reported that elevation of ET-1 and NO mechanisms, either systemically or locally in the myocardium, correlated well with the development of myocardial dysfunction during sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and make the heart susceptible to myocardial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We anticipate that the duration of hyperglycemia would differentially modulate systemic and renal ET-1 and NO mechanisms.</p><p>We hypothesize that progression of diabetes [mild (14-days) to moderate (28-days)] would produce renal and vascular dysfunction that correlate with altered p38-MAPK phosphorylation in kidneys and thoracic aorta. Therefore, the specific aims of the study are to characterize the progression of STZ-induced renal and vascular dysfunction at 14- and 28-days; and to examine if the progression of STZ-induced diabetes would alter the biosynthesis and activation of ET-1, NO and the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK and ERK1/2 in thoracic aorta, kidney cortex and kidney medulla.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 350&#x02013;400 g were used in the study.

Arterial blood was collected in plastic tubes containing EDTA (1 mg/mL) and heparin (5 units/mL) to determine the plasma concentration of ET-1, NO by-products (NOx) and creatinine. The animals were euthanitized by pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, I.P.), the thoracic aorta and kidney were harvested. The concentration of ET-1, NOx, creatinine and protein expression of preproET-1, iNOS, eNOS, phosphorylated p38-MAPK (pp38-MAPK), total p38-MAPK, phosphorylated ERK, total ERK were determined in the thoracic aorta, kidney cortex and kidney medulla obtained from each animal.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Surgical protocol</title><p>Separate group of animals (N = 6) were used for hemodynamic study.

The probe was manually positioned so that the artery was centered within its window and then probe was held in position. Through a sterile 10 CC syringe loaded with sterile K-Y brand lubricating jelly (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Arlington, TX), the acoustical window within the flow probe was filled while avoiding any air bubble.</p></sec><sec><title>Renal arterial blood flow measurement (acute)</title><p>Under pentobarbital anesthesia, rats were place in dorsal recumbency, and through a midline abdominal skin incision the left renal artery was carefully separated from renal vein and a 0.5 VB Transonic<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>flow probe was placed around it.

The acoustical window within the flow probe was filled with K-Y brand lubricating jelly (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Arlington, TX). Renal and carotid artery blood flow was measured using Transonic<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>flow meter T206 attached to MP100 system of Biopac Systems Inc., CA via analog to digital conversion. The MP100 system was calibrated with minimum and maximum flow capacity of the individual probe connected to the flow meter.

The sample was centrifuged at 3,000 &#x000d7; g for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C and plasma was separated and assayed for ET-1. Plasma was acidified adding an equal volume of 20% acetic acid. ET-1 like material was extracted from plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] using C-18 SEP-Columns (Peninsula labs, CA). The recovery of ET from plasma was approximately 87%. Immunoassay (IA) was performed using EIA kit for ET-1 (R and D systems, Minneapolis, MN). The assay was performed in microtiter plates coated with a rat antibody to human ET-1. Diluted anti-ET-1 HRP conjugate (100 &#x003bc;L) (ET-1 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) was added in each well. Standards (0.25 pg &#x02013; 65 pg ET-1), parameter control (24.5 ET-1 pg/ml) or sample extract (100 &#x003bc;L, each) were added. The plates were covered with plate sealers and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. The contents of each well were aspirated and washed using wash buffer provided with the kit. After the last wash, contents of each well were decanted and tetramethylbenzidine (100 &#x003bc;L) was added. After 30 min, stop solution (100 &#x003bc;L) containing 1 N HCl was added. Within 30 min of addition of the stop solution, the optical density of each well was measured using a micro plate reader at 450 (OD 450) and 620 (OD 620) nm separately. A standard curve was created and the concentration of ET-1 of each sample calculated and expressed as pg/ml of plasma.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of the concentration of nitric oxide byproducts (NOx)</title><p>The concentration of endogenous NO<sub>X </sub>(nitrate + nitrite) was determined in plasma, thoracic aorta, kidney cortex and medulla. Blood (500 &#x003bc;L) was collected and 40 &#x003bc;L of heparin was added to each sample to prevent clotting. The blood sample was then decanted and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until the time of nitric oxide byproducts, (NO<sub>2 </sub>+ NO<sub>3</sub>) NOx, determination. To determine the NOx level of thoracic aorta, kidney cortex and kidney medulla, those tissue samples were harvested from each experimental rat and immediately homogenized with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) on ice, which inhibited the activity of NOS <italic>ex vivo</italic>. The homogenate was centrifuged (3000 &#x000d7; g, 5 min) and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant obtained from tissues and plasma was passed through a 1.2 &#x003bc;m multiscreen filter plate. Plasma NOx and tissue NOx concentration was determined by using Greiss reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. 6 &#x003bc;L of plasma was mixed with 44 &#x003bc;l distilled H<sub>2</sub>O, 20 &#x003bc;l 0.31 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 10 &#x003bc;L each of 0.86 mM NADPH (Sigma), 0.11 mM flavenidinine dinucleotide and 1.0 U/mL of nitrate reductase. NO<sub>3 </sub>was converted to NO<sub>2 </sub>by nitrate reductase (Boehriger Mannheim). Unknown tissue samples were run in duplicate. The samples were allowed to incubate for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark. Two hundred microliters of Greiss reagent [1:1 mixture of 1% sulfanilamide in 5% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3 </sub>and 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl) ethyl-enediamine] were added to each well and the plates were incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a plate reader and converted to NOx concentration using a nitrate standard curve and expressed as &#x003bc;M in plasma and &#x003bc;moles/g protein in tissue. Protein in the supernatant obtained from each sample was determined using standard Lowry method.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot Analysis</title><p>PreproET-1, iNOS, eNOS, total and phosphorylated p38-MAPK and ERK protein expressions of thoracic aorta, kidney cortex and kidney medulla were determined using standard SDS-PAGE and immunoblot technique. Briefly, thoracic aorta, kidney cortex and kidney medulla tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer and centrifuged as described by Pollack et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The supernatants, at a final protein content of 25 &#x003bc;l, were loaded to the gels using a 2:1 laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromophenol blue and 710 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol). The prepared samples were electrophoresed on 10% denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Gelman Sciences, Pierce, Rockford, IL). Non-specific binding sites on the membrane were blocked overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.4). The membranes were then probed with the primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 hr at room temperature. The primary antibodies are highly specific against the proteins studies and had no cross-reactivity with related members. After five washings in TBST, the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 1 hr at room temperature. Finally membranes were washed three times with TBST. The specific proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were analyzed using Un-Scan-It&#x02122; software to estimate the density of the blots in pixels. Uniform loading was assessed by &#x003b2;-actin (Sigma) protein expression. While analyzing the data for immunoblot analysis, the beta-actin blots for each gel were analyzed first to confirm equal protein loading. Only after confirming that there was equal protein loading in the wells, as evidenced by no significant difference in pixel values of beta-actin blots, the bands for individual proteins were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>All the data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; SEM. One-way ANOVA was performed to analyze the hemodynamic and biochemical data using SPSS software. Following a significant F value, a post hoc Students Newman Keuls test was performed for inter- and intra-group comparisons. Statistical significance was realized at p &#x02264; 0.05 to approve the null hypothesis for individual parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>General characteristics of the animals</title><p>All control rats were freely moving in their individual cages through out the study.

These observations suggested that single intravenous injections of STZ (60 mg/kg) produced a reproducible and consistent model of diabetes in our laboratory conditions.</p><p>Renal hypertrophy can be detected as early as one day after the onset of diabetes and seen regularly post 60-hr of single STZ injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It has been reported that diabetes-induced renal hypertrophy produces increased dimensions of renal cells along with increased kidney weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the present study, we observed an elevated kidney weight corrected by body weight in diabetic (14-days and 28-days) rats suggesting that STZ-induced diabetes produced renal hypertrophy. We also observed that both 14- and 28-days diabetic rats exhibited reduced renal blood flow along with 3-2 fold increase in plasma creatinine concentration. Umerani and Goyal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] demonstrated an increase in serum creatinine as an indicator of deteriorated renal function in diabetic rats. Similar to our results, Itoh and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] also demonstrated that serum creatinine levels in control group and diabetes group varied from 0.8 to 1.4 mg/dl respectively. Thus the results obtained in our study provide evidence for diabetes-induced renal dysfunction in the rat.</p><p>ET-1, a potent vasoconstrictor peptide, has been implicated in diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Elevated, unchanged and attenuated plasma ET-1 levels have been reported during diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although the reason for such a variation in findings appears difficult to fathom, the discrepancies in data may be attributed to differences in species of animals, duration of hyperglycemia, dose of STZ administered etc. In the present study, we observed decreased aortic and renal blood flow in both 14-days and 28-days diabetics rats. However elevation of ET-1 and NOx in plasma was seen only in 28-days diabetic rats group but not in 14 days-diabetes group. Taken together, these observations suggest that STZ-induced hyperglycemia produced alterations in the systemic and regional blood flow, which could be due to altered systemic levels of ET-1 and NO. Makino <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] demonstrated upregulated preproET-1 mRNA in the aorta from STZ-induced diabetic rats. They suggested that increased release of ET-1 from the aorta contributes to enhanced plasma level of ET-1 seen in diabetic rats. Also ET-1 concentration has been shown to increase in kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] following diabetes. Since ET-1 exists not only in the vascular endothelial cells but also in the mesangial cells or tubular cells, this increase in ET-1 could be attributed to increased biosynthesis of ET-1 in the renal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the present study, we also observed an elevated expression of preproET-1 proteins in aorta and kidney cortex but not in kidney medulla at 14-days and 28-days following diabetes induction. These findings suggest that during early diabetes an upregulation of ET-1 biosynthesis in vascular (thoracic aorta) and locally at the organ level (kidney cortex) could be responsible for vascular and renal dysfunction seen during diabetes. Although the mechanisms of ET-1 elevation during diabetes are relatively unknown, several research groups speculated that this increase could be due to an abnormal production by the affected endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or lack of suppression of ET-1 release secondary to attenuated endothelium-derived relaxing factor production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Hirata <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that ET-1 via binding to ET<sub>B </sub>receptors produces activation of NOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and generates NO. In the present study, elevated concentration of NOx in plasma, thoracic aorta and kidney cortex but not in medulla was observed in 28-days diabetes group. Stockklauser-Farber <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] demonstrated an increased myocardial NOS (iNOS and eNOS) activity that reached maximal values after 4 wk and 6 wk diabetes. We speculated that along with elevated NO production, activation of NOS isoforms may play a prominent role in the pathophysiology of nephropathy at different phases of STZ-induced diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Increased expression of eNOS in afferent arterioles and glomeruli was found by Sugimoto <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In a previous study, these authors demonstrated an enhanced renal expression of iNOS 5 days post diabetes that was sustained for 20 days, while eNOS and nNOS were not altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We also observed that the progression of diabetes from 14-days to 28-days upregulated iNOS and eNOS in thoracic aorta and kidney cortex while decreasing aortic and renal blood flow that correlated well with systemic and local increase in NOx levels in thoracic aorta. This suggests that NO stimulation in thoracic aorta and kidney cortex occurs with increased duration of hyperglycemia in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Since in the present study both ET-1 and NOS activation exhibit a similar course in 28-days diabetic rats, we speculate that NOS stimulation could be due to activation of ET<sub>B </sub>receptors via elevated ET-1 mechanisms. However, further studies will be required to strengthen this speculation.</p><sec><title>Signaling mechanisms in diabetes</title><p>Hyperglycemia has been shown to phosphorylate ERK1/2 in rat glomerular and mesangial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and p38-MAPK in vascular smooth muscle cells and aorta in derived from diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Pearson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and Tian <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] demonstrated that ET-1 stimulation of mesangial cell (MC) proliferation involves several pathways, among which MAPK figures prominently. In the present study, we observed that 14-days diabetes up-regulated phosphorylated p38-MAPK but not ERK1/2 in thoracic aorta. We also observed down-regulation of phosphorylated ERK 1/2 in thoracic aorta post 28-days diabetes. In kidney cortex although p38-MAPK was not altered post 14-days diabetic group, ERK1/2 is elevated. This suggests that ERK1/2 phosphorylation predominate during 14-days diabetes in kidney cortex but not in thoracic aorta, while both p38-MAPK and ERK1/2 remain unaffected in kidney medulla.</p><p>Both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>results suggest that ERK and p38MAPK may be involved in high-glucose-induced cellular hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In the present study, we observed that ERK1/2 precedes p38-MAPK phosphorylation depending upon the progression of diabetes from 14-days to 28-days. We observed a profound increase in plasma NOx levels and iNOS expression with a corresponding increase in p38-MAPK activation in kidney cortex and thoracic aorta during 28-days diabetes. We propose that p38-MAPK activation could be an important signaling mechanism that causes iNOS activation as was reported by Liu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We speculate that activated p38-MAPK and iNOS mechanisms outweigh ERK1/2 mechanisms in kidney cortex and thoracic aorta during moderate diabetes. A similar finding, though not directly related to the present study, was shown by Purves <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] where they demonstrated using cultured sensory neurons that co-treatment with high glucose and oxidative stress results in an additive effect on p38-MAPK phosphorylation without affecting ERK1/2 activation. The findings of the present study suggested that phosphorylation of p38-MAPK and not ERK1/2 was associated with iNOS activation and renal and vascular dysfunction following 28-days of STZ-induced hyperglycemia.</p><p>The results obtained in the present study characterize the STZ (60 mg/kg, I.V.)-induced diabetic rat model in our laboratory. The marked characteristics of diabetic rat model include weight loss, increase food and water intake, and bradycardia. STZ-induced diabetes, both at 14-days and 28-days, produced renal dysfunction and vascular dysfunction that correlated well with levels of ET-1 and NOx and expression of preproET-1 and NOS proteins in kidney cortex and thoracic aorta. The data obtained in the present study demonstrate that progression of diabetes from 14-days to 28-days caused a factorial increase in p38-MAPK phosphorylation along with NOS upregulation in kidney cortex and thoracic aorta. The study provides evidence that diabetes produces vascular and renal dysfunction with a profound effect on signaling mechanisms at later stage of diabetes. However, more studies will be required to further delineate the inherent link or interaction between p38-MAPK upregulation, ET-1 and NO mechanisms and development of renal and vascular dysfunction during diabetes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>First two authors contributed equally in this study.
