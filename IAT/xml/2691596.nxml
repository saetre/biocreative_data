The complex aetiology of neurodegenerative disorders includes a genetic predisposition. Unlike monogenic traits, most genes that are involved in common complex diseases are likely to be evolutionarily conserved, vary between diseased individuals, and only modestly affect risk. This makes disease predisposing genes difficult to identify, and so far only a small number of genes regulating complex traits have been characterized. One strategy is to genetically dissect disease phenotypes in intercrosses of inbred rodent strains, which are susceptible or resistant in relevant disease models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Griffiths1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-McIntire1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Olofsson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Genome wide linkage analysis can be performed in an F2 intercross between two inbred strains. All F2 individuals are related but genetically unique, which enables positioning of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Further intercrossing generates an advanced intercross line (AIL), which increases the genetic resolution and allows for fine mapping of QTLs identified in a genome wide linkage analysis. This has proven fruitful for resolving the genetic contribution to complex traits such as autoimmune neuroinflammation, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Becanovic1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Apart from identifying candidate genes that can be tested in clinical materials, this type of experimental genetic dissection can unravel information about disease-related molecular pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Olofsson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Swanberg1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Aitman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have set out to characterize the genetic influence on neurodegeneration in a simple and reproducible mechanical nerve lesion model; ventral root avulsion (VRA) in the rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Koliatsos1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Piehl1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Lundberg1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. VRA results in a very proximal axotomy of motor axons at the boundary of the central and peripheral nervous systems, with a subsequent substantial loss of axotomized cells during the second and third post-operative weeks. Lesioned motoneurons deprived of physical contact with peripheral nerve tissue, thus, degenerate in a similar fashion as many other CNS nerve cell populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Lieberman1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This makes VRA a useful model for studying neurodegeneration in the CNS. Previously we reported results from a whole genome scan of an F2 intercross between the DA and PVG (RT1C) rat strains, which revealed four QTLs regulating different aspects of the VRA response. <italic>Vra1</italic> and <italic>Vra2</italic> were linked to neurodegeneration, <italic>Vra3</italic> displayed suggestive linkage to T cell infiltration and <italic>Vra4</italic> was linked to differential expression of MHC class II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Lidman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Fine mapping of <italic>Vra4</italic> in an AIL between DA and PVG<sup>av1</sup> rats, combined with expression studies and gene sequencing in a set of inbred strains, resulted in the identification of the underlying gene, <italic>Mhc2ta</italic>, encoding the MHC class II transactivator. This gene was also found to be associated to human inflammatory disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Swanberg1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we set out to reproduce and fine map the strongest QTL, <italic>Vra1,</italic> with regard to neurodegeneration by studying two generations of the DA and PVG<sup>av1</sup> AIL and <italic>Vra1</italic> congenic animals. This refines a 9 megabases (Mb) large fragment that significantly regulates motoneuron loss after VRA. Further, we use the experimental setup of the AIL to give more support to and fine map the second suggestive QTL, <italic>Vra2</italic>. Taken together, our data demonstrate a substantial genetic regulation of nerve-injury induced neurodegeneration and provide information about two candidate gene regions, one of them with high genomic resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fine mapping of <italic>Vra1</italic> using an advanced intercross line</title><p>Two generations, the G8 and G10 of a DAxPVG<sup> av1</sup> AIL were used for finemapping of <italic>Vra1</italic> and <italic>Vra2</italic>.

The R3 strain also displayed a significant reduction of nerve cell loss compared to the DA strain (p&#x0003c;0.01). As intra-strain differences in mean survival ratios and standard deviations are very small between the two experiments, results are presented as pooled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005906-g004">Fig 4</xref>). Pooling the data resulted in an even more significant effect of the R1 fragment, with a mean nerve cell survival of 28&#x00025; in the congenic strain representing a 48&#x00025; increase compared to the parental strain control (DA; p&#x0003c;0.001). Motoneuron survival in R3 was identical to the R1 strain (28&#x00025;; p&#x0003c;0.01 compared to DA). R2 did not differ from control DA animals (22&#x00025; and 19&#x00025;, respectively).</p><fig id="pone-0005906-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005906.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Survival of motoneurons 21 days after VRA in congenic rats containing overlapping genomic fragments of the <italic>Vra1</italic> region.</title><p>The results are presented as pooled data from two independent experiments, which yielded highly similar results.

However, this probably reflects the fact that few, if any, studies attempting to map QTLs for phenotypes related to neurodegeneration have been published. Further, 42 human homologues for the rat genes in the R3 fragment were found,of which most are located on chromosome 6. Mutations in a number of the human genes cause various Mendelian disorders, but only one of them shows association to complex disease in Genatlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genatlas.org">www.genatlas.org</ext-link>).

It may be secondary to traumatic injuries or inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), or occur as a primary disease process, as is the case in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease. The common forms of these diseases often have a complex etiology, which includes a genetic component <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Bertram1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Knowledge about disease predisposing genes is of importance for disclosing pathogenic pathways that could be targeted therapeutically. However, unlike monogenic diseases, genes involved in complex traits often only modestly affect disease and are therefore more difficult to identify. So far, very few studies have examined the genetic impact on neurodegenerative processes using an unbiased experimental approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Lorenzana1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Schauwecker1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Butterfield1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The two regions examined here, <italic>Vra1</italic> and <italic>Vra2,</italic> are the first nerve cell death regulating QTLs to be characterized and fine mapped using an advanced intercross line. These findings suggest that genetic variability in this key feature of the axon reaction is controlled by a low number of gene loci containing genes that are polymorphic between the examined strains. We report independent observations of significant effects of <italic>Vra1</italic> on the degree of neurodegeneration in genetically heterogenous intercrossed animals as well as in congenic strains, where only the <italic>Vra1</italic> locus has been exchanged between the two parental strains. This lends strong support for functional biological effects originating from genetic elements within the <italic>Vra1</italic> locus. In the preceding F2 scan, the approximate physical genomic size of <italic>Vra1</italic> locus was 55 Mb. The confidence interval of the combined AIL cohorts now reduce the size to approximately 16 Mb. In addition, the congenic experiment provides further reduction of the candidate interval to just over 9 Mb. Preserved phenotypic effect of a QTL in a congenic strain is the ultimate proof of linkage. In this context, the <italic>Vra1</italic> region is unique in showing replicated significant effects on motoneuron survival after nerve injury.</p><p>In the F2 scan, Vra2 displayed suggestive linkage to neuronal loss after VRA. In this study, we reproduce suggestive linkage of neurodegeneration to <italic>Vra2</italic> in the G10, but not the G8 cohort. Nevertheless, in the G10 cohort both <italic>Vra1</italic> and <italic>Vra2</italic> show independent linkage as well as a highly significant contribution to the combined linkage, which supports a biological effect of <italic>Vra2</italic>. Furthermore, individuals which are homozygous at both loci for either of the parental genotypes almost exactly resemble the outcome in the corresponding parental control. These two QTLs taken together thus account for a major part of the difference between the two parental strains.</p><p>After nerve avulsion, neurodegeneration is initiated around 7 days after injury and reaches a plateau at day 21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Piehl1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The AIL populations were sampled 14 days after injury, to comply with analyses of other aspects of the VRA response, whereas the congenic animals were sampled at day 21. Thus, the QTLs detected in the intercross lines are mapped at a timepoint when only half of the degeneration has occurred, which may reduce power to detect the relatively weaker linkage to <italic>Vra2</italic>. Studies in animals congenic for <italic>Vra2</italic> at 21 days after injury will likely increase the possibility to capture the effect of this locus as the segregation between parental strains with regard to neurodegeneration increases with time after injury. Congenic strains are now being bred in our laboratory, to allow for functional verification of <italic>Vra2</italic>.</p><p>The <italic>Vra1</italic> candidate region of 9 Mb contains 59 genes in the rat of which 45 are protein coding and 14 pseudo genes, which is too large a number to pinpoint candidate genes. However, the list contains a number of genes that are of importance for cell cycle regulation, a process which recently has been implicated in neurodegeneration (see eg.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Kim1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Wetzel1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Lin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>), and genes encoding reducing agents regulating oxidative stress, which is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and ALS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Pratico1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Henchcliffe1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005906-Murata1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>However, comparative genomics revealed no known association of the human homologues of the <italic>Vra1</italic> genes to any human complex disease, underscoring the need for further investigation of this region.</p><p>In conclusion, we here genetically characterize the first two regions that regulate axotomy-induced nerve cell deaths and provide a comprehensive list of candidate genes in the <italic>Vra1</italic> interval. Most importantly, we provide experimental, biological evidence from <italic>Vra1</italic> congenic rat strains that <italic>Vra1</italic> regulates the degree of motoneuron degeneration after nerve injury. We also give further support to the suggestive QTL <italic>Vra2</italic> and show a significant additive effect of these two loci. Further studies are ongoing to exactly define the underlying genetic variation underlying <italic>Vra1,</italic> primarily using recombinant breeding of existing congenic strains. Positional identification of responsible genes and the use of comparative genomics will be of importance for the understanding of the genetic regulation of susceptibility to neurodegeneration and may increase our understanding of conditions such as brain and spinal cord trauma, MS, cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals and breeding</title><p>The DA (RT1AV1) strain was originally generously provided by Professor Hans Hedrich (Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover, Germany), while the PVG-RT1AV1 (hereafter called PVG<sup>av1</sup>) strain was obtained from Harlan UK Ltd (Blackthorn, UK). These two rat strains carry the same MHC haplotype and any phenotypic differences in crosses between them will originate from non-MHC genes. Animals used for experiments were bred in our in-house breeding facility under specific pathogen-free and climate-controlled conditions with 12 h light/dark cycles, housed in polystyrene cages containing wood shavings, and fed standard rodent chow and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The AIL was created by reciprocal breeding of DA and PVG<sup>av1</sup> rats. Subsequent crossings of offspring from 50 breeding pairs were carried out for eight (G8) or ten (G10) generations, respectively.

Although mean survival rates of motoneurons did not differ between males and females, the variability obtained in the F2 cohort tended to be greater in females and linkage to <italic>Vra1</italic> and <italic>Vra2</italic> was weaker. Therefore, only males were studied in the experiments presented here. VRA experiments were performed in two AIL populations, G8 and G10. In the G8 generation, 12 rats from each parental strain and 126 male rats were used and in the G10 generation, 12 DA rats and 11 PVG<sup>av1</sup> parental rats and 186 male rats.</p><p>The congenics were bred by selecting male PVG<sup>av1</sup> allele donors from the G8 AIL cohort, in order to transfer relatively short and well defined overlapping genome fragments of the <italic>Vra1</italic> region.
