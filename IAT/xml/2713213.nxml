Transporter currents were abolished when synaptic transmission was blocked by TTX or Cd<sup>2+</sup>. Pharmacological studies identified two subtypes of glutamate transporters in spinal astrocytes, GLAST and GLT-1.

Nevertheless, studies implicating glial cells in these processes have been confined to anatomical and behavioral approaches. An important facet of glial functions within the central nervous system (CNS) that may be fundamental to their contribution to sensory encoding in the spinal cord is the clearance of glutamate from the extracellular space via specific plasma membrane glutamate transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Five cell membrane glutamate transporter proteins have been cloned, including EAAT1, EAAT2, EAAT3, EAAT4 and EAAT5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The rodent analogs of EAAT1 (GLAST) and EAAT2 (GLT-1) are expressed primarily in glial cells in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Synaptic transmission in various brain structures such as the hippocampus has been shown to be potently shaped and regulated by the functional status of these transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Glutamate transporters are also involved in spinal nociceptive processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For example, inhibition of glutamate transporters in the spinal cord elevates spinal extracellular glutamate concentrations, alters glutamatergic synaptic transmission among lamina II neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and produces spontaneous nociceptive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Dorsal horn neurons develop hyper-responsiveness to mechanical and thermal stimuli after blockade of glutamate transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Peripheral nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] induced down-regulation of glutamate transporter protein expression and attenuation of glutamate uptake activity in the spinal dorsal horn.</p><p>The hypothesis tested here is that real time physiological responses of glial cells, specifically astrocytes, to sensory inputs could be measured by analysis of glutamate transporter currents. The synaptic activation of glutamate transporter currents in glial cells has been demonstrated in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and in brain slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. So far these currents have not been characterized in spinal glial cells. Here we demonstrate that electrophysiologically characterized spinal astrocytes express two types of glutamate transporters, GLAST and GLT-1. The glutamate transporter currents in spinal astrocytes evoked by single stimulation from dorsal root entry zone share some similar properties with hippocampal astrocytes but also have their unique characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of spinal astrocytes</title><p>Whole-cell recordings were obtained from 45 glial cells in the SG of spinal cord dorsal horn. Glial cells were first visually identified as small, rounded cells with a soma diameter less than 10 &#x003bc;m (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We further distinguished glial cells from neurons by their electrophysiological properties after obtaining the whole-cell recording configuration. Glial cells were characterized by absence of action potentials to injection of depolarizing currents steps up to 1200 pA while in current clamp mode and by the demonstration of passive current responses to voltage steps while in voltage clamp mode (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In addition, recorded cells had a characteristically low mean input resistance of 24.4 &#x000b1; 2.4 M&#x003a9; (n = 45), negative resting membrane potential of -74.1 &#x000b1; 0.5 mV (n = 45), and mean membrane capacitance of 11.4 &#x000b1; 1.0 pF (n = 45).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of astrocytes in spinal dorsal horn</bold>.

Spinal cord astrocytes were differentiated from oligodendrocytes and precursor cells by their passive, non-decaying inward and outward currents in response to hyperpolarizing and depolarizing voltage steps, respectively. Astrocytes typically showed small rectifying currents with voltage steps below -80 mV. In the present study, only cells showing electrophysiological characteristics of spinal cord astrocytes were chosen, otherwise recordings were discarded. Recorded cells were marked with Lucifer Yellow contained in the pipette solution and the physiological criteria for cell selection were validated post-recording by immunostaining for the astrocyte-specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics of synaptically evoked glutamate transporter currents in spinal astrocytes</title><p>Single electrical stimuli delivered at the dorsal root entry zone evoked a large inward current in astrocytes held at a membrane potential of -80 mV (n = 15, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This inward current decayed slowly, often lasting over 10 seconds. In the presence of Ba<sup>2+</sup>, the slowly decaying inward current was blocked and a fast inward current unmasked (n = 15, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The fast inward currents were characterized by rapid onset with a rising &#x003c4; of 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.3 ms, relatively slow decay &#x003c4; of 11.3 &#x000b1; 0.6 ms and half decay time of 13.9 &#x000b1; 0.3 ms when evoked by maximal (5 &#x000d7; threshold) stimuli (n = 15, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Stimulus evoked inward currents in astrocytes were strongly, but reversibly, inhibited by addition of cadmium (CdCl<sub>2, </sub>40 &#x003bc;M, n = 3) or tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 &#x003bc;M, n = 4) to the bath to block presynaptic calcium channels and voltage-sensitive sodium channels, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Thus, glutamate transporter currents elicited in response to dorsal root entry zone stimulation is dependent on the synaptic release of glutamate. The minimal intensity threshold stimulus to evoke glutamate transporter currents ranged between 0.5 and 1.0 mA. The mean amplitude of transporter currents at threshold stimulation was 18.4 &#x000b1; 1.7 pA (n = 14). Increases in stimulus intensity resulted in an increase in evoked glutamate transporter current amplitude to a maximal mean response of 77.7 &#x000b1; 7.4 pA (n = 14) evoked at 4 to 5 times threshold strength (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). The time course of glutamate transporter currents evoked by varying stimulus strength was assessed by scaling each of the responses to the amplitude of the maximal response. The overlay of these scaled currents shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> indicates that the stronger stimuli did not change the time course of evoked glutamate transporter currents.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Spinal dorsal root entry zone stimulation evoked an inward current in spinal astrocytes</bold>.

These currents were also insensitive to the GABA transporter inhibitor SKF-89976A (25 &#x003bc;M, n = 3) and nipecotic acid (100 &#x003bc;M, n = 3), and glycine transporter inhibitor sarcosine (500 &#x003bc;M, n = 3). In contrast, this current was inhibited by glutamate transporter antagonists. Application of dihydrokainate (DHK, 300 &#x003bc;M), a nontransported inhibitor selective for the glial GLT-1 transporter (IC<sub>50 </sub>= 23 &#x003bc;M for GLT-1 vs. = 3 mM for GLAST &#x00026; EAAC1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], inhibited the evoked response by 45.6% &#x000b1; 6.4% (n = 6; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>).

The functional identification criteria were validated with immunostaining to GFAP, a well-known marker of astrocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Glutamate transporter uptake currents in spinal astrocytes</title><p>It has been demonstrated that glutamate transporter proteins are expressed abundantly in hippocampal astrocytes and Bergmann glial cells by physiological and molecular studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Spinal astrocytes in this study showed slowly decaying inward currents in response to dorsal root entry zone stimulation similar to that observed in hippocampal astrocytes in response to afferent stimulation of Shaffer collaterals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The long-lasting inward currents in forebrain neurons were presumably due to potassium redistribution in the extracellular space and could be blocked by an ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, kynurenate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Astrocytes potentially sense extracellular potassium concentration through inwardly rectifying potassium channels in their cellular membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The majority of the long-lasting inward current in spinal astrocytes was confirmed as mediated by influx of potassium ions as it was blocked by Ba<sup>2+ </sup>applied in the extracellular bath and resulted in an unmasking of a transient, fast inward current. Persistence of the residual rapid onset and fast-decaying inward current in the presence of antagonists to ionotropic glutamate, GABA<sub>A </sub>and glycine receptors and the sensitivity of this current to glutamate transporter blockers (TBOA and DHK) identifies this current as mediated by electrogenic uptake of glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This current could potentially be mediated by glutamate metabotropic receptors, which were not tested in this set of experiments. Yet, this possibility seems remote as the comparable fast inward current in hippocampal astrocytes was not affected by metabotropic receptor antagonists in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The majority of synapses in the CNS are ensheathed by glial processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], giving a structural basis of glia-neuronal communication. In the present study, the elimination of glial glutamate transporter currents in response to afferent stimulation by the blockade of presynaptic release of glutamate with TTX or Cd<sup>2+ </sup>indicated that these currents were evoked by synaptic activation. The glutamate transporter current in spinal astrocytes in response to afferent stimulation had similar dynamic properties to those observed in glial cells of hippocampus and cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The rapid onset of evoked spinal glial currents with little delay after stimulation suggests that glutamate diffuses out of the synaptic cleft rapidly in spinal dorsal horn as well, reaching glutamate transporters within a millisecond following release. Insufficient function of glutamate transporters in spinal astrocytes would therefore be expected to result in glutamate "spillover" to extrasynaptic spaces and activate high affinity receptors such as NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptors at extrasynaptic sites and/or on neighboring synapses. This finding suggests the possibility of an entirely new mechanism of enhanced synaptic transmission in spinal cord during hyperalgesia and chronic pain. The partial inhibition of the response by DHK and almost complete inhibition by TBOA indicated the co-existence of two subtypes of glutamate transporters in spinal dorsal horn astroctyes: GLT-1 and GLAST. It is consistent with the GLT-1 and GLAST mRNA/immunohistochemical staining in rodent spinal cord at this age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Functional implication of glutamate transporters in spinal astrocytes</title><p>Although both neurons and glial cells express glutamate transporters and participate in clearing extracellular glutamate, several lines of evidence suggest that the vast majority of synaptically released glutamate is transported into glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The high-affinity glutamate transporters expressed in astrocytes are essential for taking up the majority of glutamate released at excitatory synapses, maintaining low extracellular glutamate and preventing glutamate neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Blocking glial glutamate transporters results in both exaggerated amplitude and longer duration excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], suggesting that glial glutamate transporters play a critical role in limiting the extrasynaptic diffusion of glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The loss of glial glutamate transporter GLAST or GLT-1 produced elevated extracellular glutamate levels, neurodegeneration characteristic of excitotoxicity, and a progressive paralysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Mice lacking GLT-1 show lethal spontaneous seizures and increased susceptibility to acute cortical injury due to increased level of residual glutamate in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Although it remains unknown how neuronal and glial glutamate transporters function differently in spinal sensory processing and chronic pain, the glial glutamate transporters certainly draw more attention since more than 80% extracellular glutamate is uptaken by glial cells. There have been several studies showing that glutamate transporters may also play a similar role in spinal cord. Immunohistochemical studies reveal that GLT-1 and GLAST are abundantly expressed in astrocytes but not neurons or microglia of spinal cord dorsal horn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The glutamatergic synaptic transmission in spinal lamina II neurons was altered by pharmacologically blocking GLT-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Pharmacological inhibition of glutamate transporters in the spinal cord elevates spinal extracellular glutamate concentrations and produces spontaneous nociceptive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and also resulted in the hypersensitivity of spinal dorsal horn neurons to mechanical and thermal stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Down-regulation of glutamate transporter protein expression and attenuation of glutamate uptake activity in the spinal dorsal horn is associated with neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] or by chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Gene transfer of GLT-1 in to spinal astrocyes attenuated the induction but not maintenance of inflammatory and neuropathic pain in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>However, not all studies have been in agreement on the role of glial glutamte transporters in pain signaling. For example, the induction of allodynia following intrathecal injection of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2, NMDA or AMPA was diminished by spinal application of TBOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]; and inhibition of GLT-1 activity or expression reduced formalin-induced nociceptive behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It remains unclear whether these data indicate that glutamate transporters show plasticity with the onset of pathological pain or whether in these latter studies an excess of glutamate resulted in activation of presynaptic metabotropic receptors that in turn resulted in an anti-nociceptive response profile.</p><p>It is well known that repetitive low-frequency noxious stimuli applied to a spinal dorsal root result in a cumulative depolarization and a progressive increase in action potential output from dorsal horn neurons ("Windup") [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The cellular mechanisms responsible for the generation of wind-up are complex and still incompletely understood. Although the buildup of synaptically released glutamate was thought to be involved in cumulative depolarization of postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons with repeated stimuli, there has not been an efficient way to measure the concentration of glutamate in synaptic cleft in spinal cord. Since the synapses are ensheathed by glial processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], measurement of glial glutamate uptake currents induced by activation of the transporters has been suggested as an independent method of monitoring the presynaptic release of glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Several studies have shown that synaptically evoked glutamate transporter currents could be used to monitor the presynaptic release of glutamate during long-term potentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The data shown here is consistent with this thesis as glutamate transporter currents in spinal astrocytes increase in amplitude and duration with increasing strength of single afferent volleys delivered to the dorsal root entry zone. The range of stimulus intensities delivered to the dorsal root entry zone, 0.5&#x02013;5 mA in amplitude and 0.2 ms in duration, were adequate to encompass both low-threshold non-nociceptive as well as higher threshold, potentially nociceptive fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The constancy of time course of glutamate transporter currents across stimulus intensities indicate that spinal astrocytes use similar transporter capacity to manage glutamate release from both sets of afferents and additionally that there is normally a reserve capacity for both types of inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Thus, the gradual reduction in transporter currents observed with repetitive stimulation at the dorsal root entry zone across frequencies raises intriguing interpretative possibilities. At least two explanations come to mind. One, the reduced currents could reflect reduced release of presynaptic glutamate or alternatively. Two, it could reflect the saturation of the glial transporters during repetitive stimulation. If saturated, it would have been expected that later evoked transporter currents would have a longer decay time resulting from the build-up of higher concentrations of glutamate in the extrasynaptic space, but this was not observed. Moreover, glutamate transporters have very rapid turn-over rate in the continuous presence of glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and the total transport capacity of glial transporters were not overwhelmed during a brief high-frequency stimulation train at near-physiological temperature, even when a majority of the transporters are blocked by a competitive antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Thus, it seems unlikely that the glial transporters were saturated during low-frequency repetitive dorsal root entry zone stimulation in this study. Altenratively, it might be a concern that the cotransport of 2 Na<sup>+ </sup>:1Glu<sup>- </sup>with countertransport of 1 K<sup>+ </sup>and 1 OH<sup>- </sup>involved in glutamate uptake through glutamate transporter would result in translocation of 1 net positive charge and reduce the net electric gradient. But the activation of a Cl<sup>- </sup>conductance concomitant with transport would provide a potential mechanism to offset the depolarizing action of transmitter reuptake and dampen cell excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Hence, the decrease of glial glutamate transporter currents recorded here during repetitive stimulation is concluded to reflect reduced release of presynaptic (afferent-derived) glutamate, which argues against the build-up of glutamate in the synaptic cleft in the formation of "windup" following repetitive stimulation. Further studies need to be done to clarify this issue.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study showed that spinal dorsal horn astrocytes possess functional glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST. These glutamate transporters in spinal astrocytes could be activated by synaptic transmission in spinal dorsal horn. The glutamate transporter currents in spinal astrocytes share some similar characteristics with that in hippocampal astrocytes and cerebellar Bergmann glia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Use and Care of Laboratory Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (4&#x02013;6 weeks; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used for this study and were housed under a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to water and food. Every effort was made to limit the numbers, pain and discomfort of animals used.</p></sec><sec><title>Spinal cord slice preparation</title><p>Spinal cord slices were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Briefly, 4- to 6-week-old rats were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane inhalation (3%). Previous studies have shown this age rat fully capable of mature nociceptive signaling and development of hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. After a laminectomy was performed, the lumber spinal cord was quickly removed and placed into ice-cold oxygenated (95%O<sub>2 </sub>+ 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) solution consisting of (mM): Sucrose, 117; KCl, 3.6; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25; Glucose, 12. The pia-arachnoid membrane was carefully peeled off and a block of the spinal cord from L3 to S1 was embedded in 4% agar. Transverse slices (400 &#x003bc;m thick) from lumber segments L4 to L6 were cut on a vibratome (series 1000, Technical Products International Inc., St. Louis. MO). The slices were then transferred to Kreb's solution (composition in mM: NaCl, 117; KCl, 3.6; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4, 1.2; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5; glucose, 11; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25) bubbled with 95%O<sub>2 </sub>and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C, and allowed to equilibrate at least for 1 h before recording. The rats were euthanized by overdose of isoflurane (%5) inhalation after the spinal cord was removed.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from glial cells in superficial spinal cord were obtained as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. An individual slice was transferred to a recording chamber and continually perfused with oxygenated Kreb's solution (3 ml/min) at 37&#x000b0;C. Cells in the substantia gelatinosa (SG) region of spinal dorsal horn (lamina II) were visualized using a 60&#x000d7; water-immersion objective on an upright microscope (Olympus, BX50WI, Japan) equipped with infrared and differential interference contrast (DIC) optics. Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) with resistances of 4&#x02013;8 M&#x003a9; when filled with pipette solutions containing (in mM): 145 K-gluconate, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP and 0.1 Na-GTP, PH 7.2. Membrane currents were measured with the patch-clamp technique on the whole-cell recording configuration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Whole-currents were amplified using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA), filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz in digital forms using a Digidata 1322A digitizing board (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA) interfaced with a computer system. Access resistance was monitored continuously throughout the experiments and was typically 10&#x02013;20 M&#x003a9;. The recording was abandoned when the access resistance changed more than 20%. The input resistance (Rin) of the cell was calculated based on the steady state current change during application of a 10 mV depolarizing and/or 10 mV hyperpolarizing pulse. The membrane capacitance (Cm) of the cell was calculated from the transient capacitive currents during the application of a 10 mV depolarizing or hyperpolarizing pulse, using a single spherical compartment model. The resting membrane potential (Vm) was recorded in current clamp mode. For all the experiments, glial cells were recorded at a holding potential of -80 mV unless otherwise noted. Single stimuli of intensity 0.5&#x02013;5 mA; 0.2 ms, was applied through a concentric bipolar stainless steel electrode placed in the dorsal root entry zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Evoked responses were elicited with a constant-current stimulator (Master 8, A.M.P. Instruments Ltd, Israel). Leak subtraction and compensations of capacitance and series resistance were not applied. To label cells for later morphological identification and antigenic identification, 0.1% Lucifer Yellow (dilithium salt) was added into the pipette solution. The morphological characteristics were examined with fluorescence illumination after recording. The images were captured with a digital camera and stored in digital form for later analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>After recordings, slices were transferred to a fixation medium containing 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB) and stored at 4&#x000b0;C.

After that slices were incubated for 1 h in the blocking solution containing 0.2% triton, 5% NDS in PBS.
