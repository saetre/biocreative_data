To date, DNA methylation is the best studied epigenetic modification and is found in the genomes of vertebrates, plants and fungi as well as some species of bacteria and invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In mammals, the bulk of DNA methylation patterns are established during gametogenesis and early embryogenesis and as such DNA methylation is an essential developmental process. DNA methylation is important for the silencing of tandem and interspersed repeat elements and for genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Several human disorders are linked to abnormalities in DNA methylation profiles; they include cancer, Rett syndrome, ICF syndrome, as well as genomic imprinting diseases such as Angelman, Prader-Willi and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>DNMT enzymes are related by the well-conserved motifs in their catalytic domains and are required for two types of methyltransferase activity, <italic>de novo </italic>and maintenance methylation. DNMT1 is considered the major maintenance methyltransferase as it is the only DNMT known to exhibit a strong affinity for targeting hemimethylated DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Mouse embryos made completely deficient in this enzyme through gene targeting die prior to midgestation and exhibit a 95% loss of methylation when compared to normal embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Homozygous DNMT1-deficient embryos have hypomethylated repeat element sequences and biallelic expression of imprinted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. An oocyte-specific transcript, Dnmt1o, results from the alternative splicing of 5' sex-specific exons within <italic>Dnmt1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Heterozygous embryos derived from <italic>Dnmt1o </italic>null females show abnormalities in the methylation imprint maintenance and die pre-natally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. While DNMT2 is the best conserved of the eukaryotic DNMTs and possesses all the conserved motifs required for DNMT function, DNMT2 has recently been shown to specifically methylate position 38 in tRNA<sup>Asp </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to the predominant maintenance activity of DNMT1 and DNMT1o, studies have revealed that DNMT3a and DNMT3b transfer methyl groups to hemimethylated and unmethylated substrates at roughly equivalent rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Gene targeting studies have shown that <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>-/- mice survive a few weeks post-natally, while <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-/- embryos die prior to birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. DNMT3L also belongs to the DNMT3 subfamily because of the cysteine rich motif it shares with DNMT3a and DNMT3b. However unlike any of the other DNMTs that have been characterized, DNMT3L lacks the conserved motifs necessary for enzymatic function and therefore lacks DNMT catalytic activity. Instead DNMT3L has been shown to be a potent stimulator of DNMT3a and DNMT3b by changing their conformation and favouring their binding to AdoMet and target sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Remarkably, <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>gene targeting experiments have shown it to be essential for normal spermatogenesis, in particular for meiosis, and required for the methylation of DNA within the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of imprinted genes in both oocytes and male germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Genomic imprinting refers to those genes, numbering roughly 80 to date, which are expressed exclusively from one allele in a parent of origin specific manner. The parental allele specific expression of imprinted genes requires some epigenetic modification to differentially mark the two alleles during germ cell development. Studies have revealed the majority of imprinted genes to be regulated by imprinting control elements (ICEs) which harbour allele specific DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the male germ line, DNA methylation imprint establishment on paternally methylated genes is initiated pre-natally in prospermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], while maternally methylated imprinted genes acquire their methylation imprint during the postnatal growth phase of oogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Although DNA methylation is a well studied aspect of imprinted gene regulation, until recently little has been understood about which enzymes are involved in the <italic>de novo </italic>methylation that marks imprinted genes during gametogenesis. While <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>gene targeting studies clearly showed this enzyme to be essential for the establishment of methylation imprints in both germ lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the involvement of DNMT3a and DNMT3b in genomic imprinting remained unclear because of the poor survival and development of DNMT3a and DNMT3b null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Conditional germ cell specific knockouts of these enzymes showed that DNMT3a, in a manner similar to DNMT3L, is essential for the <italic>de novo </italic>methylation of imprinted genes in male and female germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>We have previously investigated the temporal dynamics that underlie methylation imprint establishment in oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Here, we examined the expression patterns of the DNMT3 family of enzymes during oocyte development in normal and DNMT-deficient mice in an effort to better understand the role these enzymes play in establishing and/or maintaining DNA methylation patterns during gametogenesis. We used real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) to profile the expression of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>in postnatal oocytes at five different developmental time points and investigated the influence of oocyte diameter on expression patterns. We also determined which DNMT3a isoforms were expressed in growing oocytes. To better understand the role DNMT3L plays in establishing methylation imprints, we studied the methylation profile of multiple imprinted genes in DNMT3L deficient oocytes at 15 dpp, the time point when we have previously shown the majority of DNA methylation to be established in oocytes. While DNMT3L clearly has an essential role in ensuring the methylation and silencing of retrotransposons in male germ cells, it is unknown whether it serves the same function in the female germ line. We therefore also investigated the methylation profiles of IAPs and LINE-1 elements in DNMT3L null oocytes. Finally, hypothesizing that these enzymes may be coordinately regulated during development, we monitored the effect of DNMT3L and DNMT1o depletion on the expression profiles of the other DNMTs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Developmental profile of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3L during postnatal oocyte growth</title><p>We determined the expression dynamics of DNA methyltransferases in oocytes at five time points spanning the period of postnatal oocyte growth: at 5 dpp, oocytes collected were from primordial follicles that had not yet entered the growth phase and measured roughly 10&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;m in diameter; 10 dpp represented a pool of early-growing oocytes ranging greatly from 20 to 80 &#x003bc;m in diameter with roughly half measuring 50 &#x003bc;m or less; at 15 dpp our samples consisted of mid-growing oocytes up to 80 &#x003bc;m in diameter with only about 5% of oocytes measuring less than 50 &#x003bc;m; fully grown GV stage oocytes were collected at 25 dpp; and mature ovulated metaphase II (MII) oocytes were isolated from superovulated 8 week old females.</p><p>To normalize for variations in RNA input and extraction efficiency, amplification of spiked rabbit &#x003b1;-globin was performed for every experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The choice of an exogenous normalizer stemmed from the absence of genes known to be expressed at a constant level throughout oogenesis (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The standard curve method was used to determine the fold changes in expression which were then calibrated to the MII oocyte sample.

Expression of these transcripts increased from 5 dpp oocytes to 25 dpp oocytes, where expression peaked and then decreased slightly in MII oocytes, coinciding with the loss of transcripts which occurs in oocytes after meiotic maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the case of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, the relative expression at 10 dpp was significantly higher than the expression measured at 5 dpp (p &#x0003c; 0.05); while there was no significant difference between the same timepoints for <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>or <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>. <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>expression was significantly upregulated between 5 and 15 dpp (p &#x0003c; 0.05), suggesting a more gradual accumulation of transcripts in mid-growing oocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). The increase in <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>expression was highly significant between 10 dpp and 15 dpp (p &#x0003c; 0.01) and showed the greatest fold increase observed for any of the genes or timepoints.

However, the developmental expression dynamics of the DNMT enzymes responsible for establishing and maintaining these DNA methylation patterns are not well understood, particularly in female germ cells. In the present study, we used QRT-PCR to determine the expression profiles of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>in postnatal oocytes during the period when methylation patterns are being established. We also examined whether expression of these transcripts is related to oocyte diameter, investigated the transcript variants and protein isoforms of <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>found in growing oocytes, and determined the effect of depleting two DNMT enzymes, DNMT1o and DNMT3L, on the relative expression of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>. In addition to exploring the expression dynamics of the <italic>de novo </italic>enzymes in <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>homozygous oocytes, we also investigated the methylation defects in these oocytes, with a particular interest in determining the effect of DNMT3L depletion on the methylation status of retrotransposons in female germ cells.</p><sec><title>Developmental profile of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3L during postnatal oocyte growth and comparison to their expression during spermatogenesis</title><p>Several reports have provided some detail on the expression of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>in mouse oocytes.

We have previously used semi-quantitative RT-PCR to determine the expression profile of these transcripts during postnatal female germ cell development and showed that they are expressed in growing oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. QRT-PCR has been used to determine the expression patterns of these DNMTs in the ovary, and while <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>expression appeared to be stable across the time points examined, <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>expression clearly peaked post-natally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Still, because of the large population of somatic cells in the ovary, a more thorough assessment of the expression of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>in isolated female germ cells remained necessary to better understand the developmental profile of these DNMTs during oogenesis. Our results suggest that <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>have similar expression profiles, with their expression peaking during the crucial period in postnatal oocyte development when maternal methylation imprints are established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Analysis of the differences between the relative expression of the DNMTs suggests that <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>are the most highly upregulated enzymes, consistent with their essential role and cooperation in establishing maternal methylation imprints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

The perinatal expression of both <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>in male germ cells fits well with the timing of methylation pattern establishment during spermatogenesis.

Postnatal oogenesis is a period during which the oocyte grows greatly in volume and accumulates a variety of factors necessary for meiotic maturation and early preimplantation development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

Although abnormal methylation of the <italic>Snrpn </italic>and <italic>Peg1 </italic>DMRs was described in mature MII oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], it remained unknown if different DMRs showed the same methylation defect and if this defect occurred early or late during female germ cell development. Here, we analyzed the methylation profile of <italic>Snrpn</italic>, <italic>Igf2r</italic>, and <italic>Peg3 </italic>in DNMT3L deficient mid-growing oocytes. We have previously observed methylation levels on these 3 genes at 15 dpp to be between 60 and 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In keeping with the previously reported <italic>Snrpn </italic>and <italic>Peg1 </italic>results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], we found <italic>Snrpn</italic>, <italic>Peg3 </italic>and <italic>Igf2r </italic>to be unmethylated in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>-/- 15 dpp oocytes, suggesting that DNMT3L is involved in the earliest stages of maternal methylation imprint acquisition.</p><p>In addition to analyzing imprinted gene methylation, we also examined the methylation status of the IAP 5' LTR and the LINE-1 5' UTR in both growing and mature oocyte samples and found these retrotransposable elements to be normally methylated when compared to prior analysis of these same regions in oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. While the methylation status of retrotransposons in <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>homozygous oocytes was unknown, previous experiments suggested these sequences to be unaffected in post-implantation <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>+/- embryos derived from the fertilization of DNMT3L deficient oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Detailed studies have clearly shown that DNMT3L is required for establishing methylation on LTR and non-LTR retrotransposable elements in the male germ line and that this role for DNMT3L is important for ensuring normal meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast, our analysis indicates that DNMT3L is not required for the establishment of methylation patterns on IAPs or LINE-1s in oocytes. In contrast to sperm, IAP and LINE-1 elements are not fully methylated in mature wild-type oocytes. This may be additional evidence of some different requirement of the two parental germ lines on methylation-dependent retrotransposon silencing. Together, these observations suggest germ line specific functions for DNMT3L and demonstrate that its involvement in retrotransposon silencing is restricted to male germ cells. Analysis of IAP LTR methylation in DNMT3a depleted oocytes showed these repeats to be hypomethylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It remains possible that other factors together with DNMT3a are involved in retrotransposable elements methylation during oocyte development. Interestingly, a recent report suggests the involvement of LSH, a member of the SNF2-helicase family of chromatin remodellers, in retrotransposon silencing in female germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Up-regulation of the de novo DNMTs in DNMT1o and DNMT3L depleted oocytes</title><p>In contrast to the <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>knockout, where genomic imprints are not established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], depletion of DNMT1o does not affect the acquisition of genomic imprints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To determine whether <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>are coordinately regulated or if they can compensate for each other, the expression profiles of these enzymes were compared between heterozygous and homozygous oocytes for both models. QRT-PCR results indicated that in response to DNMT1o depletion, the expression of the <italic>de novo </italic>DNMTs, <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, was up-regulated in 25 dpp GV oocytes, while <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>, which lacks DNA methyltransferase activity, showed no significant change. <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>were also up-regulated in the 15 dpp <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>-/- oocytes analyzed. While the increase in <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>expression was modest, <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>expression was significantly upregulated in both DNMT1o and DNMT3L depleted oocytes with a parallel increase in protein expression observed in DNMT3L depleted 15 dpp oocytes. Similarly, Gius et al. (2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] also observed a three-fold increase in Dnmt3b transcripts in a <italic>Dnmt1 </italic>knockout cell line. These findings suggest that in the absence of one DNMT, a compensatory feedback mechanism may exist which leads to the up-regulation of <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>in an attempt to rescue the defect in <italic>de novo </italic>and/or maintenance methylation.</p><p>It is possible that while such an upregulation may play a role in maintaining DNA methylation on retrotransposons and other repeat sequences in the genome of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>-/- mice, it is unable to maintain methylation on imprinted sequences due to the absence of DNMT3L. The activation of retrotransposons in the male germ line has been shown to have deleterious consequences on meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. IAP transposons also appear to be resistant to active demethylation 'reprogramming' in primordial germ cells and zygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In this report the authors speculate that maintaining these elements methylated may prevent their transposition and consequently avert the introduction of deleterious mutations in the genomes of gametes and preimplantation embryos. Therefore, the upregulation of DNMTs may be an additional mechanism which has evolved to ensure the silencing of these elements in the female germline. However, upregulation of a DNMT not normally expressed at high levels at a certain stage of oocyte development could potentially also have negative repercussions and contribute to aberrant methylation patterns in <italic>Dnmt </italic>knock-out oocytes.</p><p>Recent analysis of stochastic imprinting events in the progeny of <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>-/- females showed that sporadically, in some embryos derived from DNMT3L null oocytes, maternal DMRs were methylated and imprinted expression was normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The authors suggest that in the absence of DNMT3L, the other DNMTs or additional factors may act to rescue imprint establishment in the germline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is possible that the up-regulation of <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>that we observed in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>-/- growing oocytes may contribute to this rescue. Interestingly, for <italic>Igf2r</italic>, one of the sequenced molecules was methylated at 6 of the 7 CpG sites analyzed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). This observation may be reflective of the stochastic imprinting event also observed by Arnaud et al. and may be a result of the rare instance where the upregulation of the other DNMTs was able to rescue the methylation imprint. The overall failure of the DMRs to be methylated during oogenesis in <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>-/- oocytes which are 'over-expressing' <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>may be due to the inefficient targeting of the enzymes in the absence of DNMT3L. Previous data have shown maternally imprinted genes in <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>-/- mature MII oocytes to be unmethylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore an alternative possibility to reconcile the results presented here with those described by Arnaud et al. is that in the absence of DNMT3L the DMRs acquire methylation during preimplantation development perhaps as a result of increased expression of <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>which are carried over as maternal transcripts.</p><p>Prior studies have pointed to the interaction and interdependence of DNMT enzymes. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies have suggested that DNMT3L can stimulate <italic>de novo </italic>methylation catalyzed by DNMT3a at several ICEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

The primers used to amplify <italic>Dnmt1o</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>, <italic>18S </italic>and rabbit &#x003b1;-<italic>globin </italic>have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]; the primers used to assess expression of <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>were designed to estimate the overall expression of these genes. Expression of <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>was further explored using transcript variant-specific primers designed to determine the relative expression levels of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3a2, the two major transcripts of this gene. Primer sequences and amplification conditions are described in La Salle and Trasler, 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The primers used to determine the expression of the <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>transcript variants by QRT-PCR analyzed the expression of each individual variant: the sense primer was unique to each transcript while the reverse primer was common to both; the expression of each variant was assessed individually, not in the same reaction tube, to give an expression profile for each variant (and not a profile for Dnmt3a and a combined profile for Dnmt3a/Dnmt3a2).</p><p>QRT-PCR was carried out using 5 to 20 oocytes per sample depending on the <italic>Dnmt </italic>gene being tested and performed in triplicate for each of the 2 independent collections of oocytes. For the developmental studies, standard curves for each experiment were established using single-use aliquots of 6 dpp testes total RNA supplemented with rabbit &#x003b1;-globin, while standard curves for the studies involving the <italic>Dnmt1o </italic>and <italic>Dnmt3L </italic>+/- and -/- oocytes were established using single-use aliquots of 20 dpp ovary RNA also supplemented with rabbit &#x003b1;-globin. Data were analyzed by normalizing the RNA quantity determined for the test enzyme to the rabbit &#x003b1;-globin content of the same sample and plotted by calibrating to the lowest-expressing sample. Rabbit &#x003b1;-globin Ct values were consistent across samples and replicates suggesting that our mRNA recovery rate and cDNA synthesis efficiency was uniform across experiments. Single product amplification was verified by electrophoresing QRT-PCR products through 2% agarose gels. Results are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA isolation and methylation analysis</title><p>DNA was isolated from roughly 500 <italic>Dnmt3L</italic>-/- oocytes at 15 dpp and bisulfite treatment was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Nested PCR amplification for <italic>Snrpn</italic>, <italic>Igf2r</italic>, <italic>Peg3</italic>, <italic>H19</italic>, and non-nested PCR amplification for IAPs were carried out also with bisulfite specific primers and conditions that have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. An ABI 310 sequencer was used to sequence clones containing the appropriate inserts and only sequences that showed a bisulfite conversion efficiency of &#x0003e;95% were used for analysis. Sequence differences between clones with similar CpG methylation profiles were verified to ensure unique clones were represented. We examined a total of 16 CpG sites in a 419 bp fragment of <italic>Snrpn </italic>(2151&#x02013;2570 bp, <bold><underline>AF081460</underline></bold>), 7 CpG sites in a 205 bp fragment of <italic>Igf2r </italic>(796&#x02013;1001 bp, <bold><underline>L06446</underline></bold>), 18 CpG sites in a 286 bp fragment of <italic>Peg3 </italic>(2770&#x02013;3056 bp, <bold><underline>AF105262</underline></bold>), 16 CpG sites in a 422 bp fragment of <italic>H19 </italic>(1304&#x02013;1726 bp, <bold><underline>U19619</underline></bold>) and 9 CpG sites in a 212 bp fragment of IAP (100&#x02013;312 bp, <bold><underline>M17551</underline></bold>). Methylation analysis of <italic>H19 </italic>served as an internal control for somatic cell contamination as this imprinted gene acquires methylation during spermatogenesis and should be unmethylated in oocyte samples.</p><p>For IAP and LINE-1 methylation analysis, approximately 4 ng DNA, corresponding to approximately 700 oocytes, was digested with methylation sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII and methylation insensitive isoschizomer MspI before DNA blotting with IAP long terminal repeat (LTR) or LINE-1 5' UTR probes as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

A type B spermatogonia protein lysate prepared as previously described was also electrophoresed in parallel to serve as a positive control in the detection of DNMT3a and DNMT3b isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Proteins were transferred to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Montreal, QC, Canada) that was blocked in 5% non-fat dried milk. The membrane was incubated with the following primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer: clone 64B1446, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) raised against recombinant mouse DNMT3a (1:400; Imgenex, San Diego, CA). The membrane was washed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham) and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000; Vector Laboratories). After exposure to ECL Plus Western Blotting detection solution (Amersham), chemiluminescence was revealed on Hyperfilm ECL film (Amersham). The membrane was then stripped and reprobed with the following primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer: clone 52A1018, a mAb raised against recombinant mouse DNMT3b (1:400; Imgenex). India ink staining of the membrane was used to confirm loading (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>SPSS software was used for statistical analysis of the QRT-PCR data obtained where the number of replicates allowed for valid interpretation. Prior to performing statistical tests, the data was analyzed to determine whether it conformed to a normal distribution.
