Genotype imputation was used to maximize genomic coverage and to combine information across studies. Phenotypes were normalized within each study to account for systematic differences among studies, and fixed-effects combined analysis of the combined sample were performed to detect consistent effects across studies. Two SNP associations were assessed as having posterior probability greater than 50&#x00025;, indicating that they were more likely than not to be genuinely associated with statin-mediated lipid response. SNP rs8014194, located within the <italic>CLMN</italic> gene on chromosome 14, was strongly associated with statin-mediated change in total cholesterol with an 84&#x00025; probability by Bayesian analysis, and a p-value exceeding conventional levels of genome-wide significance by frequentist analysis (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>).

All analyses were limited to Caucasians.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We analyzed data from each of four phenotypes (LDLC, TC, Tg and HDLC) separately. For each individual there are two measures of each normalized phenotype: one reflecting levels pre-statin exposure (baseline, X), and one reflecting levels post-exposure (on study, Y). The values of X and Y are derived from extensive normalization procedures designed to eliminate the potential for false positive associations due to systematic differences among studies (see below). However, it may aid interpretation of methods and results to note that in practice X is approximately the log of the pre-statin measure and Y is approximately the log of the post-statin measure (both centered to have mean 0).</p><p>In brief, our analyses aim to identify SNPs that are associated with the bivariate outcome (X,Y), and to distinguish between SNPs that affect both X and Y in the same way (which we term &#x0201c;statin-independent associations&#x0201d;) and SNPs that affect X and Y differently (&#x0201c;statin-response associations&#x0201d;). (Although this definition of statin-response associations may seem natural, there are some issues with this definition that deserve attention, as we return to in the discussion.) To do this it is convenient to reparameterize (X,Y) in terms of the derived &#x0201c;sum&#x0201d; (S) and &#x0201c;difference&#x0201d; (D) phenotypes, S&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;Y&#x0002b;X and D&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;Y&#x02212;X. Because of the 1-1 correspondence between (X,Y) and (S,D), SNPs will be associated with (X,Y) if and only if they are associated with (S,D). But the (S,D) parameterization is convenient because i) statin-response associations are exactly those SNPs that are associated with D, and ii) S and D are uncorrelated.</p><p>For each SNP and phenotype, we assessed the fit of four different models: H<sub>0</sub>, the null model that the SNP is associated with neither S nor D; H<sub>S</sub>, the SNP is associated with S only; H<sub>D</sub>, the SNP is associated with D only; H<sub>S&#x0002b;D</sub>, the SNP is associated with both S and D. Note that H<sub>D</sub> and H<sub>S&#x0002b;D</sub> correspond to statin-response associations, whereas H<sub>S</sub> corresponds to statin-independent associations. One might expect many previously-reported associations between genetic variants and lipid phenotypes to fall into this last category, providing a helpful check of the consistency of our results with previous lipid studies not involving statin exposure. Our overall analytic strategy is to use the fits of these models to identify SNPs with strong evidence for association with the bivariate outcome (S,D) (i.e. against the null H<sub>0</sub>), and then among these most associated SNPs to assess the evidence for a statin-response association (H<sub>D</sub> and H<sub>S&#x0002b;D</sub>) vs. a statin-independent association (H<sub>S</sub>).</p><p>This bivariate approach is motivated by the expectation that many genetic variants associated with D will also be associated with S (since to be associated with D but not S a variant would have to have <italic>exactly opposite</italic> effects on Y and X). For these variants, the support for H<sub>S&#x0002b;D</sub> should generally be greater than the support for H<sub>D</sub> or H<sub>S</sub> alone, and so consideration of S and D simultaneously should improve power to detect these kinds of associations. Note that, in particular, this includes SNPs that are associated with post-statin phenotype (Y) but not pre-statin phenotype (X), since these SNPs will be associated with both S and D; similarly for SNPs associated with X but not Y. In principle it would be possible, and probably beneficial, to consider these two particular scenarios explicitly, rather than simply including them in a general search for associations with S and D as we do here. However, the correlation between X and Y complicates this analysis, and so we do not pursue it here.</p><p>To assess the relative support for the models H<sub>0</sub>, H<sub>S</sub>, H<sub>D</sub>, and H<sub>S&#x0002b;D</sub>, we used Bayesian methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Servin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Stephens1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Wakefield1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, which have advantages over standard frequentist approaches in this context (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Stephens1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>). For example, from a p-value alone it is difficult to quantify how confident one should be that a given SNP is truly associated with phenotype (e.g. is an association with a p-value of 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> more likely to be real or a false positive?). In contrast Bayesian methods allow one to assess this confidence directly by providing a posterior probability of association for each SNP. In addition, Bayesian methods can be used to formalize ideas that may be used informally in interpreting the results of frequentist analyses: for example, here we use them to formalize the idea that we may be less skeptical about an observed association with D if it is also accompanied by an association with S.</p><p>Our Bayesian analysis involves two steps: first compute a Bayes Factor (BF) for each of the models H<sub>0</sub>, H<sub>S</sub>, H<sub>D</sub>, and H<sub>S&#x0002b;D</sub>, and then combine these BFs with prior probabilities on the models to compute the posterior probability on each model. We now describe each of these steps in more detail.</p><p>The BF for each model is given by the ratio of the probability of the observed association data under that model to its probability under H<sub>0</sub>, and provides a natural measure of the strength of the support in the data for that model. For example, a BF of 100 indicates that the association data are 100 times more likely under that model than under the null model. The BF for H<sub>0</sub> is, by definition, 1. We computed the remaining BFs as follows. Let BF<sub>S</sub> denote the BF for association with the univariate outcome S, computed using the method from Servin and Stephens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Servin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, and BF<sub>D</sub> denote the BF for association with the univariate phenotype D. Then the BFs for models H<sub>0</sub>, H<sub>S</sub>, H<sub>D</sub> and H<sub>S&#x0002b;D</sub> are 1, BF<sub>S</sub>, BF<sub>D</sub> and BF<sub>D</sub> x BF<sub>S</sub>, assuming independence of S and D. Intuitively this approach highlights not only SNPs with strong associations with S (large BF<sub>S</sub>) or with D (large BF<sub>D</sub>), but also SNPs with moderate associations with both S and D (large BF<sub>S</sub> x BF<sub>D</sub>); this is the main difference between our analysis and a more standard univariate analysis.</p><p>To compute the univariate Bayes Factors BF<sub>S</sub> and BF<sub>D</sub> we used the prior D2 from Servin and Stephens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Servin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. This prior allows for both an additive effect (a), and a dominance effect (d) at each SNP, with the expected size of these two effects being controlled by hyperparameters &#x003c3;<sub>a</sub> and &#x003c3;<sub>d</sub> respectively. To put the majority of weight on near-additive models, while still allowing for dominant/recessive effects, we used &#x003c3;<sub>d</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x003c3;<sub>a</sub>/4. To deal with the fact that BFs can be sensitive to choice of &#x003c3;<sub>a</sub> we averaged results over multiple values for &#x003c3;<sub>a</sub>, as suggested in Servin and Stephens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Servin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and Stephens and Balding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Stephens1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically we used &#x003c3;<sub>a</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.125, 0.15, 0.2, 0.4 (with equal weight on each). We computed BF<sub>D</sub> and BF<sub>S</sub> using the genotype and phenotype data from all individuals combined, and the software BIMBAM and its ability to compute combined BFs from summary data on each study, with posterior mean genotypes at imputed genotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Guan1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This corresponds to assuming that each SNP has the same effect in all studies, and thus to performing a &#x0201c;fixed-effects&#x0201d; combined analysis.</p><p>The posterior probabilities on each of the models H<sub>0</sub>, H<sub>S</sub>, H<sub>D</sub>, and H<sub>S&#x0002b;D</sub> is then computed by combining the BFs with a prior probability distribution on models. Specifically, the posterior probability for each model is computed by multiplying the BF for each model by the model's prior probability, and then normalizing the four resulting products to sum to 1, so that the posterior probabilities on the 4 models sum to 1. In symbols, the posterior probability for model i is given by posterior<sub>i</sub> &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; BF<sub>i</sub> &#x000d7; prior<sub>i</sub>/&#x003a3;<sub>j</sub> BF<sub>j</sub> &#x000d7; prior<sub>j</sub>. We used the prior probability distribution: Pr(H<sub>0</sub>)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1&#x02212;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, Pr(H<sub>S</sub>)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.9&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, Pr(H<sub>D</sub>)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.01&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, Pr(H<sub>S&#x0002b;D</sub>)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.09&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>. These prior probabilities were chosen to i) place overall prior 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> on any kind of association for each SNP with a given phenotype, in line with previous suggestions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Stephens1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Reiner1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>; ii) be substantially more skeptical about associations with D than with S (overall prior on being associated with D&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, compared with approximately 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> on S), and iii) be less skeptical about an association with D if it is also accompanied by an association with S. Posterior probabilities can be sensitive to this choice of prior, particularly posterior probabilities that are not very close to 0 or 1; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Discussion</xref> for more on sensitivity. The posterior probabilities on models summarize the overall support for each model, taking account of both the association data and prior beliefs regarding the relative plausibility of the four models. Using these posterior probabilities it is straightforward to assess the overall evidence against the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> (using the sum of the posterior probabilities on H<sub>S</sub>, H<sub>D</sub> and H<sub>S&#x0002b;D</sub>), and furthermore to partition this overall evidence into evidence for statin-independent associations (posterior probability on H<sub>S</sub>) vs. statin-response associations (sum of the posterior probabilities on H<sub>D</sub> and H<sub>S&#x0002b;D</sub>).</p><p>To allow our results to be more easily compared with standard frequentist analyses, we also used linear regression with S (and respectively D) as the response variable, assuming an additive genetic model at each SNP, to compute p-values for each SNP against the null hypothesis that the SNP is unassociated with S (and respectively D). We report p-values without adjustment for multiple comparisons.</p><p>To deal with systematic differences in study population and protocols, we normalized phenotype measurements within each study. Normalized phenotypes for LDLC, TC, Tg and HDLC were derived from raw pre-statin and post-statin measurements following a four-step procedure. First, to limit the influence of outliers, pre-statin and post-statin measurements were rank transformed to a standard normal distribution within each data set (CAP-Stage I, CAP-Stage II, PRINCE-Stage I; PRINCE-Stage II; TNT). Second, derived sum and difference phenotypes (S and D above) were computed from these rank-transformed values. Next, values of S and D were corrected for covariates (log(BMI), age, sex, and smoking status) within each dataset using ordinary least squares regression. Finally, covariate-corrected values of S and D were again rank transformed to normal distributions within each dataset (note that any induced non-zero correlation between the transformed S and D was always negligibly small). We note that within each study the logs of each of the raw lipid measures (both pre- and post- statin) are approximately normally distributed, and so the end result of this extensive normalization is similar to (but not identical to) what would have been obtained by the simpler approach of working with the log-transformed phenotype values, and not performing the rank transformations to normal distributions. We used the rank (rather than log) transformations both to limit the effects of any deviations from normality (e.g. outliers) in the log-transformed phenotypes, and, more importantly, to ensure that there are no distributional differences in tested response variables among studies, so that any differences in allele frequencies among the study samples will not cause spurious associations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The characteristics of the three study populations are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009763-t001">Table 1</xref>. Although there are clear differences in clinical characteristics across these populations, our normalization steps should have ensured that systematic differences will not cause false positive associations.

To assess this, we compared the overall distribution of p-values for each tested response (sum, S, and difference, D, for LDLC, TC, Tg and HDLC) with a uniform distribution. QQ plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009763.s001">Figure S1</xref>) showed generally good agreement except in the tail where deviations are expected due to genuine associations. Genomic control inflation factors ranged from 0.99 to 1.03 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Devlin1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, preliminary analyses of the CAP and PRINCE studies that used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to correct for latent population structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Price1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> produced similar results to analyses without PCA correction (results not shown).

In addition rs1260326 located in <italic>GCKR</italic>, was assigned a 17&#x00025; probability of being associated with statin-induced change in triglyceride. These two putative SNP associations with response phenotypes were highlighted much more strongly in the Bayesian analysis than in the frequentist analysis. The p-values for associations with difference traits of these 2 SNPs were 0.0042 and 0.026 respectively, which puts them well down the list of the top associations. This difference in results between the two methods occurred because both of these SNPs showed an appreciable association with the sum trait, S. In this situation, the Bayesian approach upweights such SNPs because it reinforces the idea that, for a SNP associated with S, a modest association with D is more likely to be genuine than it would be for a SNP that is unassociated with S.</p><p>Besides the strongest associations reported here, there were many more variants that showed non-trivial, although far from conclusive, evidence for association with statin response.

Although several loci have been identified in association with statin efficacy using the candidate gene approach, the combined contribution of these genotypes explains a relatively small proportion of the variation in statin LDLC-lowering efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Mangravite1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Mangravite2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

To address this issue, we have performed a combined analysis on the three statin GWA studies that are currently available. Because each of the three trials tested a different statin, this analysis was specifically designed to identify genetic variation that is associated with statin class effects.</p><p>Among the associations identified by our analysis, the most intriguing is the association of rs8014194 with changes in total cholesterol in response to statin treatment. When we examined the association between rs8014194 and change in total cholesterol separately for each trial (TNT, PRINCE, CAP), we observed the strongest association within TNT. While differential ability to detect this association may reflect differences in statistical power across these three studies based on sample size, it may also reflect differences in pharmacological properties (e.g., dose response or statin) or differences in biological mechanism (e.g., lipoprotein homeostasis). This SNP was also less strongly associated with LDL-cholesterol reduction. SNP rs8014194 is located on chromosome 14 within intron 1 of the gene encoding calmin, <italic>CLMN</italic>. The function of calmin is unknown but the protein sequence contains a calponin-like binding domain that is expected to have actin-binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Ishisaki1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Calmin is highly expressed in several tissues including liver and adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Hirosawa1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Full-length calmin contains a putative transmembrane domain and appears to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Ishisaki1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Several <italic>CLMN</italic> alternative splice variants encode isoforms that lack the transmembrane domain and appear to be localized to the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Ishisaki1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Calmin has not previously been implicated in cholesterol or lipoprotein metabolism nor has <italic>CLMN</italic> variation been associated with any metabolic traits. As a result it is natural to question whether the observed association is likely to be genuine. Our Bayesian analysis assessed the posterior probability of this association being genuine to be 84&#x00025;. This figure is sensitive to prior assumptions about how likely each individual SNP is to be associated with each statin response trait. Our analysis assumed this to be 1 in 10<sup>5</sup>, corresponding to an a priori assumption that approximately 25 SNPs out of the 2.5 million tested would be genuinely associated with statin response for each phenotype. The data seem broadly consistent with this prior assumption, in that the posterior expected number of such associations ranged from 19 (for HDLC) to 26 (for Tg). However, the data may also be consistent with more conservative assumptions. If one were to select a more conservative prior assumption of 1 in 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> (implying approximately 5 genuinely associated SNPs) then the posterior probability for rs8014194 being genuinely associated with total cholesterol response decreases to approximately 50&#x00025;. Conversely, if one is less skeptical and increases the prior by a factor of 4 (i.e. 100 genuinely-associated SNPs), the posterior increases to over 95&#x00025;. In a frequentist analysis, degree of skepticism is reflected (implicitly or explicitly) in choice of threshold for &#x0201c;genome-wide significance&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Stephens1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Wakefield2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. In this case the p-value for association, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.9&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> meets conventional levels for genome-wide significance &#x02013; for example, it is nominally significant at the 0.05 level after a Bonferroni correction for 2.5 million tests, and exceeds the 5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> threshold used by WTCCC in reporting &#x0201c;strongly associated&#x0201d; variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, there is strong evidence to support the conclusion that rs8014194 is the first novel SNP found through GWAS to be associated with statin response, although definitive confirmation will depend on results from additional statin pharmacogenomic trials. In addition, we identified several SNPs with less strong evidence for association with lipid response to statin treatment including 2 SNPs associated with change in LDLC (posterior probabilities 13&#x00025; and 17&#x00025;) located in genomic regions containing putative genes not known to influence lipid metabolism, and 2 SNPs associated with change in Tg including one near <italic>ACVR2A</italic> (posterior probability 22&#x00025;) and one within the <italic>FADS</italic> locus (posterior probability 10&#x00025;).</p><p>One important issue facing any study of this nature is how to define a &#x0201c;drug-response association&#x0201d;. Naturally, any SNP that is associated with only post-statin levels of the phenotype, and not pre-statin levels, would be considered a drug-response association. However, here we have broadened this definition to include any SNP that has a different effect on average pre- and post- statin phenotype levels. Note that this broader definition depends on the scale on which phenotypes are considered. For example, if we had used the raw scale for pre- and post-statin measures, then a SNP that decreased pre-statin levels by 2 (units) on average and decreased post-statin levels by the same average amount would not count as a statin-response SNP. But if we had used the log-scale for the measures, then the same SNP would become a response association (effectively because 2 units is a different percentage of the average post-statin than of the average pre-statin measures). Our rank-based transformation procedures, which were used to provide strong safeguards against spurious associations due to potential differences in allele frequencies among studies, could potentially complicate interpretation. However, since these rank-based transformations produce phenotypes that are somewhat similar to a log-transformation, we think of our definition of statin-response associations as roughly encompassing SNPs that have a different relative percentage reduction in pre- and post- statin lipid levels. It is also important to note that these definitional subtleties apply only to SNPs that affect both pre- and post- statin levels: SNPs that affect one but not the other would satisfy the definition of statin-response associations whatever scale is used. Nonetheless it remains an open question to what extent SNPs that satisfy our broader definition of statin-response associations have a molecular interaction with the statins themselves, or the genetic pathways they target &#x02013; but this would be true of any definition, and the fact that most previously-identified loci associated with untreated lipid levels do not show a strong signal for statin-response associations suggests that our definition is a reasonable starting point.</p><p>Another issue is whether there might be other, more effective, statistical approaches to identifying statin response associations. It has long been recognized that simply testing groups for association with the change (Y&#x02212;X) often has low power, because this change generally has a high variance. Our analyses attempt to mediate this problem by instead considering the bivariate outcome (X,Y), or equivalently (Y&#x02212;X,X&#x0002b;Y), to identify SNPs that are strongly associated with pre- and/or post-statin lipid levels, and then, among these SNPs, attempt to identify the subset of SNPs that appear to have a different effect on Y than X. Intuitively this bivariate approach should help when compared with simply testing (Y&#x02212;X) alone, because most SNPs that are genuinely associated with (Y&#x02212;X) are expected to be associated also with Y&#x0002b;X. (e.g. SNPs associated with Y alone would fall into this category). This bivariate approach is particularly helpful to highlight SNPs for which there is complementary evidence for association with both untreated and response traits, as illustrated by the relatively high posterior probabilities assigned to SNPs near <italic>APOE</italic> and <italic>GCKR</italic> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009763-t002">Table 2</xref> for association with statin-related change of LDLC and Tg, respectively. Another source of information that one might incorporate into these analyses to help improve power is the increasing amount of data from other genetic association studies identifying SNPs associated with untreated lipid levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Kooner1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Kathiresan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Kathiresan3">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Chasman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Willer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Kathiresan4">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Within our Bayesian analysis this could be easily achieved by placing a much lower prior probability on the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> for these SNPs with prior evidence for association. However, one could also incorporate this information into a frequentist analysis: to give just a simple example, in a standard frequentist genome scan testing SNPs for association with (Y&#x02212;X), one could use a less stringent significance threshold for those SNPs already known from other studies to affect untreated lipid phenotype levels. Of course, choice of appropriate threshold is a tricky problem, and one possible reason to prefer the Bayesian approach.</p><p>The statistical approach we have taken here differs from that taken in previous analysis of the TNT data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Thompson1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, which tested for association between genetic variants (G) and post-statin phenotype measures (Y), controlling for pre-statin phenotype measures (X). While this type of analysis, sometimes referred to as ANCOVA, is standard for identifying group treatment effects in a randomized controlled trial, it must be applied with caution in the setting of genetic association studies. This is because this ANCOVA test is aimed at rejecting the null hypothesis that Y is conditionally independent of G given X, and rejecting this hypothesis in a genetic association study does not necessarily imply that G is associated with statin response. For example, if a genetic variant G affects average pre- and post- statin lipid levels in the same way, then by our definition it would not be a statin-response association, but the ANCOVA test would tend to give a significant result. This claim is easily verified by simulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009763.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009763.s003">File S1</xref>). Note that the situation here is fundamentally different from a randomized controlled trial, because the randomization is usually designed to ensure that baseline measures (X) are unassociated with the groups G being tested, in which case G will be associated with the response (Y&#x02212;X) if and only if it is associated with Y controlling for X, and the ANCOVA test is preferred due to its greater power <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Senn1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. This said, since one plausible type of statin-response association is a SNP that is associated with Y and not X, it would seem fruitful to take this into account in the analysis, and with additional work this could be incorporated into our Bayesian framework as an explicit additional hypothesis.</p><p>Finally regarding statistical methodology, we chose here to perform a &#x0201c;fixed effects&#x0201d; combined analysis that assumes the effect sizes are the same across studies, despite the fact that the studies are clearly highly heterogeneous. We did this because we judged that, due to limited sample size within each study, power would be limited to detect any effects that did not appear consistent across studies. Further, separate analyses of each study failed to yield convincing evidence for loci with strong, but possibly different, signals in more than one study. We note that although heterogeneity across studies clearly results in model mis-specification (and hence potential loss of power) under the alternative, the null model remains unaffected by this heterogeneity (after our normalization procedures ensuring that the phenotypes have the same distribution in each study) and so, under the null, heterogeneity should not cause false positive associations to be detected by our analysis.</p><p>There were several limitations of this study. Because different statins were tested in each of the three trials used for this combined analysis, the results cannot be extrapolated to individual statins. This may explain why no associations were observed with genes involved in pharmacokinetic handling of statins. Separate analyses of each study yielded no SNPs with high probability of being associated with statin response phenotypes, presumably due to limits in statistical power. There were also several major differences in study populations across these trials, the major one being the inclusion in PRINCE and TNT, but not CAP, of individuals with documented CHD or CVD events. In addition, untreated LDLC concentrations were higher in TNT than in CAP or PRINCE, and this variation across study populations in underlying CVD risk may influence genetic contribution to statin response. Moreover, as noted above, to exclude individuals with poor drug compliance, inclusion in TNT was limited to those who achieved LDLC&#x02264;130 mg/dL with atorvastatin treatment (4 weeks, 10 mg/day), and this likely led to underrepresentation of genotypes associated with attenuated statin response. Although we used imputation methods to maximize genomic coverage for these analyses, this method is ultimately limited by the genomic coverage of the underlying genotype panels. In particular, variation at genomic regions with poor coverage, such as the <italic>APOE</italic> locus, cannot be completely described through imputation. Thus, the relatively modest posterior probability assigned to SNPs near the <italic>APOE</italic> locus in this case may reflect the relatively small number of individuals for whom genotypes were measured. In addition, the SNPs at the HMG-CoA reductase (<italic>HMGCR</italic>) locus that were identified in the PRINCE and CAP populations to be associated with statin- mediated LDLC response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Krauss1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009763-Chasman2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> were not genotyped in HapMap and, therefore, were not represented in this analysis. Furthermore, rarer SNPs or haplotypes that may have large effect sizes could not be assessed. Finally a major limitation is the exclusion of individuals not of European ancestry. Although we have incorporated all available published pharmacogenomic studies of statin efficacy into our combined analysis, this study is probably still underpowered and identification of variants with statistically meaningful association to statin efficacy will require analyses in expanded populations once GWA data from additional trials becomes available. Despite this, results from this and other studies suggest that no single SNP will describe more than &#x0223c;3&#x00025; of the variance observed in lipid-lowering response to statin treatment.</p><p>In summary, using Bayesian imputation-based analysis on a combined population derived from the three currently available statin GWA trials, we have identified a new candidate gene, calmin, that may modulate statin-mediated changes in total cholesterol and LDLC. This is the first report of a variant associated with statin efficacy that was identified by GWAS and its validation awaits functional analyses and replication in additional statin trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009763.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Q-Q plots for sum traits (A, total cholesterol; B, LDL-cholesterol; C, HDL-cholesterol; D, triglyceride) and for difference traits (E, total cholesterol; F, LDL-cholesterol; G, HDL-cholesterol; H, triglyceride).</p><p>(9.78 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009763.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009763.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Simulated illustration of behavior of the ANCOVA test when applied to SNPs that have the same effect on both pre- and post- exposure measurements.
