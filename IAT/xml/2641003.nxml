We studied the balance of Th1/Th2 responses to <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> experimental infection in the absence of galectin-3. The intermediate resistance to the fungal infection presented by C57BL/6 mice, associated with the development of a mixed type of immunity, was replaced with susceptibility to infection and a Th2-polarized immune response, in galectin-3-deficient (gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice. Such a response was associated with defective inflammatory and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions, high IL-4 and GATA-3 expression and low nitric oxide production in the organs of infected animals. Gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages exhibited higher TLR2 transcript levels and IL-10 production compared to wild-type macrophages after stimulation with <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> antigens. We hypothesize that, during an <italic>in vivo P. brasiliensis</italic> infection, galectin-3 exerts its tuning role on immunity by interfering with the generation of regulatory macrophages, thus hindering the consequent Th2-polarized type of response.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</italic>, a thermally dimorphic fungus, is the etiological agent of human paracoccidioidomycosis, one of the most frequent systemic mycosis in Central and South America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Brummer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Franco1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

These investigations were performed by comparing the course of experimental infections in mice that were genetically deficient, or not, in galectin-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Bernardes1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Ferraz1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

On the other hand, during <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and <italic>Schistosoma mansonii</italic> infection, the absence of galectin-3 drives the development of a heightened Th1-type immune response, suggesting that the lectin exerts a profound effect on the development of the adaptive immune response against pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Bernardes1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Breuilh1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Together with results obtained from a murine model of asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Zuberi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, the studies provide consistent evidences that gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice develop a lower Th2 response but a higher Th1 response compared with gal3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice. In consequence, galectin-3 emerges as a fine regulator of Th1/Th2 balance.</p><p>Since protection against <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> infection depends on adequate inflammation, cellular immune response and cytokine production, and because galectin-3 is important in the regulation of the Th1/Th2 balance, the aim of this study was to analyze the immunological aspects of <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> infection in galectin-3-deficient (gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice. We demonstrate that gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice present increased susceptibility to <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> infection, associated with the inability to mount an adequate inflammatory response, the impairment of DTH response, high serum levels of specific antibodies, and the development of a Th2-polarized immune response. Such a picture is possibly due to the fact that, following contact with <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> antigens, macrophages from gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have higher TLR2 transcript levels and produce higher levels of the deactivating cytokine IL-10.

Macrophages from gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>R. equi</italic>-infected mice upregulate proinflammatory and TLR2 genes, which results in enhanced cell activation and in increased resistance to the bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Ferraz1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this report, we have observed that gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> peritoneal macrophages develop higher TLR2 mRNA expression, in comparison with the wild type macrophages, when merely elicited with thioglycollate broth. Following stimulation with <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> antigens, the TLR2 expression was remarkably greater in gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, compared to that observed in other experimental conditions. Under stimulation with fungal antigen or the intact yeast, higher levels of the deactivating cytokine IL-10 were produced by gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages. In many aspects our results are supported by the recent work of Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Ferreira1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> that shows that susceptible mice infected with <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> develop regulatory DCs, which display increased TLR2 gene expression and IL-10 production in the presence of the yeast. Our gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages behave similarly in the presence of the fungal antigens, and we hypothesize that the increased TLR2 expression is implicated in the higher IL-10 production and the generation of an ineffective immune response against <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic>. Studies with <italic>Candida albicans</italic> have shown that TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are more resistant to this infection, a fact associated with the decreased release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Netea1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the low inflammatory response observed in gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may be derived from the enhanced TLR2 expression and elevated IL-10 production in macrophages stimulated by the fungal antigens.</p><p>The present study is the first demonstration that galectin-3 deficiency may polarize the immune response toward a Th2 pattern. A critical role of galectin-3 on Th1/Th2 balance has been previously suggested by us <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Bernardes1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Ferraz1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Breuilh1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Zuberi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>T. gondii</italic> model has shown that galectin-3 leads to reduced organ inflammation and Th1-polarized immune response, which does not alter mice survival to the infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Bernardes1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. During schistosomiasis, gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice present a biased Th1 cellular and humoral immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Breuilh1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. By using a murine model of asthma, the occurrence of a lower Th2 response in gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, compared with gal3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice, has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004519-Zuberi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Our work adds new data; corroborating the idea that galectin-3 is a regulator of Th1/Th2 immunity. Because gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, during <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> infection, develop a Th2-polarized immune response and succumbed to infection, we conclude that galectin-3 is central to maintaining the intermediate resistance of C57BL/6 mice to <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic>, and the deletion of the galectin-3 gene renders mice susceptible to the fungal infection. Such susceptibility is associated with an unequivocal deviation toward a Th2-immune response, possibly triggered by macrophages over-expressing TLR2 and producing high IL-10 levels. Because the LPS stimulus (TLR4 agonist) induces IL-10 production that is not controlled by galectin-3, we suppose that our observations may be peculiar to fungal infections. A global idea of how susceptibility to <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> infection can be influenced by galectin-3 actions on the host cellular and humoral response is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004519-g008">figure 8</xref>. The results presented here, together with previous observations on the role exerted by galectin-3 in several infections, allow us to postulate that regulation of the Th1/Th2 balance by galectin-3 changes with the diversity of the initial responses triggered by different pathogens.</p><fig id="pone-0004519-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004519.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Possible role of galectin-3 during a fungal infection, as suggested by the immune response of gal3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to the inoculation of <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> yeasts.</title><p>Mice deficient for the galectin-3 gene were infected, and several aspects of the immune response mounted by these mice are summarized in the figure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004519.g008"/></fig></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Vani M.A. Correa, Sandra M.O.
