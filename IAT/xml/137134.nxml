GAGA and TTK share in common the presence of an N-terminal POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c2">2</xref>). POZ&#x0002f;BTB is a highly conserved structural motif that has been found in proteins participating in a variety of biological processes from the formation of ion-selective channels to the organisation of the cytoskeleton and the nuclear matrix, or the regulation of transcription (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c3">3</xref>). Typical of a structurally independent domain that plays specific functions, the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain is most frequently found in combination with other domains such as kelch repeats, ankryn repeats, transmembrane domains or zinc-finger domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c3">3</xref>). The POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain mediates protein&#x02013;protein interactions. In several proteins, the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain has been found to participate in the formation of homo-oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c7">7</xref>) and, based on <italic>in vitro</italic> co-expression experiments, it was proposed that POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains can also form hetero-oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c4">4</xref>). In addition, in several transcription factors, the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain was also shown to be involved in interactions with various co-repressor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c14">14</xref>). The POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of the human promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein was crystallised and its structure was solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c16">16</xref>). The crystal structure shows a tightly interwound dimer and, therefore, provides a general structural basis for the participation of POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains in homomeric interactions. Some features of the PLZF dimer are strongly reminiscent of an obligate homo-dimer. Dimerisation occurs through an extensive hydrophobic interface that involves approximately one quarter of the monomer accessible surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c16">16</xref>) and unfolding of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB dimer of PLZF occurs as a single coupled two-state transition that is irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c7">7</xref>). These considerations raise the question as to what extent POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains can actually support the formation of hetero-oligomers <italic>in vivo</italic>. On the other hand, heterophilic interactions with co-repressors were proposed to occur through a cluster of conserved residues that lie at a surface-exposed groove formed at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c16">16</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we report that GAGA519 and TTK69 isoforms interact <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>, both in yeast and Schneider S2 cells, and that their POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains are necessary and sufficient for this interaction to occur. Structural models that could account for this interaction are discussed. The various GAGA and TTK isoforms all share the corresponding POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c18">18</xref>) and, therefore, are likely to support similar GAGA&#x02013;TTK interactions. The potential contribution of this interaction to the regulation of transcription is also discussed. As with many <italic>Drosophila</italic> promoters, the <italic>even-skipped</italic> (<italic>eve</italic>) stripe 2 regulatory region contains several binding sites for GAGA and TTK which are in relatively close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c20">20</xref>), suggesting that the GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction described here might participate in its functional regulation. GAGA and TTK appear to have opposite effects on transcription. The expression of many genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is positively regulated by GAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c21">21</xref>) and it has been shown that GAGA acts as a transcription activator <italic>in vitro</italic>, or upon transient transfection in cultured S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c22">22</xref>). On the other hand, during early embryo development, TTK was shown to function as a transcription repressor of several pair-rule genes, including <italic>eve</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c25">25</xref>). Here, we show that GAGA activates transcription from the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter and that TTK inhibits this GAGA-dependent activation. Repression by TTK of the <italic>eve</italic> promoter depends on the presence of GAGA at the promoter and requires the contribution of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Proteins</title><p>The proteins used in these experiments correspond to GAGA519 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c18">18</xref>) and TTK69 forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c26">26</xref>). Several truncated peptides derived from them were constructed: &#x00394;POZ<sub>GAGA</sub> and &#x00394;POZ<sub>TTK</sub>, which are missing the first 122 and 115 residues of GAGA519 and TTK69, respectively, and POZ<sub>GAGA</sub> and POZ<sub>TTK</sub> which carry the first 122 and 114 residues of GAGA519 and TTK69, respectively.

When the preimmune serum was used, the IgG fraction was prepared. Incubation was performed at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 h. Twenty microlitres of Protein A&#x02013;Sepharose beads (Amersham) were then added and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 h.

The structure of the reporter plasmid carrying the 5&#x000d7;GAL4-<italic>hsp70</italic> promoter was described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c22">22</xref>). Seven micrograms of each reporter plasmid was co-transfected to S2 cells together with increasing amounts of pAct5CPPA vectors expressing GAGA519, TTK69, &#x00394;POZ<sub>TTK</sub>, &#x00394;POZ<sub>GAGA,</sub> GAL4Q or POZ<sub>GAGA</sub>GAL4Q as indicated in each case. GAL4Q was described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c22">22</xref>). POZ<sub>GAGA</sub>GAL4Q was constructed by fusing the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of GAGA (122 amino acids) to the N-terminus of GAL4Q using a 6&#x000d7;His-tag as linker. Three micrograms of pCMV&#x003b2;Gal plasmid (Stratagene) was added to the transfection mixture to allow correction for variations in transfection efficiencies. The total amount of plasmid added was adjusted to 20 &#x000b5;g by the addition of pAct5CPPA. Transfection was carried out by the calcium phosphate method. Cells were recovered 48 h after transfection and lysed according to the &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene reporter kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Luciferase activity was determined according to the luciferase activity assay kit (Promega) and normalised with respect to &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Model building</title><p>The models of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain complexes analysed in this study were built using the program MODELLER v.4, kindly provided by Dr Sali, which models protein structures by satisfying spatial restraints, starting from the extended polypeptide chain conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c27">27</xref>). For comparative modelling of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains, these restraints were derived from the aligned sequences of the modelled domains with that of PLZF, whose crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c16">16</xref>) was taken as a template (PDB no. 1buo).</p><p>Four kinds of models were built. For the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains of GAGA and TTK, homo-dimers were built using the whole crystallographic PLZF homo-dimer as template. No symmetry restraints were applied, so that each monomer was solely constrained to keep in the dimer, but not to have exactly the same conformation as its partner. A model of a putative GAGA&#x02013;TTK hetero-dimer was obtained following the same principles as for the homo-dimers. The models of GAGA and TTK homo-tetramers were built on the basis of the crystallographic PLZF tetramer, as observed in the same PDB entry indicated above. Again, no symmetry restraints were imposed to the monomers. Finally, a GAGA&#x02013;TTK hetero-tetramer was constructed by the same procedure, but using POZ<sub>GAGA</sub> and POZ<sub>TTK</sub> homo-dimers. The flexible loops that for GAGA and TTK lie in the exposed groove at the dimer interface, were generated by using internal co-ordinates from the CHARMM topology library included in MODELLER. All the models were refined by the program using thorough simulated annealing with molecular dynamics. During the modelling process the target structures were internally checked for their consistency with the restraints used to calculate them. Five models were generated in each round, and that with the best self-consistency score was selected.</p><p>Global analysis of the models was performed with the programs ProsaIIv.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c28">28</xref>), to assess the compatibility of residues with their environment, and WHATCHECK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c29">29</xref>), to elucidate its stereochemical correctness. Only the WHATCHECK packing quality scores were found to be significantly worse in the models, which was also reflected in slightly higher ProsaII <italic>z</italic>-scores. These values were, however, in the expected range for theoretical models. The sc program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c30">30</xref>) from the CCP4 suite was used to calculate the &#x02018;surface complementarity&#x02019; statistics, as well as to incorporate their values to the solvent accessible surface generated by GRASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c31">31</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>GAGA and TTK interact <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>The question of whether GAGA and TTK interact <italic>in vivo</italic> was addressed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed with total extracts prepared from Schneider S2 cells that were co-transfected with plasmids expressing GAGA519 and TTK69 forms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f1">1</xref>). Immunoprecipitation with &#x003b1;GAGA antibodies brings down a significant amount of TTK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f1">1</xref>A, lane 3). Under these conditions, GAGA complexes are efficiently immunoprecipitated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f1">1</xref>B, lane 2). In S2 cells, the majority of GAGA appears as two doublets of roughly the same intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c18">18</xref>). The doublet of slower electrophoretic migration corresponds to the endogenous GAGA581 form, while the species of fast mobility correspond to the GAGA519 form that was selectively overexpressed in these experiments. This co-immunoprecipitation is specific since no TTK was observed when immunoprecipitation was performed with an excess of preimmune serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f1">1</xref>A, lane 1). On the other hand, no significant amount of GAGA is detected when immunoprecipitation is carried out with &#x003b1;TTK antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f1">1</xref>B, lane 3) though, under these conditions, TTK is efficiently immunoprecipitated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f1">1</xref>A, lane 2). The lack of co-immunoprecipitation observed with &#x003b1;TTK antibodies might arise from their inability to recognise GAGA&#x02013;TTK complexes or the distortion of such complexes in their presence. As described below, the interaction of GAGA and TTK was corroborated by yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f2">2</xref>) and, <italic>in vitro</italic>, through GST pull-down assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains of GAGA and TTK are necessary and sufficient for GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction</title><p>The POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain defines a conserved structural motif of approximately 110&#x02013;120 residues that, in GAGA and TTK, is located at the N-terminus. The region of homology between the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains of GAGA and TTK extends up to residue 118 of the GAGA sequence (115 of the TTK sequence), showing an overall identity of 40&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c16">16</xref>). The contribution of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain to GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction was analysed with truncated proteins missing such a domain. The various constructs used in these experiments were designed according to the sequence comparison described above. &#x00394;POZ<sub>GAGA</sub> and &#x00394;POZ<sub>TTK</sub> are missing the first 122 and 115 residues of GAGA and TTK, respectively. Similarly, POZ<sub>GAGA</sub> and POZ<sub>TTK</sub> correspond to polypeptides containing the first 122 and 114 residues of GAGA and TTK.</p><p>The interaction between GAGA and TTK was analysed by yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f2">2</xref>). Significant growth on selective medium lacking histidine is observed when GAGA&#x02013; BD<sub><italic>GAL4</italic></sub> and TTK&#x02013;AD<sub><italic>GAL4</italic></sub> fusions are used as baits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f2">2</xref>A, row GAGA&#x02013;TTK), confirming the interaction between GAGA and TTK also in yeast cells. This interaction is strictly dependent on the presence of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains of GAGA and TTK. Deletion of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of GAGA fully abolishes its interaction with TTK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f2">2</xref>A, row &#x00394;POZ<sub>GAGA</sub>&#x02013;TTK) as, vice versa, deletion of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of TTK does (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f2">2</xref>A, row GAGA&#x02013;&#x00394;POZ<sub>TTK</sub>). On the other hand, the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains of GAGA and TTK are, by themselves, capable of interacting with TTK and GAGA, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f2">2</xref>A, rows POZ<sub>GAGA</sub>&#x02013;TTK and GAGA&#x02013; POZ<sub>TTK</sub>). Moreover, POZ<sub>GAGA</sub> and POZ<sub>TTK</sub> interact strongly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f2">2</xref>A, row POZ<sub>GAGA</sub>&#x02013;POZ<sub>TTK</sub>). These results were cor roborated when the interactions were analysed quantitatively through &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay (data not shown).</p><p>Similar results were obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> through GST pull-down assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f3">3</xref>).

On the other hand, GST&#x02013;GAGA does not bind &#x00394;POZ<sub>TTK</sub> efficiently (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f3">3</xref>B).</p><p>It was shown earlier that the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain also mediates the formation of GAGA&#x02013;GAGA homo-oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c32">32</xref>). As judged by yeast two-hybrid assays, TTK also forms homo-oligomers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f2">2</xref>B, row TTK&#x02013;TTK). Homomeric TTK&#x02013;TTK interaction is also dependent on the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain, which is necessary (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f2">2</xref>B, row &#x00394;POZ<sub>TTK</sub>&#x02013;TTK) and sufficient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f2">2</xref>B, rows POZ<sub>TTK</sub>&#x02013;TTK and POZ<sub>TTK</sub>&#x02013; POZ<sub>TTK</sub>) for the interaction to occur. Altogether, these results indicate that the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain, that mediates the formation of GAGA&#x02013;GAGA and TTK&#x02013;TTK homo-oligomers, is also responsible for GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>TTK inhibits GAGA-dependent activation of the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter element</title><p>The functional consequences of GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction were evaluated in the context of the <italic>eve</italic> promoter. In the cellular blastoderm, the pair-rule <italic>eve</italic> gene is expressed in seven defined stripes, each spanning five to six cells. It was shown that a truncated <italic>eve</italic> promoter spanning 1.7 kb of the region immediately upstream from the transcription start site carries the basal promoter elements, being sufficient to drive expression within the limits of stripe 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c19">19</xref>). This <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element was used to analyse the potential contribution of GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction to the regulation of transcription since it contains several binding sites for both GAGA and TTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c20">20</xref>). For this purpose, a plasmid carrying the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene was co-transfected into S2 cells with plasmids expressing GAGA and&#x0002f;or TTK. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f4">4</xref>A, overexpression of GAGA results in a significant activation of the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter. Luciferase activity increases upon increasing GAGA overexpression reaching a maximum activation of &#x0223c;15-fold when 4&#x02013;6 &#x000b5;g of the GAGA expressing vector is co-transfected. Activation of the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter by GAGA is efficiently repressed by overexpressing TTK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f4">4</xref>B). Luciferase activity is drastically reduced in the presence of 0.5 &#x000b5;g of the TTK-expressing plasmid, reaching background levels with just 2 &#x000b5;g of vector. As judged by western analysis (data not shown), the level of GAGA overexpression is not significantly reduced by overexpressing TTK, indicating that the decrease in luciferase activity observed in the presence of TTK reflects repression of the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter rather than a reduced expression of the activator, GAGA. TTK overexpression by itself does not affect the basal activity of the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter since no significant changes in luciferase activity are detected when TTK is overexpressed in the absence of GAGA overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f4">4</xref>C). Note that, in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f4">4</xref>C, luciferase activities are normalised with respect to the basal activity of the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter determined in the absence of any overexpressed protein. Actually, in S2 cells, the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter shows significant basal transcription activity. Luciferase activity produced by the pGL3 reporter plasmid is 250-fold higher in the presence of the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter than in its absence being, therefore, sufficiently high to eventually detect repression.</p></sec><sec><title>Repression by TTK of GAGA-dependent activation requires the contribution of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains of TTK and GAGA</title><p>The results reported above indicate that, in the experimental system described here, repression by TTK of the <italic>eve</italic> promoter depends on its activation by GAGA, suggesting that it actually involves direct interaction between the two proteins. In good agreement with this hypothesis, TTK repression of the GAGA-activated <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter depends on the presence of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain that, as shown above, mediates GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f4">4</xref>D, overexpression of &#x00394;POZ<sub>TTK</sub> does not interfere with GAGA-dependent activation. In these experiments, &#x00394;POZ<sub>TTK</sub> was expressed at equivalent levels as TTK, as judged by western blotting (data not shown). Reciprocal experiments were performed to analyse the contribution of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of GAGA but it turned out that &#x00394;POZ<sub>GAGA</sub> was not efficiently expressed in S2 cells (data not shown). The contribution of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of GAGA to repression by TTK was, however, demonstrated in a heterologous system. The C-terminal glutamine-rich domain of GAGA (Q domain) is known to be required for transcription activation both <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c22">22</xref>). Moreover, a heterologous protein, GAL4Q, carrying the DNA-binding domain of the yeast activator GAL4 fused to the Q domain of GAGA, was found to drive transcription from a 5&#x000d7;GAL4-<italic>hsp70</italic> promoter that contains five GAL4 binding sites inserted upstream of the minimal <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c22">22</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f5">5</xref>A, maximal activation is obtained in the presence of 1&#x02013;4 &#x000b5;g of the GAL4Q-expressing vector. A similar fusion protein, POZ<sub>GAGA</sub>GAL4Q, carrying the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of GAGA, activates transcription from the 5&#x000d7;GAL4-<italic>hsp70</italic> promoter to equivalent levels as GAL4Q, though, in this case, maximal activation occurs at a higher concentration of vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f5">5</xref>C). In this context, TTK represses transcription from the 5&#x000d7;GAL4-<italic>hsp70</italic> promoter when it is activated by POZ<sub>GAGA</sub>GAL4Q (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f5">5</xref>D). On the contrary, no repression is observed when the promoter is activated by GAL4Q (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f5">5</xref>B). TTK represses POZ<sub>GAGA</sub>GAL4Q as efficiently as GAGA; full repression is observed in the presence of 1&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;g of the TTK-expressing vector but a significant effect is detected with just 0.5 &#x000b5;g of vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f5">5</xref>D). Similar results were obtained when the ability of TTK to repress activation by GAL4VP16, which carries the acidic transactivation domain of VP16, was determined. Also in this case, TTK was unable to efficiently repress activation of the 5&#x000d7;GAL4-<italic>hsp70</italic> promoter by GAL4VP16 in the absence of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain (data not shown).</p><p>Altogether these results indicate that repression by TTK of GAGA-dependent activation requires the contribution of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of both TTK as well as GAGA and, therefore, strongly argue in favour of mechanisms involving direct GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we have reported the interaction of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factors GAGA and TTK. Based on <italic>in vitro</italic> co-translation, performed in a cell-free system, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, it was shown earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c4">4</xref>) that a truncated form of GAGA, carrying the first 245 residues, was capable of interacting <italic>in vitro</italic> with an epitope-tagged form of TTK, carrying the first 153 residues. The two truncated proteins tested in these experiments contain, in addition to the corresponding POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain, regions of significant length (127 residues for GAGA and 38 residues for TTK) that could also contribute to the interaction. Here, we have shown that GAGA and TTK actually interact <italic>in vivo</italic>, in yeast as well as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Moreover, our results unequivocally demonstrated, both <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as <italic>in vitro</italic>, the essential contribution of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain to GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction.</p><p>What sort of molecular interactions could account for the formation of GAGA&#x02013;TTK hetero-oligomers? The POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain, that mediates GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction, is also responsible for the formation of GAGA&#x02013;GAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c11">11</xref>) and TTK&#x02013;TTK homo-oligomers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f2">2</xref>B). Since POZ&#x0002f;BTB is a highly conserved domain, structural comparative models of those present in GAGA and TTK could be built from the crystal structure of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB dimer of PLZF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c16">16</xref>). Actually, the modelled structures of putative GAGA&#x02013;GAGA and TTK&#x02013;TTK homo-dimers bear a similar hydrophobic dimerisation interface as in the PLZF dimer, with a slightly lower complementarity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf570tb1">1</xref>). All the contacts involved in dimerisation are conserved and the central cavity is even more hydrophobic than in PLZF. These results strongly suggest that homomeric GAGA&#x02013;GAGA and TTK&#x02013;TTK interactions are likely to involve similar molecular interactions as those observed in the PLZF dimer. Moreover, similar models could also be built for heteromeric GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf570tb1">1</xref>), indicating that a putative GAGA&#x02013;TTK hetero-dimer would be stabilised by the same interactions involved in homomeric GAGA&#x02013;GAGA and TTK&#x02013;TTK interactions. The extensive dimerisation interface suggests, however, that POZ&#x0002f;BTB-containing proteins are obligated homo-dimers. Actually, there is no experimental evidence indicating that either GAGA or TTK could ever exist as monomers in solution (see below). A putative GAGA&#x02013;TTK hetero-dimer could, therefore, arise from the respective homo-dimers by swapping of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains. However, the extension and high hydrophobic character of the contacts involved in these interactions raise the question of whether such a domain-swapping model could actually account for heteromeric GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction. In this respect, it must be noted that the crystal structure of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of PLZF was solved independently by two different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c16">16</xref>) and, in spite of belonging to different crystallographic space groups, both structures showed conserved dimer&#x02013;dimer interactions, involving the extension of the &#x003b2;1&#x0002f;&#x003b2;5&#x02032;-sheet of one dimer towards the same region of the next one, keeping an antiparallel orientation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f6">6</xref>A). Eight hydrogen bonds connect main-chain atoms of the &#x003b2;1 chains of each dimer. Each dimer buries 700 &#x0212b;<sup>2</sup> in this interface, with a high complementarity score (Sc &#x0003d; 0.723) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf570tb1">1</xref>). To address the question of whether these dimer&#x02013;dimer interactions are also conserved in the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains of GAGA and TTK, we modelled GAGA and TTK homo-tetramers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f6">6</xref>B and C), as well as a GAGA&#x02013;TTK hetero-tetramer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf570f6">6</xref>D). The modelled tetramers have an interacting surface and complementarity similar to those of the PLZF homo-tetramer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf570tb1">1</xref>). The GAGA homo-tetramer and the GAGA&#x02013;TTK hetero-tetramer keep all the eight hydrogen bonds between the &#x003b2;1&#x0002f;&#x003b2;5&#x02032;-sheets, but the TTK homo-tetramer may lack those at the ends. These considerations raise the possibility that, rather than the formation of GAGA&#x02013;TTK hetero-dimers, GAGA&#x02013; TTK interaction would actually involve dimer&#x02013;dimer interactions through the &#x003b2;1&#x0002f;&#x003b2;5&#x02032;-sheets. GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction appears to be specific since, as it was found earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c4">4</xref>), TTK does not interact <italic>in vitro</italic> with the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domains of either ZID or ZF5. Interestingly, the &#x003b2;5-strand of the &#x003b2;1&#x0002f;&#x003b2;5&#x02032; motif is fully identical in GAGA and TTK, a feature not shared by any of the other POZ&#x0002f;BTB-containing proteins analysed. In the crystal of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of PLZF, this dimer&#x02013;dimer interaction propagates through the lattice, suggesting that it could give rise to the formation of multimers of higher stoichiometry. Actually, bacterially expressed TTK and GAGA, but not &#x00394;POZ<sub>GAGA</sub>, form <italic>in vitro</italic> oligomers of high apparent M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c6">6</xref>). On the other hand, dimer stability itself strongly relies on the &#x003b2;1&#x0002f;&#x003b2;5&#x02032;-sheets which, in PLZF, involve the formation of five main chain H-bonds between the &#x003b2;1 chain of one monomer and the &#x003b2;5&#x02032; chain of the second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c16">16</xref>). The only other contact that contributes to dimer formation involves the symmetry related &#x003b1;1&#x0002f;&#x003b1;1&#x02032; helices of each monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c16">16</xref>). Therefore, the &#x003b2;1 residues that could mediate dimer&#x02013;dimer interactions are themselves essential for dimerisation as it was found by mutational analysis of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of PLZF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c33">33</xref>).</p><p>GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction might play a role in the regulation of transcription. In the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, TTK was proposed to act as a maternally provided repressor of several pair-rule genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c23">23</xref>). Ectopic expression of TTK69 in blastoderm-stage embryos results in repression of several pair-rule genes, such as <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>fushi tarazu</italic> (<italic>ftz</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c25">25</xref>). GAGA, which is also maternally provided, activates the expression of <italic>ftz</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf570c34">34</xref>) and, as indicated by our results, it could also activate <italic>eve</italic> expression. We have shown here that TTK represses GAGA-dependent activation, but not basal activity, of the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 promoter. Repression by TTK of GAGA-dependent activation requires the contribution of the POZ&#x0002f;BTB domain of TTK as well as of GAGA, indicating that it actually involves direct GAGA&#x02013;TTK interaction. Several models could account for these results; GAGA&#x02013;TTK hetero-oligomers might not be capable of binding DNA or, alternatively, they might either actively participate in the recruitment of co-repressor complexes or interfere with loading, and&#x0002f;or assembly, of the activation complex at the promoter. Additional experiments are required to discriminate between these possibilities. Our results, however, indicate that neutralising the action of transcription activators, such as GAGA, might be a major determinant of the contribution of TTK to transcription repression.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf570f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Co-immunoprecipitation of GAGA and TTK.
