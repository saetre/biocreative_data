Here we show novel expression of SNAI1 and SNAI2 throughout mouse preimplantation development revealing asymmetrical localization of both SNAI1 and SNAI2 in individual blastomeres beginning at the 2-cell stage through to the 8-cell stage where SNAI1 and SNAI2 are then only detected in outer cells and not inner cells of the blastocyst.

We also applied Western Blot analysis, which revealed single and appropriate sized bands for SNAI1 and SNAI2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008530.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). Furthermore, a peptide pre-absorption assay was also performed for the Western blot analysis revealing that the SNAI1 and SNAI2 bands were no longer detectible using pre-absorbed antisera (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008530.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). These experiments conclusively show that the SNAI1 and SNAI2 antisera employed in this study are specific for SNAI1 and SNAI2, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study sought to characterize the expression of the <italic>Snai1</italic> and <italic>Snai2</italic> throughout preimplantation development. Our results have revealed a novel, asymmetrical protein distribution of SNAI1 and SNAI2 within the early preimplantation embryo. <italic>Snai1</italic> and <italic>Snai2</italic> transcripts are detectible throughout preimplantation development. SNAI1 and SNAI2 have variable expression at the 2-cell and 4-cell stage including asymmetrical and symmetrical localization within individual blastomeres. SNAI1 and SNAI2 are detected in the majority of blastomeres at the 8-cell stage, however, protein localization varies between blastomeres within a single embryo. SNAI1 and SNAI2 are then localized to the outer cells in the compacted embryo and are localized only in TE cells of the blastocyst.</p><p><italic>Snai1</italic> pattern of mRNA accumulation does not follow the general pattern of mRNA transcript expression throughout mouse preimplantation development where oogenetic transcripts are largely degraded by the 2-cell stage and then replaced by embryonic expression that drives transcript accumulation after the maternal-to-zygotic transition occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008530-Bell1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. This expression pattern supports a novel role for SNAI1 during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), as its expression is linked closely with the onset of the MZT. This is further supported by studies conducted in zebrafish that demonstrate an increase in <italic>Snai1</italic> transcript during the onset of MZT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008530-Hammerschmidt1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Snai2</italic> transcripts do decrease at the 2-cell stage and therefore more closely follow the typical MZT pattern of mRNA transcript abundance during mouse preimplantation development.</p><p>Asymmetrical protein localization in early embryonic blastomeres has been reported by Antczak and Blerkhome, 1997. They reported that Leptin and STAT3 were both asymmetrically expressed in the oocyte and after fertilization, were subsequently distributed unevenly to daughter blastomeres at the 4-cell and 8-cell stage. Consequently, Leptin and STAT3 became distributed in outer cells of the compacted embryo and then in select cells of the TE, leading to the hypothesis that Leptin and STAT3 distribution may contribute to lineage segregation. SNAI1 and SNAI2 are also asymmetrically localized, however, unlike Leptin and STAT3, are expressed in all cells of the 8-cell stage and are not asymmetrically expressed in the outer cells of the compacted embryo or TE of the blastocyst. One similarity is that SNAI1 and SNAI2, like STAT3 and Leptin are expressed in certain cells of the TE in the expanded blastocyst, but not all. It would be interesting to determine if STAT3 and Leptin expression coincided with SNAI1 and SNAI2 expression in the blastocyst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008530-Antczak1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In other vertebrates and invertebrates asymmetrical protein expression is more common (ex. Xenopus) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008530-Chan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Asymmetrical expression of proteins in other species plays a role in differentiation by the allocation of that protein to distinct cell lineages through subsequent cellular divisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008530-Chan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Lineage tracing studies would have to be performed to determine segregation of SNAI1 and SNAI2 between the 2-cell to 4-cell division in the mouse embryo. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that each blastomere at the 8-cell stage retains the ability to contribute to all cell lineages of the early embryo and thus is referred to as being &#x0201c;totipotent&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008530-Yamanaka1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results indicate that blastomeres at the 2-cell, 4-cell and 8-cell stages do not all localize SNAI1 or SNAI2 equally and thus while all early blastomeres may display totipotence, they are not all equivalent. This variable pattern of SNAI1 and SNAI2 localization may be regulated by the cell cycle as early blastomeres undergo asynchronous cell divisions. However, the asymmetrical SNAI1 and SNAI2 localization patterns within individual blastomeres cannot result from cell cycle variation between blastomeres and likely results from cytoskeletal based mechanisms within the cell.</p><p>Our data do not allow us to conclude that SNAI1 or SNAI2 are active contributors to cell fate decisions during preimplantation development, but certainly SNAI1 and SNAI2 are markers of cell fate decisions as their distribution patterns reflect the cell lineage decisions that occur during the first week of development. It is intriguing to propose that blastomeres displaying variable SNAI1 and SNAI2 localization patterns may divide in varying planes, which would produce an uneven inheritance of SNAI1 or SNAI2 to the daughter blastomeres, and thus contribute to cell fate decisions in the early embryo. Alternatively, blastomeres that have symmetrical distribution of SNAI1 or SNAI2 may divide radially, where both daughter blastomeres would inherit SNAI1 or SNAI2. Our studies will pursue the determination of the role(s) that SNAI1 and SNAI2 play in preimplantation development and possible cell fate decisions.</p><p>It has been proposed that blastomeres at the 2-cell stage are fated to contribute to the embryonic or abembryonic portion of the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008530-Bischoff1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, studies have suggested that 4-cell blastomeres are not equally pluripotent due to the manner in which 2-cell blastomeres cleave resulting in an uneven distribution of products across the blastomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008530-TorresPadilla1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results demonstrate that SNAI1 and SNAI2 are unevenly distributed at the 2-cell stage and the 4-cell stage, however, careful analysis has demonstrated that SNAI1 and SNAI2 can be found in all blastomeres at the 4-cell stage regardless of blastomere position. Furthermore, SNAI1 and SNAI2 are expressed in all blastomeres at the uncompacted 8-cell stage and are expressed in all outer cells of the compacted embryo and in both the abembryonic and embryonic portions of the TE in the expanded blastocyst.</p><p>This study reveals asymmetrical distribution of SNAI1 and SNAI2 as early as the 2-cell and 4-cell stage of preimplantation development, far earlier than previously thought. Not only are SNAI1 and SNAI2 asymmetrically distributed within early cleavage stage blastomeres but their expression is lost in the ICM coincident with cell lineage specification and the formation of outer and inner cell lineages in the early embryo. This may indicate that SNAI1 and SNAI2 may contribute to cell polarization and epithelial cell differentiation. Collectively, this study provides novel insight into the potential role of SNAI1 and SNAI2 in development and cancer metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Collection of Preimplantation Embryos</title><p>Mouse embryos were obtained from random-bred MF1 females superovulated with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and mated with CD1 males.
