A powerful method of reverse genetics in mammals is gene knockout by homologous recombination, which mutates a gene to prevent its functional expression.

It has been used to reveal gene functions in normal as well as in pathogenic pathways in vivo, and to generate models for many genetic disorders. However, the technical complexity, lengthy process, and high cost have limited its broad application. This is particularly problematic considering the fact that of the ~30,000 currently known mouse genes, only 10&#x00025; have been knocked out, and even fewer are readily accessible by the research community &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, the knockout technology, in most instances, generates animals with ~50&#x00025; or 0&#x00025; expression of the target gene, and it is difficult to create graded hypomorphic models, which may be necessary for modeling some diseases. In addition, the knockout technology is not well established in other mammalian species, consequently limiting the investigation of gene functions and the development of disease models in other mammalian species. These limitations may be overcome by RNA interference (RNAi) technology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>RNAi is a widely conserved mechanism in eukaryotes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in cells, RNAi destroys the target RNA that shares sequence homology with the dsRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The mechanism of RNAi is not fully understood. A simplified model based mainly on data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> has the following steps: First, Dicer, an enzyme of the RNase III family, initiates ATP-dependent fragmentation of long dsRNA into 21- to 25-nucleotide double-stranded fragments, called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Second, the siRNA duplexes bind the proteins Dicer and R2D2, which facilitate the formation of a siRNA/multiprotein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading complex. Third, the siRNA duplex in the RISC loading complex unwinds to form an active RISC that contains a single-stranded RNA (called the guide strand). Fourth, the RISC recognizes the target RNA by Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairing with the guide strand and cleaves the target RNA. Finally, the RISC releases its cleaved product and goes on to catalyze a new cycle of target recognition and cleavage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In differentiated mammalian cells, long dsRNA activates RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR and type I interferon response, which leads to a nonspecific global translation depression and apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. However, this nonspecific reaction can be circumvented by introduction of synthetic siRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, which can go into the RNAi pathway much like the siRNAs produced from long dsRNA can. Alternatively, RNAi may be triggered by a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) synthesized from gene constructs with RNA polymerase III (Pol III) or Pol II promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. The Pol III&#x02013;synthesized shRNA is exported by exportin 5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, where it is processed by Dicer to generate siRNA, which goes into the RNAi pathway and mediates gene silencing. The Pol II&#x02013;expressed shRNA mimics micro RNAs (miRNAs) and has one additional step of processing before nuclear export: it is synthesized as a long Pol II transcript &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; and is processed by the microprocessor complex that contains Drosha and Pasha to produce the shRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The simplicity and specificity of RNAi has made RNAi a routine tool for investigation of gene functions in invertebrates and mammalian cells. Attempts have also been made to develop RNAi as an in vivo reverse genetics tool in mice. An early experiment directly injected long dsRNA into mouse embryonic stem cells. Successful knockdown and the phenotype of the gene deletion were observed in embryogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. This approach can produce only transient inhibition of target gene expression. Another experiment used an oocyte-specific promoter to express a long hairpin (~500 bp) against c-Mos and demonstrated the expected phenotypes in oogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Both approaches cannot be applied widely because of the toxicity associated with long dsRNA in differentiated somatic cells.</p><p>With the advent of Pol III promoter-directed synthesis of shRNAs, several groups engineered transgenic mice using Pol III&#x02013;shRNA constructs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b018">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. In all cases, knockdown of the marker transgene GFP in neonates was reported. In two cases, phenotypes resembling genetic knockouts were observed in developing mouse embryos &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; and hematopoietic stem cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, Cre-lox&#x02013;inducible Pol III promoters have been demonstrated to knock down target genes and induce phenotypes of gene deficiency in developing mouse embryos &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b024">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the success rate of gene knockdown and phenotypic expression is low using Pol III constructs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;; despite the improvements using approaches employing targeted insertion in embryonic stem cells and tetraploid blastocyst complementation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, widespread knockdown and phenotypes of gene deletion that develop in postnatal animals have not been demonstrated.</p><p>In addition to Pol III, Pol II can also direct shRNA synthesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; and mediate efficient silencing in cultured cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Compared with Pol III promoters, Pol II promoter-directed synthesis of shRNAs can be advantageous for transgenic RNAi. Although limited choices of Pol III promoters have been developed to express shRNA, a large repertoire of Pol II promoters, including temporally and spatially specific and inducible promoters, have been successfully used in transgenic mice. In addition, the current Pol III strategies rely on the availability of various Cre transgenic mouse lines for shRNA induction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b024">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. These Cre transgenic lines do not exist in other mammalian species. Therefore, the application of this Pol III strategy in other mammalian species is currently impractical. Recent evidence indicates that miRNAs, the endogenous form of shRNAs, are downstream of Pol II promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d; and are expressed by Pol II activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b032">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, strategies using Pol II&#x02013;directed synthesis of shRNA mimic the natural miRNA synthesis and could be an efficient RNAi strategy in vivo.</p><p>To test this idea, we used a construct that is composed of a human ubiquitin C promoter and an shRNA with the human miRNA miR-30a structure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; to generate transgenic mice. We targeted the shRNA against the mouse Mn superoxide dismutase <italic>(Sod2)</italic> gene, because <italic>Sod2</italic>-null mice generated by standard knockout technology have striking postnatal phenotypes that have been well characterized &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b035">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. This Pol II strategy expressed siRNA widely in different tissues, knocked down the <italic>Sod2</italic> gene expression, and induced SOD2-hypomorphic phenotype. In addition, bigenic heterozygous mice generated by crossing the two independent transgenic lines showed phenotypes typical of the SOD2-null mouse, including slow growth, fatty liver, dilated cardiomyopathy, and premature death. Thus, this Pol II RNAi strategy can be an alternative to gene knockout technology and opens the door of RNAi to a wide array of Pol II transgenic strategies to investigate gene functions in mice and other mammalian species.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>The construct UbC-SOD2hp-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g001">Figure 1</xref>; also see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;) consists of the human ubiquitin C promoter, an shRNA-coding hairpin placed in the first intron, followed by the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) coding sequence and a poly-adenylation signal. The shRNA-coding hairpin mimics human microRNA miR-30a structure and target mouse <italic>Sod2</italic> mRNA. Using this construct, we generated transgenic mice by pronuclear injection of fertilized eggs. Screening of 62 founders yielded five positive lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Northern blots showed that two of the five lines (lines 8 and 26) expressed siRNA broadly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g001">Figures 1</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g001">1</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020010-sg001">S1</xref>A) and this expression was stable over multiple generations and during aging (the same level of expression was observed in animals from 40 to 200 d old; unpublished data). By real-time PCR line 8 carried a single copy of the transgene while line 26 carried three copies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020010-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). The transgene copy number did not predict the level of siRNA levels since line 8 had a higher level of siRNA than line 26 (see below).</p><p>The pattern of expression in transgenic mice differed from the pattern in cultured cells in two regards: none of these transgenic lines expressed detectable EGFP and shRNA (only siRNA was detected). This contrasts with what we observed in cultured cells, in which both were detectable &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Nevertheless, the siRNA knocked down the abundance of SOD2 as indicated by the decreased levels of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g001">Figures 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020010-sg001">S1</xref>B), mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g001">Figures 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020010-sg001">S1</xref>C), and enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). The rapid processing of pre-miRNA in vivo probably caused the lack of shRNA detection. This explanation is consistent with the lack of pre-miRNA detection for other endogenous miRNAs in mammalian cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. The lack of EGFP was puzzling. One possibility was that the transgene was altered. This was ruled out by sequencing the transgene extracted by PCR, which revealed no alteration in the transgene structure. Another possibility was that the pri-miRNA processing in vivo was highly efficient, so that the processing of pri-miRNA occurred before the splicing, and, consequently, the mRNA could not be properly spliced and exported to the cytoplasm for EGFP expression. The processing of pri-miRNA involves Drosha &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, if our hypothesis was correct, inhibition of Drosha expression should lead to EGFP expression. To test this, we transduced fibroblasts isolated from the skeletal muscle of the transgenic mice using a recombinant adenovirus that expresses an shRNA against Drosha. By RT-PCR the Drosha mRNA levels were substantially reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020010-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A), indicating the effectiveness of the shRNA. While the nontransduced cells showed no detectable EGFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020010-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020010-sg003">S3</xref>C), the transduced cells expressed EGFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020010-sg003">Figure S3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020010-sg003">S3</xref>E). This result supports our hypothesis.</p><p>To confirm the knockdown of <italic>Sod2</italic> gene expression, we examined the in vivo consequence of SOD2 deficiency. First, we compared the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) between the transgenic and wild-type animals, because SOD2 knockout is known to cause a decrease in SDH activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. We stained tissue sections from the heart using histochemical staining, and observed a decrease in the staining intensity in line 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g002">2</xref>B). Second, we isolated fibroblasts from skeletal muscle and measured the levels of superoxide in these cells. We observed that the superoxide levels were increased in the two transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This increase was higher in line 8 than in line 26, and, therefore, was correlated with the degree of SOD2 knockdown (see below). Third, we tested the sensitivity of the fibroblasts to oxidative stress induced by t-butylhydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) treatment. Fibroblasts from transgenic line 8 showed a higher sensitivity than the wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g002">Figure 2</xref>D), consistent with the lowered levels of SOD2 protein in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). To ensure that the enhanced sensitivity was caused by the knockdown of SOD2 expression, we transduced the fibroblasts with a recombinant adenovirus that expressed a <italic>Sod2</italic> gene whose mRNA was resistant to the siRNA expressed by the transgene. Expression of this SOD2 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g002">Figure 2</xref>E) rescued the cells from their hypersensitivity to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p><p>Based on these data, we conclude that ubiquitin C promoter&#x02013;directed shRNA synthesis effectively silenced the target molecule in transgenic mice. Despite this significant knockdown (by 60&#x00025;&#x02013;90&#x00025;) in all the tissues examined and the evidence of functional SOD2 deficiency, the two transgenic lines were viable to 400 d (observed to date). SOD2-null phenotypes, including small body size, dilated cardiomyopathy, lipid deposition in liver and heart, and premature death, were not observed. To determine whether knockout phenotypes could be generated, we crossed the two lines that expressed the siRNA to generate bigenic heterozygous transgenic mice. We took this approach because it was advantageous compared with generating homozygous animals of each lines, the phenotype of which could be complicated by the potential gene disruption at the transgene insertion site.</p><p>The line 8/26 bigenic mice expressed a higher level of siRNA than either of the singly transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), leading to knockdown of SOD2 protein and mRNA to nearly undetectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g003">3</xref>C). These mice exhibited phenotypes similar to the previously reported SOD2 knockout mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, including smaller body size than the wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) and death within 20 d after birth (in 34 bigenic animals that we obtained so far).

This raises the possibility that interferon response might be responsible for the phenotype observed in these mice. To test this, we examined the levels of two genes known to be dramatically induced by the dsRNA-triggered interferon response, 2&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 <italic>(OSA1),</italic> and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 <italic>(STAT1)</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Real-time PCR analysis of the mRNA of <italic>OSA1</italic> and <italic>STAT1</italic> failed to detect changes in the expression levels of these two genes in the heart, spleen, and liver in the transgenic line 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020010-g005">Figure 5</xref>), indicating no interferon response in these transgenic mice.</p><p>Taken together, the phenotypes are likely caused by the specific effect of SOD2 knockdown because (1) the siRNA was expressed widely; (2) the consequences of SOD2 deficiency were observed in the transgenic mice; (3) in cells isolated from these mice the hypersensitivity to oxidative stress was corrected by the <italic>Sod2</italic> gene that was resistant to the siRNA; (4) the phenotype typical of the SOD2-null mouse was observed when siRNA levels were increased in the bigenic 8/26 mice; and (5) levels of OSA1 and STAT1<italic>,</italic> two molecules involved in the dsRNA-induced interferon response, were unchanged. These results demonstrate that Pol II&#x02013;mediated expression of shRNA in transgenic mice can be used to investigate gene functions in mammals.</p><p>Thus, the Pol II&#x02013;directed synthesis of shRNA can be an alternative to gene knockout technology for reverse genetics in mammals. Although gene knockout remains a useful approach for the complete gene deletion or gene modification, our RNAi approach can achieve near knockout conditions and is economical in cost and time. In addition, the construct design is simple and in principle not different from the standard transgene design for gene overexpression. The placement of the shRNA-encoding hairpin is flexible: it can be placed in introns or in the 3&#x02032; untranslated regions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, and the shRNA-encoding transcript is not required to encode a protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, a wide variety of transgene promoters that have already been successfully used to overexpress genes in transgenic mice can be readily adapted for suppressing the genes. When spatially and temporally specific promoters are used, controlled suppression of the target gene can be achieved. Furthermore, this approach provides a more flexible system to model hypomorphic allele function. While the standard knockout technology reduces the target gene expression to 50&#x00025; or 0&#x00025; in most instances, transgenic RNAi can reduce the target gene to more variable degrees in different lines of transgenic mice or by induction using small molecules in transgenic mice made with inducible Pol II promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. The simplicity of this approach can accelerate the generation of models for diseases that are caused by various degrees of genetic hypomorphism, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, various cancers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, and other diseases. Finally, gene knockout by homologous recombination has not been established in other mammalian species. Current Pol III strategies rely on the crosses with numerous Cre-expression transgenic mouse lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b024">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020010-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, which are not available in other mammalian species.
