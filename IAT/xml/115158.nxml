In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> it is found in at least 15 different locations of tRNA. Uridines at positions 13, 27, 28, 31, 32, 38, 39 and 55 are almost always or frequently modified to pseudouridines, while other positions, including 1, 26, 34, 35, 36, 65 and 67, are rarely modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c1">1</xref>). A family of enzymes, the tRNA:pseudouridine synthases, catalyzes the conversion of uridine into pseudouridine residues in tRNA molecules. In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> &#x003a8;<sub>13</sub>, &#x003a8;<sub>32</sub> and &#x003a8;<sub>55</sub> are formed by three distinct activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c2">2</xref>), whereas a single enzyme (Pus1p) is responsible for &#x003a8; formation at positions 27, 28, 34 and 36, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>). In addition, Pus1p is implicated in the formation of &#x003a8; at positions 26, 65 and 67 <italic>in vivo</italic> and at position 35 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (sc) Pus1p, together with scPus2p and mouse (m)Pus1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c5">5</xref>), form a subfamily of pseudouridine synthases that is related in sequence to scPus3p&#x0002f;Deg1p, the enzyme responsible for the formation of &#x003a8;<sub>38</sub> and &#x003a8;<sub>39</sub> and the true homolog of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> synthase TruA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c6">6</xref>). scPus1p and mPus1p have similar substrate specificities while the target RNAs of scPus2p have not yet been determined. Surprisingly, scPus1p also converts uridines at position 44 in U2 small nuclear (sn)RNA and is therefore the first yeast pseudouridine synthase characterized so far which exhibits a dual substrate specificity, acting both on tRNA and snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c7">7</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that scPus1p contains a zinc atom that is essential for tRNA binding, the structural requirements of which have also been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c9">9</xref>). The other &#x003a8; synthases that have been characterized so far in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> include Pus4p, a member of the TruB family that catalyzes the formation of &#x003a8;<sub>55</sub> in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c10">10</xref>), Pus5p, a member of the RluA family that modifies yeast mitochondrial 21S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c11">11</xref>), and Cbf5p, a component of snoRNPs involved in the formation of the &#x003a8; residues in 18S and 25S rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Despite the abundance of &#x003a8; residues in yeast tRNAs, the function of these modifications remains unclear and none of the four known yeast tRNA &#x003a8; synthases (Pus1p&#x02013;Pus4p) is essential for viability, at least under normal growth conditions. However, genetic experiments have implicated scPus1p in the nuclear export of tRNA. <italic>PUS1</italic> was originally identified by its ability to complement a mutation that was synthetically lethal to a thermosensitive allele of the essential nucleoporin Nsp1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>). The synthetic lethality of the mutant strain had actually been due to a combination of mutations in three genes: <italic>NSP1</italic>, <italic>LOS1</italic> und <italic>PUS1</italic>. Los1p, as well as its human homolog Xpo-t, associates with the nuclear pores and acts as an exportin for tRNA, i.e. it can mediate the nuclear export of tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c21">21</xref>). A deletion of either <italic>LOS1</italic> or <italic>PUS1</italic> does not result in a growth defect for yeast cells, whereas combined disruption of both genes causes slow cell growth at 30&#x000b0;C as well as a thermosensitive phenotype, i.e. lack of viability at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>). This genetic interaction suggests that pseudouridinylation of tRNA residues by Pus1p could be a prerequisite for efficient nuclear export of tRNA molecules.</p><p>Pus1p has so far been characterized in only two species, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and mouse, and this makes sequence as well as phylogenetic analysis of this enzyme difficult. In order to identify a functional homolog in an additional organism we took advantage of the thermosensitive phenotype of the <italic>los1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pus1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant and searched for <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> genes that could act as high copy suppressors of this phenotype. With this approach we expected to identify <italic>S.pombe</italic> orthologs of either scPus1p or scLos1p. Indeed, we were able to clone the cDNA of a protein that represents, as shown by sequence homology and functional analysis, the <italic>S.pombe</italic> (sp)Pus1p.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, media and plasmids</title><p>The following yeast strains were used in this work: Y572 (MAT<bold>a</bold><italic>ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 pus1</italic>::<italic>HIS3</italic>); Y680 (MAT<bold>a</bold><italic>ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 los1</italic>::<italic>HIS3 pus1</italic>::<italic>HIS3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>). Cells were grown in YPD rich medium or synthetic SDC medium containing the necessary amino acids and nutrients. For counter selection of cells containing <italic>URA3</italic> plasmids 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) (Toronto Research Chemicals) was used at 1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml. The following plasmids were used: pFL61 (2&#x000b5;, <italic>URA3</italic>) contains a cDNA insert of <italic>S.pombe</italic> under control of the <italic>S.cerevisiae PGK1</italic> promoter and terminator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c22">22</xref>); pRS315 (<italic>CEN&#x0002f;ARS</italic>, <italic>LEU2</italic>); pRS426 (2&#x000b5;, <italic>URA3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c23">23</xref>). Vectors containing the precursor of yeast tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> (anticodon UAU), yeast tRNA<sup>Trp</sup> (anticodon CCA) and yeast tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (anticodon GUA), as used in the present work, were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> cDNA encoding spPus1p</title><p>An aliquot of 100 OD<sub>600</sub> units of an overnight culture of the thermosensitive yeast strain Y680 (<italic>los1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pus1</italic>&#x00394;) in YPD liquid medium was transformed with 10 &#x000b5;g <italic>S.pombe</italic> cDNA library inserted into pFL61, according to the lithium acetate method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c25">25</xref>). Transformed cells were streaked on 20 SDC-ura plates and incubated for 5 h at room temperature and for 6 days at 37&#x000b0;C. Growing colonies were re-streaked on SDC-ura plates and incubated for 3 days at 37&#x000b0;C. After two rounds of selection, the remaining clones were made ura<sup>&#x02013;</sup> by growth on 5-FOA-containing plates and tested for reappearance of the thermosensitive phenotype. The plasmid DNA of all the positive clones was isolated and the cDNA insert size was determined by restriction analysis with <italic>Not</italic>I. The screening strain was transformed with the recovered plasmids in order to confirm complementation of the thermosensitive phenotype. Three complementing plasmids (SP79, SP88 and SP130) with <italic>Not</italic>I cDNA inserts of identical length (1.9 kb) and identical restriction patterns were further analyzed. The cDNA insert was subcloned into vector pRS315 and sequenced by the dideoxy method.

This manipulation allowed cloning of the ORF into a modified pET (pET-HIS6&#x0002f;pET8c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c26">26</xref>) vector cut with <italic>Xho</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Mlu</italic>I and created an in-frame fusion protein of six histidine residues joined by a Ser-Ser spacer dipeptide to the amino acid immediately after the start methionine. The vector containing the fusion gene was transformed into <italic>E.coli</italic> BL21 cells. A 1 l culture was grown in minimal medium at 37&#x000b0;C to OD 0.7 and induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG. The bacterial cell pellet was lysed by sonication in 10 ml of lysis buffer (LB) &#x0005b;50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Complete, EDTA-free; Boehringer Mannheim)&#x0005d;. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and applied to a Ni&#x02013;NTA resin column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) which was then washed with lysis buffer lacking Triton X-100 but containing 20 mM imidazole. spPus1p was purified to near homogeneity by elution with 250 mM imidazole in lysis buffer lacking Triton X-100. To ensure further removal of contaminants the Ni&#x02013;NTA eluate was dialysed against Mono Q buffer (20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 10&#x00025; glycerol, pH 8.0) and applied to a Mono Q HR 5&#x0002f;5 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer. spPus1p was eluted with &#x0223c;250 mM NaCl, peak fractions were concentrated to 1 mg&#x0002f;ml, glycerol was added to 50&#x00025; and aliquots were frozen and kept at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C. In all purification steps the identity of the purified protein band was verified by western blotting using monoclonal antibodies (BAbCO, CA) against the His<sub>6</sub> tag. The enzyme was used for 3 months without apparent loss of activity. Recombinant His-tagged scPus1p was prepared as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c8">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Pseudouridine formation assay <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Pseudouridine synthase activity of purified recombinant spPus1p was tested at 30&#x000b0;C and compared under identical experimental conditions to that of recombinant scPus1p.

After incubation the pseudouridine content in the radiolabeled transcripts was analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c3">3</xref>). In brief, the RNA was extracted with phenol&#x0002f;chloroform, precipitated with ethanol and then completely hydrolyzed to 3&#x02032;-nucleotide monophosphates by RNase T2 (&#x02018;nearest neighbor&#x02019; analysis). Each hydrolyzate was chromatographed on 2-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates and radioactivity in the spots was evaluated after exposure to a PhosphorImager screen.</p></sec><sec><title>Tagging of spPus1p with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and localization in yeast cells</title><p>To tag spPus1p with GFP at the N-terminus, the <italic>spPUS1</italic> ORF was amplified by PCR from vector pRS315-spPUS1 using two primers that created an in-frame <italic>Pst</italic>I restriction site after the ATG start codon and a <italic>Hin</italic>dIII restriction site in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region of the gene (sense, TTTTT<underline>CTGCAG</underline>GGACGTGGTGGTAAACGC; antisense, TTTTT<underline>AAGCTT</underline>GTATATTGCACCATACGGTC; restriction sites underlined).

Therefore, the thermosensitive <italic>los1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pus1</italic>&#x00394; strain was transformed with a <italic>S.pombe</italic>-derived cDNA library and thermoresistant clones were isolated and analyzed by plasmid recovery. After passing all false positive tests (see Materials and Methods), three complementing plasmids with <italic>S.pombe</italic> cDNA inserts were obtained that were capable of restoring the viability of the <italic>los1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pus1</italic>&#x00394; strain at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f1">1</xref>A). Restriction analysis of these three clones (SP79, SP88 and SP130) showed that they contained identical cDNA inserts of &#x0223c;1.9 kb. The nucleotide sequence of the SP79 insert was determined by dideoxy sequencing and primer walking. The 1902&#x000a0;bp long cDNA insert could be completely aligned with a part of cosmid c126 derived from chromosome III of <italic>S.pombe</italic>. Two predicted introns for the uncharacterized genomic sequence could be confirmed, the first 65 bp and the second 39&#x000a0;bp long, at positions 1116 and 1472 of the cDNA, respectively. Both introns have the typical 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-splice consensus elements (GTAAGTA and TAG) and are absent in the cDNA fragment we cloned. Starting at position 40, the cDNA contains a complete 1605 bp long ORF that codes for a 534 amino acid long polypeptide (EMBL ID&#x0002f;accession no. SPO251329&#x0002f;AJ251329). This protein was named spPus1p (for <italic>S.pombe</italic><underline>p</underline>seudo<underline>u</underline>ridine <underline>s</underline>ynthase <underline>1</underline>), because of its sequence homology to two previously characterized eukaryotic tRNA modification enzymes, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> pseudouridine synthase 1 (scPus1p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>) and mouse pseudouridine synthase 1 (mPus1p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c5">5</xref>). An alignment of these three proteins is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f1">1</xref>B. This sequence comparison shows that there are two blocks of high sequence identity. The first one, containing 124 amino acids (42&#x02013;165 in spPus1), defines an N-terminal domain which is positively charged in all three proteins, with a pI between 9.2 and 10. The second one, containing 160 amino acids (314&#x02013;473 in spPus1), comprises a C-terminal domain and is also very basic, at least in the case of the two yeast proteins (pI 10.1&#x02013;10.3). The two highly conserved N- and C-termimal domains are separated by a non-conserved linker sequence of variable length which is short in the mammalian protein (11 amino acids) but long and acidic (pI 4.6) in the cases of scPus1p and spPus1p (90 and 148 amino acids, respectively). SpPus1 also shares significant homology with other uncharacterized ORFs in <italic>S.pombe</italic> and other species (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant spPus1p exhibits tRNA:pseudouridine synthase activity</title><p>The fact that spPus1p can complement the thermosensitive phenotype of the <italic>S.cerevisiae los1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pus1</italic>&#x00394; strain as well its sequence homology to scPus1p indicate that spPus1p may have pseudouridine synthase activity. To show this experimentally, we tested whether recombinant spPus1p exhibits a similar enzymatic activity to recombinant scPus1p. The <italic>spPU</italic>S<italic>1</italic> ORF was tagged at its N-terminal end with six histidines and expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>. A single protein with the expected molecular weight of His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;spPusp1 could be purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> whole cell lysates by two chromatographic steps (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f2">2</xref>A). The activity of this recombinant spPus1p, as well as recombinant scPus1p, was tested in parallel using various transcripts of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> tRNA as substrates. From earlier experiments with recombinant scPus1p we knew that the precursor of yeast tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> (which contains a 60 nt long intron) allowed intron-dependent formation of &#x003a8;<sub>34</sub> and &#x003a8;<sub>36</sub> as well as intron-independent formation of &#x003a8;<sub>27</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>). Taking advantage of the fact that both uridines U<sub>34</sub> and U<sub>36</sub> are followed by A, while &#x003a8; at position 27 is followed by C in the sequence of pre-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>, the formation of pseudouridines at position 27 and positions 34 and 36 can be monitored independently by using appropriate &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP- or &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;CMP-radiolabeled transcripts and T2 digestion prior to TLC (see Material and Methods). To monitor the formation of &#x003a8;<sub>28</sub> we used &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;CMP-radiolabeled yeast tRNA<sup>Trp</sup> and to monitor the formation of intron-dependent &#x003a8;<sub>35</sub> we used &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;AMP-radiolabeled yeast tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> bearing a 14 nt long intron (for the structures of the tRNA substrates see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c3">3</xref>).</p><p>The formation of &#x003a8;<sub>28</sub>, &#x003a8;<sub>34</sub> and &#x003a8;<sub>36</sub> by recombinant spPus1p is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f2">2</xref>B, while Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f2">2</xref>C shows the quantitation of all the results as the molar amount of pseudouridine formed per mole of tRNA, in the presence of increasing amounts of recombinant scPus1p or spPus1p and using as substrates the tRNAs mentioned above. Control experiments with yeast tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> or yeast tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, which normally contain &#x003a8; residues at positions 13, 32 and 55 or 39 and 55, respectively, but are not modified by recombinant scPus1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c3">3</xref>), gave no trace of pseudouridine formation even at the highest concentration of recombinant spPus1p tested (data not shown). These results demonstrate that spPus1p is capable of forming &#x003a8; at positions 27, 28, 34, 35 and 36, the efficiency of the modification being dependent on the position of the uridine in the tRNA molecules. While formation of &#x003a8;<sub>27</sub> in yeast tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> is catalyzed very efficiently by both spPus1p and scPus1p even at low enzyme concentrations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f2">2</xref>C, panel a), the formation of &#x003a8;<sub>28</sub>, &#x003a8;<sub>34&#x0002b;36</sub> and &#x003a8;<sub>35</sub> in yeast tRNA<sup>Trp</sup>, yeast tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and yeast tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, respectively, is catalyzed less efficiently by spPus1p than by scPus1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f2">2</xref>C, panels b&#x02013;d, respectively). This difference in efficiency most likely reflects the fact that the <italic>S.pombe</italic> enzyme is acting on <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> tRNAs, which may therefore be recognized and bound less strongly. The ability of spPus1p to form &#x003a8; at position 27 was also confirmed by testing cell extracts of the <italic>S.cerevisiae pus1</italic>&#x00394; strain transformed with a plasmid expressing spPus1p (data not shown). In summary, our results demonstrate that spPus1p, as predicted from its sequence, has tRNA:pseudouridine synthase activity and exhibits a substrate specificity which is identical <italic>in vitro</italic> to the substrate specificity of scPus1p. Therefore, spPus1p can be considered as the true ortholog of scPus1p.</p></sec><sec><title>spPus1p is imported efficiently into the nucleus of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic></title><p>The finding that scPus1p, which is an exclusively intranuclear protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c15">15</xref>), could be functionally replaced by the <italic>S.pombe</italic> enzyme indicated that spPus1p could also enter the nucleus when expressed in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> cells. In order to show that, we localized spPus1p in budding yeast cells that lacked endogenous scPus1p. To facilitate the localization, spPus1p was tagged at the N-terminus with GFP. This fusion protein could be expressed stably in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, as shown by western blot analysis of total cell extracts using antibodies against the GFP moiety, and was functional because it could complement thermosensitive growth of the <italic>los1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pus1</italic>&#x00394; budding yeast strain (data not shown). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f3">3</xref>, when GFP&#x02013;spPus1p was expressed in <italic>pus1</italic>&#x00394; budding yeast cells the fluorescence signal was restricted to an area that corresponded to the nucleus, while the cytoplasm and the vacuole, which were clearly discernable by phase contrast, were devoid of signal. Similar nuclear localization was also observed when GFP&#x02013;spPus1p was expressed in wild-type <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> cells (data not shown). Therefore, it can be concluded that the Pus1p nuclear localization signal and import pathway are conserved between budding and fission yeast cells and that nuclear residence is an integral property of a functional Pus1p enzyme.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this report we have identified the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Pus1p, which is now the third tRNA:pseudouridine synthase 1 to be characterized experimentally after the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c5">5</xref>) enzymes. The cDNA coding for spPus1p was found in a screen for fission yeast proteins that can rescue the thermosensitive <italic>los1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pus1</italic>&#x00394; budding yeast strain. Enzymatic assays <italic>in vitro</italic> confirmed the ability of spPus1p to function as a tRNA:pseudouridine synthase and demonstrated that its substrate specificity for <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> tRNAs matches those of the other two previously identified homologs from <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and mouse. All enzymes display multisite specificity and are capable of modifying residues in at least two different regions of the tRNA molecule and in an intron-dependent (positions 34 and 36) or intron-independent (positions 27 and&#x0002f;or 28) mode. Finally, the two yeast homologs localize exclusively inside the nucleus.</p><p>Comparison of the sequences of the three Pus1p orthologs allows certain conclusions to be drawn concerning their structural organization and their relationship to the other pseudouridine synthases. Pus1p was originally grouped in the TruA family because of its sequence similarity to the founding member of this family, <italic>E.coli</italic> pseudouridine synthase I or TruA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>). However, TruA modifies positions 38, 39 and&#x0002f;or 40 in tRNA and its true eukaryotic ortholog is apparently yeast Pus3&#x0002f;Deg1p, which has a similar substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c6">6</xref>). It can therefore be suggested that spPus1p, scPus1p and mPus1p constitute what can be now called the Pus1 family, which is related to but distinct from TruA. The members of the Pus1 family differ from the TruA-like proteins not only in their substrate specificity but also in the fact that they are only encountered in one kingdom, i.e. eukaryotes. Indeed, databank sequence searches and comparisons revealed a number of other eukaryotic Pus1p-like proteins that can be distinguished from the TruA-like enzymes on the basis of sequence similarity. An alignment of the most conserved areas as well as a phylogenetic tree of eukaryotic Pus1-like and TruA (Pus3)-like proteins is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f4">4</xref>. In addition to spPus1p (this work), scPus1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>) and mPus1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c5">5</xref>), potential members of the Pus1 family include human Pus1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c5">5</xref>), <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Pus2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>), two additional <italic>S.pombe</italic> ORFs (T40736 and CAA20745) and one ORF each in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (AAF17648), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (T26253) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (AAF55785). Unique sequence elements of the Pus1-like family that can be easily identified include the invariable alanine residue before the conserved RTD motif and the characteristic sequence HNFHNFT that is found with small variations in all Pus1 sequences, as well as Pus2, which can therefore be considered a member of this family (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f4">4</xref>A). Other, more distantly related polypeptides appear to be eukaryotic members of the TruA (Pus3) family, such as scPus3p itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c6">6</xref>) and ORFs in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (CAB61771), <italic>A.thaliana</italic> (AAF26999 and possibly O22928) and <italic>C.elegans</italic> (Q09524). Of course, the sequence analysis shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f4">4</xref> has only predictive value but, nevertheless, it may act as a guide for the experimentation required for the definite classification of a protein in one or the other family, according to catalytic activity and substrate specificity.</p><p>As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd657f4">4</xref>, Pus1-like enzymes contain two highly conserved, positively charged domains which may represent the catalytic core and the basic recognition machinery for the common structure of the tRNA substrates. This two-domain organization is reminiscent of the <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme TruA, which is the only pseudouridine synthase with a known 3-dimensional structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c27">27</xref>). The TruA monomer consists of two distinct domains with similar folding topology, the union of which generates a RNA-binding cleft. Therefore, Pus1-like proteins may be structured in an analogous way to TruA. However, in the Pus1-like proteins the two conserved domains are connected via a species-specific linker sequence of variable length. A possible function of this idiosyncratic sequence may be involvement in recognition of the tRNA intron, which, although required for modification at positions 34 and 36 in the anticodon of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>(UAU), varies in length between different species. For example, while the intron of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> pre-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>(UAU) is 60 nt long, analysis of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> and human genomic sequences indicates the presence of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>(UAU) genes containing a shorter intron, of 25 and 20 nt, respectively. The differences in the substrate pre-tRNA structure may also explain the fact that spPus1p modifies positions 34 and 36 in budding yeast tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>(UAU) less efficiently than the homologous scPus1p. In addition to its capability of modifying tRNAs, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Pus1p was shown previously to catalyze U&#x02192;&#x003a8; conversion at position 44 in U2 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c7">7</xref>). However, the analysis of RNA extracted from a <italic>S.cerevisiae pus1</italic>&#x00394; strain complemented by spPus1p showed that U2 snRNA does not contain &#x003a8; at position 44 (I.Ansmant and Y.Motorin, unpublished observations). These results suggest an additional difference in RNA recognition between <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> Pus1p.</p><p>The modifications catalyzed by the Pus1 enzymes are a unique feature of eukaryotic tRNAs and they may therefore be required for a process that occurs only in eukaryotes, such as nuclear export of tRNA. Indeed, scPus1p becomes essential for optimal cell growth in the absence of the tRNA nuclear export factor Los1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c4">4</xref>). The fact that spPus1p can replace scPus1p effectively suggests that this genetic interaction may be conserved between species. We have recently reported that two distinct but redundant nuclear export pathways for tRNA exist in budding yeast: one depends on Los1p while the second one is Los1p-independent but requires tRNA aminoacylation and function of the essential translation elongation factor eEF-1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd657c21">21</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that Pus1p-mediated modifications can facilitate interaction of the tRNAs with the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, EF-1A or other factors of the same pathway. In the absence of Pus1p this interaction may be weakened, causing a reduction in the rate of nuclear tRNA export, which, however, can be compensated for by the Los1p-dependent export mechanism. However, when both Pus1p and Los1p are missing the rate of nuclear tRNA export may become limiting for cell growth. We hope that the identification of Pus1p in fission yeast will help to address these issues further.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd657f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) The <italic>S.pombe</italic> cDNA that encodes spPus1p can complement the thermosensitive <italic>los1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>pus1</italic>&#x00394; double disrupted <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strain.
