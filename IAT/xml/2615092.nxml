The <italic>LMNA</italic> gene encodes the A-type lamins A and C. Both proteins are important determinants of interphase nuclear architecture and play essential roles in maintaining the integrity of the nuclear envelope and chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mounkes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke and Stewart, 2006</xref>). Mutations in <italic>LMNA</italic> have been associated with a wide range of diseases, commonly referred as laminopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Worman and Bonne, 2007</xref>). Despite the ubiquitous expression of A-type lamins, laminopathies are highly tissue-specific and typically affect one or few selected tissues, such as adipocytes in familial partial lipodystrophy of Dunnigan type (FPLD), nerve in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorder type 2 (CMT2B), or cardiac muscle in dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (DCM-CD). Two of the most common laminopathies are Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (AD-EDMD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), which both affect skeletal and cardiac striated muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broers et al., 2006</xref>). The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which mutations in genes encoding ubiquitous nuclear envelope proteins cause human disease have been largely elusive. Several possible scenarios have been suggested including impaired differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frock et al., 2006</xref>), increased susceptibility to mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broers et al., 2004</xref>), lamin-mediated changes in gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakay et al., 2006</xref>), and alterations in lamina-associated signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke and Stewart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mattout et al., 2006</xref>). Given the highly tissue-specific nature of laminopathies, it is possible that distinct mechanisms are responsible for defects in the various affected tissues.</p><p>The skeletal muscle tissue is composed of multinucleated fibers formed by fusion of mononucleated cells during development. Among the hundreds of nuclei in a muscle fiber, approximately four to eight nuclei are specialized for the transcription of the components of the synapse at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schaeffer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mejat et al., 2003</xref>). These synaptic nuclei are recruited into the vicinity of the postsynaptic membrane during muscle differentiation, and their proper positioning is crucial for NMJ establishment and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruegg, 2005</xref>). Positioning of synaptic nuclei at the NMJ involves the interplay between the cytoskeleton and several nuclear envelope proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grady et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2007b</xref>), including Nesprin, also known as Syne for synaptic nuclear envelope, and SUN proteins. Nesprins are a very large family of outer or inner nuclear membrane transmembrane proteins encoded by extensively alternatively spliced <italic>SYNE1</italic> and <italic>SYNE2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>), which anchor nuclei to the actin cytoskeleton via a pair of calponin homology (CH) domains at the N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grady et al., 2005</xref>). The luminal C-terminal KASH (klarsicht/ANC-1/syne) domain of Nesprin proteins interacts with SUN proteins, which span the inner nuclear membrane and physically interact with A-type lamins, establishing a continuous physical link between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Starr and Han, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Padmakumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crisp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haque et al., 2006</xref>). Double knockout of Nesprin-1 and Nesprin-2 in mice leads to the complete absence of nuclei recruited to the synapses of diaphragm muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2007b</xref>), which demonstrates the importance of nuclear envelope components in synaptic nuclei positioning.</p><p>We hypothesized that A-type lamins might contribute to the proper positioning of synaptic nuclei at the NMJ in muscle fibers, and, hence, we sought to test the possibility that A-type lamins&#x02013;mediated NMJ defects contribute to AD-EDMD disease symptoms. Here, we show that <italic>Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup></italic> and <italic>Lmna<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, two previously described AD-EDMD mouse models, fail to innervate muscle and exhibit aberrant NMJ architecture. In both mice models, several nuclear envelope components crucial for proper recruitment and positioning of synaptic nuclei are mislocalized, leading to a reduction in their number and their mispositioning at the NMJ. Consequently, <italic>Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup></italic> and <italic>Lmna<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> muscles show misexpression of electrical activity&#x02013;dependent genes and altered epigenetic chromatin modifications. The same defects were present in biopsies from AD-EDMD patients, which indicates that these defects are relevant to human disease. The sum of our results suggests that failed muscle innervation contributes to AD-EDMD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Muscle innervation defects in AD-EDMD mouse models</title><p>To test whether AD-EDMD pathology involves muscle&#x02013;nerve interaction defects, we analyzed innervation patterns in <italic>Lmna<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup></italic> mice. Mice lacking the <italic>Lmna</italic> gene die 6&#x02013;7 wk after birth because of severe muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy, resembling AD-EDMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sullivan et al., 1999</xref>), and present an axonopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Sandre-Giovannoli et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup></italic> mice carry a missense mutation that was originally identified in a family with AD-EDMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arimura et al., 2005</xref>). Adult H222P homozygous male mice exhibit several symptoms reminiscent of AD-EDMD patients including reduced locomotion with abnormal stiff walking posture, cardiac fibrosis, chamber dilatation, and hypokinesia with conduction defects, and they typically die by 9 mo of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arimura et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>When compared with wild-type littermates of identical genetic background, we found innervation defects in both animal models in the diaphragm visualized by staining for bungarotoxin (Bgt), which specifically binds to the acetylcholine receptors (AChR) accumulated at the muscle motor synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A, C, and E</xref>). In wild-type animals, synapses are concentrated in a narrow band, and AChR clusters appear as a thin line in the middle of each hemidiaphragm muscle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In contrast, in diaphragms of <italic>Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup></italic> and <italic>Lmna<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals, neuromuscular synapses are present outside of the central narrow end-plate band region, and synapses are scattered over a wider area of the muscle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and E</xref>). Quantitative analysis demonstrated that although the innervation area is limited to an &#x0223c;1-mm-wide band in wild-type animals (990 &#x000b1; 281 &#x003bc;m and 1,027 &#x000b1; 283 &#x003bc;m at 6 wk and 6 mo, respectively), it extends by an additional 40% in adult <italic>Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup></italic> (1,387 &#x000b1; 418 &#x003bc;m; P &#x0003c; 0.001) and by 70% in the phenotypically more severely affected 6-wk-old <italic>Lmna<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (1,775 &#x000b1; 580 &#x003bc;m; P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>). In addition to the size of the postsynaptic innervation area, the branching pattern of the diaphragm's motor nerve was also affected in AD-EDMD mouse models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B, D, and F</xref>). In contrast to wild-type animals where phrenic nerves, visualized by double-staining for neurofilament 150 kD and synaptophysin, showed few ramifications, phrenic nerves in <italic>Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup></italic> and <italic>Lmna<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals were highly branched and extended to a large area from the center of the diaphragm, with some ramifications covering the whole surface of the diaphragm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B, D, and F</xref>, arrowhead).

In pilot experiments to optimize viral transduction, injection of AAV6&#x02013;GFP virus into muscle resulted in expression of the GFP transgene in &#x0003e;90% of muscle cells 1 wk after transduction; expression was limited to muscle and was absent from Schwann cells and neurons (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811035/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811035/DC1</ext-link>). Injection of AAV6 expressing shRNA against A-type lamins (AAV6-shLMNA) in tibialis anterior muscle, but presumably not in adjacent neurons, resulted in an &#x0223c;70% decrease of A-type lamin protein levels 2 wk after injection, and was maintained 5 wk after injection (Fig. S3 B). No decrease in A-type lamin mRNA or protein levels occurred in the noninjected tibialis interior control muscle over the same time period in the same animal injected with AAV6 expressing shRNA against GFP (AAV6-shGFP; Fig. S3 B).</p><p>Knockdown of A-type lamins in muscle from wild-type animals recapitulated the NMJ defects observed in AD-EDMD mouse models. After 3 wk, we observed a significant increase in the number of fragmented NMJs in tibialis anterior muscles injected with AAV6-shLMNA, whereas AAV6-shGFP&#x02013;injected control muscles only showed a slight variation compared with noninjected muscle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). 4 and 5 wk after injection, &#x0223c;60% of the NMJs showed an altered morphology in AAV6-shLMNA&#x02013;injected muscle, whereas in AAV6-shGFP and in noninjected control muscle, only 10&#x02013;15% of NMJs were abnormal (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Similarly, as in the AD-EDMD mouse models, SUN2 proteins were frequently mislocalized and aggregated in synaptic nuclei of tibialis anterior muscle injected with AAV6-shLMNA, whereas SUN2 staining was homogeneous and indistinguishable from wild-type animals in AAV6-shGFP&#x02013;injected muscles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>).

As observed in the AD-EDMD mouse models, SUN2 staining was not affected in extrasynaptic nuclei of AAV6-shLMNA&#x02013;injected muscles (not depicted).

One model is based on the observation that immortalized <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> myoblasts are impaired in their differentiation to myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frock et al., 2006</xref>); however, in vivo regeneration of cardiotoxin-treated <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> muscles is normal and primary <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> myoblast cultures do not show impairment in their differentiation to myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melcon et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We provide several lines of evidence for a model involving NMJ defects in AD-EDMD. First, innervation patterns and NMJ morphology are altered in two independent mouse models of AD-EDMD. Second, synaptic nuclei fail to be recruited to the NMJ in the animal models. Third, several electrical activity&#x02013;dependent genes are misregulated, and denervation-characteristic histone modification patterns are present in AD-EDMD mouse model and patient samples, likely as a consequence of defective NMJ morphology. Furthermore, the proportion of altered NMJs in transient <italic>Lmna</italic> knockdown muscles strictly correlated with the number of histone hyperacetylated fibers, a hallmark of functional denervation. Fourth, our histological observations confirm previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mittelbronn et al., 2006</xref>) that muscles from AD-EDMD patients show morphological features similar to denervated muscles from ALS and CMS patients but were distinct from BMD. Finally, we found in mouse models and AD-EDMD patients that the gene expression pattern of several electrical activity&#x02013;dependent genes resembles that of ALS, an established muscle denervation syndrome, and CMS, an established altered NMJ syndrome, but is distinct from the expression profile of these genes in BMD as well as two other <italic>LMNA</italic>-related diseases not associated with innervation defects.</p><p>Our findings of altered innervation and abnormal NMJ architecture in AD-EDMD muscle based on morphological and gene expression analysis are in line with observations on the electrical activity of AD-EDMD patient muscle. Conventional and single-fiber electromyography in a family with a variant of AD-EDMD caused by a <italic>LMNA</italic> mutation revealed electromyographic alterations in motor unit potentials that were suggestive of neurogenic muscular changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walter et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, muscle biopsies of patients with AD-EDMD showed a mild mixed myopathic and neurogenic pattern with scattered small-angular atrophic myofibers, marked atrophy of type 1 fibers, and a clear predominance of type 2 fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mittelbronn et al., 2006</xref>), which is similar to the slow-to-fast fiber switch observed in denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevens et al., 1999a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">b</xref>). In addition, atrophied muscle fibers from AD-EDMD patients do not appear grouped, a hallmark of atrophy caused by degeneration of the nerve cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rowinska-Marcinska et al., 2005</xref>). These physiological observations are consistent with the presence of the cellular and molecular defects observed in AD-EDMD mouse models and patient tissue reported here.</p><p>Our observations indicate that the abnormal innervation and NMJ defects are a cause and not a secondary consequence of altered, possibly chronic, muscle defects. This is supported by the fact that NMJ defects occur before any apparent muscle defects. We found altered innervation, failed synaptic nuclei recruitment, and SUN2 mislocalization in 6-wk-old <italic>Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup></italic> mice that are asymptomatic for muscle and locomotion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arimura et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, all NMJ defects strongly correlate with the severity of symptoms in the animal models, and SUN2 aggregation occurred before NMJ alterations upon transient knockdown of A-type lamins. Although <italic>Lmna<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals exhibit axonal defects as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Sandre-Giovannoli et al., 2002</xref>), the fact that transient knockdown of A-type lamins in muscle is sufficient to recapitulate the main phenotypes in the absence of nerve defects or muscle fibrosis indicates that loss of A-type lamins is causal for the NMJ phenotype. Because the AAV6 used here does not efficiently infect Schwann cells or the nerve, the NMJ defects must be caused by the impaired function of A-type lamins in the muscle and not the nerve. These results also suggest that the previously observed axonal defects in <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are likely a consequence of loss of lamin function in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Sandre-Giovannoli et al., 2002</xref>). Based on these observations, we propose that the primary defect in muscular A-type lamin function leads to NMJ defects that ultimately contribute to the muscle atrophy observed in AD-EDMD.</p></sec><sec><title>A-type lamins mediate positioning of synaptic nuclei</title><p>Our data argue for a model in which A-type lamins play a structural role in organizing the molecular complexes responsible for the recruitment and positioning of synapse-associated nuclei underneath the postsynaptic membrane. In support, we show that the absence or mutation of A-type lamins causes mislocalization of two of the key components of the nuclear positioning machinery, the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN2 and the outer nuclear membrane component Nesprin-1, which links the nuclear envelope to the cytoskeleton. Strikingly, this mislocalization of SUN2 and Nesprin-1 was limited to synaptic nuclei but was not observed in extrasynaptic nuclei, which suggests a link between the organization of nuclear envelope components in synaptic nuclei and NMJ defects. We propose that as a consequence of this misorganization of the inner nuclear membrane, the number of muscle nuclei recruited at the synapse is reduced and the remaining synaptic nuclei beneath the NMJ tend to be progressively mislocalized or lost. This may lead to unstable NMJs, inefficient neurotransmission between the muscle and nerve, and innervation defects of the muscle fiber. Because the primary defect in both AD-EDMD mouse models is in the <italic>Lmna</italic> gene, these observations directly implicate A-type lamins and the SUN&#x02013;Nesprin complex in the recruitment and positioning of synaptic nuclei. This interpretation is in line with earlier data demonstrating that Nesprin-1 and Nesprin-2 are mislocalized in <italic>Lmna<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Libotte et al., 2005</xref>), that overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Nesprin-1 induces relocalization of synaptic nuclei at the periphery of the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grady et al., 2005</xref>), and that complete knockout of Nesprin-1 and Nesprin-2 in mice affects viability with immediate death at birth because of the complete absence of nuclei recruited to the synapses of diaphragm muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2007b</xref>).</p><p>It seems likely that A-type lamins act by organizing SUN proteins in the inner nuclear membrane, which then determines their interaction with Nesprins in the outer nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodzic et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Padmakumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crisp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haque et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, we find here differential effects of <italic>Lmna</italic> loss or <italic>Lmna</italic> mutations on SUN1 and SUN2. In synaptic nuclei, where SUN1 is expressed at low levels, SUN2 localization is dramatically affected by A-type lamins mutation or its absence; whereas, in extrasynaptic nuclei, where SUN1 is present, SUN2 localization is only slightly altered, suggesting that SUN1 might compensate for A-type lamins defects. Our findings point to the fact that, in muscle, SUN1 localization to the nuclear envelope is not dependent on A-type lamins, whereas SUN2 localization is, confirming biochemical studies showing that SUN1 and SUN2 localized to the nuclear envelope via different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Padmakumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crisp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haque et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Our findings also confirm that SUN1 and SUN2 are not redundant and may play different roles in the inner nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmitt et al., 2007</xref>). Whether these interactions are primarily important for formation or maintenance of NMJs is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for candidate AD-EDMD genes</title><p>Our observations have implications for identification of additional AD-EDMD genes. Mutations in A-type lamins (<italic>LMNA</italic>) and emerin (<italic>EMD</italic>) currently only account for 50% of AD-EDMD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2007a</xref>). Our findings indicate that components involved in synaptic nuclei positioning are potential AD-EDMD candidate genes. This possibility has recently been validated by the identification of mutations in <italic>SYNE1</italic> and <italic>SYNE2</italic> in patients with AD-EDMD phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2007a</xref>). Moreover, Nesprin-1&#x003b1; and Nesprin-2&#x003b2; interactions with the nuclear envelope have been shown to be disrupted in X-linked EDMD cells, which suggests that emerin might also play a role in the synaptic nuclear envelope organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wheeler et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, Nesprin-2, emerin, LAP2&#x003b1;, and LAP2&#x003b2; localization has been shown to be disturbed in <italic>LMNA</italic> S143F progeria cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kandert et al., 2007</xref>), which suggests that the interaction between lamins and Nesprins may not only play a role in muscular laminopathies. In agreement with our data, so far no mutations in <italic>SUN1</italic> have been identified in AD-EDMD patients. Moreover, <italic>SUN1</italic>-deficient mice develop normally into adults without any evidence of muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that, at least in the presence of A-type lamins, SUN1 is dispensable during muscle development. However, here we show that the <italic>SUN2</italic> expression pattern is highly similar to <italic>SYNE1</italic> and that its localization is dramatically altered in AD-EDMD mouse model synaptic nuclei, which suggests it may be a crucial component of the synaptic nuclei envelope. For these reasons, <italic>SUN2</italic> represents a novel gene candidate to be screened for mutation in AD-EDMD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue specificity of AD-EDMD</title><p>One of the most intriguing aspects of laminopathies is the question of how mutations in the ubiquitously expressed A-type lamin proteins lead to tissue-restricted disorders. We find here that various subsets of muscle nuclei express distinct combinations of the lamin-interacting proteins SUN1 and SUN2, and that this expression pattern correlates with susceptibility to AD-EDMD mutations. It is therefore possible that the tissue-specific nature of <italic>LMNA</italic> mutations is caused by the presence of particular combinations of lamin-interacting proteins in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellis, 2006</xref>). We find that AD-EDMD mutations in mice primarily affect the synaptic nuclei in the context of the plurinucleated muscle. Interestingly, synaptic nuclei only express SUN2 and Nesprin-1, whereas extrasynaptic nuclei express SUN1, SUN2, and Nesprin-1. Strikingly, Nesprin-1 and SUN2 are preferentially expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle and heart, both tissues affected in AD-EDMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, SUN2 has been identified as one of the genes differentially expressed in congenital heart defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2002</xref>), which suggests that SUN2, and maybe Nesprin-1, alteration might affect heart physiology. Obviously, the cardiac defects in EDMD patients are not mediated through NMJ defects because cardiac muscle lacks NMJ. A possibility is that mutations in lamin A not only affect the nuclear envelope but also, via the SUN&#x02013;Nesprin axis, the cytoskeleton, and possibly even the plasma membrane, as indicated by our finding of altered AChR organization at the cell surface. Interestingly, the ERK1/2&#x02013;MAP kinase pathways whose upstream receptors are at the plasma membrane have recently been shown to be up-regulated in heart from <italic>Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mejat et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muchir et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our data suggest a mechanistic model for the laminopathy AD-EDMD. We propose that AD-EDMD mutations alter the structural organization of the nuclear envelope in synaptic nuclei of muscle fibers. As a result, the SUN&#x02013;Nesprin-mediated interaction of the nucleus with the cytoskeleton is interrupted, leading to failed recruitment and mispositioning of synapse-associated myonuclei. Lamin A/C&#x02013;mediated neurotransmission defects may result in the misregulation of electrical activity&#x02013;dependent genes and to global chromatin rearrangements. These results strongly indicate that NMJ defects contribute to human AD-EDMD, and they provide insights into the cellular and molecular disease mechanism of a laminopathy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Lmna</italic> mice (<italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>, <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>, and <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and <italic>Lmna<sup>H222P/H222P</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sullivan et al., 1999</xref>) were housed individually and provided with mouse chow and water ad libitum in restricted-access, specific-pathogen-free animal care facilities at the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) and the Institute of Myology (Paris, France), respectively.
