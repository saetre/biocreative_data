The protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B, is known to negatively regulate EGF-induced signaling in several cell types by dephosphorylating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The current studies were conducted to determine whether PTP1B plays a role in regulating cell cycle entry in HCEC in response to EGF stimulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Donor corneas were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange and accepted for study based on established exclusion criteria. PTP1B was localized in the endothelium of ex vivo corneas and in cultured cells by immunocytochemistry. Western blot analysis verified PTP1B protein expression in HCEC and then compared the relative expression of EGFR and PTP1B in HCEC from young (&#x0003c;3 years old) and older donors (&#x0003e;60 years old). The effect of inhibiting the activity of PTP1B on S-phase entry was tested by comparing time-dependent BrdU incorporation in subconfluent HCEC incubated in the presence or absence of the PTP1B inhibitor, CinnGEL 2Me, before EGF stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PTP1B was localized in a punctate pattern mainly within the cytoplasm of HCEC in ex vivo corneas and cultured cells. Western blots revealed the presence of three PTP1B-positive bands in HCEC and the control. Further western blot analysis showed no significant age-related difference in expression of EGFR (p=0.444&#x0003e;0.05); however, PTP1B expression was significantly higher in HCEC from older donors (p=0.024&#x0003c;0.05). Pre-incubation of HCEC with the PTP1B inhibitor significantly increased (p<italic>=</italic>0.019&#x0003c;0.05) the number of BrdU positive cells by 48 h after EGF stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both immunolocalization and western blot studies confirmed that PTP1B is expressed in HCEC. Staining patterns strongly suggest that at least a subset of PTP1B is localized to the cytoplasm and most likely to the endoplasmic reticulum, the known site of EGFR/PTP1B interaction following EGF stimulation. PTP1B expression, but not EGFR expression, was elevated in HCEC from older donors, suggesting that the reduced proliferative activity of these cells in response to EGF is due, at least in part, to increased PTP1B activity. The fact that inhibition of PTP1B increased the relative number of cells entering S-phase strongly suggests that PTP1B helps negatively regulate EGF-stimulated cell cycle entry in HCEC. These results also suggest that it may be possible to increase the proliferative activity of HCEC, particularly in cells from older donors, by inhibiting the activity of this important protein tyrosine phosphatase.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human corneal endothelial cells (HCEC) do not normally proliferate in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]; however, they are able to divide in response to wounding in ex vivo corneas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] and will proliferate in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>] when stimulated by appropriate growth promoting agents. Studies exploring the relative proliferative capacity of HCEC have demonstrated that HCEC from older donors (&#x0003e;50 years old) are less responsive to mitogens than cells from younger donors (&#x0003c;30 years old) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. For example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) is able to stimulate proliferation in HCEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], but the relative level of DNA synthesis and the number of cells that divide in response to EGF stimulation is relatively low, particularly in cells from older donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Studies are being conducted in this laboratory to identify the molecular basis for this weak response to determine whether it is possible to increase the sensitivity of HCEC to EGF. This could lead to development of methods to increase proliferation of HCEC in vivo or in donor corneas to be used for transplantation, resulting in increased endothelial cell density. It may also improve methods for use of HCEC in regenerative therapies.</p><p>Several growth factors, including EGF, signal via membrane-bound receptors with intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Receptors of this type are termed receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). In the case of the EGF receptor (EGFR), the RTK activity is stimulated by ligand binding, resulting in autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues (Tyr992 and Tyr1148), which are located within the COOH-terminal intracellular domain of the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. This tyrosine phosphorylation is reversible and plays an important role in activating and regulating downstream cellular pathways. Downstream mediators of EGF-induced signaling include phospholipase C-&#x003b3; (PLC-&#x003b3;) and its downstream calcium- and protein kinase C (PKC) cascades, as well as MAP kinases, including ERK/MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. After ligand binding and tyrosine autophosphorylation, EGFR is rapidly internalized into endosomes and remains active for several minutes before either being sorted to lysosomes for degradation or recycled back to the plasma membrane. The fate of the receptor and the output of the signaling process depend on continued ligand binding and kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p><p>Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) comprise a large family of receptor-like and non-receptor enzymes that share a highly conserved catalytic domain specific for phosphotyrosine hydrolysis. PTPs act as &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; switches for numerous signaling events, thus acting as regulators of the signaling process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. PTP1B is a widely expressed non-receptor PTP that was originally identified in placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Sequencing studies indicate that PTP1B consists of 435 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. PTP1B contains a phosphatase catalytic domain at its NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus (residues 40&#x02013;276), a region containing proline-rich motifs that promote interaction with proteins containing SH<sub>2</sub>-domains. PTP1B also contains a COOH-terminal hydrophobic region (residues 401&#x02013;431) that is necessary and sufficient to localize PTP1B to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] and nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. PTP1B interacts with and dephosphorylates several RTKs, including EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], the PDGF-BB receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], and the FGF receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], thereby attenuating ligand-induced downstream signaling. Besides its role in regulating growth factor-based signaling, PTP1B is also involved in regulating insulin- and leptin-induced signaling. As a result, several laboratories are actively developing PTP1B inhibitors that will interfere with its negative regulation of these important signaling processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies from this laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>] demonstrated the expression of several PTPs, including, PTP1B, SHP-1, SHP-2, PTP-&#x003bc;, and the dual-specificity phosphatase, PTEN, in rat corneal endothelial cells both in ex vivo corneas and in culture. Treatment of subconfluent rat corneal endothelial cells with the general phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate (SOV), increased the relative number of cells entering the cell cycle, as indicated by positive staining for Ki67, a marker of actively cycling cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. This result strongly suggested that phosphatase activity helps suppress cell cycle entry in corneal endothelium. Subsequent studies concentrated on the role of PTP1B in the regulation of EGFR signaling in rat corneal endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Western blot studies indicated that EGF induces phosphorylation of EGFR-Tyr992. Incubation of these cells with the PTP1B inhibitor, CinnGEL 2Me, both sustained EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR-Tyr992 and increased the number of cells entering the cell cycle, as indicated by immunostaining for Ki67. Together, these findings provide evidence that PTP1B plays a role in the negative regulation of EGFR signaling in rat corneal endothelial cells, at least at the level of Tyr992 phosphorylation.</p><p>The current studies move the inquiry from rat to human corneal endothelial cells. The goal of these studies was to determine whether PTP1B plays a role in negatively regulating cell cycle entry in EGF-stimulated HCEC. Studies were conducted to verify expression of PTP1B in human corneal endothelium both in ex vivo corneas and in culture, to compare the relative expression of PTP1B and EGFR in HCEC cultured from young and older donors, and to determine whether inhibition of the activity of PTP1B could increase cell cycle entry in HCEC in response to EGF stimulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Isolation and culture of human corneal endothelial cells</title><p>Donor human corneas were obtained through National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI, Philadelphia, PA). In accepting corneas from NDRI, the overall health of the donor before death was considered and tissue was rejected from donors with previous history or treatment that might damage the corneal endothelium, as indicated in the exclusion criteria that have been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Handling of donor information by the source eye bank, NDRI, and this laboratory adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki 1983 revision in protecting donor confidentiality.

Briefly, Descemet's membrane with attached endothelium was dissected in small strips and then incubated in culture medium overnight at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to stabilize the cells. Culture medium consisted of OptiMEM-I (Invitrogen-Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT), 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF; Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY), 20 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF; Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA), 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml bovine pituitary extract (Biomedical Technologies), 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 200&#x000a0;mg/ml calcium chloride, 0.08% chondroitin sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich), 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen-Gibco), and antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:100. After gentle centrifugation, the medium was removed and 0.02% EDTA was added for 1 h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to separate the cells. Following centrifugation, the isolated cells and pieces of Descemet's membrane still containing attached cells were resuspended in culture medium, plated in six-well tissue culture plates that had been pre-coated with FNC Coating Mix (Biological Research Faculty &#x00026; Facility, Inc., Ijamsville, MD), and incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified atmosphere. Medium was changed every-other day. After cells reached confluence, they were subcultured at a 1:2 ratio.

Corneas from four different donors were used to localize PTP1B in ex vivo corneal endothelium, while corneas from two different donors were used as a source of cells for culture. Corneas were washed three times with culture medium and incubated overnight (37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) to stabilize the cells. After incubation, the tissues were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen) and fixed for 10 min in 100% methanol at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. All further incubations were at room temperature. Corneas were cut in quarters, washed in PBS three times for 10 min each, then permeabilized for 10 min in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). Before they were stained with antibodies, tissues were washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated for 10 min in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 4% BSA in PBS. After a 2 h incubation in mouse-anti-PTP1B (PH01; Calbiochem) diluted 1:50 in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, the tissues were rinsed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and reincubated for 10 min in blocking buffer. Corneas were then incubated for 1 h in FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), diluted 1:50 with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Tissue incubated in secondary antibody alone acted as a negative control. Each corneal quarter was mounted endothelial-side up on a glass slide. Coverslips were mounted in medium containing propidium iodide (PI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to stain all nuclei.

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, samples extracted from passage 2 HCEC (lanes 1 and 2) yielded three PTP1B-positive bands-a band at 50 kDa, as well as two additional bands migrating at approximately 48 kDa and 46 kDa. The SW480 cell positive control (lane 3) yielded a total of five bands-three corresponding to the same bands observed in the HCEC samples and two additional lower molecular weight bands at approximately 39 kDa and 37 kDa. Published studies of PTP1B protein expression in several different cell types, including HeLa cells, human diploid fibroblasts, CV-1 cells, and COS-1 cells, indicate that gel electrophoresis of full-length PTP1B yields a band with a relative molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. This strongly suggests that the 50 kDa band found on the blots of HCEC corresponds to full-length PTP1B. PTP1B has also been detected at somewhat lower molecular weights. For example, bands of approximately 48 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>] and 46 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] have been observed and appear to represent truncated forms of PTP1B that are missing the COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Thus, the 48 kDa and 46 kDa bands found in all three samples in the current study appear to represent truncated forms of PTP1B. Non-specific proteolytic cleavage of PTP1B can yield a band migrating at approximately 37 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Two bands migrating around 39 kDa and 37 kDa were visible in the commercially prepared lysate of SW480 cells, suggesting that a portion of PTP1B was nonspecifically cleaved in this sample. These lower molecular weight bands were not detected in the samples prepared from HCEC. Together, these results verified the expression of PTP1B in HCEC and provided suggestive evidence that this protein tyrosine phosphatase exists in multiple forms within the cell. Differences in the relative densities of the three PTP1B bands were also noted. For example, in the HCEC sample in lane 1, the 50 kDa band density appeared to be higher than that of either the 48 kDa or 46 kDa bands, whereas, in the sample in lane 2, the 46 kDa band appeared denser than the 50 kDa band. The fact that intra-sample differences were observed in this study was important, because it affected how total PTP1B expression was calculated in the comparative western blot studies described below. In addition, the protein samples used for this study were obtained from a newborn and a 74-year-old donor. It is possible that the observed intra- and/or inter-sample differences in relative density of the three PTP1B-positive bands were due to age-related alterations in PTP1B expression. This possibility was further explored in the comparative studies described below.</p><fig id="f2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Western blot detection of PTP1B protein bands in HCEC.

It is possible that, in HCEC from older donors, the relative expression of EGF receptors might be reduced, leading to a weaker response to EGF. Since PTP1B is known to dephosphorylate activated EGFRs, it is also possible that there may be an age-related difference in the relative expression of PTP1B in HCEC from older donors that would underlie the observed difference in response to EGF. Western blot studies were therefore conducted to compare the relative protein expression of EGFR and PTP1B in HCEC. Protein samples were prepared from confluent passage 2 cells cultured from four young (two newborns, 2-year old and 3-year old) and four older donors (aged 60, 66, 74, and 78 years old). <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> provides more information and indicates that one newborn donor sample and the sample from the 74-year-old donor used in these studies were also used for the western blot study described above.

A band of the same relative molecular weight was detected in EGF-stimulated A431 cells, which acted as a positive control for the western blot (data not shown).

Prior to this study in HCEC, a range of CinnGEL 2Me concentrations was tested both for its effect on S-phase entry and on cell viability. A final concentration of 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M was found to be optimal and was used for the subsequent studies. HCEC were cultured from donors aged 16 and 18 and two different 72-year-old donors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Subconfluent Passage-2 cells were pretreated for 1 h with 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CinnGEL 2Me. Since CinnGEL 2Me requires reconstitution in DMSO, control cells were pre-treated for 1 h with the same concentration of DMSO minus the inhibitor. Cells were then stimulated with 25 ng/ml EGF and stained at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h for BrdU incorporation to test the effect of PTP1B inhibition on S-phase entryE cultured.

Results indicate that PTP1B is expressed in HCEC and that the pattern of PTP1B localization is similar in ex vivo endothelium and in cultured cells, indicating that no gross change in PTP1B location occurs upon culturing. The punctate cytoplasmic pattern observed in HCEC is consistent with that observed in ex vivo rat corneal endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. A similar pattern has been demonstrated in several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>] and suggests that, in HCEC, PTP1B is mainly localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. Some punctate staining was also observed in the nuclei of HCEC both in situ and in culture. This finding is consistent with studies in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>], which have shown that at least a subset of PTP1B may be associated with the nuclear membrane. Co-localization of PTP1B with specific membrane markers will be needed to verify its specific subcellular localization. PTP1B is implicated in dephosphorylation and inactivation of several plasma membrane-associated RTKS, including EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Immunolocalization studies in ex vivo rat corneal endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>] demonstrated a time-dependent internalization of EGFR at cell borders following EGF stimulation, suggesting that EGFR could interact with and be regulated by PTP1B within the cell. Similar studies are needed to verify that this interaction also occurs in HCEC. It will also be important to clearly demonstrate that PTP1B is directly involved in time-dependent dephosphorylation of EGFR following EGF stimulation of HCEC.</p><p>Protein extracts of HCEC, as well as the commercial SW480 cell lysate that was used as a positive control, consistently showed the presence of three bands for PTP1B on western blots-one band at 50kDa (the relative molecular weight expected for full-length PTP1B) and two bands of approximately 48 kDa and 46 kDa. As discussed above, these two lower molecular weight bands most likely correspond to truncated forms of PTP1B. The exact nature and function of these truncated forms is unclear and needs to be further investigated. The bands identified on the blots of HCEC and SW480 cells do not appear to correspond to PTP1B forms described in HeLa cell extracts by Schievella, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. Those studies identified a single PTP1B band migrating more slowly than the 50 kDa band in samples from cells synchronized in G<sub>2</sub>/M-phase with nocodazole. This slower migrating form was identified as a serine-phosphorylated (&#x0201c;mitotic&#x0201d;) form of PTP1B. In the current studies, the position of the three PTP1B bands in HCEC relative to that of the commercial molecular weight markers and to the bands of the positive control indicates that the slowest migrating band in the HCEC samples corresponds to the full-length 50kDa form of PTP1B and not to a slower migrating &#x0201c;mitotic&#x0201d; form. In addition, fully confluent cells were used for these studies and the presence of mitotic cells in the cultures is highly unlikely. Interestingly, the relative density of the three bands differed among the HCEC samples. The specific nature of the two lower molecular weight forms and the reason why their relative concentrations differ in HCEC remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Previous studies from this laboratory demonstrated an age-related decrease in the responsiveness of HCEC to EGF stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]; however, the molecular basis for this decrease is not known. One possibility is that the expression of EGFR decreases in an age-related manner; however, results of the current western blot studies demonstrate that the relative expression of EGFR protein did not differ significantly with donor age. This finding differs from that of Lopez, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>], who used flow cytometry to quantify EGF receptors in corneal cells. In that study, Passage-7 HCEC cultured from an infant donor, which exhibited senescence characteristics, expressed a considerably higher number of EGF receptors (&#x0003e;30,000/cell) than early passage cells from an infant donor (5,142 &#x000b1;2,412/cell). This discrepancy in results could be due to differences exhibited by cells aged in culture through multiple passages versus early-passage cells cultured from young and older donors or to the detection methods used for assay. Results similar to those in the current study have been reported in other cell types. For example, EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis was found to be decreased in primary hepatocytes cultured from 24 month-old rats compared to cells cultured from 6 month-old rats, although no age-related difference in EGFR density or binding affinity was detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. Similarly, decreased DNA synthesis was observed in human diploid fibroblasts aged by passage in culture without a concomitant change in EGFR expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that the difference in responsiveness to EGF exhibited by aged cells may not be specifically due to differences in EGFR expression, but to decreased downstream signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. This idea is supported by studies in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>] and rat hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>], which found that decreased levels of DNA synthesis in old mice were associated with decreased activation of ERK and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. Studies of in vitro aged human dermal fibroblasts by Tran, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>] demonstrated that EGF receptor autophosphorylation was significantly decreased upon EGF stimulation, as was phosphorylation of the downstream mediator, Shc. These age-related changes were paralleled by increased dephosphorylation of EGFR, increased PTPase activity, and increased expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatases, PTP1B and SHP-1. These findings provide evidence that, with age, cells become less sensitive to EGF stimulation due, at least in part, to increased dephosphorylation of EGFR by PTPs, including PTP1B, resulting in decreased downstream signaling. Interestingly, western blots of HCEC showed no significant age-related change in EGFR expression, but did detect a statistically significant increase in PTP1B expression in HCEC cultured from older donors. Therefore, it is possible that the difference in responsiveness to EGF exhibited by HCEC from older donors is not due to differences in EGFR expression but to decreased downstream signaling resulting from increased PTP1B-induced EGFR dephosphorylation. This intriguing hypothesis requires further testing.</p><p>To test whether PTP1B plays a role in the negative regulation of EGF signaling in HCEC, we employed the commercially available PTP1B inhibitor, CinnGEL 2Me. In previous studies, treatment of rat corneal endothelial cells with this inhibitor before EGF stimulation resulted in an increase in Ki67-positive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Ki67 is a recognized marker of actively cycling cells, because its expression is detectable in late G<sub>1</sub>-phase through mitosis, but not in quiescent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>]. In the current studies, we chose to use BrdU to more specifically mark entry into S-phase of the cell cycle. Although EGF stimulated S-phase entry both in the presence and absence of the PTP1B inhibitor, inhibition of PTP1B resulted in a significant increase in S-phase cells by 48 h after EGF addition, strongly suggesting that PTP1B negatively regulates EGF-stimulated proliferation. It should be noted that the population doubling time (PD) of HCEC is quite slow. The average PD for HCEC cultured from young donors is 46.25 h, while the PD for cells from older donors is 90.25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Thus, it was not unexpected that these results only showed a statistical significance 48 h after EGF stimulation. Additional studies are needed to determine whether PTP1B inhibition will increase division of HCEC, particularly from older donors.</p><p>In summary, PTP1B is expressed in HCEC, as well as in rat corneal endothelial cells. Staining patterns strongly suggest that at least a subset of PTP1B is localized to the cytoplasm and most likely to the endoplasmic reticulum-a site at which PTP1B is known to dephosphorylate EGFR in other cells. Interestingly, PTP1B expression, but not EGFR expression was elevated in HCEC from older donors. It is possible that the reduced sensitivity of these cells to EGF stimulation is due, at least in part, to increased PTP1B activity, resulting in decreased downstream signaling and a reduced number of cells entering the cell cycle. These findings are relevant to understanding the molecular basis for the decreased proliferative response of HCEC to EGF (and possibly to other RTKs) and may lead to treatments to overcome decreased downstream signaling by inhibiting PTP1B, thereby increasing proliferation and endothelial cell density.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge R01 EY05767 (N.C.J.) for support of the work presented in this manuscript.
