Errors in this process give rise to aneuploidy, which leads to birth defects and is implicated in cancer progression. The spindle checkpoint is a surveillance mechanism that ensures high fidelity of chromosome segregation by inhibiting anaphase until all kinetochores have established bipolar attachments to spindle microtubules. Bub1 kinase is a core component of the spindle checkpoint, and cells lacking Bub1 fail to arrest in response to microtubule drugs and precociously segregate their DNA. The mitotic role(s) of Bub1 kinase activity remain elusive, and it is controversial whether this C-terminal domain of Bub1p is required for spindle checkpoint arrest.

This is where cells have an incorrect number of chromosomes, because of a failure to segregate their genetic material accurately during cell division. Cells employ many control mechanisms to ensure an extremely high fidelity of chromosome segregation. One way that they do this is to hold the replicated copies of their chromosomes (known as sister chromatids) together until they are all attached properly to microtubules of the mitotic spindle. All pairs of sister chromatids must have one sister attached to each of the two spindle poles, a process known as biorientation. Here we demonstrate that the Bub1 kinase domain acts to target Sgo1 to budding yeast centromeres, and that both of these proteins are required for efficient biorientation of chromosomes in yeast mitosis. Bub1 kinase and Sgo1 functions become particularly important during spindle reassembly after antimicrotubule drug treatment. We propose that this is because the mutant cells fail to respond to kinetochores that are not under tension, and that they are unable to correct syntelic attachments where both sister chromatids attach to microtubules from the same spindle pole.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Fernius J, Hardwick KG (2007) Bub1 kinase targets Sgo1 to ensure efficient chromosome biorientation in budding yeast mitosis.

Sgo1p is the sole budding yeast member of the Shugoshin/MEI-S332 family (for review see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030213-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;).

This controversy might partly be due to the use of a &#x0201c;kinase-dead&#x0201d; point mutation (K733R), which has since been shown to destabilise budding yeast Bub1p &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030213-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; and could therefore display a phenotype similar to that of a <italic>bub1</italic>&#x00394;. We generated a novel K733M kinase-dead allele, but found that this protein was also unstable (K. G. Hardwick, unpublished data). Therefore, we chose to carry out a detailed analysis of the role of the Bub1 kinase domain by using a truncated Bub1 kinase allele (containing amino acids 1&#x02013;608) in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> This allele lacks the whole kinase domain and has already been shown to express a stable protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030213-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, and to efficiently bind Bub3p and Mad1p &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030213-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.

We analysed unbiased populations of cycling cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030213-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) and cultures that had been arrested in mitosis for 3 h with nocodazole.

If, during spindle reassembly, both sister kinetochores attach to microtubules from the same spindle pole (syntelically) perhaps the <italic>bub1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>K</italic> cells would be unable to detect or correct this defect. Note syntelic attachments are unlikely to result in tension across sister kinetochores. To test this possibility, we used strains that carry an array of <italic>tet</italic> operators integrated only 2 kb from the centromere on Chromosome IV and express a Tet repressor-GFP fusion protein. In addition, their spindle poles are marked with Spc42-tomato, and the strain has a methionine repressible promoter for <italic>CDC20</italic> (p<italic>MET</italic>-<italic>CDC20</italic>). By depleting Cdc20p, we can induce a metaphase arrest that is independent of spindle damage and the checkpoint. Using such strains we could directly test the ability of cells to establish proper bipolar attachment after nocodazole treatment. Amphitelic attachments were visualised as pairs of GFP-centromere (CEN) spots pulled apart by the microtubule forces of the bipolar spindle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030213-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030213-b049">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030213-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas monotelic or syntelic attachments (both monopolar) remained as single GFP-CEN spots, on the spindle axis. Cells were arrested in G1, depleted of Cdc20p, and then released into media containing benomyl and nocodazole for 3 h. The microtubule drugs were then washed out, cells kept in metaphase by continued repression of Cdc20p, and the level of biorientation was scored as two GFP dots in between two red SPBs (filled white triangle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030213-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). This procedure gave us the relative levels of biorientation, although these numbers will be underestimated, since, at the time of fixation, some cells that have established biorientation will only show one GFP dot because of the &#x0201c;breathing&#x0201d; characteristics of mitotic centromeres &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030213-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030213-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Quantitation of these images revealed a significant defect in establishing proper biorientation in both <italic>bub1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>K</italic> and <italic>sgo1</italic>&#x00394; mutants, after nocodazole release, indicating that Bub1 kinase and Sgo1p both work to ensure efficient chromosome biorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030213-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). In addition, the <italic>bub1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>K,sgo1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant showed a very similar quantitative defect in biorientation to the two single mutants, suggesting that the Bub1 kinase domain and Sgo1p are necessary for the same biorientation function.</p><p>The position of the chromosomes in these images, relative to the SPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030213-g005">Figure 5</xref>E), is consistent with them being syntelically attached: both sisters are attached to the same spindle pole and therefore localise very close to it. We have carried out live-cell analysis of these cells (unpublished data) in which we scored the numbers of cells in which the GFP-marked chromosomes were &#x0201c;breathing&#x0201d; on a short mitotic spindle. Whilst 88&#x00025; of chromosomes were observed to breathe in wild-type cells, only 56&#x00025; did in the <italic>bub1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>K</italic> and <italic>sgo1</italic>&#x00394; mutants during the time observed. We conclude that these chromosomes are most likely syntelically attached, rather than being amphitelic attachments that fail to be stretched, and that the <italic>bub1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>K</italic> and <italic>sgo1</italic>&#x00394; mutants are unable to correct these attachments. Such a defect could account for much of the chromosome loss detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030213-g004">Figure 4</xref>.

This lethality is rescued by checkpoint mutations, as no mitotic delay is imposed. In addition, doxycycline represses a dominant <italic>CDC20</italic> allele that is insensitive to the spindle checkpoint proteins because it contains a mutation in the Mad2p binding site &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030213-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.
