Set against this, however, there is strong evolutionary drive to preserve the function of male-benefit genes on the Y chromosome, and to acquire novel male-benefit genes on the Y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These opposing effects lead to a heterogeneous structure of Y chromosomal DNA, with functional genes (often male specific, sometimes highly amplified) set among a sea of degenerate pseudogenes, repetitive sequence, and parasitic transposable elements.</p><p>The long arm of the mouse Y chromosome is a spectacular example of this process, being highly repetitive, transcriptionally silent in the majority of cell types, and yet indispensable for normal spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Deletions on mouse Yq lead to teratozoospermia and reduced fertility. The severity of the phenotypes varies according to the extent of the deletion, with large deletions (&#x0003e; = 9/10 of Yq) resulting in complete infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], while smaller deletions (~2/3 of Yq) result in reduced fertility and a less severe sperm shape abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Intriguingly, the offspring of males with 2/3 Yq deletions show an approximately 60:40 sex ratio skew in favour of females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and this is due to reduced efficiency of Y-bearing sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we have made considerable progress in defining the gene content of mouse Yq, identifying two new repeat gene families (<italic>Sly, Asty</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] in addition to the one family previously known (<italic>Ssty1</italic>/2). During this work, we observed novel "recombinant" transcripts arising from loci that contain exons from both <italic>Ssty1 </italic>and <italic>Asty</italic>, and termed this new transcript <italic>Asty(rec) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Here, we describe the detailed genomic arrangement of this rearranged locus and show expression of a large variety of transcriptional variants arising from these rearranged loci. These variant transcripts are differentially regulated during testis development.</p><p>We were also interested to know how these rearranged loci arose, and whether there were further examples of such "exon shuffling" on mouse Yq. We therefore compared the genomic organisation of the loci encoding all known Yq genes to each other and to their X-linked homologues, in order to more clearly delineate the composition of the novel rearranged loci, the differences between each of the Yq genes and their X-linked relatives, and the sequence of events involved in the genesis and amplification of these genes.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the wider genomic context of the rearranged loci by <italic>in silico </italic>mapping of the location of all known MSYq genes within the currently-released draft Y chromosome sequence contigs. The MSYq gene copies located by the mapping project were used to construct phylogenetic trees elucidating the sequence of events in MSYq evolution</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>A rearranged locus formed by chimerism between three Yq-specific genes</title><p>While we previously reported the presence of both <italic>Ssty1 </italic>and <italic>Asty </italic>exons within the locus encoding <italic>Asty(rec) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], further analysis of public genome sequence data shows this locus to be entirely composed of regions with high sequence similarity (greater than 90% across all regions) to members of all three known Yq-linked gene families. The structure of this novel locus is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. It comprises sequence homologous to exons 1, 2 and partial exon 3 of <italic>Ssty1</italic>, followed by exons 2&#x02013;4 of <italic>Asty</italic>, followed by exons 1&#x02013;2 (and partial intron 2) of <italic>Sly </italic>in the opposite orientation. Since the locus contains segments of all three Yq-linked gene families, we feel the designation <italic>Asty(rec) </italic>is no longer appropriate. Given its highly unusual composition, and the fact that it is transcribed in both directions, we propose the name <italic>Orly </italic>(<underline>O</underline>ppositely-transcribed, <underline>r</underline>eassorted <underline>l</underline>ocus on the <underline>Y</underline>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Characterisation of <italic>Orly </italic>transcripts. <bold>A</bold>: Structure of <italic>Orly </italic>as a chimera of relict partial <italic>Ssty1</italic>, <italic>Asty </italic>and <italic>Sly </italic>loci (not to scale).

Two faint larger bands were also detected by the S1.f2/N2.r2 primer pair (arrowed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), however, we were unable to obtain sequence for these products. These upper bands are likely to represent transcripts including portions of <italic>Ssty1 </italic>exons 2/3 or <italic>Asty </italic>exons 2&#x02013;4, as detected in the other reactions (see below). No larger bands were seen in the S1.f1/N2.r1 reaction. It is possible that the larger bands detected by the S1.f2/N2.r2 primer pair arises from copies of the <italic>Orly </italic>locus where the exon S1.f1 and/or N2.r1 primer binding sites are mutated.</p><p>Using primer pairs directed at the other <italic>Orly_v2 </italic>exons gave a wide variety of bands. Many of the products generated from RT-PCR on adult testis were gel purified and sequenced to confirm which regions of <italic>Orly </italic>are included in each detected transcript. Unfortunately we were unable to generate clean sequence for the products produced by the S3a.f/A3.r primer pair. This is likely due to the presence of a large number of similarly-sized transcripts which cannot be separated on a gel. The resulting partial transcriptional map for <italic>Orly </italic>is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>. In most cases, the sequenced bands correspond to spliced transcripts, however, the majority of the products do not conform to the splicing pattern of <italic>Orly_v1 </italic>or <italic>Orly_v2</italic>. It appears that there is a plethora of different <italic>Orly </italic>isoforms expressed at low levels, which are only detected when specific primers are used.</p><p>We investigated whether any of the detected <italic>Orly </italic>isoforms had any significant coding potential. The <italic>Ssty1 </italic>open reading frame is encoded by exon 3 of <italic>Ssty1</italic>, which is not fully included in any <italic>Orly </italic>transcriptional variant (though two shorter forms of this exon are variably included). <italic>Orly </italic>transcripts thus do not encode the SSTY1 protein. The <italic>Sly </italic>portion of the locus is in antisense, thus <italic>Orly </italic>transcripts cannot encode any portion of SLY. Finally, <italic>Asty </italic>does not contain any open reading frame, thus the <italic>Asty</italic>-related portion of <italic>Orly </italic>also has no coding potential. Further electronic searching of the various <italic>Orly </italic>transcriptional variants revealed no significant open reading frames other than a partial degenerate retroviral <italic>pol </italic>sequence (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Orly retains potential promoter sequence from both <italic>Ssty1 </italic>and <italic>Sly</italic></title><p>The regions of high sequence identity between <italic>Orly </italic>and its various progenitor loci extend a further 5 kb into the upstream region of <italic>Ssty</italic>, and 3 kb into the upstream region of <italic>Sly</italic>, indicating that the rearranged locus has retained the proximal upstream promoter regions of both genes, in antisense orientation relative to each other (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"/>). <italic>Orly_v1 </italic>and <italic>Orly_v2 </italic>are known to be transcribed from the relict <italic>Ssty1 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], which is thus shown to be functional.</p><p>Turning to the relict <italic>Sly </italic>promoter region, we conducted a search for transcription factor binding sites using TFSEARCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This showed that of the 42 predicted transcription factor binding located between -600 and +10 of the reference <italic>Sly </italic>sequence, 35 were present at the corresponding site in <italic>Orly</italic>, indicating retention of potentially functional promoter elements (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Overall sequence identity between <italic>Sly </italic>and <italic>Orly </italic>across this region is 95.7%. Significantly, the conserved elements include a GCCAAT box at position -161 of the reference <italic>Sly </italic>locus. This motif is a strong transcriptional signal, and is known to be present in other spermatid specific TATA-less promoters such as the <italic>Pgk-2 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Both of the promoters at opposite ends of <italic>Orly </italic>are functional</title><p>This electronic promoter analysis suggested to us that the relict <italic>Sly </italic>promoter at the 3' end of the <italic>Orly </italic>locus may have retained functionality, and be able to generate opposite-strand transcripts. We designate such opposite-strand transcripts as <italic>Orlyos</italic>. No <italic>Orlyos </italic>transcripts were present in the nr or dbEST databases. We used strand-specific RT-PCR to determine whether any of the bands shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> corresponded to <italic>Orlyos </italic>transcripts.</p><p>Importantly, of the three bands obtained using the N1.f/N2.r2 primer pair, the lower band corresponds to a forward orientation (<italic>Orly</italic>) transcript, while the upper band corresponds to a reverse orientation transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Sequencing confirmed that this RT-PCR product shows 99% identity to the reference <italic>Orly </italic>genomic sequence over 622 nt, and only 91% identity to <italic>Sly </italic>over 464 nt. This demonstrates that this transcript arises from an <italic>Orly </italic>locus rather than from <italic>Sly</italic>, and constitutes a true <italic>Orlyos </italic>transcript. The middle band seen in this reaction is not always detected by RT-PCR, and we were unable to determine the direction of transcription of this band.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>RT-PCR on adult testis using primer pair N1.f/N2.r2.

As discussed above, this section of <italic>Orly </italic>is also transcribed in the opposite orientation, generating <italic>Orlyos </italic>transcripts. Thus there is the potential for <italic>Orly </italic>transcripts to form dsRNA either by pairing with <italic>Orlyos </italic>transcripts or with nascent <italic>Sly </italic>transcripts.</p><p>Exons N1 and N2 derive from a partial degenerate retrovirus belonging to the MuRVY lineage of mouse Y chromosome specific repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which is embedded in this intron of <italic>Sly </italic>(see below). <italic>Orly-F </italic>transcripts terminate at the transcription stop site of this MuRVY-related element. We therefore deduce that although the MuRVY element is degenerate and does not encode a functional retrovirus, its transcriptional termination site has remained functional and become co-opted to form the transcriptional termination site for <italic>Orly </italic>forward transcripts. None of the known <italic>Orly </italic>transcripts contain any large open reading frames, however, <italic>Orly_v1 </italic>contains a short ORF running from bases 117&#x02013;284. This ORF has 63% identity and 75% similarity over 49aa to a partial <italic>pol </italic>gene (data not shown), further demonstrating the retroviral origin of the terminal exons of <italic>Orly</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of <italic>Orly </italic>isoforms</title><p><italic>Orly </italic>transcripts are under tight transcriptional control. All variant forms (both forward and reverse) are only observed after day 19 of postnatal life, and thus are deduced to be spermatid-specific. This is to be expected as both <italic>Ssty1 </italic>and <italic>Sly </italic>promoters are spermatid specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The age of first appearance for each band varied from day 19 to 23, indicating differential regulation of <italic>Orly </italic>isoforms in successive spermatid stages. This variation was observed both between different primer pairs (e.g. the majority of S1.f1/A4.r bands appear at 23 dpp, while the majority of S1.f1/A3.r bands appear at 21 dpp), and between different bands detected by the same primer pair (e.g. the upper, lower and middle bands in the N1.f/N2.r2 reaction appear at 19, 21 and 23 days respectively). This differential regulation may be due to spermatid stage dependent splicing of transcripts, or may represent varying subsets of transcripts arising from different copies of <italic>Orly </italic>with subtly different promoter activities. It is unfortunately not possible to use <italic>in situ </italic>or Northern blot data to confirm the detailed cellular expression patterns of these transcripts, since there is no portion of any of them which is not also part of a different Y-linked gene or retrovirus with a confounding expression pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic comparisons of <italic>Orly</italic>, its progenitor loci, and their X homologues</title><p>We carried out a detailed comparison of the genomic loci encoding <italic>Orly</italic>, the other MSYq genes and their X counterparts, in order to better delineate the sequence of events during MSYq evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic comparison of <italic>Ssty1 </italic>and <italic>Ssty2</italic></title><p>The structure of the reference genomic loci encoding <italic>Ssty1/2 </italic>is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> for ClustalW alignment). Sequence identity is 82.7% across the locus as a whole. The coding region is conserved (barring the final 5 amino acids of <italic>Ssty1</italic>), and lies entirely within exon 3. Sequence identity within the coding region is 86.4%. The splice site at the end of the first exon is conserved. <italic>Ssty2 </italic>does not incorporate sequence corresponding to exon 2 of <italic>Ssty1</italic>. The splice site at the start of the terminal exon is located differently in <italic>Ssty1 </italic>and <italic>Ssty2</italic>, the latter thus having a longer terminal exon which in part matches intronic sequence from <italic>Ssty1</italic>. The 5'UTRs of the two gene transcripts are thus very different despite the high sequence identity between the loci.

The first repeat family contains representatives of all Yq genes including <italic>Orly </italic>and constitutes the Huge Repeat Array, while the second specifically contains <italic>Ssty1 </italic>and <italic>Asty</italic>.</p><p>At present unresolved is the question of when the MuRVY retrovirus arrived on Yq. The presence of MuRVY-related sequence within intron 2 of every copy of <italic>Sly </italic>indicates that <italic>Sly </italic>acquired its MuRVY-derived insert in intron 2 some time between stages (3) and (6), however, the origin of MuRVY itself cannot be placed in the above sequence from available evidence.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We report here on the genomic locus <italic>Orly </italic>and the wide variety of alternatively spliced transcripts arising from it. <italic>Orly </italic>has a complex and unusual genomic structure, being derived from partial copies of three other Yq-linked genes. Intriguingly, we also found <italic>Sly </italic>to be derived by combination of existing genes, in this case a fusion of the 5' region of <italic>Xmr </italic>with the 3' region of <italic>Xlr</italic>, together with an internal duplication of exons 3&#x02013;4 of the <italic>Xmr</italic>-derived segment. This may indicate that chimerism and "exon shuffling" are a general feature of novel Y chromosome gene creation. Significantly, the two outermost partial gene loci contributing to <italic>Orly </italic>are in antisense orientation relative to each other, and retain their upstream promoter regions. We detected <italic>Orlyos </italic>transcripts in addition to <italic>Orly </italic>transcripts, and thus deduce that both promoters have retained their activity. In particular, exons N1, N2 and the intervening intron are transcribed in both directions. This region derives from a MuRVY retroviral insertion into intron 2 of <italic>Sly</italic>.</p><p>There is an intriguing parallel to be drawn with the <italic>Stellate </italic>system in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where there is a sense/antisense regulatory loop between X-encoded <italic>Stellate </italic>and Y-encoded <italic>Su(Ste) </italic>repeat genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the case of <italic>Stellate</italic>, the Y gene arose from the X gene by insertion of a transposon (with active promoter) in reverse orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Antisense <italic>Su(Ste) </italic>transcripts primed from the transposon promoter act to regulate both sense <italic>Su(Ste) </italic>and <italic>Stellate </italic>transcript levels via an RNAi mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>Orly </italic>and <italic>Orlyos </italic>transcripts could potentially regulate each other and also <italic>Sly</italic>. A key avenue of future work is to determine the full length sequence of <italic>Orlyos</italic>, in particular whether it contains any <italic>Ssty1- </italic>or <italic>Asty-</italic>derived regions which may in turn regulate these genes.</p><p>The comparison to <italic>Stellate </italic>is especially interesting given the sex ratio skewing in male mice bearing partial Yq deletions. Partial deletions of the repressor <italic>Su(Ste) </italic>on <italic>Drosophila </italic>Y chromosome lead to sex ratio skewing or infertility dependent upon the X chromosomal <italic>Stellate </italic>haplotype present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. <italic>Stellate </italic>was hypothesised to be a meiotic drive gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], although this is now disputed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In male mice, partial deletions of Yq lead to mild teratozoospermia and sex ratio skewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], with reduced effectiveness of Y-bearing sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Larger deletions lead to severe teratozoospermia and infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The mice with partial deletions show normal fertility and fecundity (in terms of number of successful matings and number of offspring per litter), thus the only effect of the decrease in Yq gene copy number appears to be the sex ratio skew.</p><p>It should be understood that the sex ratio skew in mouse with Yq deletions does not constitute meiotic drive in the classical sense, since equal numbers of X- and Y-bearing gametes are generated at meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, the presence of Yq-encoded genes affecting sex ratio indicates the potential for a conflict between these Yq-encoded genes and other interacting X- or autosomally-encoded factors. Given that Yq deletion also leads to a spermatid-specific derepression of X transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], with increasing X gene expression correlated with the extent of the deletion, we have suggested that there may indeed be an ongoing genomic conflict between the mouse X and Y chromosomes, with X-linked sex ratio distorter genes acting to favour generation of female offspring, and Yq-linked repressor genes acting to restore a normal 50:50 sex ratio. Such an intragenomic conflict is expected to lead to massive amplification of gene number on both chromosomes due to an "arms race" between the conflicting genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Intriguingly, the hybrid sterility seen in <italic>Mus musculus musculus</italic>/<italic>Mus musculus molossinus </italic>consomic strains is X-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Whether genomic conflict is involved or not, the fact that Yq-encoded genes are necessary for normal levels of Y chromosome transmission necessarily leads to a strong and direct evolutionary pressure to maintain the function of these genes. This may be one of the factors behind the recent and highly unusual gene amplification seen on mouse Yq. <italic>Orly</italic>, being composed of portions of all the other known MSYq-linked genes, must also necessarily be the most recent known addition to MSYq gene content.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Orly </italic>is a novel chimeric locus on mouse chromosome Yq which is bidirectionally transcribed, giving rise to <italic>Orly </italic>and <italic>Orlyos </italic>transcripts. These transcripts may potentially form dsRNA in partnership with each other, or with the progenitor loci <italic>Ssty1</italic>,<italic>Asty </italic>and <italic>Sly</italic>. A phylogenetic tree analysis of Yq genes indicates that <italic>Orly </italic>arose shortly prior to a massive expansion in copy number of all the Yq-linked genes. Also, potentially significantly, copies of <italic>Orly </italic>are only found in the context of the Huge Repeat Array that distinguishes MSYq &#x02013; a particular segment of around 500 kb that appears to have been amplified <italic>en bloc</italic>. Taking the above evidence together, we propose that the emergence of <italic>Orly </italic>may have been one of the triggers that led to massive amplification of Yq sequence. Further analysis of the genomic complement of MSYq, and the copy number of the corresponding X genes, in a range of different mouse subspecies should help date these events more precisely, and establish whether X-Y genomic competition is a contributing factor to the gene amplifications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sequence comparison and detection of copies of Yq-linked genes</title><p>Nucleotide sequence alignment was performed using BLAST and ClustalW.
