Perlecan absence does not impair basal lamina assembly, although in the 55% of the mutants early disruptions of this lamina conducts to exencephaly, impairing brain development. The rest of perlecan-null brains complete its prenatal development, maintain basal lamina continuity interrupted by some isolated ectopias, and are microcephalic. Microcephaly consists of thinner cerebral walls and underdeveloped ganglionic eminences. We have studied the mechanisms that generate brain atrophy in telencephalic areas where basal lamina is intact.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Brain atrophy in the absence of perlecan started in the ventral forebrain and extended to lateral and dorsal parts of the cortex in the following stages. First, the subpallial forebrain developed poorly in early perlecan-null embryos, because of a reduced cell proliferation: the number of cells in mitosis decreased since the early stages of development. This reduction resulted in a decreased tangential migration of interneurons to the cerebral cortex. Concomitant with the early hypoplasia observed in the medial ganglionic eminences, Sonic Hedgehog signal decreased in the perlecan-null floor plate basal lamina at E12.5. Second, neurogenesis in the pallial neuroepithelium was affected in perlecan deficient embryos. We found reductions of nearly 50% in the number of cells exiting the cell cycle at E12&#x02013;E13. The labeling index, which was normal at this age, significantly decreased with advancing corticogenesis. Moreover, nestin<sup>+ </sup>or PCNA<sup>+ </sup>progenitors increased since E14.5, reaching up to about 150% of the proportion of PCNA<sup>+ </sup>cells in the wild-type at E17.5. Thus, labeling index reduction together with increased progenitor population, suggests that atrophy is the result of altered cell cycle progression in the cortical progenitors. Accordingly, less neurons populated the cortical plate and subplate of perlecan-null neocortex, as seen with the neuronal markers &#x003b2;-tubulin and Tbr1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>As a component of the basal lamina, perlecan both maintains this structure and controls the response of the neuroepithelium to growth factors. Less mitotic cells in the early medial ganglionic eminences, and impaired cell cycle progression in the late neocortex, suggests insufficient recruitment and signaling by neurogenic morphogens, such as SHH or FGF2.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>During the histogenesis of the cerebral cortex, neural precursor cells in the anlage of the cortical hemispheres as well as in the subpallium withdraw from the cell cycle and migrate in an ordered manner following multidirectional pathways to generate a functional neuronal architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Proliferation and cell fate determination in the developing brain are extrinsically regulated by multiple interactions among a large number of secreted molecules, such as Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], which usually act in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentrations of these morphogens are modulated in turn by components of the extracellular matrix (ECM).</p><p>Perlecan is one of the most ubiquitous and multifunctional ECM proteins. The proteoglycan is expressed during the prenatal stages of brain development in the basal laminae of the neuroepithelium and of blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Perlecan binds with varying avidity to many diverse macromolecules. These include cell-surface receptors such as &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;3 integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and &#x003b1;-dystroglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; other ECM proteins such as nidogen, collagen IV, laminin, fibulin and fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; a number of signaling molecules such as FGF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], FGF7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]; and enzymes such as acetyl cholinesterase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In particular, it is well known that the heparan sulfate (HS) moieties of perlecan interact with growth factors, regulating their interaction with cell surface receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of perlecan-null mice has demonstrated essential roles of this proteoglycan during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The absence of perlecan does not compromise assembly of basement membranes. However, perlecan-deficient embryos showed severe chondrodysplasia, life-threatening malformations of the heart outflow tract, as well as impaired telencephalic development. Perlecan-null mice die before birth due to their bone and heart malformations.</p><p>In a previous publication, we reported that many of homozygote perlecan-null embryos presented exencephaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We showed that exencephaly was not due to impaired neural tube closure, but to an ulterior disruption of the developing cerebral cortex caused by the invasion of neural cells into the meningeal layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, even perlecan-null embryos without exencephaly showed manifold morphogenetic alterations of the brain. This observation suggested that these embryos might serve to analyze major physiological functions of the protein in telencephalon morphogenesis. In the present investigation, we studied in detail brain development in perlecan-null embryos that do not show exencephaly. We conclude that perlecan potentiates cell cycle progression and neuronal differentiation in the cerebral hemispheres and ventral forebrain. Our data suggest that perlecan could critically regulate the availability of a crucial morphogen, such as SHH, in the floor plate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Two brain phenotypes converge in perlecan-null embryos</title><p>In the present analysis, we selected perlecan-deficient embryos that were not exencephalic. Whilst all homozygote perlecan-null embryos depicted cerebral ectopias, only about the 55% developed exencephaly. Ectopias are invasions of the meningeal layers by neuroblasts after the disruption of basal lamina. As previously reported, in the most early (about E10.5) and severe cases these invasions opened the neural tube in the frontal part of the cerebral hemispheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] driving to exencephaly, which prevents the brain to complete its development. Milder ectopias did not induce <italic>de novo </italic>generation of cortical openings. In these cases, ectopic cells did not proliferate and remained trapped within the marginal zone generating distortion of the cortical layers but allowing the brain to complete development. Non-exencephalic embryos, which represent the remaining 45% of the perlecan-deficient embryos, invariably displayed a hypoplasic brain phenotype. Typically, in these animals we observed the cerebral cortex to proceed along development. It showed an obvious lamination, with a clear differentiation of cortical compartments such as preplate and, later, marginal zone, subplate and the cortical plate. Occasionally, and most commonly near the rostral pole of the telencephalon, isolated ectopias were evident. We considered these brains useful to analyze critical functions of perlecan during corticogenesis. As a control in assessing such a hypoplasic phenotype, after a visual inspection of the embryos, we sectioned the brains serially and observed all the sections carefully. We discarded as exencephalic those brains showing openings of the cerebral wall. For the current investigation, we have analyzed 24 perlecan-null non-exencephalic embryos and 36 wild-type ones, ranging from embryonic day (E) 10.5 to E17.5, distributed in 18 litters.</p></sec><sec><title>Non-exencephalic perlecan-deficient embryos are microcephalic</title><p>The non-exencephalic perlecan-null embryos showed drastic reductions in the size of telencephalon. It is important to recall that perlecan-null embryos do not display reductions in the size of the rest of the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

At E12.5 and E13.5, the overall morphology was normal in the mutant telencephalon.

In all perlecan-null embryos, the MGEs cross-sectional area ranged between 24% and 70% of that of wild-type embryos of the same litters. At E15.5, LGE in addition to the MGE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H &#x02013; I</xref>) and the CGE (not shown) showed striking reductions in size as compared with wild-type littermates.

At this age, brain reduction resulted mainly from a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the ventral telencephalon, but also the cerebral wall was significantly thinner mainly due to reduced cortical plate thickness (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L &#x02013; M</xref>). In addition, a number of ectopias were visible in the cortical plate, which distorted the cortical laminar pattern (arrows in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>). The ectopias consisted of groups of early-generated neurons that invaded the meningeal layers disrupting the basal lamina, as shown by laminin immunostaining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1N &#x02013; O</xref>). This figure shows that in both perlecan-null embryos and wild-type littermates, basal lamina assembled normally in the cerebral surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1P</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the perlecan-null embryos that complete their prenatal development were microcephalic. The cerebral hypoplasia progressed following a ventromedial-to-laterodorsal sequence along brain development. The brains maintained basal lamina continuity, interrupted by some isolated ectopias.</p></sec><sec><title>The cell proliferation in the forebrain decays in the absence of perlecan</title><p>To understand the cellular mechanisms involved in the brain hypoplasia, we measured proliferation in the ventricular (VZ) and subventricular zones (SVZ) of the pallium and subpallium. To this purpose, we first used an antibody to the M phase marker histone H3 phosphorylated on Ser 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A &#x02013; B</xref>). We quantified the mitotic index as the ratio between the number of metaphase phospho-histone H3<sup>+ </sup>(pH3<sup>+</sup>) cells referred to the number of progenitor cells in the same area, marked with antibodies to Ki67 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>; see Methods). We found that cells in metaphase distributed uniformly along the ventricular surface of the telencephalic vesicles until E12.5 (data not shown). At E13.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A &#x02013; B</xref>), a secondary mitotic population, called basal progenitors, appeared in the SVZ of the cortical primordium. In parallel with the progression of hypoplasia, the mitotic index was reduced in the perlecan mutants, starting in the medio-ventral telencephalon and reaching the cortex at advanced corticogenesis. At E13.5, the perlecan-null brains had a mitotic index similar to that of wild-type embryos in the cortex, but displayed a reduced index in the MGE (2.6% in perlecan-null mice vs. 4.0% in wild-type mice; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). At E16.5, the mitotic index was reduced in the perlecan-null neocortex to about a 60% of that in the wild-type, and the reduction affected both the VZ and the SVZ (basal) progenitors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Thus, reduced proliferation seemed to contribute to brain hypoplasia.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cell proliferation decays in the absence of perlecan</bold>.

We examined the telencephalon for the presence of DNA fragments that are direct evidence of programmed cell death using TUNEL staining. No significant changes in the number of TUNEL<sup>+ </sup>cells were detectable in the neocortex and basal ganglia of perlecan-null embryos. In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D,E</xref> we show the TUNEL stained neocortex of E15.5 wild-type and perlecan-null embryos. At this age, few apoptotic cells were detectable by TUNEL staining in the developing cortex, and we observed no significant differences in the perlecan-null embryos. Thus, cell death must not be a major agent in generating underdeveloped cerebral walls and subpallium in perlecan mutants. However, the contribution of cell death to brain hypoplasia cannot be discarded completely, since it is known that the TUNEL method does not detect all cells that die during prenatal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>In the perlecan-null neocortex, the labeling index is normal at the beginning of cortical neurogenesis, but decreases at late stages</title><p>The impaired mitotic index observed in the pallium suggests that low proliferation of cortical progenitors in the VZ and SVZ might contribute to the reduction of cortical size. The onset of such a process of low proliferation in the cerebral wall occurred at the time corticogenesis is well advanced, i.e., later than in the ventral forebrain. We studied in detail proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the cortex at two representative time points: E12.5&#x02013;E13.5, which represents an early stage of corticogenesis, and E16.5, which represents a late stage.</p><p>To analyze the rates of proliferation of neuronal precursors in the cortical primordium, we used BrdU pulse labeling and survival periods of either 30 min, 4, or 24 hours combined with Ki67 staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Thirty min after a BrdU pulse, BrdU-labeled cells appeared distributed throughout the VZ and SVZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A &#x02013; B</xref>).

Therefore, the length of G<sub>2</sub>/M phase did not change in the perlecan-null embryos at E16.5 and, thus, could not contribute to the detected decay in proliferation rate.

In the perlecan-null embryos, in accord with the reduced cell cycle exiting population, the thickness of the &#x003b2;-tubulin<sup>+ </sup>layer was reduced not only in the pallium (see also, Haubst et al., 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]), but also in the mantle of the septal and ganglionic eminences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The decrease of neuronal differentiation in the perlecan-null embryos was even more obvious in the late developing stages. Thus, at E16.5 &#x003b2;-tubulin marked cells within the marginal layer and the cortical subplate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, &#x003b2;-tubulin immunoreactivity in the subplate was significantly less dense in the perlecan-null embryos than in the wild-type littermates.

The neurons that populate the MZ and the SP initially reside in the preplate, formed at about E12.5, so that these results suggest that perlecan is critical for the differentiation of the earliest generated neurons at this age.

In particular, laminin on the one hand and glial integrins and &#x003b1;-dystroglycan on the other are required for anchorage of glial endfeet to the pial basal lamina, and mice defective in these proteins exhibit abundant ectopias and disorganization of the cortical marginal zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In a previous work, we reported that perlecan-null embryos present cortical ectopias or exencephaly. Further, we showed that exencephaly is due to very early disruption of the cortical plate, caused in turn by invasion of neurons into meningeal layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the rest of perlecan knockouts, ectopias set off at or before E12.5. With advancing corticogenesis, the clusters of early-generated neurons that form the ectopias settle abnormally and remain trapped in the marginal zone of the cortex.</p><p>Among other components of the basal lamina, perlecan bind cell receptors such as integrins and &#x003b1;-dystroglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, and in marked contrast with laminin, &#x003b1;-dystroglycan or &#x003b2;1-integrin, perlecan is not essential for extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and a basal lamina covers most of the cerebral surface of perlecan-null embryos. Nevertheless, the ectopias that form in the perlecan mutants appear to result from defects in the structure of the perlecan-defective basal lamina.</p><p>In a recent paper, Gotz and co-workers reported that mutant mice with defects in the continuity of the basal lamina due to a mutated nidogen-binding site in laminin &#x003b3;1 chain, or to perlecan or &#x003b1;6-integrin knockouts, exhibit normal neurogenesis and proliferation in the ectopic areas where radial glia has lost contact with the basal lamina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These authors infer from these results that the attachment of radial glia endfeet to the basal lamina does not play an important role in the control of radial glia proliferation and fate. This attachment could be, however, functionally relevant for positioning neurons during their radial migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Based on a much more extended material, we show here that perlecan-null brains undergo cortical neurogenesis indeed, but this process is severely impaired since the earliest stages and implies profound reductions in the thickness of the cortical plate. Moreover, we show here that these alterations affect non-ectopic areas, an aspect unanalyzed in their report. Along these lines, it is also noteworthy that brains of mouse embryos mutated in laminin &#x003b3;1III4 chain or with a brain-selective deletion of &#x003b2;1-integrin invariably exhibit significant reductions in the size of the telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. We consider that this hitherto unexplained defect and our present observations are highly relevant to understand the cues that link basal membrane and neurogenesis.</p><p>To ascertain in detail the developmental roles of perlecan and of basal lamina in neurogenesis, we centered our current analysis in brain areas that were devoid of ectopias. In these regions, the basal lamina is present in the brain surface, and radial glia endfeet are in their proper subpial positions.</p><sec><title>Regulation of neurogenesis by perlecan</title><p>Atrophy in the perlecan mutants is detectable much earlier in the ventral telencephalon than in the cortical primordium and progresses in a medial-to-lateral direction. Thus, between E12.5 and E13.5, the size of the medial ganglionic eminence in perlecan-null embryos was severely reduced, while those of the LGEs and dorsal telencephalon were normal. During the following days, atrophy extended to the whole ventral telencephalon and paleocortex. A compromised tangential migration of MGE-derived interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] could perhaps account for paleocortex atrophy. At intermediate stages (E15.5), reduction in size of the ventral telencephalon provided an elongated appearance to the neocortex. Such an elongated aspect has also been described in laminin mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and invoked to explain the reduction of cortical thickness in these mutants. However, in the late (E17.5) perlecan-null brains the neocortex is not more elongated than in the wild-type, and the whole telencephalon is reduced in size.</p><p>During corticogenesis, cell cycle exit, neuronal differentiation and migration are coordinately regulated. At E17.5, the non-ectopic areas of the cerebral cortex of perlecan-null brains had a normal layering thus implying normal radial migration, but the cortical plate was strongly reduced in thickness. The initial defect is a decay of neuronal differentiation: at E13.5, the fraction of cells exiting cell cycle reduced by nearly one-half of normal values in perlecan-null embryos. In good correspondence, immunostaining for Tbr1, which marks different populations of early-generated neurons of the developing cerebral cortex, and &#x003b2;III-tubulin, a general neuronal marker, revealed a reduction in the packing density of neurons in the perlecan-null cortical plate and subplate. Finally, we found the neocortex of perlecan-null embryos to have much less presumptive interneurons in the cortical plate than their wild-type littermates. The decrease of interneurons is probably the consequence of the initial atrophy that occurs in the ventral forebrain, because the MGE is the major source of tangentially migrating neurons bound to the neocortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In apparent contradiction with the reduced mitotic index, in the perlecan-null primordium we have demonstrated a progressive increase in the proportion of progenitor cells that express nestin or PCNA. At E14.5 the proportion of PCNA<sup>+ </sup>cells, among the total cell content, increased up to 127%, and at E17.5 reached up to the 150% of the proportion in the wild-type littermates. These data denote an immature status of perlecan defective brain at late corticogenesis.</p><p>We note that in other mice mutants, such as the &#x003b1;E-catenin-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and &#x003b2;-catenin overexpressing mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], lack of neuronal differentiation results in bigger brains due to early increases of the progenitor population. This is in contrast to perlecan mutants, where the progenitor population increases only during the most advanced stages of corticogenesis, and the labeling index diminishes concomitantly. This difference might well explain the opposite phenotype observed in &#x003b1;E- and &#x003b2;-catenin <italic>vs</italic>. perlecan mutant mice.</p><p>To understand this difference, it is important to stress that in perlecan-null mice the labeling index is unaltered at the onset (E12.5&#x02013;E13.5) of corticogenesis, but it decreases as corticogenesis proceeds. In mammalian cells, the length of S phase remains relatively constant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and no changes in the length of the G<sub>2</sub>/M phases were detectable in perlecan-deficient neocortex. Thus, it seems likely that the lengthening of cell cycle observed in the absence of perlecan is due to an extension of the G<sub>1 </sub>phase. This would in turn result in a progressively increasing fraction of postmitotic cells that cannot become neurons and continue undifferentiated, but have lost the potential to initiate a new S phase. This dormant G<sub>o </sub>state has been described in brain culture, but is considered an abnormal fate option for neuronal precursors in the neuroepithelium that may result from trophic factor deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We will further discuss this aspect below.</p><p>Hypoplasia could also result from an increase in the number of dying cells in the perlecan-null brain. We did not detect changes in the apoptotic cell population in the cortex of perlecan mutants at E10.5&#x02013;11.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and at E15.5 (present data). Blaschke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] identified a population of dying cells among the progenitor pool in the developing cortical VZ that accounts an average of approximately 50% of the progenitor population. This population is much larger than the apoptotic pool detected with the standard method of TUNEL or with antibodies to activated caspase 3. Although a detailed study on this apoptotic population in perlecan-null mice is necessary to discard that cell death is playing a role in the cerebral hypoplasia, the observed progressive increase of the progenitor population seems to suggest that apoptosis is not playing a relevant role in brain atrophy.</p><p>In summary, less proliferation in both the ventral telencephalon and the cortex will result in decrease of tangentially migrating neurons and less neuronal differentiation in the cerebral cortex, respectively, and may explain the outstanding reduction of cortical thickness that occurs in these knockout mice.</p></sec><sec><title>What are the mechanisms by which perlecan promotes brain maturation?</title><p>Diverse morphogens modulate cell division and neuronal fate in a concentration-dependent manner.

In particular, the heparan sulfate chains of the proteoglycan specifically bind two morphogens that are likely candidates to explain the observed brain phenotype, namely Sonic hedgehog (SHH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>SHH is absolutely required for ventral brain expansion and maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], including the specification of MGE-generated cortical interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In the perlecan deficient embryos, brain atrophy starts at about E12.5 and has a ventromedial-to-lateral progression. SHH protein diffuses into the brain following a ventromedial-to-lateral pattern, which coincides with the direction of brain atrophy progression in perlecan-deficient embryos. The strong immunocytochemical SHH signal found within the floor plate and basal lamina at E10.5&#x02013;E12.5 probably reflects the fact that SHH is translocated into the brain, where it forms active multimeric complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In the perlecan-null embryos, neither SHH distribution within the neuroepithelium nor expression of its receptor, Ptch1, was impaired.</p><p>However, a marked reduction in the intensity of the SHH signal in the basal part of forebrain at E10.5&#x02013;E12.5, and the absence of SHH immunostaining in basal lamina of the perlecan-null embryos suggests a role for the proteoglycan in the spreading of SHH complexes. Accordingly, we propose that perlecan is required to concentrate SHH signal in the floor plate, in order to facilitate its proper delivery to the neural plate at the exact concentration and time needed for correct brain development. Along these lines, the perlecan homologue in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>trol</italic>, regulates the timing of neuroblast proliferation by modulating FGF and Hedgehog signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Further, SHH interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans promote maximal proliferation of postnatal granule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In addition to its role in ventral neural tube patterning, SHH participates in the control of progenitor cell number in developing dorsal brain. Although neither immunostaining nor in situ hybridization allowed to detect SHH in this compartment, more sensitive RT-PCR analyses indicate that SHH is present in the neocortex since E14.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This possibility is compatible with our data showing the presence of the SHH receptor Ptch1 in the neocortex. The retarded diffusion of SHH into the perlecan-null cerebral wall could explain the delayed atrophy in this compartment in mutant mice. Nevertheless, additional direct evidence is still needed to conclusively establish that cerebral hypoplasia in the perlecan mutants is secondary to delayed SHH signal.</p><p>In addition to SHH, FGF signaling is required both for generating ventral precursors and for promoting their differentiation in the telencephalon, as nicely shown in the FGFR1; FGFR2 double mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Mice lacking FGF2 exhibit a reduced density and number of neurons in the neocortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], and microinjection of FGF2 into the cerebral ventricles shortens the cell cycle and increases the number of cortical neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In addition, the pallial defect of perlecan-null embryos strongly resembles that seen in mice with a conditional disruption of EXT1, the HS-polymerizing enzyme, which show an abnormally small cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Therefore, less commitment to a neuronal fate in the perlecan knockouts could alternatively result from defective FGF2 signaling of the VZ progenitors in the cerebral wall. Admittedly, we did not detect overt changes in the intensity or pattern of distribution of FGF2 protein in the telencephalon of perlecan mutants. However, we note that growth factors such as FGF2 are required in very low amounts, undetectable by standard procedures, to activate signaling. Regulation of cell cycle and commitment to neuronal differentiation takes place before the last division of progenitors and during the following G<sub>1 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Radial glia, as neural progenitor cells in the VZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], extend and retract basal processes to attach and detach from the basal lamina in a cell cycle-dependent sequence. In particular, VZ progenitors interact strongly with the basal lamina during G<sub>1</sub>, and perlecan-bound FGF2 could directly promote progression along the cell cycle and neuronal commitment at this stage.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we show that perlecan influences the size of ventral and cortical telencephalic structures. Brain atrophy starts in the ventral telencephalon, with a marked reduction of basal progenitor proliferation, and progresses in a medial-to-lateral direction. Our findings suggest insufficient recruitment and/or signaling by the morphogen SHH, in the basal lamina of the floor plate. In addition, in the cortex the presence of perlecan in the leptomeningeal basal lamina could be crucial to provide signals to induce neurogenesis and cell cycle progression in the VZ progenitor population, either through direct contacts with radial glia processes or due to its ability to stimulate FGF2 interaction with cell receptors. Crosstalk between different signaling molecules and their cell receptors is necessary to maintain cell differentiation and several extracellular matrix proteins are known to facilitate these interactions. In this context, it is important to stress that perlecan represents an important suppressor of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] and of endothelial cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Finally, we note that our findings may have important implications to understand the pathology of several human conditions, such as holoprosencephaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], neuronal heterotopias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] or microcephaly. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms controlling proliferation and differentiation of specific subsets of progenitor cells in brain may lead to the development of strategies for neural stem cell production and its utilization in brain therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Perlecan gene was inactivated in mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. As previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], deletion of the sixth exon of the perlecan gene results in the lack of expression of perlecan protein. PCR was used to genotype offspring resulting from perlecan heterozygous matings. We used two sets of oligonucleotides for genotyping. The first set of primers, 5'-AACCAGAAGGGGTGGCAAGAA-3' and 5'-GCAGCACCTCTTGAATCTGAG-3', amplifies a fragment of 500 bp between intron 5 and exon 6, which is absent in the perlecan mutants. The second set of primers, 5'-AACCAGAAGGGGTGGCAAGAA-3' and 5'-TACTGAGGCAGAGTCTCTCTC-3', amplifies an approx. 1000 bp fragment between the intronic regions 5 and 6 in the wild-type allele. In the perlecan mutant allele this fragment is reduced to 500 bp. We used the same PCR conditions for both sets of primers: denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes, followed by 35 cycles at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, and 72&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, and a final step at 72&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes. Mice heterozygous for the mutation appeared normal and did not display any overt anatomical or behavioral abnormalities. Brains were removed and either fixed in Carnoy (60% ethanol, 30% chloroform, 10% acetic acid) or in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA), embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 6&#x02013;7 &#x003bc;m.

Fluorescent secondary antibodies included goat anti-rabbit IgG tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (1:100; Abcam, UK) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa488 and goat anti-rat IgG Alexa488 (1:200; Molecular Probes). For non-fluorescent immunohistochemistry we used the following secondary antibodies: biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Vector Laboratories), biotinylated anti-goat IgG (1:200; Vector Laboratories), and biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Vector Laboratories). Immunostaining was visualized by using the ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) and a solution of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) and hydrogen peroxide. Images were obtained in a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with an Axiocam camera or with a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope equipped with an Ar 488 laser and HeNe 543 and 568 laser lines. Confocal analysis was performed in the SCIE, University of Valencia and in the Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante.</p></sec><sec><title>BrdU experiments and apoptosis labeling and detection</title><p>To track proliferating cells, we injected dams intraperitoneally with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (Sigma) at 40 mg/kg of body weight. Embryos were collected at varying time points (30 minutes, 2, 4 or 24 hours) after injection. After a 30 min survival, BrdU labels cycling cells during S-phase. Two hours survival marks cells until M-phase, and four and 24 h survival allows the detection of S-phase cells and some postmitotic neurons. The endpoints of migration of early neuronal cohorts were similarly studied, with BrdU injections to dams at E12.5 and embryo collection at E17.5. BrdU staining was performed on paraffin sections that had been pretreated to denaturate DNA (2 N HCl for 30 min at 40&#x000b0;C and then neutralized in 0.1 M sodium tetraborate). Apoptosis was analyzed on paraffin sections of 4% PFA fixed brains by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method using a commercial in situ cell death detection kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative studies of regional growth of the telencephalon and of cell proliferation</title><p>To quantify brain size at E12.5&#x02013;13.5, we measured the cross-sectional area of each telencephalic region considered on two sets of three coronal sections for each embryo at levels similar to those shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>.</p><p>PCNA and Ki67 antibodies mark the same cells, namely the progenitor population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the present study, we initially immunostained such a population with a mouse monoclonal antibody to PCNA. However, in some experiments we used Ki67 antibodies instead of anti-PCNA so that double-label immunofluorescence could be performed along with anti-BrdU. We performed simultaneous immunofluorescence staining of Ki67 and BrdU after survivals of 30 minutes, 4 hours or 24 hours post-BrdU injection. We calculated the labeling index as the number of BrdU<sup>+ </sup>cells divided by the number of Ki67<sup>+ </sup>cells in a given telencephalic region. Quitting fraction was calculated in E12.5 embryos pulsed with BrdU and retrieved 24 h later. The quitting fraction represents the ratio of BrdU<sup>+</sup>, Ki67<sup>- </sup>cells (i.e., those that have left the mitotic cycle) referred to the total number of BrdU<sup>+ </sup>cells. Mitotic index was calculated as the number of phospho-histone H3<sup>+ </sup>cells (cells in M phase) divided by the number of Ki67<sup>+ </sup>cells in a given telencephalic region. We counted phospho-histone H3<sup>+ </sup>cells in sections adjacent to those where we counted Ki67<sup>+ </sup>cells. To compare the extent of G<sub>2</sub>/M phase between wild-type and perlecan-null E16.5 neocortex, pregnant mother were injected with BrdU 2 h before killing and double labeling was performed to reveal BrdU-positive nuclei as well as mitotic cells containing phospho-histone H3, as has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].
