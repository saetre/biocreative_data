Here, we describe a new function for yeast Sem1. We show that <italic>sem1</italic> mutants are impaired in messenger RNA (mRNA) export and transcription elongation, and induce strong transcription-associated hyper-recombination phenotypes. Importantly, Sem1, independent of the RP, is functionally linked to the mRNA export pathway. Biochemical analyses revealed that, in addition to the RP, Sem1 coenriches with components of two other multisubunit complexes: the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-associated TREX-2 complex that is required for transcription-coupled mRNA export, and the COP9 signalosome, which is involved in deneddylation. Notably, targeting of Thp1, a TREX-2 component, to the NPC is perturbed in a <italic>sem1</italic> mutant. These findings reveal an unexpected nonproteasomal function of Sem1 in mRNA export and in prevention of transcription-associated genome instability. Thus, Sem1 is a versatile protein that might stabilize multiple protein complexes involved in diverse pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-driven production of mRNAs in the nucleus initiates gene expression. The nascent pre-mRNAs are processed and matured into mRNAs by several protein complexes that are loaded onto transcription sites via their interaction with the C-terminal domain of RNAPII (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reed and Cheng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sommer and Nehrbass, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole and Scarcelli, 2006</xref>). Processing and maturation events include the 5&#x02032; capping and splicing, and 3&#x02032; polyadenylation of the pre-mRNAs. Further, these steps are coupled to the dynamic interaction of mRNAs with several proteins, including export factors that facilitate their transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the cytoplasm. Studies over the past years have revealed that all steps during gene expression, starting from gene activation to the nuclear export of mRNAs, are tightly coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suntharalingam and Wente, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reed and Cheng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sommer and Nehrbass, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">K&#x000f6;hler and Hurt, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In budding yeast, the THO&#x02013;transcription export (TREX) complex and the Sac3&#x02013;Thp1&#x02013;Sus1&#x02013;Cdc31 (TREX-2; also called THSC) complex are involved in transcription-coupled mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">K&#x000f6;hler and Hurt, 2007</xref>). The THO&#x02013;TREX complex is thought to be recruited to the elongating RNAPII via the THO subunits (Hpr1, Tho2, Mft1, and Thp2), which function in transcription and biogenesis of mRNA protein complexes (messenger ribonucleoproteins [mRNPs]). The additional TREX factors Sub2 and Yra1 are involved in recruiting the Mex67-Mtr2 export receptor to the mRNP, thereby coupling mRNP biogenesis with their nuclear export (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reed and Cheng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">K&#x000f6;hler and Hurt, 2007</xref>). TREX-2 potentially coordinates Spt7-Ada2-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA)-mediated transcription of a subset of genes at the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Navarro et al., 2004</xref>). An integral component of TREX-2 is Sac3, a multidomain protein that serves as a binding platform for other members of the complex. The N-terminal and middle domain (N+M) of Sac3 binds Thp1 and Mex67-Mtr2, whereas the C-terminal domain mediates its NPC targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>) and recruits the centrin Cdc31 as well as Sus1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>). Recent works from several groups have demonstrated a requirement of TREX-2 in the dynamic repositioning of a subset of gene loci from the nuclear interior to the nuclear periphery upon their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casolari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taddei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurshakova et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In addition to their direct function in mRNA export, THO&#x02013;TREX and TREX-2 play an important role in preventing transcription-associated genomic instability. Impaired components of both complexes induce transcription elongation defects, in particular for long and GC-rich DNA sequences (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera, 2005</xref>) and repeat-containing genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voynov et al., 2006</xref>). THO and TREX-2 mutants show defects that lead to hyper-recombination phenotypes via the cotranscriptional formation of RNA/DNA hybrids (R loops) between the emerging RNA and the transcribed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huertas and Aguilera, 2003</xref>). R loops are likely to become obstacles for subsequent elongating RNAPIIs, thus impairing transcription elongation or generating mRNA-RNAPII-DNA tertiary structures that can obstruct replication, leading to genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilera and G&#x000f3;mez-Gonz&#x000e1;lez, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Sem1 is a small acidic protein that is highly conserved among all eukaryotic species. <italic>SEM1</italic> was originally isolated as a multicopy suppressor of exocyst mutants in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">J&#x000e4;ntti et al., 1999</xref>). Mutations in Sem1 lead to several pleiotropic phenotypes such as defects in exocytosis, pseudohyphal growth, and defects in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">J&#x000e4;ntti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marston et al., 1999</xref>). Genetic screens and proteomic approaches identified Sem1 as a component of the lid subcomplex of the 19S regulatory particle (RP) of the 26S proteasome in both budding yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funakoshi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krogan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joss&#x000e9; et al., 2006</xref>). Loss of Sem1 impairs the functional integrity of the proteasomal RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funakoshi et al., 2004</xref>); <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> mutants show impaired ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and accumulate poly-ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sone et al., 2004</xref>). Further, RP mutants, when combined with <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic>, show an increased sensitivity to UV radiation and DNA-damaging agents such as hydroxyurea, which suggests a role of the RP in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funakoshi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krogan et al., 2004</xref>). Dss1, the mammalian homologue of Sem1, was discovered to be a BRCA2-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marston et al., 1999</xref>) that specifically interacts with the C-terminal portion of BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Dss1 has since been shown to be essential for BRCA2 function both in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gudmundsdottir et al., 2007</xref>) and in the fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kojic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kojic et al., 2005</xref>). Depletion of Dss1 in mammalian cells induces phenotypes similar to those seen in BRCA2-deficient cells, which is attributable to a defect in homology-directed repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gudmundsdottir et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we describe a new function for the budding yeast Sem1. We provide multiple lines of evidence that Sem1, as part of TREX-2, functions in mRNA export. Moreover, we show that Sem1 is specifically enriched in distinct protein complexes, namely the RP, COP9 signalosome (CSN), and TREX-2 that function in diverse pathways. Notably, we find that targeting of Thp1 to TREX-2 is severely affected in a <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> mutant. These data suggest that Sem1 might contribute to the functional integrity of its target complexes and thereby impact diverse pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Previous studies in fission yeast demonstrated a requirement for Sem1/Dss1 in the export of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thakurta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mannen et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, genetic and visual screens in budding yeast have uncovered a role for the E3-ubiquitin ligases Tom1 and Rsp5 in the nuclear export of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neumann et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, it has remained unclear whether Sem1/Dss1 as part of the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome pathway is required for proper mRNA export or whether Sem1/Dss1 has an additional function in the mRNA export pathway. Therefore, we sought to address this issue in budding yeast using a combination of cell biological, genetic, and biochemical approaches.</p><sec><title>Sem1 but not the RP is required for nuclear poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA export</title><p>We initiated our analysis by asking whether a budding yeast strain deficient for Sem1 (<italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic>) exhibits nuclear accumulation of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA.

This phenotype was also observed at 25&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C (not depicted). Furthermore, the nuclear accumulation of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA was found to be comparable to TREX-2 deletion mutants (i.e., <italic>thp1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>sac3&#x00394;</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>) but less severe than in the <italic>mex67-5</italic> strain at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA export is inhibited in <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> but is not impaired in mutants of the RP.</bold> (A) The depicted yeast strains were grown in YPD at 30&#x000b0;C; the localization of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA in the strains was assessed by in situ hybridization using Cy3-oligo (dT)<sup>30</sup>, and DNA was stained with DAPI.

Neither <italic>cim3-1</italic> nor <italic>cim5-1</italic> were found to show this phenotype at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Finally, the treatment of the drug-permeable yeast strain <italic>erg6&#x00394;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee and Goldberg, 1998</xref>) with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 did not induce a nuclear accumulation of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA (Fig. S1 B). Thus, Sem1 is the unique component of the RP that is required for proper nuclear export of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Sem1 interacts genetically with mRNA export factors</title><p>Next, we asked whether Sem1 is genetically linked to factors involved in mRNA export. We found that <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> is indeed synthetic lethal (<italic>sl</italic>) or synthetic enhanced (<italic>se</italic>) in combination with impaired alleles of known mRNA export factors such as Mex67, Mtr2, Yra1, and Sub2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

Lysates derived from wild-type strains were used as controls. The bound material was released by TEV cleavage. TEV eluates of purified bait proteins were separated on a 4&#x02013;12% SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gradient gel and subjected to silver staining. Western blot analysis of the purified protein complexes was performed with indicated antibodies against CBP and Sem1.

The bound TREX-2 was released by TEV cleavage, and the TEV eluates were separated on a 4&#x02013;12% SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gradient gel; Western analyses were performed using antibodies against GFP, CBP, and Sem1 to detect components of TREX-2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200810059_GS_Fig4"/></fig><p>Previously, the N+M domain of Sac3 has been reported to interact with Thp1 and the mRNA export adaptor Mex67-Mtr2, whereas the NPC-targeting C domain of Sac3 interacts with Sus1 and Cdc31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>). We performed purifications from yeast lysates containing protein A&#x02013;Sac3, protein A&#x02013;N+M&#x02013;Sac3, and protein A-C&#x02013;Sac3. We found that the N+M domain but not the C domain of Sac3 is required for coenrichment of Sem1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Next, we asked whether Sem1, like in the case of the RP, is a bona fide component of TREX-2. For this, protein A&#x02013;Sac3 was purified from a strain containing Thp1-GFP and an untagged strain (negative control). A fraction of the TEV eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and Western analysis was performed using antibodies directed against GFP (to detect Thp1-GFP) and Sem1. The TEV eluates enriched both Thp1-GFP and Sem1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, top). The rest of the TEV eluates were incubated with Sepharose beads that were coupled to anti-GFP antibodies. The bound material was eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. Sem1 was specifically enriched in the TEV eluates obtained from protein A&#x02013;Sac3 purification that contained Thp1-GFP but not Thp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, bottom). Further, we analyzed the requirement for the enrichment of Sem1 with TREX-2. To this end, we purified Thp1-TAP from a <italic>sac3&#x00394;</italic> strain and protein A&#x02013;Sac3 from a <italic>thp1&#x00394;</italic> strain. The presence of Sem1 in the TEV eluates was probed by Western analysis. Sem1 failed to coenrich in both purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). These biochemical data suggest that the enrichment of Sem1 with TREX-2 requires the presence of both Sac3 and Thp1. Importantly, the enrichment of Sem1 with TREX-2 was found to be insensitive to RNase A treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Thus, Sem1 association with TREX-2 requires both Sac3 and Thp1, and is independent of its association with RNA. All together, these biochemical data strongly suggest that, like in the RP, Sem1 is a bona fide component of TREX-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Sem1 coenriches with Sac3&#x02013;germinal center&#x02013;associated nuclear protein (GANP) and PCI-associated module (PAM) domain&#x02013;containing protein complexes</title><p>Previously, sequence analysis of individual subunits of the RP and TREX-2 had revealed one common feature: two subunits of each complex contain a Sac3-GANP domain and a PAM domain, respectively. The Sac3-GANP domains are present in Rpn12 (RP) and Sac3 (TREX-2), whereas Rpn3 (RP) and Thp1 (TREX-2) contain the PAM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccarelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheel and Hofmann, 2005</xref>). Both domains are predicted to be &#x003b1;-helical and have been proposed to mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccarelli et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, Csn12, a subunit of the CSN, has also been reported to contain a PAM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccarelli et al., 2003</xref>). Large-scale proteomic approaches had revealed a coenrichment of the Sac3-GANP domain containing protein Ypr045c in the Csn12-TAP purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krogan et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether Sem1 also coenriches with these components. Western analysis of Csn12-TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) and Ypr045c-TAP (not depicted) preparations show that this is indeed the case. Because the PAM domain is often found upstream of proteasome-COP9-initiation factor (PCI) domains, we investigated the ability of Sem1 to bind to PCI domains. We were unable to detect Sem1 in a Nip1 purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), which coenriches eIF3, a PCI domain containing translation initiation factor.

We asked whether deletion of Sem1 affects the NPC localization of Sac3 and Thp1. For this, we tagged both Sac3 and Thp1 at their C termini with GFP in <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> strains at their genomic loci. As described previously, Thp1-GFP and Sac3-GFP have a punctate distribution at the nuclear periphery in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>). In <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> cells, the association of Thp1-GFP with the NPC is severely perturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Furthermore, we observed an increase in cytoplasmic staining of Thp1-GFP in <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> cells. However, the punctate staining of Sac3-GFP is only slightly affected in <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> cells. Mislocalization of Thp1-GFP in <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> cells is specific because we did not observe this phenotype in other deletion mutants of the RP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810059/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>).

Northern analysis of <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> showed decreased mRNA levels compared with the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). This reduction was not caused by an impairment of transcription initiation at the <italic>tet</italic> promoter, as the expression of the pCM189-LEU2 system (short, GC-poor) was not affected in the <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>).

The frequencies of recombination observed in the above mentioned strains were obtained by quantifying the number of revertants that grew on media lacking leucine. <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> and Sem1-TAP strains exhibit a vast increase in recombination above wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). To see whether this increase in recombination is dependent on transcription, we used the LNAT system, identical to LNA but with a transcriptional terminator located downstream of the <italic>leu2&#x00394;3&#x02032;</italic> fragment so that the intervening region is not transcribed. In this construct, recombination levels are found to resemble those seen in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>), which suggests that the hyper-recombination phenotype of <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> and Sem1-TAP is transcription dependent. To check further whether the phenotypes observed in <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> mutants were independent of its RP function, we addressed whether mutants of the RP (<italic>pre9&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rpn10&#x00394;</italic>) show similar recombination or transcription phenotypes. For the analysis of TAR, we used systems similar to those described above, based on 0.6-kb <italic>leu2</italic> repeats: LY&#x00394;NS in which transcription has to proceed through a long and GC-rich intervening sequence between the <italic>leu2</italic> repeats, and L that is identical to LY&#x00394;NS but without an intervening sequence between the repeats. Mutants of the RP did not show an increase in recombination in either system, whereas an increase in recombination was specifically observed in the LY&#x00394;NS system for Sem1-TAP and in mutants of TREX-2 (<italic>thp1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>sac3&#x00394;</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>).

Second, like <italic>sac3&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>thp1&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> mutants are defective in transcription of long GC-rich genes, which leads to transcription-dependent hyper-recombination phenotypes and susceptibility to the mutagenic action of AID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallardo and Aguilera, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tous and Aguilera, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Aguilera et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, we show that Sem1 specifically coenriches with TREX-2, independently of the RP. The reason why association of Sem1 with TREX-2 was not previously observed appears to be due to the use of Sem1-TAP alleles.

Deletions of members of the CSN complex have been shown to accumulate neddylated cullin Cdc53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maytal-Kivity et al., 2002</xref>). Functional analysis of the PAM domain containing Csn12 showed that it does not participate in the deneddylation of Cdc53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maytal-Kivity et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, we did not observe any alterations in Cdc53 deneddylation in <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ypr045c&#x00394;</italic> strains (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810059/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>). Moreover, both <italic>csn12&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ypr045c&#x00394;</italic> strains are not defective in mRNA export (Fig. S1 A), which suggests that Sem1 has an additional role in the CSN that is independent of its function in the RP and TREX-2. While this work was under revision, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilmes et al. (2008)</xref> showed that Sem1 coenriches with distinct complexes (RP, TREX-2, and CSN). Furthermore, they showed that the Csn12-Ypr045c-Sem1 subcomplex associates with the splicing machinery and that the <italic>csn12&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ypr045c</italic> strains were defective in pre-mRNA splicing. Thus, we speculate that the Csn12&#x02013;Ypr045c&#x02013;Sem1 subcomplex is likely to affect a yet undetermined activity of the CSN.</p><p>What could be the functional role of Sem1 in these three protein complexes? The common feature of the RP, TREX-2, and CSN is the presence of Sac3-GANP and PAM domain&#x02013;containing subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hofmann and Bucher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccarelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheel and Hofmann, 2005</xref>). Importantly, Sem1 specifically coenriches with the N+M&#x02013;Sac3 domain that contains a Sac3-GANP domain and also binds the PAM domain&#x02013;containing Thp1. Recently, a specific acidic motif in Sem1 has been shown to directly interact with Rpn3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wei et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, a combination of chemical cross-linking followed by mass spectrometry and yeast two-hybrid analyses of the RP suggests that Sem1 lies in the near vicinity of Rpn3 (PAM) and Rpn12 (Sac3-GANP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gudmundsdottir et al., 2007</xref>). These findings have led us to speculate that Sem1 might facilitate interactions between the Sac3-GANP-containing subunit and its PAM domain counterpart. Consistent with this notion, we have observed that the tethering of Thp1 to the NPC is severely affected in <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic>. Previously, an RP purified from <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> cells was shown to be considerably destabilized and defective in ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funakoshi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sone et al., 2004</xref>). Whether Sem1 &#x0201c;glues&#x0201d; the Sac3-GANP and PAM domains together still remains to be determined. Another possibility is that Sem1 stabilizes the PAM domain, which then would facilitate a robust interaction with the Sac3-GANP-containing subunit or vice versa. Previously, Dss1, the human homologue of Sem1, has been implicated in maintaining the correct conformation of BRCA2, as BRCA2 is largely insoluble in absence of Dss1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kojic et al., 2003</xref>). Further biochemical work could provide insights into how Sem1 might facilitate complex formation between Sac3-GANP and PAM-containing proteins.</p><p>Can Sem1 interact with other protein complexes? Here, the structure of Dss1 in complex with a part of BRCA2 can provide possible insights. Dss1 was shown to bind the helix turn helix motif (helical domain) and an oligonucleotide-binding domain (OB) of BRCA2 in an extended conformation. Dss1 appears to make contacts with numerous residues on the helical domain and the OB surface that is rich in basic, aromatic, and hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). The Sac3-GANP and PAM domains contain periodic hydrophobic patches followed by conserved positive residues typically found in &#x003b1;-helical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hofmann and Bucher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheel and Hofmann, 2005</xref>). Interestingly, Sac3-GANP and PAM domains have neither structural nor sequence homology with the region of BRCA2 that interacts with Sem1. Thus, it is very likely that Sem1 will target multiple folds present in several unrelated protein complexes. Interestingly, alleles of Mex67 and Mtr2 (<italic>mex67-kraa</italic> and <italic>mtr2-33</italic>), which are specifically defective in 60S export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yao et al., 2007</xref>), in combination with <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> were also found to be <italic>sl</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), which indicates a functional link of Sem1 to export of the large ribosomal subunit. Purification of the complexes associated with human Dss1 has identified the Integrator complex (involved in snRNA processing) in addition to proteasome and the metazoan-specific BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baillat et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>A large body of work in mammalian cells has implicated mutations in the tumor suppressor protein BRCA2 in genomic instability. BRCA2 functions in the repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gudmundsdottir et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Dss1 has been shown to stabilize BRCA2, and consistently, depletion of either BRCA2 or Dss1 was shown to induce similar phenotypes of genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Although yeast lacks an obvious homologue of BRCA2, Sem1, as part of the RP, was shown to be important for the repair of DSBs by both homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krogan et al., 2004</xref>). Our work has uncovered a nonproteosomal role of Sem1 in preventing transcription-associated genomic instability by regulating the integrity of TREX-2. Mutations in genes encoding components of TREX-2, which functions at the interface between transcription and mRNA export, induce transcription-associated hyper-recombination phenotypes that are very similar to <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic>. We show that, like <italic>thp1</italic>&#x00394;, the <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> mutation facilitates the mutagenic action of AID on transcribed DNA. As AID preferentially acts on ssDNA, this supports the idea that in <italic>sem1&#x00394;</italic> mutants, ssDNA regions accumulate during transcription, which is consistent with the possibility of R-loop formation, as observed in THO complex mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">G&#x000f3;mez-Gonz&#x000e1;lez and Aguilera, 2007</xref>). Recently GANP, the human homologue of Sac3, has been shown to suppress hyper-recombination and AID activity in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshida et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, several components that directly participate in mRNA export show moonlighting functions. The TREX-2 component Cdc31 performs an additional role in spindle pole body duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, the heterodimeric mRNA export factor Mex6-Mtr2 has been shown to be required for proper nuclear export of the large ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yao et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, the NPC-associated factors Gle1 and Dbp5 have been shown to function in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, this study adds Sem1 to the list of versatile proteins that function in multiple pathways, in addition to their direct involvement in mRNA export.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and microbiological methods</title><p>Microbiological techniques such as plasmid transformation, mating, sporulation of diploids, and tetrad analysis were done according to standard procedures.
