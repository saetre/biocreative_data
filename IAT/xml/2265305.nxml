However, observational studies are subject to confounding by other behavioural and sociodemographic factors, while clinical trials are difficult to implement and have limited follow-up time. Mendelian randomization can provide robust evidence on the nature of this association by use of a common polymorphism in <italic>aldehyde dehydrogenase 2</italic> (<italic>ALDH2</italic>) as a surrogate for measuring alcohol consumption. <italic>ALDH2</italic> encodes a major enzyme involved in alcohol metabolism. Individuals homozygous for the null variant (<italic>&#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic>) experience adverse symptoms when drinking alcohol and consequently drink considerably less alcohol than wild-type homozygotes (&#x0002a;<italic>1&#x0002a;1</italic>) or heterozygotes.

Hypertension has no symptoms but can lead to heart attacks or strokes. It is diagnosed by measuring blood pressure&#x02014;the force that blood moving around the body exerts on the inside of large blood vessels. Blood pressure is highest when the heart is pumping out blood (systolic pressure) and lowest when it is filling up with blood (diastolic pressure). Normal blood pressure is defined as a systolic pressure of less than 130 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and a diastolic pressure of less than 85 mmHg (a blood pressure of 130/85). A reading of more than 140/90 indicates hypertension. Many factors affect blood pressure, but overweight people and individuals who eat too much salty or fatty foods are at high risk of developing hypertension. Mild hypertension can often be corrected by lifestyle changes, but many people also take antihypertensive drugs to reduce their blood pressure.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Another modifiable lifestyle factor thought to affect blood pressure is alcohol intake. Observational studies that ask people about their drinking habits and measure their blood pressure suggest that alcohol intake correlates with blood pressure, but they cannot prove a causal link because of &#x0201c;confounding&#x0201d;&#x02014;other risk factors associated with alcohol drinking, such as diet, might also affect the study participant's blood pressures. A trial that randomly assigns people to different alcohol intakes could provide this proof of causality, but such a trial is impractical. In this study, therefore, the researchers have used &#x0201c;Mendelian randomization&#x0201d; to investigate whether alcohol intake affects blood pressure. An inactive variant of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2; the enzyme that removes alcohol from the body) has been identified. People who inherit the variant form of this gene from both parents have an <italic>ALDH2 &#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic> genotype (genetic makeup) and become flushed and nauseated after drinking. Consequently, they drink less than people with a <italic>&#x0002a;1&#x0002a;2</italic> genotype and much less than those with a <italic>&#x0002a;1&#x0002a;1</italic> genotype. Because inheritance of these genetic variants does not affect lifestyle factors other than alcohol intake, an association between <italic>ALDH2</italic> genotypes and blood pressure would indicate that alcohol intake has an effect on blood pressure without any confounding.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers identified ten published studies (mainly done in Japan where the <italic>ALDH2</italic> gene variant is common) on associations between <italic>ALDH2</italic> genotype and blood pressure or hypertension using a detailed search protocol (a &#x0201c;systematic review&#x0201d;). A meta-analysis (a statistical method for combining the results of independent studies) of the studies that had investigated the association between <italic>ALDH2</italic> genotype and hypertension showed that men with the <italic>&#x0002a;1&#x0002a;1</italic> genotype (highest alcohol intake) and those with the <italic>&#x0002a;1&#x0002a;2</italic> genotype (intermediate alcohol intake) were 2.42 and 1.72 times more likely, respectively, to have hypertension than those with the <italic>&#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic> genotype (lowest alcohol intake). There was no association between <italic>ALDH2</italic> genotype and hypertension among the women in these studies because they drank very little. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures showed a similar relationship to <italic>ALDH2</italic> genotype in a second meta-analysis of relevant studies. Finally, the researchers estimated that for men the lifetime effect of drinking 1 g of alcohol a day (one unit of alcohol contains 8 g of alcohol in the UK and 14 g in the US; recommended daily limits in these countries are 3&#x02013;4 and 1&#x02013;2 units, respectively) would be an increase in systolic blood pressure of 0.24 mmHg.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings support the suggestion that alcohol has a marked effect on blood pressure and hypertension. Consequently, some cases of hypertension could be prevented by encouraging people to reduce their daily alcohol intake. Although the Mendelian randomization approach avoids most of the confounding intrinsic to observational studies, it is possible that a gene near <italic>ALDH2</italic> that has no effect on alcohol intake affects blood pressure, since genes are often inherited in blocks. Alternatively, ALDH2 could affect blood pressure independent of alcohol intake. The possibility that ALDH2 could effect blood pressure independently of alcohol is intake made unlikely by the fact that no effect of genotype on blood pressure is seen among women who drink very little. Additional large-scale studies are needed to address these possibilities, to confirm the current finding in more people, and to improve the estimates of the effect that alcohol intake has on blood pressure.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050052">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050052</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus encyclopedia has a page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000468.htm">hypertension </ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The American Heart Association provides information for patients and health professionals about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=2114">hypertension</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK Blood Pressure Association provides information for patients and health professionals on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bpassoc.org.uk/index.htm">all aspects of hypertension</ext-link>, including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bpassoc.org.uk/information/lifestyle/alcohol.htm">information about alcohol affects blood pressure</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.at-bristol.org.uk/Alcoholandyou/Facts/units.html">The Explore&#x00040;Bristol science center</ext-link> (a UK charity) provides an alcohol unit calculator and information on the effects of alcohol</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icap.org/Home/PolicyIssues/DrinkingGuidelines/tabid/125/Default.aspx">The International Center for Alcohol Policies</ext-link> provides drinking guidelines for countries around the world</p></list-item></list></sec></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Chen L, Davey Smith G, Harbord R, Lewis SJ (2008) Alcohol and blood pressure: A systematic review implementing a mendelian randomization approach.

However, associations in observational studies of alcohol intake and blood pressure may be heavily confounded by factors such as diet, smoking, exercise levels, and socioeconomic position. Conversely, the detection of high blood pressure may lead to efforts to reduce alcohol intake, which will attenuate any positive association. In addition, reporting of alcohol is likely to be subject to considerable error, and this error may be differential&#x02014;e.g., people who have been advised to reduce alcohol intake for medical reasons may under-report alcohol intake.</p><p>Randomized controlled trials in which individuals are randomized to drink different amounts of alcohol are problematic for ethical reasons and in terms of compliance, so trials have generally randomized individuals who drink at least moderate amounts of alcohol to receive interventions aimed at reducing drinking. It is difficult to know how successful such interventions are, and how taking part in a trial aimed at reducing alcohol intake influences reporting of (rather than actual) drinking behaviour. Furthermore, follow-up is generally short-term, whereas alcohol intake may have long-term effects on blood pressure.</p><p>Mendelian randomization can provide robust evidence on such associations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Alcohol is initially metabolised to an intermediate compound, acetaldehyde, which is further metabolised and then eliminated from the body. The major enzyme responsible for the elimination of acetaldehyde is alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. In some populations, the <italic>ALDH2</italic> gene is polymorphic and an individual's genotype at this locus influences blood acetaldehyde concentrations after drinking &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. A single point mutation in <italic>ALDH2</italic> has resulted in the <italic>ALDH2&#x0002a;2</italic> allele, which is common in some Asian populations. The resultant protein has an amino acid substitution from glutamic acid (glutamate) to lysine at residue 487, and an inactive subunit. This substitution leads to an inability to metabolize acetaldehyde and causes an accumulation of acetaldehyde after alcohol intake &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Individuals who are homozygous for the <italic>ALDH2&#x0002a;2</italic> allele have 18 times higher, and heterozygotes have five times higher, peak blood acetaldehyde levels compared with <italic>&#x0002a;1&#x0002a;1</italic> homozygotes (wild type) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>ALDH2&#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic> homozygotes are characterized by a facial flushing response after consumption of alcohol coupled with nausea, drowsiness, headache, and other unpleasant symptoms that normally prevent them from heavy drinking &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Heterozygotes have a limited ability to metabolize acetaldehyde, but exhibit a less severe reaction than that seen among <italic>ALDH2&#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic> homozygotes. Due to the above adverse symptoms when drinking alcohol, <italic>&#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic> homozygotes drink considerably less alcohol than people homozygous for the wild-type allele (<italic>&#x0002a;1</italic>), with heterozygotes drinking intermediate amounts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. The genetic variant is not, however, associated with factors that would confound the relationship of alcohol consumption and blood pressure (such as smoking) nor, of course, would germline genetic variants be influenced by blood pressure level. Thus genotype can define groups with considerably different levels of lifetime average alcohol intake but with no difference in confounding factors and without the influence of reverse causation or differential reporting bias. Analysing individuals by genotype is akin to a randomised controlled trial of different levels of alcohol intake. This approach has been used to provide proof of concept&#x02014;the genotype related to higher alcohol intake is also associated with the predicted increase in oesophageal cancer risk, a disease generally considered to be alcohol related &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We have used a Mendelian randomization approach &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; to establish the extent to which alcohol intake results in changes in blood pressure, using <italic>ALDH2</italic> genotype as an instrument for indexing alcohol intake at a group level, producing groups with relatively high (<italic>&#x0002a;1&#x0002a;1</italic>), moderate (&#x0002a;<italic>1&#x0002a;2</italic>), and very low alcohol consumption (&#x0002a;<italic>2&#x0002a;2</italic>).

Exploratory analyses using an instrumental variable approach in which the association between genotype and alcohol intake and the association between genotype and blood pressure was triangulated to give an estimate of the effect of alcohol on blood pressure, we obtained estimates of a 0.24 mmHg increase in SBP per gram of alcohol per day over the course of a lifetime (because genotype influences on alcohol intake will represent differences that generally persist throughout adult life).</p><p>It is difficult to compare these effects with those seen in randomized controlled trials, because very few trials have managed to include a control group drinking little or no alcohol, and randomized controlled trials look at the effect of changes in alcohol consumption over a short time period, whereas genetic variants will influence alcohol intake over a lifetime.

This effect was seen among men, but not among women. As alcohol is an energy-dense macronutrient and has an appetite-enhancing effect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, it is likely that the increase in BMI among individuals with the <italic>&#x0002a;1&#x0002a;1</italic> genotype is due to their increased alcohol consumption. In support of this a positive association between BMI and alcohol intake has been observed among men in epidemiological studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. A cohort study carried out in a Toyama, Japan among factory employees with an age range of 35 to 59 years found that for each 1 unit increase in BMI, SBP increased by 0.86 mmHg and DBP increased by 0.69 mmHg &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. BMI was on average 1 unit higher among individuals with the <italic>&#x0002a;1&#x0002a;1</italic> genotype than among those with the <italic>&#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic> genotype in the study by Amamoto et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; included in this review. The predicted blood pressure effect of genotype differences in BMI equates to 11.6&#x00025; of the observed difference in SBP and 16.3&#x00025; of the observed difference in DBP by genotype. Therefore a small proportion of the genotype differences in blood pressure in this review may have occurred through genotype differences in BMI, but the majority of the effect is likely to be due to independent effects of alcohol on blood pressure.</p><p>It is possible that the <italic>ALDH &#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic> genotype influenced blood pressure directly or by another mechanism that was independent of the effect on alcohol intake (pleiotropy). Analyses of this genotype in relation to oesophageal cancer are complicated by dual effects of the <italic>ALDH2 &#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic> genotype in reducing alcohol intake but dramatically increasing acetaldehyde, a potent carcinogen, among those who do drink &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Elevation of acetaldehyde causes vasodilation, and consequently lower blood pressure, which is associated with increased skin temperature and characteristic flushing observed among <italic>ALDH2 &#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic> homozygotes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. The lower blood pressure associated with acetaldehyde could account for the acute reduction in blood pressure immediately after ingesting alcohol. However, this effect is short lived, and acetaldehyde is unlikely to explain the lower blood pressure seen among <italic>&#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic> homozygotes in this study, particularly as they tend not to drink. In fact, heterozygotes tend to have higher levels of acetaldehyde than either <italic>&#x0002a;1&#x0002a;1</italic> or <italic>&#x0002a;2&#x0002a;2</italic> homozygotes, because although they drink alcohol in moderation, they clear acetaldehyde at a much slower rate and consequently have greater elevations of acetaldehyde per unit of alcohol consumed than do <italic>&#x0002a;1&#x0002a;1</italic> homozygotes, which is illustrated by their high oesophageal cancer risk relative to other genotypes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore if the association between genotype and blood pressure were due to acetaldehyde levels rather than alcohol intake per se we would expect heterozygote individuals to have the lowest blood pressure and the lowest risk of hypertension. It is also possible that these results have arisen by confounding due to close proximity of the genotype of interest with other genotypes that may influence blood pressure (the close proximity of genotypes at different loci such that they are inherited together is termed linkage disequilibrium). Evidence that the effects of this genotype on blood pressure are due to differences in alcohol consumption levels rather than pleiotropic effects of <italic>ALDH2</italic> or linkage disequilibrium, is provided by the data on women, who tended not to drink and among whom there were no differences in blood pressure by genotype. If either pleiotropic effects or confounding by linkage disequilibrium were operating, an effect on blood pressure would be seen in both sexes.</p><p>Additional evidence that argues against linkage disequilibrium and pleiotropic effects and an effect of acetaldehyde on blood pressure, is that among studies that looked at the effect of <italic>ALDH2</italic> genotype after adjustment or stratification for amount of alcohol consumed there was no difference in blood pressure by genotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. The exception is a study that found a residual association between <italic>ALDH2</italic> and blood pressure in a multiple logistic regression analysis including age, BMI, genotype, and alcohol consumption, but the association with genotype in this analysis was considerably weaker than in the univariate analysis, and the authors concluded that this difference could be due to differences in past drinking habits between genotype groups, which were not controlled for in the analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. The finding could also be due to measurement error in self-reported alcohol intake data or chance.</p><p>There was some evidence of small-study effects in our review, which suggests that publication bias may have occurred. This bias may have led to an overestimation of the effects in the meta-analyses. However, only three of the largest studies were included in our instrumental variable analysis, as these were the only studies that presented mean alcohol intake by genotype, and so we do not expect this estimate to be influenced to a great extent by small-study bias; in addition a sensitivity analysis including only studies with at least 500 participants showed only minor changes in effect estimates.</p><p>In summary, observational epidemiological studies have proved to be a misleading source of knowledge regarding the cardioprotective effects of several dietary factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050052-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Inadequate statistical control for confounding by other behavioural and sociodemographic factors related to cardiovascular disease risk are likely to underlie this problem. This study shows that alcohol intake may increase blood pressure to a much greater extent, even among moderate drinkers, than previously thought. Large-scale replication studies are required to confirm this finding and to improve the precision of our estimates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting
