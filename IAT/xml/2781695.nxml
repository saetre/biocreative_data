The mismatch-, MutS-, and MutL-dependent activation of MutH is unaffected by the presence or orientation of loaded &#x003b2; clamp on either 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; heteroduplexes. Similarly, &#x003b2; is not required for 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; mismatch-provoked excision when scored in the presence of &#x003b3; complex or in the presence of &#x003b3; complex and DNA polymerase III core components. However, mismatch repair does not occur in the absence of &#x003b2;, an effect we attribute to a requirement for the clamp in the repair DNA synthesis step of the reaction. We have confirmed previous findings that &#x003b2; clamp interacts specifically with MutS and MutL (L&#x000f3;pez de Saro, F. J., Marinus, M. G., Modrich, P., and O'Donnell, M. (2006) <italic>J. Biol. Chem.</italic> 281, 14340&#x02013;14349) and show that the mutator phenotype conferred by amino acid substitution within the MutS N-terminal &#x003b2;-interaction motif is the probable result of instability coupled with reduced activity in multiple steps of the repair reaction. In addition, we have found that the DNA polymerase III &#x003b1; catalytic subunit interacts strongly and specifically with both MutS and MutL. Because interactions of polymerase III holoenzyme components with MutS and MutL appear to be of limited import during the initiation and excision steps of mismatch correction, we suggest that their significance might lie in the control of replication fork events in response to the sensing of DNA lesions by the repair system.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">GM23719</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mismatch repair is a conserved genetic stabilization system that in bacteria corrects DNA replication errors and ensures the fidelity of genetic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content>, the strand specificity necessary for removal of DNA biosynthetic errors from the daughter strand is based on the transient absence of d(GATC) methylation in newly synthesized DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). A methyl-directed reaction that can account for replication error correction has been reconstituted using purified <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Mismatch recognition by MutS initiates the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> mismatch repair, leading to recruitment of MutL. Assembly of a MutS-MutL-heteroduplex complex activates MutH endonuclease, which incises the unmethylated strand at a hemimethylated d(GATC) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The resulting strand break, which may reside 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; to the mismatch, serves as the entry site for an excision system comprised of DNA helicase II and an appropriate single-strand exonuclease. Excision directed by a 3&#x02032; strand break depends on the 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; hydrolytic activity of exonuclease I, exonuclease VII, or exonuclease X, whereas the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; activity of either RecJ exonuclease or exonuclease VII is sufficient to support hydrolysis directed by a 5&#x02032; strand break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).

Two MutS motifs have been implicated in this interaction, one located near the N terminus and the second near the C terminus. Deletion of the C-terminal motif (<sup>812</sup>QMSLL<sup>816</sup>) abolishes <italic>in vitro</italic> MutS interaction with &#x003b2; in the absence of DNA but does not confer hypermutability <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). By contrast, Ala substitution mutagenesis within the N-terminal MutS motif (<sup>15</sup>QQYLRL<sup>20</sup>) is without effect in MutS-&#x003b2; interaction in solution but confers strong hypermutability in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> cell. The latter finding has led to the proposal that the N-terminal &#x003b2; interaction motif of MutS might play an important role in the interaction of the two proteins, but only when they are DNA-bound.</p><p>To clarify the role(s) of the &#x003b2; clamp in mismatch repair, we have evaluated the effects of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> &#x003b2;, &#x003b3; complex, and Pol III core on individual steps of the reconstituted <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> methyl-directed reaction.

Popular models for clamp function in mismatch repair have invoked clamp-based recruitment of a MutS protein to sites of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), stabilization of a MutS&#x000b7;mismatch complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), or clamp-based linkage of excision and repair DNA synthesis steps of the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Nevertheless, inactivation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen interaction motif of yeast MutS&#x003b1; results in only a modest mutability increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), and deletion of this motif from human MutS&#x003b1; is without significant effect on the initiation or excision steps of <italic>in vitro</italic> mismatch correction, although it does confer a partial defect in 5&#x02032;-directed repair when the complete reaction is scored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><p>As judged by <italic>in vitro</italic> assay using covalently closed or nicked circular model heteroduplexes, we have found that the &#x003b2; sliding clamp has little if any effect on the initiation or excision steps of methyl-directed mismatch repair. However, because &#x003b2; is required for overall repair as scored using the same DNAs, we infer that the clamp plays an essential role during the repair DNA synthesis stage of mismatch correction. It is noteworthy that our findings do not exclude a role for &#x003b2; in providing a link between the excision and repair synthesis steps of mismatch correction, particularly in the case of 5&#x02032; heteroduplex repair where excision and repair synthesis could occur in a concerted manner.</p><p>As discussed above, two potential &#x003b2; interaction motifs have been identified within <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> MutS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). A C-terminal MutS element is a <italic>bona fide</italic> &#x003b2; interaction motif, conferring strong interaction with the clamp <italic>in vitro</italic>. Deletion of this motif (MutS<sup>C</sup>) abolishes <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction of the two proteins but does not result in elevated mutability <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Although synthetic peptides containing the N-terminal motif interact with &#x003b2;, Ala substitution mutagenesis of this motif (MutS<sup>N</sup>) does not alter <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction of &#x003b2; with native MutS in the absence of DNA. However, the finding that the <italic>mutS</italic><sup>N</sup> mutation results in hypermutability has led to the proposal that this sequence element may support &#x003b2; interaction, but only when the two proteins are DNA-bound. Our results suggest that this is not the case and that the biological phenotype associated with the <italic>mutS</italic><sup>N</sup> mutation is the probable result of instability coupled with a general activity defect. It therefore seems likely that the MutS-&#x003b2; interaction is largely mediated <italic>via</italic> the C-terminal MutS motif and that this interaction is of limited significance during the early steps of methyl-directed mismatch repair.</p><p>Thus, as in the MutS&#x003b1;-dependent eukaryotic pathway where genetic and biochemical studies have indicated a limited contribution of the MutS&#x003b1;-proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamp interaction to mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), interaction of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> MutS with &#x003b2; clamp is not required for methyl-directed mismatch correction as judged by <italic>in vitro</italic> assay. Our biochemical experiments have also failed to reveal significant contributions of the &#x003b3; complex clamp loader or Pol III core components to the initiation and excision steps of the methyl-directed mismatch correction. Despite these observations, we have confirmed previous findings that &#x003b2; interacts specifically with both MutS and MutL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and that &#x003b3; complex interacts with MutL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). In addition we have shown that the &#x003b3; complex interacts specifically with MutS and that Pol III core interacts with both MutS and MutL. In view of the role of mismatch repair in replication fidelity, such interactions may not be surprising, but our failure to identify the functional consequences of such interactions was unexpected.</p><p>We have considered several explanations for these puzzling findings. Because the biochemical assays that we use to score mismatch repair rely on nonreplicating model heteroduplexes, our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments may not accurately reproduce repair events that occur at the replication fork insofar as such interactions are concerned. An alternate view posits that our biochemical results are providing an accurate indication of the significance of these interactions in mismatch repair. As noted above, the limited <italic>in vitro</italic> consequences of inactivation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-binding site of human MutS&#x003b1; are consistent with the genetic consequences of inactivation of this motif within the yeast protein, and a similar consistency of biochemical and genetic findings applies if the MutS C-terminal &#x003b2; interaction motif is solely responsible for MutS-clamp interaction, as has been indicated by experiments performed in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In this case, interactions that have limited implications for repair as deduced by biochemical methods could nevertheless be sufficiently significant in biological terms to confer selective advantage.</p><p>There is, however, another way to think about the interaction of mismatch repair and replication activities. Like the study described here, previous work on this issue has been restricted to the significance of these interactions in the context of mismatch repair. A plausible alternative is that the functional consequences of these interactions are primarily manifested at the level of replication, providing a regulatory mechanism whereby mismatch repair proteins modulate fork activity in response to DNA lesions. Such a mechanism could be valuable for several reasons. It would permit replication error removal to be integrated into the context of replication fork events, an effect that might be particularly useful in those organisms where termini at the fork may provide the strand signals that direct mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). It could in principle also function to regulate fork movement in response to a transient elevation of DNA biosynthetic errors such as those that may arise from transient nucleotide pool imbalances or chemical damage to exposed bases within template strands. The possibility of mismatch repair modulation of fork activities in response to chemical lesions may be particularly worth considering in the context of the mammalian mismatch repair system, which is known to participate in checkpoint and apoptotic responses to certain classes of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grant GM23719.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN3"><label>3</label><p>The abbreviations used are: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">Pol</term><def><p>polymerase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">BSA</term><def><p>bovine serum albumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">SSB</term><def><p>single-strand binding protein.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Iyer</surname><given-names>R.
