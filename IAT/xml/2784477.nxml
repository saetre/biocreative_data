Canine non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has been proposed to be a relevant preclinical model that occurs spontaneously and may share causative factors with human NHL due to a shared home environment. The canine <italic>DLC1 </italic>mRNA sequence was derived from normal tissue. Using lymphoid samples from 21 dogs with NHL and 7 normal dogs, the methylation status of the promoter CpG island of the gene was defined for each sample using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA), methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and bisulfite sequencing methods. Relative gene expression was determined using real-time PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mRNA sequence of canine <italic>DLC1 </italic>is highly similar to the human orthologue and contains all protein functional groups, with 97% or greater similarity in functional regions. Hypermethylation of the 5' and 3' flanking regions of the promoter was statistically significantly associated with the NHL phenotype, but was not associated with silencing of expression or differences in survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The canine <italic>DLC1 </italic>is constructed highly similarly to the human gene, which has been shown to be an important tumor suppressor in many forms of cancer. As in human NHL, the promoter CpG island of <italic>DLC1 </italic>in canine NHL samples is abnormally hypermethylated, relative to normal lymphoid tissue. This study confirms that hypermethylation occurs in canine cancers, further supporting the use of companion dogs as comparative models of disease for evaluation of carcinogenesis, biomarker diagnosis, and therapy.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Dogs with spontaneously arising lymphoma represent a large animal model of naturally occurring non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in a species which shares the human household environment and potential carcinogen exposure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Lymphoma in dogs is common and shares similarities in cellular morphology and clinical behavior with the human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The indolent forms of human NHL have a protracted course of disease that ultimately leads to therapy resistance and death[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] Lymphoma in dogs has a similar course of response to therapy followed by terminal resistance. As such, the dog has been proposed as a model for preclinical evaluation of novel diagnostics and therapeutics intended for human use[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. To date, only p53, p16, and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor genes have been evaluated for mutation in canine NHL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. No published examination of possible hypermethylation of a tumor suppressor gene in a dog with NHL exists.</p><p>The <italic>DLC1 </italic>gene possesses tumor suppressor function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The coded protein is a Rho-GTPase Activating Protein (RhoGAP) that counteracts the feed forward signaling of RhoA and Cdc42 among other Ras signaling proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Loss of this function results in unconstrained growth signaling from the surface of the cell to the nucleus, changes in cell mobility through increased ROCK-mediated events, and signaling between the cell and its extracellular environment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The tumor suppressor function has been confirmed by demonstrating that loss of <italic>DLC1 </italic>expression resulted in hepatocellular carcinoma formation in a knockdown mouse model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Transfection of <italic>DLC1 in vitro </italic>caused decreased proliferation and colony forming potential of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells and breast carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Stable transfection of <italic>DLC1 </italic>in a mouse model of metastatic NSCLC halted tumorigenicity of the cell line and resulted in decreased invasiveness of the cells into normal tissue[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Expression microarray analysis of transfected cells revealed transcriptional upregulation of thrombospondin 2 (<italic>TSP2</italic>), a tumor growth inhibitor, acting principally through counteracting angiogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The human DLC1 protein contains three recognized functional domains: a sterile &#x003b1; motif (SAM), a RhoGAP, and a steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer (START) domain domain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The START and RhoGAP domains are necessary for the tumor-suppressor function of the protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Interaction with 14-3-3 protein binding in the linker area near the N-terminal SAM region appears to regulate DLC1 function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. At points of focal cellular adhesion, DLC1 interacts through a Src homology 2 (SH2) binding motif (Y422) with tensin family members cten and tensin2 at the SH2 domain on each protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This interaction was confirmed by mutation of the SH2 active regions of both <italic>DLC1 </italic>and <italic>cten</italic>, resulting in a loss of both interaction and localization at the plasma membrane[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. DLC1 also interacts with tensin2 in caveolae, contributing to the organization of the local actin cytoskeleton and inhibition of the formation of stress fibers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The interacting DLC1 and tensin2 suppress activity of the serum response element (SRE), a Ras cytoskeleton effector[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. At focal adhesion sites, DLC1 function is modulated by binding of p120Ras-GAP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Loss of such function could confer significant growth advantages to preneoplastic or neoplastic cells, contributing to the initiation, promotion, or progression of cancer, as well as metastasis. Indeed, <italic>DLC1 </italic>silencing has been demonstrated to be a significant contributor to many human cancers. This gene and its protein have not yet been characterized in the dog.</p><p>The presence of a hypermethylated promoter region of the <italic>DLC1 </italic>gene has been demonstrated in humans with NHL[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Shi and colleagues examined NHL cell lines and patient samples for hypermethylation of CpG islands with differential methylation hybridization (DMH) using a CpG island microarray[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The <italic>DLC1 </italic>gene was found to be hypermethylated in all six NHL cell lines examined, with concomitant silencing of transcription. In several lines, expression could be upregulated by treatment with a combination of a demethylating agent and a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Seventy-five NHL patient samples were examined for hypermethylation of several candidate genes, including <italic>DLC1</italic>. Of these, 87% demonstrated hypermethylation of <italic>DLC1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Overall, expression of mRNA for this gene was significantly downregulated in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Only recently have epigenetic mechanisms begun to be examined in dogs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Initial work by our group has identified strong evidence that the tumor suppressor gene <italic>DLC1 </italic>is frequently hypermethylated in canine NHL, as it is in human NHL[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this series of experiments was to sequence the canine <italic>DLC1 </italic>gene and determine whether hypermethylation of the gene is present in canine lymphoma. No literature or databank information characterizes this gene in dogs. While new, more precise prediction software has identified a putative structure for the canine <italic>DLC1 </italic>gene, no biological data confirms its existence or its expression in canine tissue. The studies presented here define the sequence of the mRNA, characterize the similarities and differences of the structure of the dog and human promoter regions of <italic>DLC1</italic>, report expression levels in the normal lymphoid samples and canine NHL samples, and identify DNA methylation patterns and their relationship to the expression of the gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The construction of the canine <italic>DLC1 </italic>cDNA (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FJ602870">FJ602870</ext-link>) as determine by 5'RACE is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

The SH2 interacting domain (hs Y442; cf Y450) and surrounding sequence is preserved in the dog (data not shown). The arginine finger (hs R677; cf R684) of the RhoGAP is also preserved in the dog (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Structure of the canine <italic>DLC1 </italic>gene based on sequencing results from mRNA isolated from normal spleen tissue</bold>.

There is a particularly strong conservation of Sp1 binding motifs. Of the canine Sp1 sites, 69% are common to human and 68% of the human sites are common to dogs. Furthermore, within the specific forms of the sites, interaction with pathway signaling is largely common between the two, including <italic>jun</italic>, dihydrofolate reductase, and gamma-globulin signaling pathways. Differences observed include cyclooxygenase signaling Sp1 in dogs and heat shock protein 70 signaling Sp1 in humans. Relative to human, the canine sequence has a higher density of CpG dinucleotides. The dog Sp1 sites are also more densely packed at the 5' end of the promoter region relative to the human sequence.</p><p>The conservation of non-Sp1 transcription factor binding sites is less striking. Of the conserved elements, only 41% are common to both the human and canine sequences. Conserved elements common to both species include ras and jun pathway binding sites.</p><p>Patient demographic data is presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Five clones each from control dog 1 and lymphoma dogs 5, 12, and 19 were sequenced. As predicted by the pattern of COBRA results, methylation was present in the 5' region of the sequence at a visibly greater density than at the 3' of the amplicon. Density of methylation was the least in the normal Dog 1, with sporadic methylation more prominent at the 5' end near the edge of the CpG island. Density was significantly different from normal for lymphoma Dog 19 (P = 0.032). Dog 5 displayed slightly less methylation at the TaqaI cut-site than either dog 12 or 19. Dog 12 displayed the least methylation at the BstuI cut-site, with dog 5 intermediate between 12 and 19. All dogs displayed near complete methylation of the HpyCh4IV cut-site as suggested by the visual analysis of the gel, although methylation was slightly less complete in the normal dog. The small, diffuse nature of the band prevented adequate digital analysis in 10 of the cases. The AP-2 transcription factor binding site is located at the sixth CpG dinucleotide, and the ninth through fifteenth are included in Sp1 binding sites.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Bisulfite sequencing results for normal dog 1, and dogs 5, 12, and 19 with NHL</bold>. The corresponding DNA sequence is above with each CpG dinucleotide marked in bold. Open circles denote unmethylated CpG dinucleotides and black are methylated. Five clones for each dog were submitted for sequencing. Note the relatively lower methylation density for the normal dog. The high frequency of methylation at the HpyCh4IV cut-site in all dogs, including the normal dog, suggests that this CpG behaves as a genomic CpG dinucleotide and is routinely methylated.

The relationship identified at the TaqaI site was positive (r = 0.394), but not significant (P = 0.086). The calculated power of the analysis was also low (0.403). This was the highest correlation identified. Normal samples were not included in this analysis, as they belong to a separate class, and the effect of lymphoma could not be separated from the effect of age.</p><p>Expression was variable in both normal and lymphoma samples, ranging from 0 to 3.03 relative to the GAPDH expression within the matching sample.

Epigenetic silencing of the gene has been identified in cell lines and primary tumors of non-small cell lung, neuroectodermal, breast, colon, prostate, gastric, renal, uterine, esophageal, naspharyngeal, and rectal cancers, as well as NHL[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. To better characterize lymphoma in dogs as a model for the human disease, we sequenced the canine <italic>DLC1 </italic>gene and evaluated the effect of hypermethylation on its expression. Sequencing of the 5' region of the cDNA was made difficult by the high GC content. The sequence presented here was isolated from normal canine spleen, and is highly similar to that reported by Yuan and others, isolated from human liver tissue[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Both human and canine sequences originate immediately downstream from a large CpG island, contain the same number of exons, and share protein functional groups. A gap is present in the canine genome build 2.0 in chromosome 16 from 39,504,330-39,505,008. A portion of the fifth exon of the <italic>DLC1 </italic>sequence lies within this gap, further revealing the sequence of the canine genome. The similarities in the canine and human amino acid sequences and in the transcription factors capable of binding to the control regions of these orthologs suggest highly common functions between the two. The promoter analysis presented here is a significant expansion from that previously reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Although specific pathway interactions are impossible to predict simply by the presence of conserved elements, the similarities conserved, and the differences that have arisen, are striking between the canine and human promoter elements of <italic>DLC1</italic>. The conservation of Sp1 binding sites between dog and human is high. The canine Sp1 sites are collected slightly more 5' and more densely relative to the human, with a less dense distribution of sites throughout the first exon and first intron region, which may have functional impact on methylation of the region. These findings suggest significant commonality of transcription control between dogs and humans, with subtle alterations introduced during the years of divergent evolution.</p><p>The extremely high GC content of this CpG island limited bisulfite evaluation to the margins of the island. The COBRA and MSP results demonstrate a pattern of greater density of methylation in the 5' and 3' flanking regions of the promoter of the canine gene with lower density of methylation near the core of the promoter region where, presumably, transcription is controlled. The greater number and density of Sp1 binding sites, relative to the human gene, may provide a boundary region, preventing the spread of methylation into the core of the promoter, even in neoplastic lymphocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The HpyCh4IV cut site, the first CpG in the bisulfite sequencing analysis, is also the first CpG dinucleotide included in the island in the Methprimer analysis. This CpG dinucleotide may function as a genomic CpG, rather than as part of the island, and be methylated in almost every animal. The high rate of methylation in the bisulfite sequencing analysis supports this, as does the visual analysis of the gel image. Only the TaqaI site and the MSP data were significantly correlated with the neoplastic phenotype. Of these two, MSP is likely the better discriminator because methylation was present only in the NHL samples. Methylation at the BstuI site should continue to be evaluated in larger trials, as no normal sample was hypermethylated at that location on COBRA analysis.</p><p>The bisulfite sequencing results provide a visual representation of the likely control apparatus of this canine gene. AP-2 does not appear to contribute significantly to the expression of canine <italic>DLC1</italic>, as the binding site was uniformly methylated in two of the three lymphoma samples and partially in the normal sample. It is possible that the high density of Sp1, or another less frequent transcription factor, overwhelms any contribution of AP-2, as well protects other transcription factors within the core of the promoter region from hypermethylation. There is methylation in only a small minority of the Sp1 binding sites. This is in contrast to the methylation pattern identified in <italic>DLC1 </italic>in human prostate cancer in which the Sp1 sites are more heavily methylated, contributing to silencing[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. An Sp1 boundary phenomenon has been reported in the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>promoter of breast cancer cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>the Sp1 binding sites were shown to serve as normal boundaries between the hypermethylated and hypomethylated regions at the border of the gene control region[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, methylation of these binding sites resulted in inhibition of binding by Sp1. This boundary effect was abrogated by specific mutation in a mouse model examining the <italic>Aprt </italic>gene[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In fact, no relationship appears to exist in the samples studied between the methylation status of the examined CpG island regions and the expression of this gene. Expression was present in all but one sample, and was highest in one of the lymphoma samples. This is not surprising, given the apparent protection of the majority of the core promoter binding sites identified. Discordant methylation and expression has been reported in the human gene <italic>hTERT </italic>by several investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. A critical, hypomethylated region has been discovered around the transcription start site (TSS) of the <italic>hTERT </italic>gene that allows transcription in spite of heavy methylation upstream[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. It is likely that the canine <italic>DLC1 </italic>gene is similar, in that methylation not present in normal tissue can be readily demonstrated in the CpG island of canine NHL samples, but the core of the promoter appears unmethylated, allowing transcription to occur. Overall, expression of the gene is low in both node tissue and circulating lymphocytes, as found in humans by Shi and others[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The highest mRNA expression in this series was in lymphoma dog 17, but protein expression was not evaluated.</p><p>Of the 21 cases of lymphoma in this study, two were of T-cell immunophenotype. Unlike in our previously reported study, hypermethylation was identified in both cases. Methylation has been reported in T-cell lymphoid neoplasia. DLC1 was hypermethylated in three of six human patients with T-cell ALL[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Genomic hypomethylation and accumulation of CpG island hypermethylation has been associated with increasing age in humans[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This may be contributory to the development of cancer as individuals age. A similar phenomenon of accumulated CpG island hypermethylation has not been demonstrated in dogs. In this series of lymphoma samples, there was no statistically significant association between age and the degree of hypermethylation. This phenomenon should be studied further in normal and diseased populations of dogs with sufficient sample size to answer this question.</p><p>Analysis of hypermethylation by site identified no relationship between Working Formulation classification or survival in these dogs. This is not surprising, as the hypermethylation had no effect on expression of canine <italic>DLC1</italic>. Hypermethylation has been shown to be a frequent finding in all of the forms of human NHL, with differences occurring primarily in degree of hypermethylation and gene sets affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The present cases were only classified by Working Formulation criteria after the fact. If comparative studies are to bear fruit on a mechanistic level, disciplined classification must become the norm for veterinary pathologists and clear prognostic significance must be attached to the different classifications. Development of diagnostic technology for flow-cytometry, antigen-receptor gene rearrangement, and, now, epigenetic alterations of cells will define the points of origin of canine NHL in B-cell biology that have already been defined in human NHL[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Only with this information will the comparative model be complete.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study further characterize the similarities and differences between the human and canine <italic>DLC1 </italic>gene. The cDNA sequences of canine and human <italic>DLC1 </italic>are highly similar. The promoter regions of both human and canine <italic>DLC1 </italic>have important similarities in content of methylation sensitive transcription factors. Significantly, the density of Sp1 sites in dogs is more numerous and more concentrated at the 5' end of the promoter, potentially making the canine CpG island more resistant to hypermethylation. <italic>DLC1 </italic>is not silenced in canine NHL, but the statistically significant relationship with the malignant phenotype suggests that hypermethylation may be used as a biomarker for neoplasia in abnormal lymphoid populations. The clear association between hypermethylation and the malignant phenotype, taken with previously published data demonstrating global hypomethylation,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. demonstrate that methylation patterns are altered in canine forms of NHL in a similar manner to human NHL. Current research in the author's laboratory using high-throughput technology will begin to establish the patterns of hypermethylation associated with specific forms of lymphoma in dogs, and further define the comparative framework of NHL etiology, pathobiology, and therapy between dogs and humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>In Silico </italic>methods</title><p>A region of the canine genome corresponding to the sequence surrounding the promoter region of the human <italic>DLC1 </italic>gene (NM_006094) was identified as previously described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Exonic primers that overlapped by a minimum of 50 bases were designed according to Ambion recommendation to amplify the regions of the mRNA between the 5' and 3' amplified segments. The PCR product was enzymatically purified with Exo-SapIt (Amersham, USA). PCR products were incubated for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C and the reaction was terminated by incubation at 80&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes. (Amersham, USA). PCR product were further purified with Zymo Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research Corporation, Orange, CA) and eluted in 10 &#x003bc;L of HyPure water. Clean PCR product was sequenced by cycle sequencing using big-dye terminator. The reaction was carried out in a 10 &#x003bc;L reaction containing 4 &#x003bc;L big-dye, 4 &#x003bc;L PCR, and 2 &#x003bc;L (3.2 pmol) primer. The mixture was cycled as follows: initial denaturation at 96&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes, and 36 cycles of 96&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds, 50&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds, and 60&#x000b0;C for 4 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>COBRA and MSP</title><p>The MethPrimer <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/index1.html">http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/index1.html</ext-link> website was used to locate a primer region at the 5' end of the CpG island to serve as the left primer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Because the sequence contains a single CpG dinucleotide, a second primer was designed to be complementary to a TpG sequence at the same location. The right primer was constructed 187 bp 3' to the first primer pairs, and contains a single CpG dinucleotide as well, necessitating design of TpG complementary primer as well. The product size of these primers is 187 bp and contains one BstuI cut-site yielding fragments of 116 bp and 71 bp, one TaqaI cut site yielding fragments of 128 bp and 59 bp, and one HpyCh4IV cut site yielding fragments of 160 and 27 bp. The primers used for COBRA were (5' to 3'): forward, TATAGTTTTAGGCGGTGTTTTGG and TATAGTTTTAGGTGGTGTTTTGG and reverse, CCCAAAATCCAACTCAAAATTTACG and CCCAAAATCCAACTCAAAATTTACA. PCR was performed at an annealing temperature of 60&#x000b0;C for 60 s, an extension temperature of 72&#x000b0;C for 60 s, and a melting temperature of 95&#x000b0;C for 60 s, repeating for 36 cycles. The PCR product was purified with the Zymo Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research Corporation, Orange, CA) and eluted in 20 &#x003bc;L of HyPure water. For BstuI, 10 &#x003bc;L of PCR product was added to 2.5 &#x003bc;L of Buffer 2, 1 &#x003bc;L of BstuI, and 11.5 &#x003bc;L of HyPure water, and incubated at 60&#x000b0;C for 4 h. For TaqaI, 8 &#x003bc;L of PCR product was added to 2.0 &#x003bc;L of Buffer 3, 1 &#x003bc;L of 10&#x000d7; bovine serum albumin, 1.5 &#x003bc;L of TaqaI, and 7.5 &#x003bc;L of HyPure water, and incubated at 65&#x000b0;C for 4 h. For HpyCh4IV, 8 &#x003bc;L of PCR product was added to 2.0 &#x003bc;L of Buffer 3, 1.5 &#x003bc;L of HpyCh4IV, and 8.5 &#x003bc;L of HyPure water, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 h. Controls were bisulfite-treated DNA from normal lymphocytes (negative) and bisulfite-treated SssI-treated DNA from normal lymphocytes (positive). The PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide for visualization. MSP was performed as previously described for this gene[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The primers used were: unmethylated forward TGGTTTTAAGTTTAGTGGTTAGTGG; unmethylated reverse CCTTATCAAACCAATACCTATCATT; methylated forward GCGGTTTTAAGTTTAGTGGTTAGC; methylated reverse CCTTATCAAACCGATACCTATCGT. Results were analyzed using a gel documentation and analysis system (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Proportion of methylation for COBRA samples was calculated as the intensity of the cut bands divided by the total intensity of all bands in the lane. For MSP, a ratio of the intensity of the methylated band to the unmethylated band was calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Bisulfite sequencing</title><p>The PCR product of 5' COBRA primer set from three cases and a normal dog was amplified, purified with the Qiagen Clean and Concentrator kit (Qiagen, Inc. USA. Valencia, CA) and eluted in 10 &#x003bc;L of HyPure water. Using the Invitrogen TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA), the product was transfected into competent cells provided for transformation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Single colonies of transformed cells were selected and grown overnight in enrichment broth with ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was extracted using the Qiagen miniprep kit (Qiagen, Inc. USA. Valencia, CA), and the presence of an insert, indicating a transformed cell, detected by PCR. Five clones of each purified plasmid DNA were submitted with universal primers where they were sequenced by the DNA Core using a standard dideoxynucleotide sequencing technique. CpG dinucleotides within the sequences were mapped and labeled as methylated if cytosine remained unconverted, and unmethylated if a thymidine was in a cytosine position.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression analysis</title><p>Primers were designed that reside in two adjacent exons, spanning an intron, near the 3' end of the mRNA. Reverse-transcriptase PCR was used to create a cDNA copy of the mRNA. This cDNA copy was amplified in tandem with GAPDH cDNA to yield relative copy numbers in SYBR-Green Real-Time PCR. Primer sequences were as follows: GAPDH forward GTGACTTCAACAGTGACACC; GAPDH reverse CCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGACC; DLC1 forward CTCACCTACATGTGCAGAGC; DLC1 reverse ACAACTTCAGCTGCACACAG. This was performed in five normal dog samples, as a control population, and all NHL samples. Assays were run in triplicate to avoid inter-assay variability. Data were evaluated using the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The relationship between degree of methylation and level of expression and degree of methylation and age were evaluated using a linear correlation model. Methylation density of each NHL sample was compared to expression of the mRNA relative to normal lymphoid tissue using a Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Association between methylation at each restriction enzyme or MSP site and the neoplastic phenotype or lymphoma subtype results was examined using the Fisher's Exact Test. Differences in survival were calculated for dogs receiving a CHOP chemotherapy protocol which did or did not have methylation at each restriction site and MSP analysis using the Kaplan Meier Log-Rank Analysis. Significance was set at P = 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>DLC1: Deleted in Liver Cancer 1; COBRA: combined bisulfite restriction analysis; MSP: methylation-specific PCR; NHL: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; NSCLC: non-small cell lung carcinoma; RhoGAP: Rho-GTPase Activating Protein; SAM: sterile &#x003b1; motif; SRE: serum response element; START: steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer; TSP2: thrombospondin 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JNB was the principal investigator of this project and performed the primary methylation analysis, expression analysis, statistical analysis, and manuscript preparation.
