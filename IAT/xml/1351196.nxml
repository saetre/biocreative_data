Following abrogation of the G2 checkpoint, these cells arrest in mitosis and can subsequently form polyploid cells. This response is thought to represent an alternative to immediate death through apoptosis. This abnormal arrest in mitosis and the subsequent formation of mono-and multi-nucleated endopolyploid giant cells is incorporated under the collective term 'mitotic catastrophe' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying such responses remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Our group has previously described the morphological features of these endopolyploid cells and observed that certain stages of the cytological rearrangements that lead to their de-polyploidisation, and return to mitosis are partly reminiscent of meiotic prophase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, ectopic expression of meiotic proteins of the so-called cancer/testis antigens group, namely SCP1 and SPO11, has been reported in the literature as a feature of progressing tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and it has been suggested that this phenomenon could represent a link between the malignant behaviour of tumours and a gametogenesis-like processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>One of the central signalling pathways involved in switching cells from mitosis to meiosis is regulated by the MOS kinase. During meiosis, MOS is translationally up-regulated, where it first stimulates the first reduction division of the cell and then further acts as a cytostatic factor to maintain the oocyte in metaphase arrest at meiosis II until fertilization occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These separate functions are attributed to two different downstream targets of the MOS/MAPK pathway, cdk1 and Rsk90, respectively. In addition, MOS directly interacts with kinetochores thereby interrupting mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Meiosis functions to generate cells with a reduced number of chromosome sets. There are two obligate and interdependent requirements for this reduction division: (1) Sister chromatid cohesion and homologous chromosome pairing to facilitate the correct segregation and reduction of maternal and paternal chromosomes; (2) recombination between homologous chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Pivotal to these processes is the meiotic cohesin REC8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] which sustains the cohesion between sister chromatids and particularly centromeres preventing separation until anaphase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Rec8 functions to ensure that both homolog pairing and reduction division occurs during meiosis. Recently, Rec8 dominant negative mutants have been shown to prevent synapse formation of homologs in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], whilst in yeast mutants over-expressing REC8 fail to produce sister chromatid separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>During pre-meiotic replication REC8 associates with an axial structure on the meiotic chromosomes which later forms the lateral element of the synaptonemal complex (SC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. REC8 has been found to form complexes with the meiosis-specific recombinase DMC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This enzyme is necessary for the Rad51-mediated stable DNA strand invasion and homology search which occurs during the homologous recombination stages of meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Other important proteins of the SC are SCP3 and SCP2 which form the lateral elements of the SC. A third protein, SCP1 forms the central element of the SC, providing a bridge to hold the two homologous chromosomes together, assisted by recombination chiasma between the homologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. REC8 colocalizes with another meiosis specific cohesin, STAG3. STAG3 stabilizes cohesion between sister chromatids during meiosis I and together with REC8 marks the lateral element of the SC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Thus, REC8 and MOS, together with a number of specific cohesins and recombinases are important in the regulation and execution of meiosis, combining to achieve homologous recombination and chromosome separation/reduction. Although the molecular machinery for meiotic reduction divisions is largely understood, little is known regarding the regulation of reduction division in somatic polyploid cells which is thought to be a rare event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We hypothesised that polyploid cells may have the same common regulators involved in reduction division as meiosis on the basis that meiosis has probably evolved as a means of reducing the chromosome number in asexual polyploid protists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, we sought to address whether the transformations observed in the endopolyploid tumour cells were linked with the ectopic expression of these genes. In this study we demonstrate the expression of several key meiotic prophase genes including <italic>MOS, SYCP1, REC8, DMC1, STAG3 </italic>and <italic>SYCP3 </italic>in tumour cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and irradiation of cells</title><p>The Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Namalwa was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and carries mutated p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The TK6 and WI-L2-NS human lymphoblastoid cell lines were derived from the same WI-L2 isolate and were obtained from Dr. P. Olive (Vancouver, Canada). TK6 cells are p53 wild type and WI-L2-NS p53-mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The p53 mutation status of all three cell lines was confirmed by sequencing analysis. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, 10 % Foetal Calf Serum (FCS; Gibco, Paisley, UK) at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5 % CO<sub>2 </sub>humidified incubator.

However, when protein expression was assessed by Western blotting, a particularly pronounced accumulation of p39mos was observed in Namalwa cells after irradiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) with the peak levels of expression coinciding with the maximal metaphase arrest on day 3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The p39mos expression was also elevated in WI-L2-NS cells after irradiation, which again coincided with the maximum mitotic arrest (in this case on day 2), albeit less pronounced (both the expression of p39mos and cell arrest) than that observed in the Namalwa cells. In contrast, p39mos protein was expressed at a very low level in p53 wild-type TK6 cells and its expression was not enhanced following irradiation. The expression level of p39mos also correlated with the amount of polyploid cells produced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These data suggest that the post-translational events responsible for the induction of MOS only occur in p53 mutated irradiated lymphoma cells following irradiation. Next we sought to examine the expression of the meiotic cohesin REC8.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of REC8 is enhanced after irradiation</title><p>Although transcribed at a low level in untreated cells, <italic>REC8 </italic>was substantially up-regulated following irradiation in all five independent experiments performed with the Namalwa cell-line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Up-regulation was observed from day 3 until day 7&#x02013;9 post-irradiation over the period during which the largest number of polyploid cells are present in the culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). <italic>REC8 </italic>was also expressed in WI-L2-NS cells and elevated following irradiation, albeit with different kinetics than that seen in Namalwa cells where a prominent increase in transcription was seen only from day 5. In contrast, in TK6 cells, <italic>REC8 </italic>was transcribed prior to irradiation but its expression fell afterwards. Due to almost all of the TK6 cells undergoing apoptosis by day 3, it was impossible to analyze expression levels on subsequent days. Western blot analysis performed for REC8 protein in Namalwa cells further confirmed the translation of this meiotic cohesion protein over this protracted period post-irradiation with a peak in protein expression on day 3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Distribution of REC8 in endopolyploid cells</title><p>Given the pronounced upregulation of REC8 following irradiation, we next assessed the localisation of REC8 in cells at various times after irradiation. As a positive control for REC8 staining we first assessed two different antibodies directed to REC8 on rat testes tissue and, as expected, we observed strongly positive staining in the primary spermatocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> insert). Using the same antibodies, we then assessed the expression of REC8 in the lymphoma cells. Untreated Namalwa cells in interphase or undergoing mitosis were negative for REC8. Interestingly, however, a few bright, large, REC8-positive foci were observed in the chromatin of rare mitotic cells undergoing arrest in metaphase (data not shown).</p><p>Following irradiation of Namalwa cells, bright REC8-positive foci appeared in about 10&#x02013;15% of the cells on day 3. These data are in accordance with the western blot REC8 protein expression coincident with the peak of mitotic arrest. REC8 was localised within the arrested aberrant metaphases characterised by the swollen and adhered chromosomes (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), evidently undergoing restitution into interphase. After day 3, the amount of REC8 staining increased in the nuclei of subsequent endopolyploid interphase cells. During this period (day 3&#x02013;6), DNA endoreduplication and repair by homologous recombination were observed as documented by us previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Subsequently, we assessed if REC8 was associated with centromeres by combining immunostaining with REC8 and a CREST antibody known to detect kinetochore proteins associated with centromeres. This staining revealed REC8- and CREST-positive foci to be associated and juxta-posed from day 5 to day 9&#x02013;11, although somewhat irregularly. REC8 foci were seen inserted between doublets or chains of CREST-positive foci (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of other meiosis-specific genes</title><p>Next, we assessed whether other meiosis specific proteins were expressed in the lymphoma cells. The <italic>DMC1 </italic>gene encodes for a meiosis specific recombinase from the RecA family and appears to act in cooperation with REC8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and Rad51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We found by RT-PCR that <italic>DMC1 </italic>was also expressed, both in irradiated and non-treated samples of all three cell lines, with a prominent decrease after irradiation in the p53 wild-type TK6 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We also found that <italic>STAG3</italic>, a meiosis-specific cohesin, is transcribed in all three cell lines, although with no apparent change in transcription after irradiation. The translational expression of Rad51 in endopolyploid cells, a recombinase engaged in DNA repair, has previously been shown by us to occur following irradiation in these same p53 mutated cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Studies of the genes involved in the formation of the synaptonemal complex, <italic>SYCP1 and SYCP3 </italic>revealed some weak background expression in Namalwa cells. Although only weakly transcribed, the identity of these PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. The transcriptional expression of these genes was not elevated by irradiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>On day 6 post-irradiation, approximately 8% of irradiated Namalwa cell nuclei displayed atypical weak SCP3 staining by IF in the perinuclear region (not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have investigated the expression of several meiotic genes in p53 wild-type and p53 mutated lymphoma cells both before and after an irradiation insult that induces mitotic catastrophe. This study reveals that a group of previously well defined meiosis-specific proteins are clearly upregulated in the p53 mutated cells after DNA damage with irradiation. In particular, the meiosis-regulatory protein, MOS, was strongly post-transcriptionally up-regulated in the Namalwa and WIL2NS cells after irradiation. This up-regulation was only apparent in p53 mutated cells and was lacking from the wild-type TK6 cells, implying that up-regulation of MOS by DNA damage is inhibited by wild type p53 function. Interestingly, this elevation in MOS protein was a post-translational event as transcription remained constant after irradiation. Therefore increases in MOS may arise from either increased translation from the mRNA or increased protein stability. For example, post-translational modification of the MOS protein by (auto)phosphorylation on Ser-3 could lead to its increased stability and decreased proteasome-mediated degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>This observation of mos upregulation in p53 mutated cells, is in line with data of Fukasawa and Vande Woude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] who demonstrated that only p53-/- somatic cells can tolerate high levels of MOS and the subsequent downstream elevation of MAPK activity. It should also be noted that up-regulation of MOS protein has been previously shown in human ovarian cancer cells arrested at the spindle checkpoint by microtubule-damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Hence, the quantitative and temporal relationship between MOS up-regulation and the arrest in the spindle checkpoint were also found in that system, although a different type of tumour cell was used and a different metaphase arrest strategy employed. These data strengthen the notion that MOS expression may be directly involved in the metaphase arrest in mitotic catastrophe.</p><p>During the homologous recombination processes of meiosis, Rad51 is known to cooperate with the meiotic cohesin Rec8 and meiotic recombinase DMC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is striking that in the irradiated p53 mutant lymphoid tumours shown here, we observed the expression of a major meiotic cohesin REC8 and the meiotic recombinase DMC1. In addition to its potential role in DNA recombination and repair, the chromatid-cohesing function of REC8 may also provide for the induction of polyploidising ('catastrophic') mitosis. Whether it represents an adaptive response which favours escape from mitotic cell death, providing an option for the formation of giant cells, additional DNA repair and their segregation by somatic reduction still remains to be elucidated.</p><p>An interesting and unexpected finding was that a number of other meiotic prophase-specific genes are also expressed in the lymphoma cell lines. Importantly, the induced activation of these meiotic genes seen in the p53 mutated cell lines was not observed in the wild-type p53 TK6 cells. In accord, TK6 cells produce a very small polyploid cell fraction after irradiation, approximately 6 to 10 times less than WI-L2-NS or Namalwa cells and do not survive the 10 Gy irradiation dose (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that the meiosis-specific genes that were observed by us to be aberrantly expressed in the p53 mutated lymphoma cells <italic>(MOS, REC8, DMC1, STAG3, SYCP1</italic>, and <italic>SYCP3) </italic>can all be classified as cancer/testis antigens as defined by Simpson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Many of the cancer/testis gene products belong to a broad and ever expanding group of tumour antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and some have been used, with various success rates, as targets for vaccine therapy in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, four of these meiotic prophase-associated genes (<italic>REC8, DMC1, STAG3 </italic>and <italic>SYCP3</italic>) are reported to be expressed in malignant tissue for the first time. Interestingly, at least a proportion of these meiosis specific genes appear to be associated with the induction of mitotic catastrophe and the generation of endopolyploid tumour cells.</p><p>Finally, recent advances in long-term video-microscopy have found that the endopolyploid cells resulting from mitotic catastrophe appear to have some reproductive potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Given these observations and the potential importance of the meiosis-specific genes in the response of p53 mutated tumour cells to genotoxic treatment, further study of these meiotic genes in tumours may reveal novel therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>IF- immunofluorescence</p><p>SC- synaptonemal complex</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MK carried out the RT-PCR studies together with GP, performed the IF experiments, participated in REC8 western analysis and did most of the manuscript preparation.
