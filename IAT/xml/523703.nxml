The molecular basis of this enzyme regulation was investigated by isolating the rat P450(24) gene and examining the 5'-flanking region for possible cis-acting regulatory elements involved in the induction process. Constructs containing different lengths of 5'-flanking region of the gene were linked to a luciferase reporter gene and transiently co-transfected with a human vitamin D receptor (hVDR) expression vector (pRSV-hVDR) into COS-1 cells. These experiments showed that the flanking region from -298 to -122 directed a 24-fold increase in luciferase activity in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 provided that the cells were co-transfected with pRSV-hVDR. Within this region, the sequence from position -171 to -123 conferred 1,25-(OH)2D3 responsiveness to both the native P450(24) promoter and the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. Mutagenesis revealed that the sequence from position -150 to -136 is required for induction by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and that this sequence shares similarity to other vitamin D responsive elements (VDREs) reported for other genes. Gel shift mobility assays showed this region specifically bound a nuclear protein complex from 1,25-(OH)2D3 treated COS-1 cells that had been co-transfected with pRSV-hVDR. The retarded band was specifically competed with the well characterized VDRE from the mouse osteopontin gene. A VDRE at position -150 to -136 in the promoter of the rat P450(24) gene is identified in this study and found to be important in mediating the enhanced expression of the gene by 1,25-(OH)2D3.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00036-0241-a" xlink:role="2414"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00036-0237.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2410"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00036-0238.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2411"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00036-0239.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2412"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00036-0240.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2413"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00036-0241.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2414"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00036-0242.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2415"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00036-0243.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2416"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
