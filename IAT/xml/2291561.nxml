Here we present a large scale analysis by nanoLC-Q-TOF and nanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) of ten independent chloroplast preparations from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> which unambiguously identified 1325 proteins. Novel proteins include various kinases and putative nucleotide binding proteins. Based on repeated and independent MS based protein identifications requiring multiple matched peptide sequences, as well as literature, 916 nuclear-encoded proteins were assigned with high confidence to the plastid, of which 86&#x00025; had a predicted chloroplast transit peptide (cTP). The protein abundance of soluble stromal proteins was calculated from normalized spectral counts from LTQ-Obitrap analysis and was found to cover four orders of magnitude. Comparison to gel-based quantification demonstrates that &#x02018;spectral counting&#x02019; can provide large scale protein quantification for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This quantitative information was used to determine possible biases for protein targeting prediction by TargetP and also to understand the significance of protein contaminants. The abundance data for 550 stromal proteins was used to understand abundance of metabolic pathways and chloroplast processes. We highlight the abundance of 48 stromal proteins involved in post-translational proteome homeostasis (including aminopeptidases, proteases, deformylases, chaperones, protein sorting components) and discuss the biological implications. N-terminal modifications were identified for a subset of nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded proteins and a novel N-terminal acetylation motif was discovered. Analysis of cTPs and their cleavage sites of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplast proteins, as well as their predicted rice homologues, identified new species-dependent features, which will facilitate improved subcellular localization prediction. No evidence was found for suggested targeting via the secretory system. This study provides the most comprehensive chloroplast proteome analysis to date and an expanded Plant Proteome Database (PPDB) in which all MS data are projected on identified gene models.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chloroplasts are essential organelles of prokaryotic origin and carry out a wide range of metabolic functions. The chloroplast genome only encodes for about 100 proteins, whereas the vast majority of the chloroplast proteome is encoded by the nuclear genome. These proteins are generally synthesized as precursor proteins with cleavable N-terminal chloroplast transit peptides (cTPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-vonHeijne1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Several subcellular localization programs, such as TargetP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Emanuelsson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> are available that predict these cTPs, with the number of predicted chloroplast (plastid) proteins ranging from about 1500 to 4500 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Richly1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Sun1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However, several known plastid proteins appear to have no obvious cTP, and chloroplast outer envelope proteins never have a cleavable cTP (for discussion see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-vanWijk1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Millar1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. It was recently suggested that an <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (from here on referred to as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) chloroplast protein (a carbonic anhydrase) takes an alternative route through the secretory pathway, and becomes N-glycosylated before entering the chloroplast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Villarejo1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that more chloroplast proteins follow this route. Large scale experimental plastid proteomics studies are needed to evaluate unusual targeting pathways and to provide new training sets to improve subcellular localization prediction.</p><p>Driven by developments in mass spectrometry (MS), the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplast proteome has been analyzed by MS in combination with various protein fractionation techniques to assign proteins to chloroplast compartments (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-vanWijk2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Rolland1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>). Collectively, these studies identified 1090 proteins (counting 1 gene model per protein), with an overall cTP prediction rate of 60&#x00025; by TargetP (data not shown). However, from manual evaluation we estimate that 300&#x02013;350 proteins likely represent false positive identifications and/or non-chloroplast contaminations. This shows that uncurated experimental proteomics data from isolated subcellular compartments and localization predictors do not provide sufficient quality for localization. However, the combination of multiple independent proteomics experiments, ideally from all compartments of a cell, as well as cross-correlation to detailed functional and localization (eg. with GFP fusion proteins) studies may allow high quality subcellular localization and functional annotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Heazlewood1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Currently, this curation process cannot be fully automated and requires manual supervision. Thus more experimental work and curation is needed to obtain a more in-depth and accurate overview of the chloroplast proteome in <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic></p><p>Protein accumulation levels within a cell, or subcellular compartment such as the chloroplast, span five to ten orders of magnitude. To understand chloroplast function and homeostasis and to accommodate systems biology approaches to model genetic and metabolic networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Glinski1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, it is important to determine protein accumulation levels. A recent analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> stromal proteome used gel based quantification to rank the abundance of 240 stromal proteins spanning several orders of magnitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Peltier1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The challenge is now to obtain accurate quantification for a larger percentage of the chloroplast proteome. Recently, large scale MS-based studies for yeast, humans, <italic>E. coli</italic> and other sequenced organisms have shown that the number of MS/MS spectra matched to a protein (spectral counts - SPC) positively correlates with the protein abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Liu1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Lu1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon control of several experimental conditions, careful and stringent spectral assignments, and sophisticated normalization procedures, it appears that MS-based quantification can provide an attractive and sensitive tool to obtain large scale measurements of relative protein concentrations. For further review and discussions were refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Listgarten1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Bantscheff1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. These new developments provide an excellent opportunity for quantification of the chloroplast proteome as will be demonstrated in the current study.</p><p>The half-life and function of proteins is often influenced by post-translational modifications (PTMs). N-terminal modifications of chloroplast proteins have shown to be important for chloroplast viability. For instance, N-terminal acetylation in the cytosol of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins is required for chloroplast function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Pesaresi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, both chloroplast localized deformylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Giglione1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Giglione2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and methionine endopeptidase are essential for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedling viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Giglione3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Ross1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. It is quite likely that these N-terminal modifications improve protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Meinnel1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, for example to avoid degradation by the abundant chloroplast Clp protease system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Adam1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. However, no systematic experimental analysis of N-termini of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplast proteins has been carried out so far. PTMs, such as N-terminal acetylation, typically lead to a well-defined change in molecular mass that can often be detected by high quality MS. The rapid improvements in MS instrumentation, exemplified by the linear ion trap triple quadropole (LTQ) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance and LTQ-Orbitrap instruments, now facilitate a high throughput PTM analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Jensen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Olsen2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The current study determines chloroplast stromal protein abundance and N-terminal modifications, re-evaluates chloroplast transit peptides and cleavage sites, and provides a comprehensive catalogue and annotation of the chloroplast proteome, encompassing existing literature. The plastid proteomics database, PPDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ppdb.tc.cornell.edu/">http://ppdb.tc.cornell.edu/</ext-link>), first described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Friso1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, is focused on the (cell-type specific) chloroplast proteomes from maize and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and their functional annotation. We recently renamed the Plastid PDB into Plant PDB to better reflect the content. The dataset obtained in the current study is integrated in the PPDB, is expected to serve the plant community in small and large scale analyses where protein subcellular location, protein modification, function and abundance are important. Moreover, based on our experimental and theoretical analysis of the N-terminal portions and cTP cleavage sites, it is expected that the chloroplast data set presented here will facilitate improvement of subcellular protein localization predictors. Finally, the protein coverage and abundance of key chloroplast pathways and processes is discussed. This study demonstrates that &#x02018;spectral counting&#x02019; can provide large scale protein quantification for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which is important in the context of plant systems biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Glinski1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Hennig1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental identification of the chloroplast proteome by LTQ-Orbitrap</title><p>To identify stromal and thylakoid proteins in the chloroplast, three independent <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplast preparations from mature rosette plants were used.

Biological replicates were analyzed two or three times to determine the technical variation of MS acquisition, as discussed further below.</p><p>Filtering criteria for MS-based protein identification were chosen to give an overall peptide false discovery rate (FDR) of 1&#x00025;, as estimated by concatenated target/decoy database search <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Peng1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, only one gene model per protein was selected, which was either the one with the highest protein identification Mowse score, or in case of equal scores, the one with the lowest model number (indicated by the number after the digit). If the same set of peptides could be used to identify several different proteins, these homologous proteins were reported as an ambiguous group with all possible proteins listed, yet counted as one protein identification. For example, AT5G38410.1 and AT5G38420.1, corresponding to Rubisco small subunits 3B and 2B, were counted as one identification because they were described by the same set of peptides. Proteins were not reported if they could only be identified based on subsets of peptides matching to another identified protein.

We then filtered the identified accessions in these LTQ and Q-TOF data sets each separately, using two simple and objective parameters: i) presence in at least 2 independent preparations, with at least 2 unique matched MS/MS spectra per preparation; the underlying assumption is that contaminations are often different in each independent preparation, and ii) at least 2 different peptide aa sequences across the independent observations. This is to avoid proteins that are identified with repeated matched MS/MS spectra (possibly in different charge states) of only 1 peptide sequence. Examples are AT5G39560 (WAVE protein) and At5G01730 (KELCH protein) each multiple times identified with peptides IEWINSVLTVPL and EDLISPR, respectively. Applying these two simple filters resulted in 739 nuclear-encoded proteins with an 86&#x00025; cTP prediction rate and 46 chloroplast-encoded proteins in the LTQ-Orbitrap data sets and 340 nuclear-encoded proteins with a 91&#x00025; cTP prediction rate and 13 chloroplast-encoded proteins in the Q-TOF stromal data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001994.s005">Table S4</xref>).

The second residue has a strong affect on the frequency of acetylation, and in eukaryotes, acidic residues (D, E) stimulate acetylation, while P and basic residues (K and R) inhibit acetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Polevoda1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0001994-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001994.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Consensus Sequences of the sites of cTP cleavage in chloroplast proteins.</title><p>(A) Sequence logo of the cTP cleavage site, constructed for proteins, for which N-terminally Acetylated semi-tryptic peptides within 10 residues from predicted cTP cleavage site were observed by MS.

Interestingly, the second position for these sequences is occupied by A, S, V or L which is different from the preference in eukaryotes, although none of these residues have inhibitory effects on acetylation in eukaryotes. Additionally, the &#x0002b;3 position is occupied by the small, uncharged residues, S,A,V, and T, in agreement with avoiding charged and very large residues in eukayotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Polevoda1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To distinguish between motifs for the SPP and the acetylase, we also assembled those proteins for which the most N-terminal identified peptide was within 10 aa residues from the predicted cTP cleavage site (upstream or down-stream) and for which the N-terminal residue was un-modified. The sequences of these proteins were aligned, assuming that the most N-terminal identified peptide represented the true N-terminus of the protein, resulting in a sequence logo plot of 62 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001994-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The upstream residues at the &#x02212;3 and &#x02212;1 positions are similar to the sequence logo plot from acetylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001994-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), but with stronger conservation of the A at the &#x02212;1 position. The residues at the &#x0002b;1 and &#x0002b;2 position were enriched for A, S, but there was little conservation at the &#x0002b;3 position. This suggests that the conservation at the &#x0002b;3 position in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001994-g006">Figure 6A</xref> was due to preference for the N-terminal acetylase, rather than SPP. This helps to define the consensus motif for N-acetylation in chloroplasts, which is important for future N-acetylation predictions. Interestingly, the set of acetylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001994-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), but not the unmodified set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001994-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), showed also some conservation at the &#x02212;3 to &#x02212;7 positions.</p><p>There is a potential pitfall in this analysis using tryptic digests (cleaving C-terminal of R and K), in that the &#x02212;1 position is enriched for R or K. However, using semi-tryptic peptides, rather than full tryptic peptides suppressed this potential pitfall, which is obvious from the weak &#x02018;conservation&#x02019; lack of R or K at the &#x02212;1 position in the sequence logos. We note that the average length of the peptides in our analysis was &#x0223c;15 residues, explaining why there is little risk for artificial enrichment for R or K within the first 10 residues down-stream of the cleavage site. To illustrate this point, we created a sequence logo of 203 stromal proteins for which the most N-terminal peptide (full tryptic or the semi-tryptic peptide) was within 10 residues of the predicted cTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001994-g006">Figure 6C</xref>); this clearly shows an &#x02018;artificial&#x02019; enrichment of R and K at the &#x02212;1 position, which has no biological relevance.</p><p>The sequence logo of the original experimental training set showed a consensus sequence for the cTP cleavage site of &#x0005b;V/I&#x0005d;&#x0005b;R/A/V&#x0005d;&#x0005b;A/MC&#x0005d;&#x02193;&#x0005b;A/S/M&#x0005d;. However, using the same proteins to predict the cTP consensus motif with ChloroP produced a consensus sequence of &#x0005b;V/I/P&#x0005d;&#x0005b;R/S/V&#x0005d;&#x02193;&#x0005b;A/C/S&#x0005d;&#x0005b;S/A/M&#x0005d;, essentially moving the cleavage site one residue upstream <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Emanuelsson2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. When creating a sequence logo of the predicted cTP from a much larger dataset of 898 annotated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chloroplast proteins (outer envelope proteins were removed) (see further below), we observe a similar consensus sequence as for the original training set and a similar upstream shift of one residue as compared to the experimental consensus sequence presented. Moreover, the sequence logo of the predicted cTP of our large dataset shows a similar enrichment for R at the &#x02212;1 position as originally observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001994-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). However, our experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001994-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>) suggest that there is not such a strong preference for an R. The one residue upstream shift by the cTP cleavage site predictor, is most likely a consequence of the build-in preference (based a small set of <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage experiments) for cleavage after an R, as explained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Emanuelsson2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on our experimental data and the low abundance of the amino peptidases quantified in our study, it seems unlikely that all imported and SPP processed proteins undergo systematically a one (or two) aa removal from the N-terminus. We suggest that there is an excellent basis and larger experimental data set for improvement of the cTP cleavage site predictor.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>lTP cleavage site analysis</title><p>So far, 66 nuclear-encoded proteins assembled from various papers have been identified in the chloroplast lumen (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ppdb.tc.cornell.edu/subproteome.aspx">http://ppdb.tc.cornell.edu/subproteome.aspx</ext-link>). These proteins have a lumenal transit peptide (lTP) down-stream of the cTP which is needed to cross the thylakoid membrane. In addition several integral thylakoid membrane proteins also have an lTP.</p><p>The LTQ-Orbitrap analysis identified 46 out of these 66 lumenal proteins, and except for the lumenal PSI subunit psaN (AT5G64040; see further below), none of them showed N-terminal acetylation, consistent with cleavage of the lTP on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane and the lack of a known acetylase in the lumen. This also confirms the low FDR for acetylation. In addition, we identified five integral thylakoid proteins with known lTP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001994-t002">Table 2</xref>). For 13 of these lTP proteins, we identified the processed N-terminus that exactly matched the predicted cleavage site and/or N-terminal Edman sequencing data from previous studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001994-t002">Table 2</xref>). For one accession (AT3G01480 - TLP40), we found that the most N-terminal peptide matched the Edman sequencing data, but was 11 residues downstream of the predicted lTP. This either suggests an unusual lTP cleavage after the residues &#x02018;DVS&#x02019;, instead of after the predicted residues AHA, or this suggests that there was an additional cleavage event. Interestingly, the most N-terminal peptide for OEC-23-like (AT2G39470) and an isomerase (AT1G18170) were upstream of the predicted lTP cleavage site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001994-t002">Table 2</xref>), indicating either incorrect lTP cleavage site prediction or identification of an intermediate processing step. The N-terminal Edman sequence (ASA&#x02193;NAGVI) of psaN, coinciding with an lTP cleavage site, was 2 residues down-stream of the N-acetylated and unmodified peptides that we identified multiple times by MS. This suggests that biogenesis of psaN is more complicated that anticipated.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0001994-t002" position="float"><object-id

Therefore we investigated those identified proteins for which the most N-terminal (tryptic/semi-tryptic and/or modified) peptide matched the predicted lTP cleavage site or was within 100 residues downstream of the predicted lTP, <underline>without</underline> any additional peptides matching upstream of the predicted lTP site. These proteins were then evaluated for experimental mass spectrometry data and other information. This identified four putative lumenal proteins with unknown function, three of which were also identified in our earlier thylakoid analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Friso1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Peltier3">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001994-t002">Table 2</xref>). The predicted lTP cleavage site (SMA&#x02193;ENI) for one of the proteins (AT2G23670) coincides precisely with the most N-terminal peptide identified (ENIPLFGIR). Putative lumenal protein At1G05385 is an orthologue of cyanobacterial protein Psb27 which was suggested to be involved in assembly of the water splitting complex of PSII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Nowaczyk1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Roose1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, consistent with location on the lumenal site of the thylakoid. We note that Psb27 has another homologue in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, At1G03600, for which we previously determined the N-terminus by Edman sequencing and which we assigned to the lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Peltier4">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref> and was recently showed to be involved in PSII assembly in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Chen1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Putative lumenal protein AT2G36145.1 has no predicted function, nor predicted TMD and a maize homologue (TC294822) was found in maize thylakoids (Majeran et al, submitted). Putative lumenal protein AT5G42765 was identified with strong MS data in the thylakoid and the most N-terminal (semi-tryptic) peptide suggests an lTP cleavage site of AFA&#x02193;FSLGISGPK (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001994-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>N-terminal modifications of chloroplast-encoded proteins</title><p>Chloroplast-encoded proteins are synthesized with an N-terminal formylated methionine residue. The N-termini of 59 chloroplast&#x02013;encoded proteins from various plant species were experimentally determined by Edman sequencing across multiple studies, and subsequently assembled and evaluated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Giglione2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> (see the table at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isv.cnrs-gif.fr/tm/maturation/images/chloro.html">http://www.isv.cnrs-gif.fr/tm/maturation/images/chloro.html</ext-link>).

In this study we only observed and quantified MAP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001994-g004">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that MAP1B is more abundant than the other two amino peptidases.</p><p>Since no systematic experimental N-terminal analysis for chloroplast-encoded proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> we used the LTQ analysis to evaluate information about the N-termini of 54 identified chloroplast-encoded proteins. For 12 chloroplast-encoded proteins we determined the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001994-t003">Table 3</xref>), while the N-terminus for several others could not be determined, because they start with a short (semi-)tryptic peptide of less than 7 residues These short peptides are excluded from our database searches because of the relatively low information content. Four out of those 12 proteins (rpl14, and NDH subunits A,I,J) were identified with their N-terminal methionine. The N-termini of Rpl14 and NdhI were also observed with the methionine removed. In case of NDHA, the methionine was formylated; however, we must be careful as samples have been observed to become non-enzymatically formylated during the sample preparation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Whitelegge1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. For five proteins (cyt<italic>b6</italic>, rps8, rps15, D2, CF1&#x003b5;), we observed that the methionine was always removed and two of those processed N-termini (for D2, CF1&#x003b5;) were acetylated (both at a T residue). In case of CF1&#x003b2; and RBCL, the first two residues were removed and the new N-termini (respectively an R and P residue) were acetylated. Thus in addition to preferential N-acetylation of A,V,S,T,M observed for the imported nuclear-encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001994-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), N-acetylation can also occur at T, R and P.

We did identify the processed N-terminus (starting at residue 37) of mature cyt<italic>f</italic> which was not acetylated, as expected since it is located on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001994-t003">Table 3</xref>).

It was shown that that this carbonic anhydrase was synthesized with an N-terminal sP and after cleavage in the ER, it reached the chloroplast through an unknown mechanism. It was hypothesized that this maybe a more common pathway for targeting of nuclear-encoded proteins to the chloroplast. Therefore, the 916 nuclear-encoded plastid proteins (but excluding 18 known outer envelope proteins) were passed through the SignalP predictor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/</ext-link>).

We used two MS platforms and 95&#x00025; of the proteins identified in the stromal preparations by Q-TOF MS were also found in the LTQ-Orbitrap analysis. This clearly reflects the higher sensitivity and speed of the LTQ-Orbitrap platform, as was recently detailed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Elias1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>, and also underscores the reproducibility of the stromal preparations.</p><p>Uncurated experimental proteomics data from isolated subcellular compartments do not provide sufficient quality for localization, as contamination of even less than 1&#x00025; protein mass can result in significant numbers of identified proteins from other subcellular compartments. However, by demanding that proteins are identified with multiple high quality MS/MS spectra (with FPR &#x0003c;1&#x00025;) and multiple unique peptide sequences in multiple independent preparations, many of these contaminations can be eliminated. We showed that this was particularly effective for chloroplasts. Subsequent comparison to proteomics studies of other subcellular compartments and cross-correlation with studies of localization and function removed (most) remaining contaminants.</p><p>Some 20 non-chloroplast proteins were frequently observed in our chloroplast preparations, with scores placing them in low abundance classes. For instance, we frequently observed peroxisomal proteins involved in photorespiration. Repeated analysis of total <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedling extracts by LTQ-Orbitrap MS as described here, show that these proteins are among the top scoring proteins in terms of matched MS/MS spectra (Zybailov, Friso and van Wijk, unpublished data). We also noted that most of these contaminants are observed in many proteomics studies of other organelles and membranes, further illustrating the benefits of cross-correlating different studies, made easy through an integrative PPDB. A recent mitochondrial proteome analysis observed many enzymes in the cytosolic glycolytic pathway and it was suggested that they interact tightly with mitochondria, explaining their frequent identification in mitochondrial samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Heazlewood3">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar scenario may explain the identification of cytosolic HSP70 and an isomerase in the chloroplast preparations. This brings about the question how one can identify proteins that have less than five orders of magnitude abundance than the most abundant chloroplast proteins. We believe that it will be possible to assign such proteins to the chloroplast based on repeated MS based identification, when many other subcellular compartments are also analyzed with similar high sensitivity setups. A collective effort of the plant (proteomics) community specialized in preparing the various subcellular compartments will be needed to create a high quality &#x02018;proteome map&#x02019; of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell.</p><p>The stringent filtering of our experimental proteomics data, combined with known chloroplast proteins from the literature, identified 916 nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins. The experimentally identified proteins include many low abundant regulatory proteins, such as several kinases involved in aa biosynthesis (<italic>e.g</italic>. shikimate-kinases At2G35500 and At3G26900), a protein tyrosine phosphatase (AT3G44620) and the thylakoid integral membrane protein state-transition kinases, STN7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Bellafiore1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref> and STN8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Bonardi1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>, not earlier observed in MS studies. In addition, we identified multiple low abundant putative RNA and DNA proteins and four RNA polymerases (Rpo-A,B,C1,C2) that were previously only identified by MS in experiments specifically focused on the transcriptional apparatus and the plastid chromosome (the nucleoid) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Pfalz1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref> &#x02013; here it is worth noting that we identified these polymerases in the thylakoid fraction, consistent with the thylakoid association of the plastid nucleoid. We also identified several new putative thylakoid lumen proteins that may help to clarify the function of this enigmatic compartment. The chloroplast protein dataset will be an important resource for detailed chloroplast studies, as well as large scale <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> analysis.</p><p>Ultimately, it would be ideal to identify every protein in the chloroplast, but given the anticipated wide range of protein abundance (&#x0003e;6 orders of magnitude) and the dynamics of the chloroplast proteome, this is not feasible. To better understand coverage and function of the identified chloroplast proteome, we compared the MapMan bin distribution (for functional assignments) of the cTP predicted plastid proteome (4053 - only 1 gene model) with the curated plastid proteome. This shows that the identified chloroplast proteome is overrepresented (as compared to the predicted plastid proteome) in co-factor and vitamin metabolism (59&#x00025;), Photosynthesis (58&#x00025;), N-metabolism (&#x0002b;54&#x00025;), tetrapyrrole metabolism (47&#x00025;), major CHO metabolism (&#x0002b;45&#x00025;), redox regulation (&#x0002b;44&#x00025;), oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (49&#x00025;), while proteins involved in signaling (&#x02212;74&#x00025;), stress (&#x02212;69&#x00025;), development (&#x02212;47&#x00025;), unassigned (&#x02212;45&#x00025;) and RNA (&#x02212;40&#x00025;) are underrepresented. Even if functional assignments and cTP predictions are imperfect, this provides an impression of relative protein abundance of the various functional classes and processes within chloroplasts, with overrepresented and underrepresented proteins being respectively of higher and lower abundance. The actual quantification of the stromal proteome using the spectral counting technique provides a more accurate estimate of pathway abundance.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Stromal proteome quantification and pathways analysis</title><p>Large scale quantification of protein abundance, alongside quantification of transcripts and metabolites, will be needed for systems analysis of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Glinski1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, this gel based method fails to accurately detect and quantify the lower abundance proteins and also cannot accurately quantify proteins that co-migrate with other proteins. Gel based quantification is thus not a suitable alternative for large scale quantification. Additional (but far more costly and labor intensive) techniques, such as titration with known amounts of stable isotope labeled &#x02018;proteotypic&#x02019; peptides uniquely representing each proteins will be needed to obtain precise quantifications (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Nesvizhskii1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>).

It is clear that while further optimization of MS based quantification is beneficial, our current quantification of the stromal proteome using spectral counting does provide an excellent overview of over 550 stromal proteins, with relatively small variation and a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude. We used this quantitative data to highlight the post-translational protein homeostasis machinery, while the remainder of the dataset is provided as a community resource for functional analysis of the chloroplast.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Analysis of the cTP and cleavage site suggests potential for improved subcellular localization prediction</title><p>Determination of the protein subcellular localization in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is important since it often dictates the function of a protein and it is also needed to calculate metabolic flux and contributions to signal transduction cascades (e.g. kinases, phosphates, etc) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Fernie1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>.

The large set of curated plastid proteins in this study and the detected features in the cTP cleavage site, suggest that there is a good basis for improving plastid localization prediction. Analysis of unfiltered sets of identified proteins in stromal samples suggested that the cTP success rate was much lower for low abundant proteins than for high abundant proteins. However, when chloroplast membrane associated and thylakoid lumen proteins, as well as non-chloroplast contaminants, were removed, this bias was strongly reduced, indicating that cTP prediction rates are relatively independent of protein abundance, although some bias for the very high abundant proteins (class I and II) does seem to exist, as also indicated by the 97&#x00025; cTP prediction rate of those 156 proteins that were identified in each of the nine LTQ experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001994.s007">Table S6</xref>).

Taking advantage of the high accuracy of the Orbitrap, we were able to determine the N-termini of 47 acetylated nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins and also identified processed (by deformylase and amino-peptidase activity) and unprocessed N-termini of chloroplast-encoded proteins. The biological significance of N-acetylation varies with the particular protein and has been shown to affect protein-protein interactions, protein assembly and enzymatic activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Polevoda1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Analysis of the acetylated N-termini identified in the current study suggests that in case of nuclear-encoded proteins, small hydrophobic residues A, V, followed by small, hydroxylated residues S and T account for 80&#x00025; of the acetylated residues. Position 2 is occupied by A, S, V, L and position 3 essentially by S,T,A,V. This illustrates that G, charged residues (D,E,K,R,H), aromatic residues (Y,N,Q) and residues with large side chains (I and L) are largely avoided in the first three positions. This includes primary destabilizing residues in <italic>E. coli</italic> (F,Y,W,L), as well secondary destabilizing residues (R,K) although the latter is likely a consequence of the tryptic digest. In case of chloroplast-encoded acetylated proteins, all but one were acetylated after f-Met removal. The acetylated N-termini residues are either T, R or P, with the secondary residues L,I,T,Q, which is very different from the residues in nuclear-encoded proteins. This could suggest involvement of two different N-acetylases, one operating co-translationally in case of chloroplast-encoded proteins and the other operating pos-translationally. We are not aware that anyone has investigated the role of acetylation of these or other chloroplast proteins, and this collection of acetylated proteins will provide a basis for such investigations.</p><p>The N-end rule states that the half-life of a protein is determined by the nature of its N-terminal residue. Whereas this fundamental principle is conserved from bacteria to mammals, prokaryotes and eukaryotes employ distinct proteolytic machineries for degradation of N-end rule substrates and the stabilizing and destabilizing residues are also different. The proteolytic machineries in plastids and chloroplast are all distinctly of prokaryotic origin, and it is therefore anticipated that the N-end rule stabilizing and destabilizing residues also follow bacterial rules. Proteolysis in prokaryotes and plastids is entirely independent of ubiquitin. Instead substrate selection is mediated by specialized HSP100 components (in chloroplasts ClpC1,C2, and ClpD) and aided with so-called adaptor proteins (ClpS), which together transfer the substrates to their cognate proteolytic partners. The N-rule and proteolysis in prokaryotes is best studied in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Mogk1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Baker1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, large hydrophobic (L.F,W,Y) and basic residues (R,K) represent primary and secondary destabilizing residues. Generally, M-aminopeptidases do not generate N-end rule destabilizing N-termini and indeed, the processed N-termini of the chloroplast-encoded N-termini followed this rule. In addition, in <italic>E. coli</italic>, proteins with an R or K as N-terminus can be destabilized by addition of L or F through an L/F-tRNA protein transferase &#x02013; but no such transferase has yet been identified in chloroplasts. As mentioned above, we only observed one nuclear-encoded protein with an N-terminal destabilizing residue, Y in AT3G55250.1, which was observed multiple times but always carrying an N-terminal acetylation. Inspection of the sequence logos of the experimental, non-acetylated cTP cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001994-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) showed that the experimental N-termini essentially avoided destabilizing residues.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Creating resources for the plant community</title><p>To disseminate our chloroplast proteomics data and integrate these with other types of proteomics information, we had developed the Plastid Proteomics Database, PPDB, initially reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Friso1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. For this study we have added several features to the PPDB, in particular to better display details of MS based identification such that the user can better evaluate the significance of the protein identification and assigned localization. This includes mass error for all precursor ions and matched peptides, protein Mowse scores, as well as peptides with PTMs and a search option to extract all PTMs (with peptides and accessions). Importantly, all matched MS data are projected on the relevant gene models (using &#x02018;pop-up&#x02019; windows), aiding in a better understanding of gene models and PTMs. MS data from earlier published papers (since summer 2004) were all re-searched and filtered and search data extracted and uploaded into PPDB. In addition, all protein accessions can be directly cross-referenced against identified proteins from more than 50 published proteomics papers (from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other members of the <italic>Brassicae</italic> family), as well as the subcellular localization in GO (experimental) from TAIR, localization data from SUBA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.suba.bcs.uwa.edu.au">http://www.suba.bcs.uwa.edu.au</ext-link>) and best matching homologues in maize and rice. Many of these data types can be directly exported from the PPDB as excel files. Since we also curated the location of hundreds of non-chloroplast proteins, and to reflect other available information, we changed the name from Plastid PDB to Plant PDB. Our PPDB is a unique resource for the plant community and complements other plant proteomics resources, such as Promex, a mass spectral reference database for proteins and protein phosphorylation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Hummel1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>, SUBA a database for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Heazlewood1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as databases specialized in other organelles, such as peroxisomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001994-Reumann1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>.

A precolumn splitter was used to reduce the flow rate of 10 &#x000b5;l.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 200 nl.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Each sample injection and analysis was followed by two blank injections using 60-min and 40-min gradients to prevent carry over from sample to sample.</p><p>The Q-TOF was operated in positive ion mode with sample cone voltage of 35 kV, capillary voltage of 3.3 kV and a source temperature of 90&#x000b0;C. The samples were run in data-dependent mode (DDA) where each full MS scan was followed by three consecutive MS/MS scans of the 3 most abundant peptide molecular ions (typically doubly and triply charged ions), which were selected consecutively for collision-induced dissociation (CID). The MS survey scans (m/z 350&#x02013;1550) were carried out with a scan time of 1 second (s) and a interscan time of 0.08 s. MS/MS spectra were automatically acquired when the peak intensity rose above a threshold of 10 counts.s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Normalized collision energies for peptide fragmentation were set using the charge&#x02013;state recognition files for 1&#x0002b;, 2&#x0002b;, 3&#x0002b;, 4&#x0002b; peptide ions provided by Masslynx (Waters). For tandem MS acquisition we used a scan range from m/z 50&#x02013;1550 with a scan time of 1.92 s and an interscan of 0.08 s and a dynamic exclusion window of 240 s. Argon was used as collision gas. All MS data from the Q-TOF were processed using Mascot Distiller (v2.0) and the resulting peak lists (in mgf files) were searched again against ATH1v6 database concatenated with a decoy where all the sequences were in reversed orientation using Mascot with a significance threshold of 0.01. For each of the peak lists two searches were performed: 1) tryptic search and 2) a semi-tryptic search with methionine oxidation set as a variable modification and carboxymethylation of cysteins as fixed modification and the maximum mass error tolerance for precursor and products ions at respectively 1.2 and 0.8 Da. Using in-house written filter the results both searches were combined in an excel spreadsheet. Only matches from tryptic search were considered in protein identifications. The Mascot output was automatically processed by in-house software (Qi Sun, B. Zybailov and K.J. Van Wijk; unpublished).</p><p>The LTQ-Obtrap was interfaced with an LC system (MS surveyor pumps from Thermoelectron) and an MicroAS autosampler (from Thermoelectron). Analysis by nanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap was as follows: Used automated sample pickups, 6.4 &#x000b5;l peptide extracts were loaded at 20 &#x000b5;l.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 6 min on a guard column (LC Packings; MGU-30-C18PM), followed by elution and separation on a PepMap C18 reverse-phase nano column (LC Packings nan75-15-03-C18PM), using 90-min gradients with 95&#x00025; water, 5&#x00025; acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1&#x00025; FA (solvent A), and 95&#x00025; ACN, 5&#x00025; water, 0.1&#x00025; FA (solvent B) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. A precolumn splitter was used to reduce the flow rate of 25 &#x000b5;l.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 200 nl.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Each sample injection and analysis was followed by two blank injections using 60-min and 45-min gradients to prevent carry over from sample to sample. The acquisition cycle consisted of a survey FTMS scan at the highest resolving power (100,000), followed by 5 data-dependent MS/MS scans acquired in the LTQ. Dynamic exclusion was used with the following parameters: exclusion size 500, repeat count 2, repeat duration 30 s, exclusion time 180 s, exclusion window &#x000b1;6 ppm. Target values were set at 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> for the survey and Tandem MS scans, respectively, and the maximum ion accumulation times were set at 200 ms in both cases. Acquired MS/MS data were searched with Mascot 2.2 using a significant threshold of 0.01. Preliminary search was conducted with broad precursor tolerance window set at &#x000b1;30 ppm. Peptides with the ion scores above 45 were chosen as benchmarks for off-line recalibration. Recalibration was performed using a Perl script which adjusted precursor masses in the peak lists. The recalibrated peak lists were searched again against ATH1v6 database concatenated with a decoy where all the sequences were in reversed orientation. For each of the peak lists three searches were performed: 1) <italic>tryptic</italic> search with precursor ion tolerance window set at &#x000b1;6 ppm, 2) <italic>error-tolerant</italic> search with precursor ion tolerance window set at &#x000b1;3 ppm, 3) <italic>semi-tryptic</italic> search with acetylation of peptide N-terminus set as a variable modification. For all of the three types of searches first and second <sup>13</sup>C peaks were considered as precursors without widening of the precursor ion tolerance, using the corresponding Mascot 2.2 feature. Additionally, in all of the three searches methionine oxidation was set as a variable modification. Using in-house written filter the results of the three searches were combined in an excel spreadsheet. The ion scores threshold were set to 33, which yielded final peptide false positive rate below 1&#x00025;. Additionally, for proteins represented only by one unique peptide, mass accuracy on the precursor ion was required to be within &#x000b1;3 ppm.
