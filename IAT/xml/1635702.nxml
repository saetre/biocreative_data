Allergic asthma results from an inappropriate immune response to inhaled allergens characterized by the recruitment of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils to the lung, inflammatory mediator release, IgE production, mucin hypersecretion and bronchoconstriction. It is believed that CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th2-type cells mediate these responses through the production of the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]).</p><p>Recent studies have shown that patients with asthma have increased activation of complement components C3 and C5 with increased bronchalveolar lavage C3a and C5a levels following allergen challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and patients with severe asthma have higher C3a plasma levels than those with stable asthma. Numerous studies investigating the role of C3 in asthma have shown C3-deficient mice have consistently decreased AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Studies by Drouin et al found C3-deficent mice have decreased airway eosinophilia, allergen-specific IgE and a reduced number of IL-4 producing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Converse to these studies genetic analysis has inversely linked gene expression of complement component 5 (C5) with susceptibility to AHR in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In these studies mouse strains that are more susceptible to allergen-induced AHR had decreased C5 gene expression while those resistant to developing AHR had increased C5 gene expression. Few studies have further investigated this paradigm.</p><p>In the present studies, C5-sufficient and C5-deficient congenic mice were immunized and challenged with a HDE containing high levels of cockroach allergens (CRA). CRA has been implicated as a key allergen in the incidence and severity of allergic asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We show that C5-deficient mice have significantly increased AHR. C5-deficient mice also have a dramatic increase in BAL fluid cysteinyl-leukotriene production providing a potential mechanism for the increased AHR seen in these mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>6&#x02013;8 week old C5-deficient (B10.D2-H2d H2T18c Hc<sup>0</sup>/oSnJ) and C5-sufficient (B10.D2-H2d H2T18c Hc<sup>1</sup>/nSnJ) congenic mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, Maine). C5-deficient mice carry a null hemolytic component (Hc) allele rendering them unable to produce C5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

Sterile PBS was added to the dust and mixed overnight at 4&#x000b0; on a rotator. Samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 &#x000d7; g, 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 &#x000d7; g, 4&#x000b0;C and the HDE was stored in aliquots at -70&#x000b0;C for analysis of allergen content[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] The levels of cockroach allergens Bla g1 and Bla g2 in the HDE were determined using matched-antibody pairs (Indoor Biotechnologies, Charlottesville, VA).

On days 14 and 21 animals were challenged intratracheally with 1:10 diluted HDE, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Baxter, Deerfield, IL) and the anesthetized mouse was suspended from its front incisors on an inclined board with the base of the tail taped to support its weight. The tongue was retracted using forceps while holding the jaw open and two, 25 &#x003bc;l aliquots of 1:10 diluted HDE were pipetted at the base of the oropharynx. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on day 22 or 23, as indicated in the text. Following exsanguination, lungs were lavaged with 2, 1-ml fractions of HBSS. The two washes were centrifuged at 1000-&#x000d7; g for 5 minutes. The supernatant of the first wash was saved for later analysis while the supernatant of the 2<sup>nd </sup>fraction was discarded. The cell pellets from both washes were combined and total cells were counted using a Coulter counter model ZF (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Slides of BAL fluid cells were prepared in a cytospin (Shandon Southern Instruments, Sewickley, PA), slides were stained with Diff-Quick (Baxter, Detroit, MI) and differentials were calculated by counting 300 cells. For lung homogenate preparations, the whole right lung was removed and kept on ice in 3-ml of Hanks balanced salt solution without magnesium or calcium containing one Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and 0.01% Triton-X. Samples were homogenized, sonicated and centrifuged at 16,000-&#x000d7; g for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. Supernatant was stored at -70&#x000b0;C for later protein determination.</p></sec><sec><title>Airway hyperresponsiveness</title><p>AHR of mice was measured 24-hours after the last airway challenge using a whole-body plesthysmography system (Buxco, Troy, NY). Mice were placed in the main chamber and allowed to acclimate for 10 minutes. Baseline values were then recorded for 5 minutes. Mice were subsequently challenged with aerosolized PBS or increasing doses of aerosolized &#x003b2;-methylcholine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for a 2-minute period. The response was recorded for 5 minutes after each dose by measuring the pressure differences between the main chamber containing the mouse and a reference chamber. Differences in signal quantified during respiratory cycle are reflected by enhanced pause (Penh). Penh is widely used in models of pulmonary dysfunction and has been shown to correlate with airway resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Penh values are normalized as the percent increase of average Penh for each methylcholine dose over the average Penh for PBS aerosolization. Calculating the change in Penh will account for pressure changes resultant from heating and humidification of air traveling between the chamber and lungs, termed gas conditioning. If gas conditioning is present, then an absolute Penh may not be indicative of bronchial constriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our experimental design ensures that the Penh does reflect increases in bronchial constriction.</p></sec><sec><title>Leukotriene receptor antagonist treatment protocol</title><p>Immunized, C5-deficient mice were by oro-gavage with 10 mg/kg body weight of Montelukast (Singular<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Merck, Whitehouse station, NJ) in 0.1 ml of PBS.

CCL11, CCL2, IL-12 and IL-13 primary and secondary antibodies and standards were purchased from (R &#x00026; D systems, Minneapolis, MN). IL-12 was measured using antibodies directed against the p70 form (also from R &#x00026; D Systems). Total plasma IgE was measured by ELISA using rat anti-mouse IgE MAb, rat anti-mouse IgE biotinylated antibody, and mouse IgE standard (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Standards and samples were diluted in dilution buffer containing 10% Casein, 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.0001% BSA in 1&#x000d7; PBS. HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoReseach Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was diluted 1:20,000 and added to plates for 30 minutes at room temperature. Color was developed with 3, 3'-5, 5' tetramethylbenzidine and the reaction was stopped with 1.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

Anti mouse Tryptase &#x003b2;-1 capture antibody and mouse tryptase &#x003b2;-1 standards were purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Ninety-six well plates (Nunc Immunoplate Maxisorb; Nunc, Neptune, NJ) were coated with serially diluted standard or samples, and incubated overnight at room temperature. The plates were then washed using a wash buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (FisherBiotech, Fair Lawn, NJ) in PBS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the plates with Blocker Casein (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in PBS for 1 hour. This and subsequent incubations were conducted at room temperature on a shaker. After washing, the capture antibody was added and the plates incubated for 2 h. Standard curves were prepared using the appropriate recombinant allergen. All standard and sample dilutions were made in dilution medium (10% casein in PBS supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 (FisherBiotech)). Plates were washed and peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 1 h. After a final wash, 3,3',5,5' tetramethylbenzidine(Genzyme Diagnostics, San Carlos, CA) was added, plates wereincubated in the dark for 15 min, and the reaction was stopped with 1.5 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Plates were read using dual wavelengths (465 and 590 nm) on the Bio-Tek microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT), and allergen concentrations were estimated using the recombinant allergen standard curve.

Non-immunized, i.e. na&#x000ef;ve, C5-sufficient and C5-deficient mice had equivalent numbers of cells recovered from the BAL fluid. These cells were 99% alveolar macrophages (data not shown). C5-deficient and C5-sufficient congenic mice were immunized and challenged with HDE. AHR was assessed by whole body plethysmography on day 22, 24-hours after the last pulmonary challenge in all experiments. For the 24-hour time point animals were sacrificed immediately after AHR measurement. In separate experiments mice were sacrificed 48-hours following the last pulmonary challenge, on day 23; previous studies have shown AHR peaks at 24-hours, whereas 48-hours is the optimal time-point for eosinophil and lymphocyte influx to the airways in this model system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Differential counting of the BAL fluid found C5-deficient mice exhibit slightly reduced total cell recruitment to the lung following allergen challenge (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Eosinophil influx to the airways is reduced in C5-deficient animals compared to sufficient controls, though this reduction did not reach significance (p = 0.06, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). BAL fluid lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils were comparable in the deficient and sufficient mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;E</xref>).

Complement activation in allergic asthma may occur through the classical, lectin, or alternative pathways; these pathways converge at the level of C3 activation. The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a may also be formed by proteolytic cleavage of C3 and C5 by inflammatory cell-derived proteases or allergen proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Dendritic cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and T lymphocytes chemotax to C5a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, C5a mediates eosinophil and neutrophil activation resulting in degranulation and oxidant secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In our studies, cell recruitment to the lung was not markedly decreased in C5-deficient animals suggesting the involvement of other chemotactic agents. Although these chemokines may account for allergen-induced cellular influx in these animals, levels of the chemotactic cytokines CCL11/eotaxin and CCL2/MCP-1 were not altered in C5-deficient animals. CCL11/eotaxin has been shown to be a potent eosinophil chemotactic mediator and is believed to be important in the development of allergic asthma and is a major eosinophil chemoattractant in our model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Despite comparable, if not slightly reduced, pulmonary inflammation AHR was exacerbated in C5-deficient animals indicating the increased AHR in C5-deficient mice occurs independent of cellular recruitment to the airways. Previous work in our laboratory has suggested AHR is independent of inflammatory cell recruitment in that lymphocyte and eosinophil influx to the airways peaks at 48-hours after allergen challenge whereas AHR peaks at 24-hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In agreement with our studies, Corry et al have shown AHR occurs independently of eosinophil recruitment to the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Exacerbated AHR in C5-deficient animals was first suggested in gene-linkage studies by Karp et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] that showed C5 gene expression inversely correlates with the magnitude of allergen-induced AHR in an ovalbumin model of allergic asthma; C5 gene expression was found to be lower in mouse strains more susceptible to the development of allergen-induced AHR. More recently, Kohl et al showed blocking C5aR signaling during initial allergen priming results in exacerbated TH2 responses and increased AHR compared to control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It has been suggested that the increased AHR in C5-deficient animals is due to a skewed immune response in favor of a TH2 phenotype; mouse strains deficient in C5 (A/J) have significantly decreased IL-12 production from cultured peritoneal macrophages following IFN-&#x003b3; + <italic>Staphalococcus aureus </italic>(SAC) stimulation compared to cultured macrophages isolated from C5-sufficient C3H/HeJ mice. Primary human monocyte cultures stimulated with IFN-&#x003b3; + SAC in the presence of a specific C5aR antagonist showed a dose-dependent decrease in IL-12 production as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Taken together this suggests that C5a signaling through the C5aR would result in IL-12 production and Th1-cell differentiation; thus there is an abrogated IL-12 response in C5-deficient animals that may favor Th2-cell development and potentiate the allergic phenotype. These studies do not address the <italic>in vivo </italic>IL-12 response following allergen stimulation. We report C5-deficient mice immunized and challenged with HDE have significantly decreased lung homogenate IL-12 at 24-hours but similar levels of IL-12 in BAL fluid compared to C5-sufficient mice of the same genetic background. IL-13 in the lung was also comparable in sufficient and deficient animals at 24- and 48-hours after allergen challenge. These time points were chosen as optimal for the measurement of AHR and cellular influx to the airways however, the peak of cytokine and chemokine production in lung is likely a much earlier event. It is plausible that the Th1/Th2 balance is skewed in the early asthmatic response and further studies to investigate the time course of IL-12 and IL-13 production in the lung need to be performed to determine if cytokine levels are comparable early after allergen provocation.</p><p>Increased production of cysteinyl-leukotrienes relates to increased AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and provides a potential mechanism for the substantial increase in AHR seen in C5-deficient mice following allergen provocation. Cysteinyl-leukotrienes are secreted by activated mast cells, basophils and eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Studies using W/W<sup>v </sup>mice deficient in mast cells have shown the importance of these cells in allergen-induced AHR. Mast cell deficient animals immunized and challenged with OVA fail to develop AHR to MCh challenge but AHR is restored when mast cells are reconstituted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Clinically, basophils and mast cells accumulate in the airways of asthmatic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We show for the first time that C5-deficient animals have significantly increased production of cysteinyl-leukotrienes in the BAL fluid compared to sufficient controls. Furthermore, we found this enhanced cysteinyl-leukotriene production in C5-deficient animals was directly linked to the substantial increase in AHR seen in these animals. Treatment with the leukotriene inhibitor Montelukast abrogated the hyperresponsiveness. These data are interesting considering previous in vitro studies have found C5a leads to leukotriene C4 production by basophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and both C3a and C5a have been shown to stimulate chemotaxis of mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore one would expect leukotriene production to be decreased in the C5-deficient mice. The apparent dichotomy of C5aR signaling has been shown to be dependent on the time of receptor targeting. C5aR signaling at the time of sensitization has been reported to protect against the development of allergic inflammation whereas signaling through C5aR in a pre-existing inflammatory environment results in enhanced inflammatory responses. This supports our findings that the absence of C5a at the time of sensitization results in exacerbated allergic inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of cysteinyl-leukotriene production in C5-deficient mice is not clear from these studies and requires further investigation. Total plasma IgE is comparable in sufficient and deficient animals suggesting enhanced leukotriene production is not mediated through Fc&#x003b5;RI. One explanation is that the degree of C3 activation is increased in animals deficient in C5. C3-deficient and C3aR-deficient mice have decreased pulmonary inflammation, Th2 cytokine production, and AHR in OVA models of allergic pulmonary inflammation and attenuated particulate matter-induced AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. These studies consistently show C3a is an important mediator of AHR. C3a binding to C3aR on mast cells and basophils could activate these cells to release inflammatory mediators including leukotrienes. We saw similar levels of C3 protein in the BAL fluid of sufficient and deficient animals after allergen challenge at 24- and 48-hours after allergen challenge and further investigation into the levels of C3 and C3a in C5-sufficient and C5-deficient animals is planned.</p><p>Alternatively, C5a and C3a may have differential roles in the allergic inflammatory response. As suggested by Hawlisch et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], C5a binding to C5aR results in IL-12 production while C3 binding C3aR favors Th2 cytokine production. This would explain contrasting results with C3-deficient animals and C5-deficient animals in models of allergic asthma. Previous investigators have also demonstrated that blockade of C5a will reduce late airways hyper-reactivity in an ovalbumin model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], inhibition of complement activation also reduced airways hyper-reactivity in the ovalbumin model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and blockade of C5a receptors reduced airways responsiveness in an Aspergillus model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The differences in experimental design between these previous reports and our studies and those of Karp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] probably account for the divergent results. Karp's studies plus our own used genetically modified mice while the other papers inhibited complement only during the effector phase of asthma.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown C5-deficient mice immunized and challenged with HDE containing high levels of cockroach allergens exhibit dramatically increased AHR. This AHR occurs independently of pulmonary cellular infiltration and does not appear to be the result of a skewed immune response as seen by comparable production of IL-12 in sufficient and deficient animals. It remains possible that C5-deficient mice have an abrogated IL-12 response and enhanced IL-13 production in the early phase of the asthmatic response resulting in the increased cysteinyl-leukotriene production; future studies where mice will be sacrificed in the early phase are thus planned. Increased levels of BAL fluid cysteinyl-leukotrienes seen in C5-deficient mice provide a logical mechanism for the increased level of AHR.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AHR, airway
