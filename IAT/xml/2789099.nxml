This process involves reception of signals by the presynaptic cell followed by precise rearrangements of the cytoskeleton to direct changes in cell shape and control the formation of the presynaptic apparatus (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] for reviews).</p><p>The giant fiber system (GFS) is a unique neural circuit that contains several of the few identified central synapses in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and includes the largest in the fly between the giant fiber (GF) interneuron and the leg extensor muscle motorneuron, the tergotrochanteral motorneuron (TTMn), the GF-TTMn synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Several studies using over-expression of dominant-negative transgenes, or homozygous adult viable mutations, have recently shed light on signaling mechanisms during the formation of the GF-TTMn synapse. These include the receptors Semaphorin 1a and Roundabout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; the L-1 type cell-adhesion molecule Neuroglian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]; the endocytotic and ubiquitin machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; the small GTPase DRac1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and the transcription factor Ken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the precise mechanisms by which these integrate during synaptogenesis are yet to emerge.</p><p><italic>Glued </italic>encodes the largest subunit of the retrograde motor dynein-activating complex dynactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The <italic>Glued</italic><sup>1</sup>(<italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>) mutation results in a truncated protein product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] that disrupts the dynein-dynactin complex by binding to dynein and microtubules but fails to bind to cargoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Mutants have both visual and CNS defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Glued has a key role in formation of the GF presynaptic bend which may involve local cytoskeletal dynamics and rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Forward genetic screens to identify gene products involved in post-mitotic neural differentiation can be problematic as many of these genes are plieotropic and will have vital functions earlier in development, thus preventing mutants from being recovered. Moreover, many of the genes may well have several functions during differentiation of a single neuronal type. Consequently, mutants, therefore, will exhibit phenotypes that are difficult to interpret. Indeed, this has been shown for the dynein-dynactin complex in the formation of mushroom body neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The eye is not required for either viability or fertility of the adult and genetic disruptions targeted to the eye have been exceptionally useful in deducing signaling pathways, for example the <italic>sevenless </italic>pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and also in identifying mutant alleles that would cause lethality earlier in development if they were to be expressed throughout the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This coupled with the fact that it has been estimated that two thirds of the vital genes within the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>genome (~2,500) are involved in its development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], makes the eye invaluable in a primary screen for genes with additional roles in processes such as neural differentiation.</p><p>In this study we have undertaken a genetic modifier screen in the adult eye and isolated 12 mutations that either dominantly enhance or suppress a phenotype caused by over-expression of a dominant-negative form of the Glued protein (Gl<sup>DN</sup>). We assayed these mutations for additional interactions with <italic>Glued </italic>in the GFS and found that 6 show interactions. Mapping of each modifier mutation is presented. One of the suppressors is an allele of <italic>aPKC</italic>, and we found that other aPKC mutant alleles exhibit suppression of the synaptic phenotype caused by over-expression of Gl<sup>DN</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Screening for modifiers of a truncated Glued (Gl<sup>DN</sup>) over-expression eye phenotype</title><p><italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>is a true dominant-negative mutation and the effects of the truncated product produced are dose-sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We previously exploited this by generating a UAS-Gl<sup>DN </sup>transgene to over-express this "poison subunit" using the GAL4-UAS system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and showed that disruption of retrograde motor function resulted in synaptic defects in the GFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our aim was to identify genes that acted with <italic>Glued </italic>during GFS formation in the developing CNS. Direct screening for alterations of an adult neural phenotype is problematic and extremely labor-intensive because it would involve an F2 screen. Individual mutant stocks would need to be made and crossed into the appropriate mutant background followed by dissection and staining of the adult CNS.</p><p>We therefore reasoned that since <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>affects the development of the eye, monitoring the eye phenotype in a primary F1 screen would provide an excellent read-out for defining interacting loci. Using the eye-specific GMR-GAL4 line to target truncated Glued (Gl<sup>DN</sup>) resulted in the generation of adult flies possessing smaller eyes with fused ommatidia and miss-arrayed eye bristles. As expected, this was a more severe phenotype than that seen in <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). This disruption provided a sensitized background in which to base an F1 screen on adult eyes to isolate novel mutations that altered this phenotype. We performed an EMS screen for second-site modifiers that dominantly enhanced or suppressed the over-expression phenotype in the eye (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; see materials and methods). We screened over 34,000 flies and obtained both suppressors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) and enhancers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>) that reproducibly altered the eye phenotype. We recovered nine lines with homozygous lethal mutations on the second chromosome and seven lines with homozygous lethal mutations on the third chromosome that were either enhancers of <italic>Glued </italic>(EGs) or suppressors of <italic>Glued </italic>(SGs). The lethal mutations were most likely the dominant modifiers of the eye phenotype but we could not rule out the posibility of second-site mutations on the chromosomes that were responsible for altering the phenotype. The lines were crossed <italic>inter se </italic>for complementation. All mutations showed complementation illustrating each of the 16 mutations map to independent loci (data not shown). Twelve of these were analyzed further (see below).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The Gl<sup>DN </sup>sensitized screen in the adult eye</bold>.

From these lines we wished to identify which mutations dominantly interacted with <italic>Glued</italic>, rather than simply up- or down-regulated the GAL4/UAS system or interacted with the synthetic GMR element which can cause disruptions if homozygous or if the temperature is raised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To do this we tested whether these mutations could dominantly interact with the <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>allele by making flies heterozygous for both <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>and the novel EG or SG mutations and identifying subsequent alterations of the <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>eye phenotype. The <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>eye phenotype was clearly exacerbated by the enhancer EG162 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Other mutations caused more subtle alterations of the <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>adult eye phenotype that were either variable or could not be distinguished when viewed under a dissecting microscope. The eyes of <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ individuals show irregular ommatidia and bristle orientation as revealed by SEM (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In addition retinal sections reveal a variable number of rhabdomeres in each ommatidium, which are often reduced in size, as well as clear disruption of the accessory cells. As previously reported, these affects produce a distortion in the overall shape of the ommatidia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To determine whether we had isolated interacting mutations we examined whole eyes by SEM and retinal sections by light microscopy from the eyes of <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ flies and those transheterozygous with an enhancer (EG37) and a suppressor (SG13). When EG37 was introduced into the <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>background (EG37/+; <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+) we saw an increase in bristles and an increase in ommatidial fusion and disorganization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Retinal sections of the eyes from these flies revealed increased disruptions of accessory cells and fused rhabdomeres (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). The number of rabdomeres per ommatidium was 4.43 &#x000b1; 1.11 (<italic>n </italic>= 195, P &#x0003c; 0.001) compared to those from flies containing <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ alone which had 5.03+1.28 (<italic>n </italic>= 119). We also sometimes saw holes between some ommatidia in the sections (data not shown). With SG13 in the <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>background (SG13/+; <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+), the ommatidia and bristles became more ordered than is seen in <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, compare D [inset] with B [inset]) and the sections revealed a return to a more hexagonal lattice of accessory cells and trapezoidal pattern of the rhabdomeres (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). These contained an average of 5.89 &#x000b1; 1.13 (n = 195, P &#x0003c; 0.001) rhabdomeres per ommatidium. These data indicated that, for at least two of our mutations, we had isolated loci that genetically interact with <italic>Glued </italic>during eye development. A third suppressor, SG46, was also analysed in this way and also showed supression of the <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>eye phenotype (data not shown).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>An enhancer and a suppressor interact with <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>in the adult eye</bold>.

Several studies have reported that this bend is often absent or altered when the two neurons fail to form a proper synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Since our main aim was to identify genes involved in synapse formation within the GFS we next performed morphological analysis of the giant fiber neurons in adult flies carrying an EG or SG mutation and with disrupted <italic>Glued </italic>function.</p><p>We used the GF-specific GAL4 enhancer-trap line, <italic>A307 </italic>[GAL4] (hereafter referred to as <italic>A307</italic>), to identify alterations of the GF morphological phenotype, brought about by Gl<sup>DN </sup>over-expression, in the presence of the dominant enhancers or suppressors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Our previous work indicated that there are two aspects to the phenotype observed when Gl<sup>DN </sup>is targeted to the GF. First, the distinctive terminal bend does not form after 48 hrs of pupal development indicating that synaptogenesis with the TTMn is defective. Second, as the GF axon develops during later pupal stages, the tip swells, often to several times the axon diameter, presumably because of a build-up of cellular material that the motor is unable to move toward the cell body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Like many GAL4-generated phenotypes there is some variation between preparations, most notably on the extent of axon swelling (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). While both the lack of terminal bend and axon swelling are a result of retrograde motor disruption, any link between the two phenotypes is unclear. Both SG13/+ and SG46/+ showed suppression of these two phenotypes when Gl<sup>DN </sup>was expressed using <italic>A307 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Swollen axon tips were rarely seen and the axons were either "bendless," or showed at least one bend in a preparation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref> [arrowhead] &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), a phenotype not seen when the dominant-negative subunit is expressed alone (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). SG58/+ showed a mild suppression of the GF morphology phenotype with consistently fewer neurons exhibiting swollen axons (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, see below). However no bends or partial bends were observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). We could not unequivocally rule out the possibility of these mutations altering the effectiveness of the GAL4/UAS system, however, the phenotypes observed for SG13/+ and SG46/+ were different from those seen if GAL4 expression was suppressed by reducing temperature (M.J.A unpublished observations). SG16/+ showed no rescue of the GF morphology phenotype, suggesting that this mutation does not interact with <italic>Glued </italic>in the GFS. The EG162/+ and EG165/+ caused dominant lethality in the <italic>A307</italic>&#x0003e;Gl<sup>DN </sup>background (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) presumably because they affected other cells expressing Gl<sup>DN </sup>in the A307 line that eliminated viability. 20% (4/20) of EG28/+ preparations exhibited GF axons which remained in the brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). This is likely to be due to a failure to exit the brain on outgrowth, or retraction after a failure in synatogenesis. No obvious enhancement of the GF phenotype was observed with EG37/+ (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Mutations that interact with <italic>Glued </italic>and alter GF axon morphology</bold>.

Mutations in genes that have a role earlier in development, for example in axon guidance, may give rise to a discernable enhancement, such as incorrect GF axon growth as was the case for EG28/+. In <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>mutants the GFs look morphologically normal, although they have GF-TTMn synaptic defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, we tested for dominant effects of the EG mutations on the morphology of the GFs in a <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ background by generating flies with <italic>A307</italic>, UAS-LacZ, <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>and our third chromosome EGs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I-K</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We saw an increase in the frequency of "bendless" axons in 3 of 4 EG mutations tested, suggesting an enhancement of the <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ phenotype, but no appearance of the swellings seen with over-expression of the dominant-negative subunit. Unusually, preparations containing EG28/+ and <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ exhibited a reduction in "bendless" axons and often had ectopic axonal branching (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K</xref>). Taken together with the phenotype seen with Gl<sup>DN </sup>(see above), we presume this mutation is at a locus that has a role in axon growth and/or guidance. We were unable to do this with the mutations on chromosome two, using any GAL4 GF marker lines, since the mutations are on the same chromosome as the UAS-Gl<sup>DN </sup>insert resulting in over-expression of Gl<sup>DN </sup>in any cell that express GAL4 and contain the mutation. The UAS-Gl<sup>DN </sup>element and the interacting mutations would need to be separated onto different chromosomes by either recombination or precise excision of the P-element containing the UAS-Gl<sup>DN </sup>transgene. As an alternative, morphology of the GF can be observed using dye-filling techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, these techniques are labor-intensive and were not practicable for screening purposes.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutations that interact with <italic>Glued </italic>in the Giant Fiber System and alter synaptic function</title><p>We used electrophysiology to assay GFS function, which, in combination with morphological analysis, can reveal abnormalities of synaptogenesis during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A severe GF-TTMn synaptic phenotype is caused by over-expression of Gl<sup>DN </sup>; some flies fail to respond to brain stimulation and those that do respond exhibit a long response latency and show only a single response or poor following to repetitive stimuli ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We put the SG mutations which had exhibited morphological rescue into the <italic>A307</italic>/UAS-Gl<sup>DN </sup>background.

All preparations responded to brain stimulation and had shorter response latencies and increased following at 100 and 250 Hz than is seen with simple over-expression of Gl<sup>DN </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). SG58/+ also exhibited a detectable increase in synaptic function with all preparations responding upon stimulation, a slight reduction in the long latency seen when Gl<sup>DN </sup>is over-expressed and also a corresponding increase in following to repetitive stimuli which was significant at 100 Hz (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Mutations that suppress the electrophysiological phenotype seen in <italic>A307</italic>&#x0003e;Gl<sup>DN </sup>adult flies</bold>.

They exhibit a response latency not significantly different from wild type (&#x003c7; = 1.1 ms, <italic>n </italic>= 8) to brain stimulation, but do not follow 1:1 on stimulation at a frequency of 250 Hz as observed in wild type flies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). We crossed the EGs into the <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ background to observe any enhancement of this synaptic phenotype. Because this test did not rely on GAL4 expression we were able to assay any of the EG mutations, regardless of their chromosomal location. All of the EGs tested showed significantly increased reponse latencies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) and exhibited poor following. To analyse this more carefully we looked at the probability of a response being seen with each sequential stimulus at 250 Hz. When 10 stimuli were given to <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ mutants, the flies demonstrated a depression in response to stimuli 1 through 10 with a plateau after stimulus 6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), probably due to TTMn not always reaching threshold. This resulted in a 30% (probability 0.3) chance of responding to the last 4 stimuli for <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ flies whereas wild type flies will typically have &#x0003e; 90% (probability &#x0003e; 0.9) chance of responding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). When EG37/+ or EG162/+ were trans-heterozygous with <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ an enhancement of the phenotype was seen since 100% of <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ flies responded to stimulus number 3 whereas the probability of responding fell to 0.6 with EG37/+ and &#x0003c;0.2 with EG162/+ added (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). We used root mean square deviation (RMSD) to measure the differences in the depression curves and compared them to that seen with <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+. The average deviation between <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+; EG37/+ and <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ was 0.23 (P &#x0003c; 0.1) and between <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+; EG162/+ and <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ was 0.48 (P &#x0003c; 0.001). For most of the other enhancers tested there was no significant enhancement of the depression seen with <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). This included EG28/+ which had given outgrowth/retraction phenotypes when combined with Gl<sup>DN </sup>(see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Two of the EGs, EG56/+ &#x00026; EG79/+, seemed to suppress the depression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>) despite the fact that they caused an increase in the reponse latency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

Alternatively, the mutation in EG37 may have different properties than the <italic>Su(H)</italic><sup>1 </sup>allele.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The success of our two-stage screening approach may have been facilitated by the fact that <italic>Glued </italic>has a plethora of distinct roles during eye development, including organizing optic neural architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and an involvement in the formation of sensory neuronal circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore we had an eye phenotype on which to base the screen. However, this does not preclude such a method being used for identifying genes involved in other aspects of neural differentiation. We found that 50% (6/12) of the isolated mutation-containing chromosomes that altered the eye phenotype also altered GFS phenotypes when tested.</p><p>The over-expression of the truncated Glued protein caused strong phenotypes in both the eye and GF neurons, greater than those caused by heterozygosity for the dominant <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>allele. This is likely to be due to the GAL4-UAS system producing many more molecules of the truncated product than <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ cells in which, theoretically, a maximum of half of the Glued molecules will be truncated. Consistent with this observation, both the suppressors and enhancers isolated during this screen showed stronger effects on Gl<sup>DN </sup>eye phenotypes than on those produced by <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>. Determining interactions with the <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>allele also allowed us to confirm GAL4-independent interactions with the <italic>Glued </italic>locus. For all of the mutations (with the exception of EG162), the alterations of the weaker <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ eye phenotype were not obvious, however, SEM and sectioning was performed to show interactions with two of the mutations (EG37 &#x00026; SG13).</p><p>We used two different disruptions of Glued function, one strong and the other weaker, to assay successfully the effects of both enhancer and suppressor mutations in the GFS using both morphological and electrophysiological criteria. The severe disruptions of GF morphology and synaptic function enabled the effects of suppressor mutations to be clearly observed. This was less reliable when assaying the effects of mutations isolated as enhancers as either no increase of the already severe phenotype was seen or the interaction was lethal. For the enhancers, therefore, we relied on generating double heterozygotes with <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+. As was the case in the eye, interactions were less pronounced and only two enhancers, EG37/+ and EG162/+ showed enhancement of the <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ electrophysiological phenotype. Indeed, the subtlety of some interactions with <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>/+ may have resulted in our analyses being unable to detect some positive interacting loci in the GFS that altered the eye phenotype caused by Gl<sup>DN</sup>.</p><p>We have generated some EMS alleles, two of which we have mapped to known genetic loci (see below) and four of which we have mapped to discrete chromosomal locations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). However, these four complement all the available lethal alleles in these regions indicating that our mutations lie in loci for which there are few or no lethal alleles available. Identification of the location of these new alleles will require either new rounds of mutagenesis, such as via P-element excision in the mapped regions, finer mapping using SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] or custom made deficiencies using stocks from the DrosDel project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Completion of the BDGP Gene Disruption Project may also enable mapping of the lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] along with more recent approaches using other transposable elements that may disrupt genes refractory to P-element disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Interestingly, we appear not to have isolated any mutations in genes that encode known components of the retrograde motor complex including any further alleles of <italic>Glued</italic>. During some of the early genetic analysis of the <italic>Glued </italic>locus, dominant second-site suppressors of the <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>eye phenotype were isolated and reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Of these, two were mapped to the X chromosome (<italic>Su [Gl]27 </italic>&#x00026;<italic>Su [Gl]57</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]) and the others, <italic>Su(Gl)77 </italic>&#x00026;<italic>Su(Gl)102 </italic>are alleles of <italic>Dynein heavy chain 64C </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. From the map positions of our mutations, we have not re-isolated similar alleles. Because our primary screen involved making only the eye mutant for <italic>Glued</italic>, we could potentially isolate mutations that are lethal in combination with <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1 </sup>and would, therefore, not have been isolated Harte and Kankel's screen. However, none of the enhancers tested were lethal with <italic>Gl</italic><sup>1</sup>.</p><p>We have successfully isolated two new alleles of known genes, <italic>Su(H) </italic>and <italic>aPKC</italic>. Of the two, we have shown that alleles of <italic>aPKC </italic>genetically interact with <italic>Glued </italic>in the GFS and suppress the abnormalities in GF-TTMn synapse formation seen when the retrograde motor complex is compromised by Gl<sup>DN</sup>. These abnormalities are: a lack of the presynaptic "bends"; a branching event that takes place after the two neurons have met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]; swollen axon tips and a weak or absent functional synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. aPKC is part of a protein complex, with PAR-3 (Bazooka in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) and PAR6 that regulates cell polarity in a number of different tissues/cells of <italic>Drosophila </italic>and vertebrates including neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. So what is the role of <italic>aPKC </italic>in the GF neuron? In vertebrate neurons aPKC is needed for neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In contrast, aPKC in flies is an essential part of the machinery that polarizes dividing neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] but is not needed postmitotically for outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Our data also indicate that aPKC is not needed for neurite extension since the introduction of <italic>aPKC </italic>mutations into our sensitized background has no effect on GF outgrowth. <italic>aPKC </italic>is involved in memory formation in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and at the developing larval NMJ it regulates microtubules (MTs) both pre- and postsynaptically during synapse formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Indeed MTs are one of the major targets of the PAR-3/PAR-6/aPKC complex in several contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. aPKC regulates MT orientation in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] and MT organization in the early embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. At the NMJ it controls MT stability with a reduction in aPKC activity causing a decreased association of MTs with the microtubule associated protein Futsch and MT fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Dynein-dynactin is known to be involved in MT organization during growth cone remodeling as well as polarizing MTs in axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Our data indicate that dynein-dynactin and aPKC are acting antagonistically during formation of the GF presynaptic structure and suggest that both are needed to control microtubule organization and dynamics in synapse formation but have opposing roles. One simple explanation is that one of the roles of dynein-dynactin in the GF is to alter MT dynamics at the tip of the axon, when it has reached its post-synaptic target, so that they are more mobile enabling the presynaptic bend to be formed. aPKC regulates the stability of MTs thereby confining axon branching to a single bend. Blocking dynein-dynactin function prevents the MT re-organization needed for formation of the bends and this is ameliorated when aPKC function is reduced.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have used a novel approach to screen for genes involved in central synapse formation by performing a primary screen, using a sensitized background, on the adult eye and then a secondary screen, on the isolated mutations, for synaptic phenotypes. This study shows that forward genetic screens are powerful tools for identifying genes with roles in CNS development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Drosophila strains</title><p>The <italic>A307 </italic>[GAL4] enhancer-trap line and the line containing the UAS-Gl<sup>DN </sup>transgene on chromosome 2 (UAS-Gl<sup>&#x00394;96B</sup>) have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], as has the eye specific GMR-GAL4 line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].

We isolated 324 adults with altered eye morphology; 215 potential enhancers and 109 potential suppressors. Mutations were recovered by mating flies with altered eye phenotypes individually to <italic>w</italic>; <italic>CyO</italic>/Sco; <italic>MKRS</italic>/<italic>TM6B </italic>flies. Sibling crosses were then performed to obtain lines with recessive lethal, or recessive viable, mutations on chromosomes 2 or 3 balanced over <italic>CyO</italic>, <italic>MKRS </italic>or <italic>TM6B</italic>. One hundred and sixteen lines were recovered with either a recessive lethal on chromosome 2, 3, or both. We did not obtain any recessive mutations that gave a homozygous visible phenotype.

Samples were dried in a Polatron E3000 critical point dryer, mounted onto stubs, and coated with gold. Micrographs were taken on a Hitachi S-430 electron microscope. For retinal sections, head cases were dissected from whole flies and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>/NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>[pH 6.8]) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Following dehydration in an acetone series, the head cases were embedded in Durcupan resin and 2.5 &#x003bc;m sections cut with a Lieca: Jung RM2065 microtome.

Flies were cooled on ice until they were immobile and secured in wax, ventral side down, with the wings held outwards in the wax. The GFs were stimulated using a Grass S48 stimulator to deliver a 40 V pulse for 0.03 ms through tungsten electrodes pushed through the eyes and into the brain. A tungsten earth wire was placed into the abdomen. Glass microelectrodes (resistance 40-60 M&#x003a9;), filled with 3 M KCl, were driven through the cuticle into the TTM and DLM muscles to record responses. These were amplified using Getting 5A amplifiers (Getting Instruments, USA) and the data digitized using an analogue-digital Digidata 1320 and Axoscope 9.0 software (Axon Instruments, USA). A single pulse was delivered for response latency measurements and trains of 10 stimuli, either 4 ms (250 Hz) or 10 ms (100 Hz) apart, were given with a 5 s interval between each train for following frequency recordings. We routinely recorded from both TTM and a DLM in each preparation to ensure that correct stimulation of the GF was achieved. However, only data from the TTM are presented in this report.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic mapping</title><p>Mutations were mapped using the "classic"second chromosome "deficiency kit" (DK2) of 110 stocks from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center containing mostly deletions that were defined cytologically. Once deficiencies were identified that failed to complement the isolated lethal mutations, smaller deficiencies in the regions were tested for complementation including molecularly defined deficiencies recently made available from Exelixis and the DrosDel project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Standard complementation tests were then performed with known lethal mutations in the chromosomal regions uncovered by the deficiencies. SG13 failed to complement <italic>Df(2R)kr10 </italic>but complemented <italic>Df(2R)gsb </italic>and <italic>Df(2R)kr14 </italic>indicating that SG13 lies at 60F5. SG46 failed to complement <italic>Df(2L)79b </italic>which covers 22A2 to 22E1. Testing smaller deletions within this region revealed that SG46 failed to complement the molecularly defined deletions <italic>Df(2L)Exel17008 </italic>(22B8;22D1) and <italic>Df(2L)Exel17011 </italic>(22E1;22F3). However when crossed together the two deletions failed to complement each other and both fail to complement alleles of <italic>Dpp </italic>which lies at 22F1-2. Therefore they both delete at least the region 22E1 to 22F3 and <italic>Df(2L)Exel17008 </italic>is incorrectly annotated. SG58 failed to complement <italic>Df(2R)KnSA4 </italic>and <italic>Df(2R)XTE-58 </italic>indicating it resided between 51D1 and 51D6 on chromosome 2. Using the available lethal mutations we determined SG58 to be an allele of <italic>Drosophila </italic>atypical Protein Kinase <italic>C </italic>(<italic>aPKC</italic>) as it failed to complement <italic>aPKC</italic><sup>06403 </sup>and <italic>aPKC</italic><sup>EY22496</sup>, both known null alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. EG28 failed to complement <italic>Df(3R)p13 </italic>which extends from 84F1 to 85A8. Within this region EG28 failed to complement <italic>Df(3R)exel6417 </italic>but complemented <italic>Df(3R)dsx29 </italic>making its location to be within 84F7-84F12. All available lethal mutations were found to be not allelic to EG28. EG37 failed to complement <italic>Df(2L)TE35BC-24 </italic>and <italic>Df(2L)A48 </italic>and testing known lethal alleles uncovered by both these deficiencies revealed the mutation to be in the <italic>Su(H) </italic>locus. EG37 is lethal when trans-heterozygous with the <italic>Su(H)</italic><sup>1 </sup>allele. EG162 failed to complement <italic>Df(2R)X1 </italic>and <italic>Df(2R)stan1 </italic>indicating that is resides between 46D and 47A. However, it did complement <italic>Df(2R)stan2 </italic>indicating that it lies at 46D-E. We have been unable to map this mutation further at present.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LM and LAJ carried out the genetic screen; LAJ performed the SEM and eye sectioning; LM and MJA did the electrophysiology, all authors performed CNS dissection and staining.
