Proteins L5 and L18 were shown to be necessary and sufficient to effect the association of the 5S and 23S RNAs into a quaternary complex that contains equimolar amounts of all four components. Measurement of diffusion constants by laser light scattering revealed that integration of the 5S RNA induced the 23S RNA to adopt a somewhat more open conformation. An investigation of relationships among proteins associated with the central and 3' portions of the 23S RNA demonstrated that attachment of L5, L10 + L11, and L28 depends upon the RNA-binding proteins L16, L2, and L1 + L3 + L6, respectively, and that L2 interacts with the central segment of the 23S RNA. These data, as well as the results of others, have been used to construct a scheme that depicts both direct and indirect associations of the 5S RNA, the 23S RNA, and over two-thirds of the subunit proteins. The 5' third of the 23S RNA apparently organizes the proteins required to nucleate essential reactions, whereas a region within 500 to 1500 bases of its 3' terminus is associated primarily with proteins involved in the major functional activities of the 50S ribosomal particle.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0446.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1669"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0447.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1670"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0448.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1671"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0449.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1672"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0450.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1673"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0451.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1674"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0452.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1675"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0453.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1676"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0454.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1677"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0455.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1678"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0456.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1679"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0457.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1680"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0458.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1681"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00445-0459.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1682"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
