In the vertebrate retina, dopamine is involved in mediating neuronal adaptation to light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], and circadian rhythmicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>], as well as cell survival and eye growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. In teleost retinas, dopamine is released by dopaminergic interplexiform cells (DA-IPCs), which contact horizontal and bipolar cell dendrites in the outer plexiform layer (OPL), and receive input from amacrine and bipolar cell terminals in the inner retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. DA-IPCs have been proposed to be a centrifugal pathway for information flow from the inner to the outer retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>], and they have been shown to mediate the modulatory effect of olfactory input on retinal ganglion cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>].</p><p>Despite the diverse roles of DA cells in retinal functions, the understanding of DA cell function has been limited because they have a low density in the retina and cannot be identified in living retina by morphological characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. In the mouse, transgenic lines have been created, in which reporter genes are driven by the promoter for the tyrosine hydroxylase (<italic>th</italic>) gene, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis. These transgenic lines provide strategies to identify dopaminergic neurons in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>] and in situ in living retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Here we report marking dopaminergic neurons in vivo in zebrafish retina using a similar approach.</p><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) has become of interest for research on neurogenesis and the dopaminergic system due to fast embryonic development, as well as the availability of mutagenesis and transgenesis. For example, tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity studies have revealed the presence of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral diencephalon as early as 18 h post fertilization (hpf) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>], and in the retina at three days post fertilization (dpf) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. In addition, mutant zebrafish lines in which catecholaminergic or dopaminergic system development is disrupted have been isolated using large-scale mutagenesis screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Studies of these mutants can enhance our understanding of the dopaminergic system development and function. To investigate the normal function and morphology of living DA cells in zebrafish retinas, we established a transgenic zebrafish model in which GFP is driven by sequences of the zebrafish <italic>th1</italic> promoter. Here, we report morphological, molecular, and physiologic characterization of the genetically labeled neurons in this transgenic zebrafish line.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Transgenic zebrafish</title><p>To generate the <italic>Tg(&#x02212;12th:MmGFP)</italic> transgenic zebrafish, we isolated a genomic P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) clone, BUSMP706E03252Q3, containing the zebrafish tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (<italic>th1</italic>) gene promoter region by screening the zebrafish PAC library (BUSMP706) with a probe containing a part of <italic>th1</italic> cDNA sequence. To identify genomic fragments containing the <italic>th1</italic> promoter region, we digested the PAC clone with several restriction enzymes and performed duplicate Southern hybridization using two probes. The first probe was a genomic PCR product of the 5&#x02032;UTR region of the <italic>th1</italic> locus. Following identification of the <italic>th1</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR by RACE, we designed two primers as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> for the genomic PCR. The second probe was generated from a previously published partial <italic>th1</italic> cDNA clone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] by PvuII-BglII digest and contained approximately 100 bp of carboxyterminal portion of the coding region of the <italic>th1</italic> gene. To identify a genomic fragment, which contains mostly the promoter region and not the coding region, we sought to isolate PAC restriction fragments, based on Southern analysis, that are positive for the 5&#x02032;UTR probe but are negative for the carboxyterminal probe. A XbaI-XhoI fragment was identified, which fulfilled this criterion. The XbaI-XhoI fragment was further digested with EcoRI (EcoRI restriction site is found immediately downstream of the Th1 start ATG) and XhoI, and was cloned into a pBluescript II vector. The end sequencing of this fragment using T7 primer revealed that the fragment contains the <italic>th1</italic> genomic region of chromosome 25 starting at position 20376290 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/index.html">Ensembl</ext-link> Zv7 assembly). Since the <italic>th1</italic> transcript begins at the position 20364304, and since <italic>th1</italic> is oriented in reverse direction on this chromosome, the EcoRI-XhoI fragment encompasses 11986 bp of <italic>th1</italic> genomic promoter region; therefore, we refer to this fragment as <italic>th1</italic> 12 kb promoter fragment. The MmGFP chromophore coding region and SV40 polyA sequence was PCR-amplified from pG1 vector (gift of Chi-Bin Chien and Darren Gilmour, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT and EMBL) and cloned downstream of the <italic>th1</italic> 12 kb promoter fragment in the pBluescript II vector. To increase the translational efficiency, we adjusted the translational initiation context to better match the consensus Kozak sequence (GCCATGG). Transgenic zebrafish were generated by microinjection of 1&#x02013;2 nl of 50 ng/&#x003bc;l linearized DNA into 1- to 2-cell stage embryos (University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany). The founders were crossed with wild-type fish and their progeny were screened to establish transgenic lines. The transgene integration used for this study has the allele designation <italic>Tg(&#x02212;12th:MmGFP)<sup>m899</sup>.</italic></p><table-wrap id="t1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Primers for the genomic PCR and for the nested PCR</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="107" span="1"/><col width="245" span="1"/><thead><tr><th valign="bottom" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Primer</bold></th><th valign="bottom" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Sequence</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TH5RaceM13FF<hr/></td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02032;-GTTTACATTTCCAATGCGCGCG-3&#x02032;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TH5RaceM13FR<hr/></td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02032;-ATATCAGCAAAAGAGATTTAATGAAG-3&#x02032;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>th</italic> forward primer<hr/></td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02032;-CAGGATTTCAGTTGAGGCCAGTG-3&#x02032;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>th</italic> reverse primer<hr/></td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02032;-ATGCACCAGCTCTCCATAGGATG-3&#x02032;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>th</italic> nested primer<hr/></td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02032;-TCCACAGTGAACCAGTACATTGTCG-3&#x02032;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>dat</italic> forward primer<hr/></td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02032;-AACTCTCTGACCAGCTTCTCCTCCG-3&#x02032;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>dat</italic> reverse primer<hr/></td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02032;-ATTCCACCGTTGGTGACGCAG-3&#x02032;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>dat</italic> nested primer</td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02032;-GTCGATGAGTCCCGTGATCAC-3&#x02032;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Screen of transgenic offspring</title><p><italic>Tg(&#x02212;12th:MmGFP)</italic> transgenic zebrafish hemizygous for the <italic>Tg(&#x02212;12th:MmGFP)</italic> transgene were crossed with wild-type AB* fish to produce the hemizygous <italic>Tg(&#x02212;12th:MmGFP)</italic> fish used in this study.

The cell suspensions were distributed into 35&#x000a0;mm culture dishes, which were kept at room temperature for 30 min. For collection, cells were observed with an inverted microscope (Nikon, Lewisville, TX), and perfusion system was used to avoid contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. The inlet tube perfused the target cell with an extracellular solution for zebrafish that contained 137&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 2.5&#x000a0;mM KCl, 2.5&#x000a0;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10&#x000a0;mM HEPES, and 10&#x000a0;mM glucose (pH 7.4). Individual cells were aspirated into the pipette and after washing with extracellular solution, the tip of the pipette harboring the target cell was broken into a 0.5&#x000a0;ml tube with 14&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of Master Mix 1 and maintained on dry ice. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. For seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we used the primers shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. Seminested PCR was performed using an Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).

On average, 29.2 &#x000b1; 1.7% (mean &#x000b1; SD, n=4) of GFP-expressing neurons also expressed TH, and GFP-expressing neurons exhibited a density of 286 &#x000b1; 43 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>.

In this transgenic line, <italic>th1</italic>-driven GFP exhibited robust expression in the brain and retina, but was not restricted to DA neurons in the retina. In juvenile and adult zebrafish retinas, about 30% of GFP-expressing cells were found to be dopaminergic cells by co-labeling with TH. Single-cell RT&#x02013;PCR results further indicated that most dim GFP-expressing cells were dopaminergic neurons. In addition, spontaneous action potentials were observed in many of labeled cells in darkness, suggesting that these cells are functionally active. These results indicate that this transgenic line, though not a completely specific reporter for retinal dopaminergic neurons, provides the means to enrich for zebrafish retinal dopaminergic neurons in experiments using the living retina and in primary cell culture.</p><p>A similar strategy for labeling zebrafish dopaminergic neurons has been reported by Gao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. In their transgenic line, GFP expression was driven by the rat <italic>TH</italic> promoter and was present in many more neurons throughout one to two cell layers in the INL, as well as in the ganglion cell layer. In our line, GFP driven by the zebrafish <italic>TH</italic> promoter was restricted to a limited number (approximately 1000/retina) of neurons in the INL only. The zebrafish <italic>TH</italic> promoter used in the present study may more faithfully drive reporter expression compared to the mammalian promoter. It is possible that the presence of different transcriptional regulators in teleost and mammalian organisms is responsible for the disparate transcriptional regulation of these transgenes.</p><p>In our <italic>Tg(&#x02212;12th:MmGFP)</italic> transgenic line, about one-third of the GFP-expressing retinal neurons are TH-IR, while the rest remain to be identified. One possible explanation for this is that the 12 kb zebrafish <italic>TH</italic> promoter may not include all the 5&#x02032; regulatory elements, or that there are downstream regulatory elements not included in the transgene, so that GFP is ectopically expressed in some non-DA cells. A silencer or negative regulatory element that would normally suppress TH expression might be missing from the relatively small constructs, as has been proposed to be a potential reason for ectopic transgene expression in the mouse and in the zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Another possibility is that GFP-expressing, TH-negative cells could be non-DA catecholaminergic (CA) cells, referred to as Type 2 CA cells in the mouse and other mammalian species, that have been shown to express TH-promoter driven reporters, but to lack sufficient TH protein to be detected by antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. In mammals, there are distinct differences between DA cells and Type 2 cells in soma size, process morphology, and distribution pattern throughout the retina. However, our results indicate no significant differences in cell size or shape between GFP-TH colocalized cells and GFP single-labeled cells. Instead, we found a fluorescent intensity difference between individual labeled neurons that correlated with DAT expression. Although the identity of the non-DA cells is unknown to us, it is important to note that the GFP-fluorescent intensity can be used to reliably identify DA cells for molecular and physiologic analysis.</p><p>Our single-cell RT&#x02013;PCR results with bright and dim subpopulations of GFP-labeled neurons revealed a useful strategy for identifying dopaminergic neurons for future in vitro and in situ studies. Our results also indicate the possibility of analyzing the molecular components of GFP+ neurons at the single-cell level. For example, DA neurons in the mouse have been reported to express circadian clock genes, as well as multiple subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Investigation of these genes in the current <italic>Tg(&#x02212;12th:MmGFP)</italic> fish will provide the information about teleost retinas from a comparative aspect.</p><p>Electrophysiology recordings of GFP-expressing cells demonstrated that in the dark, many of these cells generate spontaneous action potentials. Spontaneous activity of dopaminergic retinal neurons has been implicated in the maintenance of the basal level of dopamine release from fish IPCs in a calcium-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. After prolonged darkness, fish cone horizontal cell responsiveness is suppressed, as is receptive field size of cone horizontal cells, both due to dopamine release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. These facts suggest that dopamine, released by spontaneous oscillatory spiking of DA-IPCs, modulates the dark-adaptation process of cone horizontal cells. Since horizontal cells mediate lateral inhibitory effects in the OPL and form the antagonistic surround responses of cones, bipolar cells, and certain ganglion cells, dopamine may have a broader effect on dark-adaptation in the retina via cone horizontal cells. In addition, Li and Dowling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>] studied effects of dopamine depletion in zebrafish and found that in DA-cell depleted fish, rod signals were blocked in the inner plexiform layer during dark adaptation. They suggested this rod signaling defect was due to the lack of dopamine release, which is required for the rod signal to be transmitted from the rod to cone bipolar cells in darkness. Our results provide direct evidence of dopaminergic cell activity in darkness in the zebrafish retina. Compared to dopaminergic neurons in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], zebrafish dopaminergic neurons exhibit lower rates of spontaneous activity in the dark, similar to the reduced number and frequency of spontaneously active ganglion cells in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Although the <italic>TH</italic>:RFP mouse model has been highly successful in defining novel aspects of dopamine amacrine cell control circuitry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], the zebrafish provides a potentially valuable alternative. Whereas the mouse has a nocturnal, rod-dominated retina, unlike the human, the zebrafish has a diurnal cone-dominated retina. Having molecular and physiologic data on dopaminergic neurons from the zebrafish retina for comparison should allow for elucidation of general principles of retinal dopaminergic organization.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that by using this <italic>Tg(&#x02212;12th:MmGFP)</italic> transgenic line, we can experimentally enrich for dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in vivo. <italic>Tg(&#x02212;12th:MmGFP)</italic> targeting of DA retinal neurons can be used as a valuable approach for developmental and functional studies of dopaminergic cells in the zebrafish retina.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by NEI grant EY09256 (D.G.M.), HFSP Long-term Fellowship (S.R.) and EU-IP ZF-MODELS (W.D.).
