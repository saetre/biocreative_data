Co-injection of mRNAs encoding custom-designed ZFNs into the pronucleus of fertilized oocytes yielded genetically modified offspring at rates greater than 20&#x00025;, which possessed a wide variety of deletion/insertion mutations.

We recently reported on a high-throughput gene-driven strategy which uses the mutagen ENU and the Mu-transposition reaction (MuT-POWER) to rapidly detect induced mutations. This was in addition to our investigation of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for recovering heterozygous genotypes of interest out of a large sperm cell repository <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Mashimo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Yoshimi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, even if a large number of mutant strains already exists or may potentially be available, targeted modification or disruption of specific DNA regions is difficult to achieve. Even in the case of our gene-driven strategy, X-linked mutations are impossible to obtain because of the breeding protocol which is used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Mashimo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recently, a novel gene-targeting technology which employs zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) has been proven to work successfully in plants, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, frogs, drosophila, zebrafish, and human ESCs and iPSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Porteus1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Wu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Hockemeyer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. ZFNs are chimeric proteins that consist of a specific DNA-binding domain which is made of tandem zinc finger-binding motifs that are fused to a non-specific cleavage domain of the restriction endonuclease <italic>Fok</italic>I. ZFNs can create site-specific double-stranded breaks which are repaired via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a process that results in the arbitrary addition or deletion of base pairs. Consequently, repair by NHEJ is mutagenic and results in a knockout. Recently, it was reported that a single injection of DNA or messenger RNA that encodes specific ZFNs into one-cell transgenic rat embryos that express GFP could lead to a high frequency of animals that do not express the transgenic marker as a consequence of homologous recombination at the GFP site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Geurts1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we report on an experiment that involved using ZFN technology. The aim of the experiment was to inactivate the gene that encodes the interleukin 2 receptor gamma (<italic>Il2rg</italic>), which is essential for signaling by interleukins such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. In addition, the gene is involved in the X-linked form of severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), one of the most common forms of human SCID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Noguchi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Leonard1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. A major motivation for performing this experiment was the observation that although SCID mouse animal models are the most commonly used in research on drug development, an X-SCID immunodeficient rat model would complement mouse models through the additional advantage of being employed for testing the pharmacodynamics and toxicity of potential therapeutic compounds.

Sequence analysis of the ZFN target site of these 54 founder animals revealed that 5 males and 8 females (24.1&#x00025;) carried a variety of mutations including from 3 to1,097 bp deletions and a 1 bp insertion in the region which overlapped the ZFN target site as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008870-g001">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008870.s001">Figure S1</xref>. Four out of five of the males carried different biallelic mutations at the <italic>Il2rg</italic> locus despite them only having one X chromosome. This suggests that mosaicism was induced by the ZFN treatment, a situation which is frequently observed in the DNA of transgenic founders. Three of the affected females had a monoallelic homozygous mutation, four had heterologous or mosaicism biallelic mutations, and the remainder had three different mosaic mutations. The normal F344-allele was not found in the affected founder animals. Most of these mutations were expressed as frameshifts or splicing errors and resulted in no or very little IL2RG mRNA being expressed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008870-g001">Figure 1d</xref> probably due to nonsense-mediated decay.

First and foremost, knockout rats can be created in a four- to six-month time frame and with high efficiency at more than 20&#x00025;. This is more favorable than the ES cell-based method for mice that usually takes 12&#x02013;18 months. Given the high rate of germ line transmission, preliminary phenotypic analysis can be performed on G1 animals after intercrossing the initial G0 founders, thereby saving time and effort. Second, gene-targeting with ZFNs does not seem to be strain-dependent (unpublished data) and accordingly can be performed with any inbred strain. This is of great advantage since other techniques like ENU mutagenesis differ in their efficiency when used with different strains. This provides a straight forward strategy for directly employing targeted gene disruption in the existing strain, thereby bypassing tedious and time-consuming backcrossing steps that generally take two to three years to complete. Third, ZFNs can be used to induce a wide variety of allelic changes covering small or wide deletions or insertions. They may be used to produce frameshifts or small in-frame deletions such as the 3-bp deletion that we observed. Given the reports on successful ZFN-targeted gene modification or correction by homologous recombination in mammalian cell cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Hockemeyer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Urnov1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008870-Kandavelou1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, it should be feasible to archive targeted knock-in technologies that have thus been far inaccessible without rat ES cells. Finally, since ZFN technology does not rely on using species-specific embryonic stem cell lines, it should be possible to adapt it to other mammalian species such as pigs, cattle, and monkeys, where it is possible to harvest and manipulate fertilized embryos.</p><p>The X-SCID rats established in this study provide not only a valuable <italic>in vivo</italic> model for evaluating drug treatment or gene therapy approaches, but also a system for assaying novel anticarcinogenic effects on transplanted malignancies.
