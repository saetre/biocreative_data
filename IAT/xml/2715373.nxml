The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are involved in ET-1-induced VSMC contraction and proliferation. This study was designed to investigate the ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>receptor intracellular signaling in human VSMCs and used phosphorylation (activation) of ERK1/2 as a functional signal molecule for endothelin receptor activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Subconfluent human VSMCs were stimulated by ET-1 at different concentrations (1 nM-1 &#x003bc;M). The activation of ERK1/2 was examined by immunofluorescence, Western blot and phosphoELISA using specific antibody against phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein. ET-1 induced a concentration- and time- dependent activation of ERK1/2 with a maximal effect at 10 min. It declined to baseline level at 30 min. The ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 was completely abolished by MEK1/2 inhibitors U0126 and SL327, and partially inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. A dual endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan or the ET<sub>A </sub>antagonist BQ123 blocked the ET-1 effect, while the ET<sub>B </sub>antagonist BQ788 had no significant effect. However, a selective ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist, Sarafotoxin 6c (S6c) caused a time-dependent ERK1/2 activation with a maximal effect by less than 20% of the ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2. Increase in bosentan concentration up to 10 &#x003bc;M further inhibited ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 and had a stronger inhibitory effect than BQ123 or the combined use of BQ123 and BQ788. To further explore ET-1 intracellular signaling, PKC inhibitors (staurosporin and GF109203X), PKC-delta inhibitor (rottlerin), PKA inhibitor (H-89), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (wortmannin) were applied. The inhibitors showed significant inhibitory effects on ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2. However, blockage of L-type Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, chelating extracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>or emptying internal Ca<sup>2+ </sup>stores, did not affect ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The ET<sub>A </sub>receptors predominate in the ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 in human VSMCs, which associates with increments in intracellular PKC, PKA and PI3K activities, but not Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signalling.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In the human cardiovascular system, endothelin-1 (ET-1) is the most important isoform, which induces long-lasting vasoconstriction and stimulates proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. ET-1 acts on two G-protein coupled receptors: endothelin type A (ET<sub>A</sub>) and endothelin type B (ET<sub>B</sub>), and plays an important role in hypertension, vascular remodelling, cardiac hypertrophy and coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The ET<sub>A </sub>receptors locate on VSMCs and mediate vasoconstriction, while the ET<sub>B </sub>receptors primarily locate in vascular endothelial cells and mediate transient vasodilation <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, a subpopulation of contractile ET<sub>B </sub>receptors exist in the VSMCs and mediate vasoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The ET<sub>A </sub>receptor activates G proteins of Gq/11 and G12/13, which results in the contractile and proliferation effects in VSMCs through activation of diverse signaling molecules such as phospholipase C (PLC), intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, protein kinase C (PKC), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Whereas, the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor stimulates the Gi and the Gq/11 families in VSMCs and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. ET-1 is non-selective agonist for both ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>receptors, which may result in receptor signal cross-talk in vascular physiology and pathology. However, there is limited knowledge about this.</p><p>ERK1/2, also termed p44/42 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), is one of the members of MAPK superfamily, which includes a family of serine/threonine kinase associated with VSMCs contraction, proliferation, migration, differentiation, adhesion, collagen deposition and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Activation of either the ET<sub>A </sub>or the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor results in phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which is an important regulator for cellular proliferation, migration, differentiation and vascular smooth muscle constriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A MAPK kinase (MEK) is required for the ERK1/2 phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the activated form, ERK1/2 transmits extracellular stimuli by phosphorylating a variety of substrates including transcription factors and kinases. There is a paucity of knowledge on intracellular signal mechanisms that ET-1 leads to activation of ERK1/2 in human VSMCs. Non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src-independent small G protein Ras-Raf-dependent mechanisms have been reported to mediate ET-1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cultured mouse VSMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals are required for MAPK/ERK1/2 activation induced by angiotensin II in VSMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, ET-1-induced vasoconstriction is not affected by calcium channel blockers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent contraction is suggested to be associated with PKC, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Rho kinase and MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The present study was designed, by using a series of specific pharmacological inhibitors, to explore the intracellular signal mechanisms that ET-1 leads to activation of ERK1/2 in human VSMCs with special focus on the receptor signalling. We have demonstrated that ET<sub>A </sub>receptors predominate over ET<sub>B </sub>receptors in mediating ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 in human VSMCs. This activation is associated with PKC, PKA and PI3K activities, but not intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signalling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Time course and concentration-dependent activation of ERK1/2 induced by ET-1</title><p>ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 was examined in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) at different time points and ET-1 concentrations.

To clarify if the ET<sub>B </sub>receptors in HASMCs were involved in ET-1- induced activation of ERK1/2, sarafotoxin 6c (S6c), a selective ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist was employed and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was examined by immunofluorescence and western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, there was a slight elevation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (1.3 fold, p &#x0003c; 0.001) as observed at 5 min after exposure to 1 &#x003bc;M of S6c. This peaked at 10 min (1.5 fold, p &#x0003c; 0.001), and quickly declined at 15 min (1.3 fold, p &#x0003c; 0.001). This slight transient increase of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was also produced by 100 nM of S6c and verified by western blot for pERK1/2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). BQ123 and bosentan significantly inhibited the increase in pERK1/2 activities, while the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor antagonist BQ788 had no significant effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 was significantly inhibited by 5 &#x003bc;M of BQ123 (by 51.8%, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), which is consistent with the results of phosphoELISA assay (by 51.9%, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) and western blot (by 56.2%) [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. ET-1-induced ERK1/2 activation was also significantly inhibited by combination of BQ123 and BQ788 by 65.4% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> in immunocytochemistry), by 43.6% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> in phophoELISA assay) and by 62.1% [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> in western blot].

Bosentan at 5 &#x003bc;M and 10 &#x003bc;M significantly inhibited ET-1- induced activation of ERK1/2 by 65.1% and 87.1%, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

The ET-1-induced response requires intracellular signal molecule PKC, PKA and PI3K activities, while it is independent of intracellular calcium signaling.</p><sec><title>ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 in HASMCs</title><p>ERK1/2 are important regulators of cell proliferation and migration in VSMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These basic cellular functions are important for the formation of the neointima in pathologic states such as atherosclerosis. Many stimuli such as mechanical stretch, growth factors, cytokines and activation of G protein-coupled receptors, can result in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and its signal pathways. Recent studies have demonstrated that ERK1/2 MAPK pathways regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent contraction of VSMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Intracellular ERK1/2 MAPK signal mechanisms play important roles in vascular pathology and in the development of cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. ET-1 not only remains the most potent and long-lasting vasoconstrictor of human vessels, it also induces proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells through activation of ERK1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] in pulmonary hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart failure and restenosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In human arterial smooth muscle cells, ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 is much weaker in aortic artery than in coronary artery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This implies that small arteries are more sensitive than large arteries. Unlike angiotensin II, which shows a rapid and transient increase in activities of ERK1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], ET-1 induced a long-lasting phosphorylation of ERK1/2 with a peaked at 10 min and declined to baseline after 30 min in present study. The activation of ERK1/2 by ET-1 might contribute to VSMC proliferation in formation of new intima and thus it may contribute to serve as an early "switch-on" mechanism for cardiovascular disease development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of ET receptors in activation of ERK1/2 in HASMCs</title><p>The physiological and pathological effects of ET-1 are mediated through two G protein-coupled receptors, ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B</sub>. In human vasculature, ET<sub>A </sub>receptors predominate on the smooth muscle cells and mediate constriction, whereas ET<sub>B </sub>receptors are expressed less than 15% on these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. <italic>In-vivo </italic>studies suggest that both subtypes of endothelin receptors can mediate vasoconstriction in human resistance and capacitance vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the present study, we found that ET<sub>A </sub>predominately mediated ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2. Although some activation of ERK1/2 was obtained with the ET<sub>B</sub>-selective agonist, S6c, the maximum response produced to S6c was transient and less than 20% of the ET-1 effect. In addition, BQ123, a selective antagonist of the ET<sub>A </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], but not ET<sub>B </sub>receptor antagonist BQ788, significantly inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 induced by ET-1, suggesting that ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 is predominately mediated by ET<sub>A</sub>receptors. Compared to BQ123, a further inhibition of ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 was obtained in combination of BQ123 and BQ788. Bosentan, a dual ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>receptor antagonist had a significant stronger inhibitory effect on ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 than either BQ123 or the combination of BQ123 and BQ788. These results suggest that ET receptor dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] might also occur in human VSMCs in the presence of ET-1 as a bivalent ligand connecting two receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and that the receptor cross-talk is involved in the ET-1 effect. However, this requires more studies to verify.</p></sec><sec><title>Upstream intracellular signal molecules involved in ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2</title><p>ERK1/2 activation requires a sequential activation of Ras, Raf and MEK signal cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. MEK inhibitors (U0126, PD98059 and SL327) were used to investigate the role of upstream MEK in ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2. U0126, a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2 had the same potency as SL327 (another selective inhibitor of MEK1/2), and completely inhibited ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2, whereas, PD98059, a selective MEK1 inhibitor, only partially inhibited ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2. PKC, a family of serine/threonine kinases, may be involved in the intracellular signal transduction of MEK/ERK1/2 induced by ET-1. PKA is an important second messenger. Cyclic AMP-independent activation of PKA by ET-1 has been observed in rat aortic smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. On the other hand, G-protein-coupled receptor signaling can be mediated through various small G proteins. The Ras/Raf pathway is found to be a proximal regulator of MEK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. PI3K, another downstream effector of Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], has been linked to a diverse group of cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. By using selective inhibitors, the present study revealed that PKC, PKA and PI3K were involved in activation of ERK1/2 induced by ET-1 in HASMCs, which may provide targets for drug discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling was not required for ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2</title><p>ET-1 stimulates phospholipase C-dependent hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2 </sub>(phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) through G-protein coupled receptors, leading to the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are involved in intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization and PKC activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recently, growing evidence has shown that Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling is critical for activation of ERK1/2 induced by angiotensin II in VSMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the role of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling in ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 in human VSMCs remains unclear. It has been reported that the activation of L-type Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels contributes to ET-1-induced sustained phase of the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>response and the ability to generate force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Unlike angiotensin II, the present study revealed that extracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx through L-type Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels did not participate in ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 in human VSMCs. To further investigate the involvement of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>through other Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels, which are suggested to be involved in ET-1-mediated contractions of VSMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and mitogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], 5 mM of EGTA was used. Extracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>chelation by EGTA did not affect activation of ERK1/2 induced by ET-1. ET-1-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release from intracellular stores is triggered by the binding of IP3 to receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Depletion of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>stores can lead to a local Ca<sup>2+ </sup>flux through store-operated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels (SOCC), which has been reported to initiate the activation of ERK1/2 in RBL-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, in our studies, thapsigargin, an inhibitor to the SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase pump, which results in Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release and depletion from internal stores, was applied together with 5 mM of EGTA. The results showed that ERK1/2 activation by ET-1 did not require the participation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release. Studies have indicated that the CAMKII pathway mediates G-protein coupled receptor ligand-depedent activation of ERK1/2 in cultured VSM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, we observed that CAMKII pathway was probably not involved in the ET-1- induced activation of ERK1/2 in human VSMCs as based on KN-62 inhibition experiment. Using receptor-operated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channel blockers LOE 908 and SK&#x00026;F 96365, and L-type Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels blocker nifedipine, Kawanabe et al noted that ET-1-induced ERK1/2 activiation involved a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx-dependent cascade through Ca<sup>2+</sup>permeable nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) and SOCC, and a Ca<sup>2+</sup>influx-independent cascade in rabbit carotid artery VSMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The studies showed that maximal effective concentration of nifedipine has only 10% of the inhibition on ET-1-induced increases in ERK1/2 activity. However, we did not find significant changes of phosphorylated ERK1/2 induced by ET-1 after treatment with nifedipine or chelation of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have demontrated that ET-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 in human VSMCs is predominantly mediated by ET<sub>A </sub>receptors through upstream signal molecule PKC, PKA and PI3K, while it is independent of CAMKII and intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling.
