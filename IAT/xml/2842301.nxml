Indeed the lack of an anti-tumor effect of many of the anti-&#x003b1;v<bold>&#x003b2;</bold>3-inhibitors, except for in glioblastma, suggest that perhaps <bold>&#x003b2;</bold>3-integrin in the vasculature of some tumors is not significantly high or functional. Thus it is of importance to understand the molecular basis of <bold>&#x003b2;</bold>3-integrin low/deficient angiogenesis.</p><p>Downstream signalling pathways of both integrins and growth factor receptors involve RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1, all members of the family of Rho GTPases. RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1 can be activated when GTP-bound, and inactivated, when GDP-bound. The activation of RhoA has been reported to be involved in the development of actin stress fibres, Cdc42 in filopodia formation and Rac1 in membrane-ruffling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Jaffe1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Rac1 has been shown to be required for the migration of cells, including endothelial cells, and also it appears to play a role in vascular tube formation and lumen formation, at least <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Bryan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Merajver1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently, some studies have suggested a role for Rac1 in endothelial cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, haploinsufficiency of Rac1 in Tie2-Cre mice results in the poor regulation of blood pressure, vasodilation and impaired hind limb ischemia-induced neovascularization, suggesting that a 50&#x00025; loss of Rac1 in Tie2-Cre mice is sufficient to affect this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Sawada1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, Rac1-deletion in Tie2-Cre mice has implied a role for Rac1 in developmental vasculogenesis, due, possibly, to its deletion both in Tie2-positive endothelial cells and in approximately 80&#x00025; of hematopoetic cells which are also Tie2-positive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Tan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. However, since these embryos die at E9.5, before developmental angiogenesis can proceed fully, the precise effect of endothelial-Rac1-deficiency in tumor angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> is unknown.</p><p>Here we show that, surprisingly, the inducible-deletion of Rac1 in adult endothelial cells does not affect tumor angiogenesis or VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in adult mice. However, in the absence of <bold>&#x003b2;3</bold>-integrin, the dependency of these processes on Rac1 becomes apparent. Our data indicate that Rac1, in adult endothelial cells, is not normally required for the migration and capillary formation necessary in adult neovascularization in vivo and that the role for this Rho GTPase <italic>in vivo</italic> may well be different to its functions <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in &#x003b2;3-null, but not wild-type mice, are dependent on adult endothelial Rac1 expression</title><p>Endothelial cell migration is a critical feature of tumor angiogenesis and is thought to involve both changes in integrin expression and the activity of Rho GTPases such as Rac1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Lamalice1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

Importantly, none of these processes were affected when Rac1 was depleted or deleted in the tumor endothelium of adult wild-type mice. These findings reveal that, unexpectedly, Rac1 expression in adult endothelial cells is not essential for tumor angiogenesis. However, we report that active levels of Rac1 are increased in &#x003b2;3-null endothelial cells and that the enhanced tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis and VEGF-mediated responses in &#x003b2;3-null mice were all dependent on endothelial Rac1 expression since Rac1-depletion in <bold>&#x003b2;3</bold>-null endothelial cells reduced significantly these responses. These data demonstrate that the requirement for endothelial-Rac1 becomes important when vascular &#x003b2;3-integrin is absent.</p><p>Endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation are essential processes during tumor angiogenesis and Rac1 activity is believed to be important for these cellular processes <italic>in vitro</italic> implying a possible requirement for this molecule in angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. However our data demonstrating that tumor angiogenesis and VEGF-induced angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> were not affected in either pSico-Rac1-infected wild-type/Tie1-Cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mice or tamoxifen-treated Rac1 flox/flox PDGFB-iCreER mice, imply that angiogenic processes such as proliferation, migration and tube formation <italic>in vivo</italic> are not affected by the induced-loss of Rac1 in adult endothelial cells. In contrast, recent studies have suggested a positive role for Rac1 in endothelial cell function. For example, a 50&#x00025; loss of Rac1 in Tie2-Cre mice results in reduced neovascularization in the hind-limb ischemia model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Sawada1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, Rac1-deletion in Tie2-Cre embryos results in early lethality due to severe heart and vasculogenic defects by E8.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Tan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The apparent discrepancies between our results and those reported in Tie2-Cre mice may be due to several reasons. For example, the haploinsufficiency or deletion of Rac1 in these systems is from early embryogenesis and this has been shown to induce changes in blood pressure and vasodilation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Sawada1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> that, in turn, are known to affect neovascularization indirectly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Carmeliet2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and therefore it is likely that such changes in blood pressure would actually affect angiogenesis in the Rac1-haploinsufficient-Tie2-Cre mice. In contrast, using the pSico or PDGFB-iCreER-inducible systems we have deleted Rac1, predominantly, in adult tumor or VEGF-induced neo-endothelial cells themselves, thus reducing any side effects on the whole vasculature. In addition, Cre activity in Tie2-Cre mice, as well as being present in endothelial cells, is also apparent in approximately 80&#x00025; of hematopoietic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Constien1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Griffin1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, and it is tempting to speculate that the haploinsufficiency or deletion of Rac1 in this compartment may well affect angiogenesis. In contrast, in the pSico models that we have used, it is unlikely that the hematopoietic compartment is subject to Rac1-deletion and thus these cells are unlikely to affect angiogenesis in our system.</p><p>Regarding proliferation, our results corroborate the findings that increased Rac1 activity correlates with enhanced endothelial proliferation, since the elevated Rac1-activity in <bold>&#x003b2;3</bold>-null endothelial cells show elevated proliferative capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Mettouchi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our data go on to demonstrate that the loss of Rac1-activity is not sufficient to control microvascular-endothelial cell growth in culture and this is in line with other data where deletion of Rac1 does not affect cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Wells1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our data also illustrate that the requirement for Rac1 in 3D versus 2D endothelial cell migration is different. Indeed, by examining VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration in 2D (scratch wound healing assays) and in 3D (3D modified Boyden chamber assays), Rac1-depleted cells were less motile than controls in 2D; whereas they migrated as well as controls in 3D. Several studies have shown that VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration in 2D involves activation of Rac1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Garrett1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Soga1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Zeng1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and our data are in line with these observations.

In contrast, using a novel 3D model involving co-culture with VEGF-A-overexpresing fibroblasts, others have shown that dominant-negative N17Rac1 has no effect on VEGF-induced capillary-like network formation of endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Liu1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. These investigators showed that a dominant negative mutant of N-Ras (a small GTPase from a different family to that of Rac1) suppressed capillary-network formation of endothelial cells induced by VEGF-A-producing fibroblasts whereas the mutants of Rac1, RhoA or Cdc42 did not. Our observations also support the notion that, in 3D environments, Rac1 is dispensable for VEGF-mediated capillary-formation in wild-type but not <bold>&#x003b2;3</bold>-null aortic rings and angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that &#x003b2;3-integrin activation induces Rac1 activity. For example, inhibition of endothelial cell cyclooxygenase-2, by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, suppresses &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3-dependent activation of Rac1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Dormond1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Ruegg1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Given such crosstalk between integrins and Rac1, it is surprising that Rac1-activity is enhanced in &#x003b2;3-null endothelial cells. The increased active levels of Rac1 may reflect a compensatory response due to the deletion of &#x003b2;3-integrin, since rescuing the expression of &#x003b2;3-integrin in &#x003b2;3-null endothelial cells diminished the activity of Rac1 to levels similar as those seen in wild-type. Importantly, however, the expression and activity levels of other tested Rho-related GTPases (e.g. Rac2, Rac3, Cdc42 and RhoA) were equal in wild-type and &#x003b2;3-null endothelial cells suggesting that these Rho GTPases are unlikely to compensate for the loss of <bold>&#x003b2;3</bold>-integrin.</p><p>Although recent work has shown that molecules such as RhoG can compensate for Rac-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Elfenbein1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> there is also evidence that this depends on specific signaling cascades and is not always the case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Bass1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggest that this is unlikely in &#x003b2;3-null endothelial cells, since we have shown, that by inhibiting Rac1 expression alone, we can reduce the enhanced angiogenic responses of &#x003b2;3-null mice back to levels observed in wild-type mice either with or without depletion of Rac1. Although it is tempting to speculate that RhoG activity may compensate for Rac1 in wild-type endothelial cells, thus explaining the reduced requirement for Rac1 in wild-type angiogenic events <italic>in vivo</italic>, this is also not likely because Rac1-deletion in both &#x003b2;3-null and wildtypes brings tumor growth and blood vessel density to the same level in both genotypes. Thus the most logical assumption is simply that Rac1 is not involved in tumor angioegenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> unless &#x003b2;3-integrin is absent.</p><p>Our data indicate that the importance of Rac1 in angiogenic processes is revealed only after <bold>&#x003b2;3</bold>-integrin is absent. We show that the enhanced Rac1 activity in &#x003b2;3-null endothelial cells is responsible, at least in part, for the elevated tumor angiogenesis and VEGF-mediated angiogenic responses in &#x003b2;3-null mice.</p><p>Despite the fact that &#x003b2;3-null endothelial cells have elevated VEGFR2 (Flk-1) levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Reynolds1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Reynolds2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Robinson1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, even after Rac1-depletion, indicates that elevated VEGFR2 levels alone are not sufficient to enhance angiogenesis. We show that VEGF/VEGFR2-mediated responses are Rac1-dependent in the absence, but not in the presence of &#x003b2;3-integrin, raising the possibility that downstream signalling of VEGFR2 can either involve Rac1 or not, but that this depends on &#x003b2;3-integrin.</p><p>In <bold>&#x003b2;3</bold>-null mice the increased Rac1-1 activity likely results in changes in downstream signaling that confer the enhanced angiogenic responses. For example, p38 MAP kinase signaling is known to be downstream of Rac1 and <bold>&#x003b2;3</bold>-integrin and plays a role in angiogenic processes such as endothelial cell migration and regulation of cell-cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Engl1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Laferriere1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Rousseau1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

This may simply reflect that tumor angiogenesis is not actually dependent on the activity of &#x003b1;v<bold>&#x003b2;3</bold>-integrin in endothelial cells in several tumor types.

Thus testing &#x003b2;3-integrin ligation <italic>in vivo</italic> is presently impossible without the use of inhibitors.

Endothelial cell purity was 96&#x02013;98&#x00025; as assessed by performing flow cytometry for PECAM-1 (clone MEC 13.3, Pharmingen), Endoglin (Pharmingen) and ICAM-2 expression. Acquisition of samples was performed on a FACS Calibur fluorescence activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and the data were analysed with CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences). Cells were cultured routinely in a 50&#x02236;50 mix of Hams F12 and D-MEM media supplemented with 20&#x00025; FCS, 6 mM glutamine, 25 &#x000b5;g/ml endothelial mitogen (Biogenesis), 1 &#x000b5;g/ml heparin and antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Generation of pSico-Rac1 lentivirus</title><p>The <underline>p</underline>lasmid for <underline>S</underline>table RNA <underline>i</underline>nterference <underline>co</underline>nditional (pSico) was a kind gift from Dr. Tyler Jacks (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MA, USA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Ventura1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. The pSico-Rac1 lentiviral vector was produced by digesting the pSico construct with HpaI-XhoI restriction enzymes (Promega), inserting shRNA oligonucleotides to target the mouse Rac1 gene and religating using T4 DNA ligase (Promega). A pSico containing shRNA to target the firefly Luciferase gene (pSico-Con) was generated to serve as a non-specific control RNAi and a pSico containing shRNA to target the mouse VEGFR2/Flk-1 gene (pSico-Flk-1) was made to stably knockdown the expression of Flk-1, therefore serving as a positive control in angiogenesis assays. Oligonucleotides coding shRNA for mouse Rac1, mouse VEGFR2/Flk-1, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3-integrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009766-Robinson2">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref> and firefly Luciferase were designed using the program PSICOLIGOMAKER 1.5 (available on Jacks' website). Luciferase oligos were blasted against the mouse genome to ensure that they do not recognise any sequence in the mouse DNA. All oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. Chemically competent E. coli (One Shot Stbl3, Invitrogen) were transformed with ligated DNA. Plasmids were purified (QIAprep kit, Quiagen), digested with SacII-NotI (Promega) and positive clones released a fragment approximately 50 bp larger than the fragment released by pSico empty vector. Positive clones were sequence verified (Equipment Park Laboratory, London Research Institute Cancer Research UK). Sequences were analysed using DNA Strider 1.4f1 software (CEA, France).</p><p>Lentiviruses were generated essentially as described in the Virapower Lentiviral Expression System User Manual (Invitrogen). Briefly, 3 &#x000b5;g of pSico-Rac1, pSico-Con or pSico-Flk-1 lentiviral vectors and 9 &#x000b5;g of ViraPower Packaging Mix (Invitrogen) were cotransfected in 293FT cells (Invitrogen) by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Supernatants were collected 48&#x02013;72 hr after transfection, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min, filtered through a 0.45 &#x000b5;m filter, and used to directly infect primary mouse lung endothelial cells. Overnight infection usually was sufficient to infect 50&#x02013;65&#x00025; of the cells as assessed by flow cytometry. Acquisition of samples was performed on a FACS Calibur fluorescence activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and the data were analysed with CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences). GFP-positive endothelial cells were sorted 3&#x02013;4 days after transfection using a FACSAria cell sorter and program. Sorted cells were used to assess efficiency of Cre-mediated RNAi in vitro by transfecting them with Cre expression-plasmid, pTURBO-Cre (a kind gift from Dr. David Stevenson, The Beatson Institute, UK). Transfection of cells was performed by electroporation using the Basic Nucleofector kit designed for primary mammalian endothelial cells (Amaxa GmbH) following the manufacturer's instructions. One week after transfection with pTURBO-Cre, Rac1 and Flk-1 knockdown efficiencies were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. For in vivo experiments, lentivirus were ultracentrifuged at 25000x g for 1.5 hr and stocks titrated. Titers ranged between 1.5&#x02013;2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> i.u/ml.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Rac1 siRNA</title><p>To target mouse Rac1 gene we used siGENOME ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool reagent (Dharmacon).

Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C, to pellet insoluble material. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to membranes (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in either 5&#x00025; milk or 5&#x00025; BSA in PBS-Tween (0.05&#x00025;) and incubated with mouse anti-Rac1 (Clone 23A8, Upstate), mouse anti-Cdc42 (Chemicon), mouse anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz) or rabbit anti-VEGFR2 (Cell Signalling Technologies) antibodies. Membranes were washed three times in PBS-Tween (0.05&#x00025;) and subsequently incubated with HRP-conjugated IgGs. Immunoreactive bands were visualised by incubating the membranes with ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Life Science) and exposing the membranes to autoradiography film (Amersham Life Science). After detection of the protein of interest, membranes were stripped with stripping solution (Chemicon), and re-blotted with mouse anti-Hsc-70 antibody. Densitometry was performed using a gel acquisition and analysis set-up (UV Products, Ltd.).

The proportion of active Rac1 and Cdc42 relative to their the total amount in the cells was determined by densitometry (UV Products, Ltd.). Active levels of RhoA in MLEC transfected with scrambled or Rac1 siRNA, were assessed using the G-LISA<sup>TM</sup> RhoA activation assay Biochem Kit<sup>TM</sup> (Cystoskeleton) following the manufacturer's instructions. The degree of RhoA activation was determined by comparing absorbance readings at 490 nm from Rho control protein (constitutively active RhoA protein) samples versus cell lysates of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>In vivo tumorigenesis and endothelial-specific Rac1-deletion</title><p>Rac1 flox/flox and Rac1 flox/flox PDGFB-iCreER mice were implanted subcutaneously with tamoxifen (Rac1 flox/flox and Rac1 flox/flox PDGFB-iCreER) or placebo (Rac1 flox/flox PDGFB-iCreER) 1 mg-slow release pellets in the scruff of the neck.
