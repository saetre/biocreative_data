In this cell line Gart and Notch are actively transcribed, whereas white is not expressed. In all three genes UV-induced pyrimidine dimers were removed with the same rate and to the same extent: 60% removal within 16 hours, up to 80-100% in 24 hours after irradiation with 10 or 15 J/m2 UV. These kinetics are similar to the time course of dimer removal measured in the genome overall. No difference in repair of the inactive white locus compared to the active Gart and Notch genes was found. Similar results were obtained using a different wild type cell line, SL2, although repair appeared to be somewhat slower in this cell line. The results are discussed with respect to the data found for gene specific repair in other eukaryotic systems.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0111-a" xlink:role="3291"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0112-a" xlink:role="3292"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3289"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3290"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3291"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3292"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3293"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00092-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3294"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
