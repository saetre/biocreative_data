It is anchored on nucleolar chromatin by the Cfi1/Net1 protein until early anaphase, at which time it is released into the nucleoplasm. Two poorly understood, redundant pathways promote Cdc14 release, the FEAR (Cdc fourteen early release) network and the MEN (mitotic exit network). Through the analysis of genetic interactions, we report here a novel requirement for the ubiquitination of histone H2B by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase in the cell cycle&#x02013;dependent release of Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin when the MEN is inactivated. This function for H2B ubiquitination is mediated by its activation of histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 (meH3K4 and meH3K79) but, surprisingly, is not dependent on the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Sir2, which associates with Cdc14 on nucleolar chromatin as part of the RENT complex. We also observed a defect in Cdc14 release in cells lacking H3 lysine 36 methylation (meH3K36) and in cells lacking an HDAC recruited by this modification. These histone modifications represent previously unappreciated factors required for the accessibility to and/or action on nucleolar chromatin of FEAR network components. The nonredundant role for these modifications in this context contrasts with the notion of a highly combinatorial code by which histone marks act to control biological processes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>During proliferation, eukaryotic cells segregate their replicated genome to generate two identical progeny through a highly regulated process called mitosis. Inaccuracy in this process results in cell inviability or aneuploidy. In the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cell cycle, the exit from the mitotic state is triggered by the release of the phosphatase Cdc14 during the anaphase stage of mitosis from nucleolar chromatin, where it is sequestered and kept inactive. The role of chromatin, if any, in the regulation of Cdc14 sequestration and/or release is unexplored. Using genetic analysis, we have discovered that multiple evolutionarily conserved histone modifications are required for the early anaphase release of Cdc14. These include monoubiquitination of histone H2B as well as two methylations of histone H3 on lysines 4 and 79 that require H2B monoubiquitination to occur efficiently. In addition, methylation of H3 on lysine 36 and a histone deacetylase recruited by this modification are also required. We suggest that these histone modifications are required on nucleolar chromatin for the accessibility and/or action of factors involved in the early anaphase release of Cdc14. The nonredundant requirement for multiple chromatin modifications stands in contrast to the popular notion of a highly combinatorial &#x0201c;histone code&#x0201d; for the action of histone modifications.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>To ensure the timely and correct inheritance of sister chromatids followed by cytokinesis, eukaryotic cells have evolved sophisticated regulatory networks. Part of the regulatory complexity involves the requirement that a variety of soluble proteins communicate with tightly chromatin-bound factors on chromosomes. An example of such a mechanism in the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is the control of Cdc14, a conserved and essential protein phosphatase. Outside of anaphase, Cdc14 is kept away from its soluble substrates by being tightly associated with nucleolar chromatin through its inhibitor, the nucleolar protein Cfi1/Net1. Upon entry into anaphase, however, this interaction is dissolved via the phosphorylation of Cfi/Net1, which is necessary for the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000588-Shou1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000588-Azzam1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

The MEN, the first and better characterized of the two networks, is a signaling cascade which is controlled by the GTPase Tem1 and its upstream regulators, the GTPase activating complex Bub2-Bfa1 and the GTP exchange factor Lte1. Before and during early anaphase, Tem1 is kept in its inactive GDP state by association with Bub2-Bfa1 at the spindle pole body (SPB). As the SPB enters the daughter cell during mid to late anaphase, Tem1 is relieved of inhibition by exposure to bud localized Lte1 and activates a kinase cascade consisting of Cdc15 and the Dbf2/Mob1 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000588-Frenz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000588-Mah1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, even though total Fob1 levels are unchanged in <italic>bre1&#x00394;</italic> mutants, Fob1 bound to chromatin could in principle be increased by a loss of uH2B-K123, leading to defects in mitotic exit similar to those observed previously for strains overexpressing Fob1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000588-Stegmeier3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

This discrepancy may be explained by differing thresholds for function in the two assays and/or the fact that eliminating the function of Cdc15, the central and essential kinase of the MEN, is a more severe perturbation of mitotic exit than the deletion of the non-essential upstream regulator Lte1. In addition, the defect in Cdc14 release of the methylase mutants is due to their primary function in histone methylation, as unmethylatable lysine to arginine mutants of H3K4 and H3K79 (H3K4R and H3K79R) were also unable to efficiently release Cdc14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000588-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

An appealing possibility is that histone modifications may serve to maintain a permissive state for mitotic exit regulators to access the chromatin associated factors Cfi1/Net1 and Fob1 at the onset of anaphase and to enact the release of Cdc14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000588-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Surprisingly, our genetic experiments indicate that this requirement is independent of the action of the Cdc14-associated histone deacetylase Sir2 and removal of Sir2 did not bypass the requirement for histone modifications in Cdc14 release. Potential candidates whose access to Cfi1/Net1 could be affected by this alteration of chromatin function include Cdc5 and Clb-Cdk, the kinases responsible for Cfi/Net1 phosphorylation, and PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup>, the phosphatase complex that counteracts this phosphorylation. Recently, Zds1 and Zds2, previously identified to associate with the chromatin silencing machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000588-Roy1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, have been shown to play a role in early anaphase release of Cdc14 and to interact with PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000588-Queralt1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting another potential mediator for the histone modification requirement for efficient mitotic exit.</p><p>As all of the histone modifications studied here are conserved from yeast to mammals, it seems possible that their role in controlling localization of Cdc14 is also conserved. A hint that this might be the case comes from studies of HUB1, the homolog of Bre1 in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Cells from <italic>hub1-1</italic> mutants exhibit an increased population with 4C DNA content, consistent with a delay in progression through G2 or mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000588-Fleury1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, while Cdc14 is not essential for mitotic exit in animal cells, its cell cycle-regulated association with the nucleolus is remarkably conserved from yeast to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000588-Kaiser1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it was reported that mammalian cells have adapted the Cdc14 sequestration mechanism to regulate the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000588-Bassermann1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the emerging role of meH3K79 and other histone modifications in the DNA damage response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000588-Escargueil1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that the Cdc14 regulation by meH3K79 described here is relevant to the function in metazoans of this conserved histone modification in DNA damage checkpoint signaling.</p><p>More generally, our studies point to a role for histone modifications in a process involving chromatin but not directly impinging on transcription or DNA repair on which most functional studies have been focused. The nonredundant role for all three known histone methylations in mitotic exit suggests they do not function in this context as part of a combinatorial code but instead may affect chromatin in a similar way to promote the programmed release of a chromatin bound factor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast Strains and Plasmids</title><p>A list of the yeast strains and plasmids used in this paper is found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000588.s004">Table S1</xref>.
