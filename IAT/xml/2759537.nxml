In chick embryos, segmentation of a new pair of somites occurs every 90 minutes and involves a mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition of cells from the presomitic mesoderm. Little is known about the cellular rearrangements involved, and, although it is known that the fibronectin extracellular matrix is required, its actual role remains elusive. Using 3D and 4D imaging of somite formation we discovered that somitogenesis consists of a complex choreography of individual cell movements. Epithelialization starts medially with the formation of a transient epithelium of cuboidal cells, followed by cell elongation and reorganization into a pseudostratified epithelium of spindle-shaped epitheloid cells. Mesenchymal cells are then recruited to this medial epithelium through accretion, a phenomenon that spreads to all sides, except the lateral side of the forming somite, which epithelializes by cell elongation and intercalation. Surprisingly, an important contribution to the somite epithelium also comes from the continuous egression of mesenchymal cells from the core into the epithelium via its apical side. Inhibition of fibronectin matrix assembly first slows down the rate, and then halts somite formation, without affecting pseudopodial activity or cell body movements. Rather, cell elongation, centripetal alignment, N-cadherin polarization and egression are impaired, showing that the fibronectin matrix plays a role in polarizing and guiding the exploratory behavior of somitic cells. To our knowledge, this is the first 4D <italic>in vivo</italic> recording of a full mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition. This approach brought new insights into this event and highlighted the importance of the extracellular matrix as a guiding cue during morphogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Imaging morphogenesis in live embryos and tissues has revealed that cells are much more dynamic than previously thought, changing their shape and behavior in ways that our interpretation of successive static images of developmental stages could not have predicted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007429-Kulesa1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007429-Voiculescu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

We first obtained detailed images of fixed embryos revealing the cellular organization of the PSM and early somites as well as the 3D organization of the surrounding ECM. We then used two-photon live imaging to obtain 3D videos (4D images) of cell dynamics during somite formation. Our results show that PSM cells are highly dynamic, exhibiting constant protrusive activity and cell body movements, and that somite epithelialization involves the progressive organization of these dynamic cells into an aster-like arrangement, a process that takes much longer than the 90 minute interval of each new boundary formation. This reveals and also clarifies the nature and sequence of events in a surprisingly complex morphogenetic process, involving two distinct stages of epithelialization and multiple concurrent cell movements, some of which had not been previously described as contributing to somitogenesis. Perturbation of <italic>de novo</italic> FN matrix assembly does not inhibit the dynamic behavior of PSM cells but impairs cell elongation and alignment, N-cadherin polarization and egression of cells from the somitocoel into the epithelium. These results provide new insights into the complexity of the mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition underlying somitogenesis and demonstrate how a FN matrix is essential to guide dynamic cells into an epithelial structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Embryos and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Fertilized chicken eggs were incubated at 38&#x000b0;C until the stages of interest.

N-cadherin is enriched in the medial, dorsal, ventral and caudal sides, and less so in rostral and lateral sides. Thus the N-cadherin-staining forms a 3D &#x0201c;adhesion basket&#x0201d; in s0.

We further propose that when EphrinB2 reverse signaling induces the somitic cleft, caudal s0 cells adhere strongly to the FN matrix, accreting cells pull the superficial FN matrix into the cleft and then new somite-derived FN is assembled to fill in the cleft, stabilizing it. Finally, it is tempting to speculate that the progressive accumulation of FN in the cleft promotes the alignment and polarization of the cells in the rostral side of the following somite. In this scenario, a fibrillar FN network is absolutely crucial to package cells into a somite.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007429.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Cell shape and movement measurements.

The &#x0201c;outward cables&#x0201d; of FN are clearly seen radiating from the surface of the somites in formation.

First segment of the video shows a portion of the PSM of a chick embryo (rostral is upwards, medial is to the left). In the beginning only one somite is formed, but at the end of 6 hours four new somites have formed. After zooming into a single somite the details of individual cell movements are shown. Several different morphogenetic stereotypical movements are identified in cells with different colors. Blue represents elongation of a medial cell, red cell accretion in the rostral and caudal walls, green egression, and yellow mesenchymal elongation and intercalation in the lateral wall. In the end, a zoom of a forming intersomitic cleft shows the continuous extension and retraction of pseudopodia.

FN matrix assembly disruption slows down and eventually halts somite formation and prevents cells from organizing into an aster of spindle-shaped centripetally aligned cells.
