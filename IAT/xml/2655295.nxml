Successful implantation depends on the synchronized development of a normal embryo to the blastocyst stage, and the maternal uterus from a non-receptive to a receptive state, as well as the establishment of the active interactions between maternal and embryonic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This exquisite coordination involves the regulated production of hormonal and non-hormonal molecules by embryonic and maternal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A large number of non-hormonal factors have been identified to be involved in this process, and some of them have been extensively investigated and regarded as the endometrial receptivity markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the exact molecular interactions between the implanting embryo and the maternal uterus are still not clear. To identify novel genes that could be crucial for embryo implantation and to explore their biological roles in implantation would undoubtedly accelerate a better insight into the molecular mechanism underlying embryo implantation.</p><p>In order to search for the novel molecules that are highly expressed at the implantation sites, we have successfully applied the CLONTECH PCR-select cDNA subtraction technique to screen specifically up-regulated genes in the mouse uterus around the time of implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. One of the genes screened out from the subtracted cDNA library was <italic>SEC63 </italic>gene that encodes Sec63 protein (Sec63p). Sec63p is involved in the post-translational processing of secretory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], including the folding and quality control of secretory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], as a component of the protein translocation machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. <italic>SEC63 </italic>expression was originally found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The mammalian <italic>SEC63 </italic>cDNA and Sec63p were also identified subsequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Mammalian Sec63p consists of 760 amino acids, sharing 53% homology and 25.6% identity with the yeast Sec63p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As an ER integral membrane protein of the Hsp40 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], Sec63p could facilitate protein translocation into the ER. The C-terminal conserved Brr2-like domain of Sec63p, that could be phosphorylated by the protein kinase CK2, is essential for its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Sec63p is required for post-translational translocation of invertase, carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) and dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase B (DPAP B) in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In mammals, Sec63p is a prime candidate for co-chaperone of IgG heavy chain-binding protein (BiP/Kar2p) in protein transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, the exact secretory protein species of Sec63p-dependent secretion in mammals is still unclear. Because mammalian uteri synthesize secretory proteins essential for survival and development of the embryo and fetus during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we hypothesize that Sec63p may also be involved in the process of embryo implantation. Thus, the present study was undertaken to examine the pattern of SEC63 gene expression in the uterus during the peri-implantation period in mice by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and tissue preparation</title><p>Adult ICR mice aged 6&#x02013;8 weeks were obtained from the SIPPR/BK Laboratory Animal Company (Shanghai, China). All of the mice were caged at controlled temperature (approximately 22&#x000b0;C) under a 14 h light: 10 h dark photoperiod. All the experiments were in full compliance with standard laboratory animal care protocols (NTC-SOP-ADM-ANM-003, -014, -038, -039 and -040) approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research.</p><p>Adult females were mated with fertile males of the same strain to achieve pregnancy (day1 = day of vaginal plug). Pregnancy was confirmed on days 1&#x02013;4 by recovering embryos from the reproductive tracts. The implantation sites on days 5&#x02013;6 were identified by intravenous injection of Chicago blue dye solution (1% in saline; 0.1 ml per mouse; Sigma, St Louis, MO). The entire uteri of non-pregnant and pregnant mice on days 1&#x02013;4 pregnancy were respectively collected immediately after the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. For days 5&#x02013;8 of pregnancy, uterine tissues at implantation sites and inter-implantation sites were separately collected. Embryos were collected by flushing the uterus with PBS at 07:00&#x02013;08:00 on day 5 of pregnancy.</p><p>Pseudopregnant mice were obtained by mating females with vasectomized males, and the entire uteri of pseudopregnant mice on days 1&#x02013;5 were collected. Implantation was delayed by ovariectomizing pregnant mice at 08:30&#x02013;09:00 h on day 4 of pregnancy and administering progesterone (1 mg per mouse, Sigma) during days 5&#x02013;7. Delayed implantation was subsequently initiated by administering estradiol-17&#x003b2; (25 ng per mouse, Sigma) on day 7. The uterine tissues were respectively collected at 24 h after estrogen or last progesterone treatment. Delayed implantation was confirmed by flushing the blastocysts from uterus, and the activation of delayed implantation was identified by intravenous injection of Chicago blue dye solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Ovary and non-reproductive tissues including brain, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, small intestine, skin were also collected from the day 5 pregnant mouse. Male reproductive tissues, testis and epididymis, were collected from adult male mice. All tissues collected were stored at -80&#x000b0;C until further analysis.</p><p>The sections of human decidual and oviductal tissues were kindly provided by the International Peace Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, the China Welfare Institute, Shanghai, China. Ethical approvals were granted both from Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research, and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. All subjects signed an informed consent before the collection of decidual and oviductal tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR</title><p>Different tissues, including brain, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, muscle, small intestine, skin, ovary, uterus, testis and epididymis, were individually collected from 3 mice and pooled. Total RNA was then respectively extracted from each tissue pool using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies Ltd, Renfrew, Strathclyde, UK), and the RNA quality was evaluated by the ratio of optical density (OD<sub>260</sub>: OD<sub>280</sub>). Only these RNA samples with a ratio &#x0003e; 1.8 were used for PCR. Each RNA sample (2 &#x003bc;g) was treated by RNase-free DNase I (TakaRa Biotechnology Co.) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. RNA Reverse transcription (RT) was performed at 42&#x000b0;C for 1 h with the poly(dT) primer in 50 &#x003bc;l reaction mixture using Superscript MII reverse transcriptase (Gibco BRL, Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, 2 &#x003bc;l RT reaction mixture were used as the template for PCR amplification at the cycling conditions: 94&#x000b0;C 20 sec, 57&#x000b0;C 20 sec, 72&#x000b0;C 30 sec for 35 cycles. The primers used to detect the targeted and housekeeping control mRNAs were as follows: <italic>SEC63</italic>, 5'-AAGAATGAACCTCCACTCACC-3' (sense) and 5'-GTCCTCTTCAATATGAGGGAGC-3' (antisense) (318 bp); <italic>GAPDH</italic>, 5'-GTCGGTGTGAACGGATTT-3' (sense) and 5'-ACTCCACGACATACTCAGC-3' (antisense) (276 bp). PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide (EB), and the signal was photographed by BioSens Gel Imaging System (Shanghai Bio-Tech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).

Uterine tissues were collected from 3 mice at each time-point and pooled. Total RNA samples were isolated and RT reactions were performed as above described. The primers were as follows: <italic>SEC63</italic>, 5'-TGACAAGGGCAGTGATTCTG-3' (sense) and 5'-GCCACCACC ACTCTTGTTTT-3' (antisense) (248 bp); &#x003b2;-<italic>Actin</italic>, 5'-AGCCATGTACGTAGCCATCC-3'(sense) and 5' CTCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAA-3' (antisense) (228 bp). All amplifications were designed to span over introns to rule out the genomic DNA contamination, and the PCR products were authenticated by sequencing. The PCR reaction mixture (25 &#x003bc;l) contained 12.5 &#x003bc;l SYBR green I reaction (QPK-201, Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan).

After further washing, the signal was visualized with BCIP/NBT (ZYMED) in 0.1 M Tris&#x000b7;HCl (pH 9.5) and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Comparable protein loading per lane was confirmed by using &#x003b2;-actin as the reference. The rabbit anti-&#x003b2;-actin antibody (Abcam, Cambrige, UK) was used as the primary antibody, and the AP-labeled donkey antibody against rabbit IgG (ZYMED) was used as the secondary antibody.

In the present study, we identified the predominant expression of <italic>SEC63 </italic>mRNA and Sec63p in the decidualized area of uterine tissues during early pregnancy in mice. More interestingly, an increased expression of Sec63p was also observed in human decidualized uterine and oviductal tissues.</p><p>During the pregnancy, the fetomaternal interface, consisting of the maternal decidua and the invading fetal trophoblast, critically regulates placental function and the growth and development of the conceptus. The maternal decidua is differentiated from the endometrial tissues during decidualization, a postovulatory process of endometrial remodeling in preparation for pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In most species studied, during the embryo implantation process, an increase of endometrial vascular permeability in areas adjacent to the blastocysts is the earliest macroscopically identifiable change, and, this is followed in species with invasive implantation by decidualization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Meanwhile, molecules produced by endometrial epithelium, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteinases, could be secreted into the uterine lumen to affect blastocyst development, migration, and attachment, or to basally facilitate the differentiation of the underlying stromal cells to produce decidual cells; and these decidual cells, which subsequently form a major component of the decidua of pregnancy, also produce a set of secreted proteins, such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and placental protein 14 (PP14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], to drive the decidualization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, the process of decidualization is accompanied by the frequent production and secretion of a number of secretary proteins in endometrial tissues which fills the intrauterine cavity and glandular lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The targeting and transport of precursors of secretary proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is essentially required for the biosynthesis of most secretory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and the protein translocation channel in the ER membrane mediates such a transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Specific protein complexes that recognize the signal sequence of these precursors are involved in their translocation to the membrane of the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, different translocation substrates appear to have different requirements for components of the cellular targeting and translocation machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The major components of translocation machinery are signal recognition particle (SRP) and secretory (Sec) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The later consists of Sec61p, Sec62p, Sec63p, Sec71p and Sec72p[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, being different from the other Sec complex components, Sec63 is also involved in the SRP-dependent transport pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Dysfunction of the SEC63 gene is associated with defects in protein translocation into the ER[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and results in human diseases including various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and the polycystic liver disease (PCLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The precise bio-functions of Sec63p in mammals, especially the role it plays in reproduction, are still unclear. The group of secretary proteins of which precursors are targeted by Sec63p has not yet been identified in mammals. However, it has been demonstrated in yeast that, Sec63p is involved in post-translational translocation of invertase, CPY and DPAP B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Invertase, encoded by SUC2, is a sucrose hydrolyzing enzyme that cleaves sucrose into the glucose, and therefore plays a central role in carbohydrate metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Carbohydrate metabolism controls the mammalian development during the pre- and peri-implantation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and the abnormal glucose level in uterus disrupts cell apoptosis during embryonic development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. CPY is a yeast vacuolar serine protease with structural homology to Cathepsin A in mammals. Cathepsin A is involved in the C-terminal processing of some implantation-related peptides/proteins including endothelin, substance P, and bradykinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Deficiency of cathepsin A leads to the lysosomal storage disease, galactosialidosis, in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. DPAP B, another membrane protein of the yeast vacuole, is significantly homologous to mammalian dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Active DPP IV is present in glandular cells and surface epithelium during the peri-implantation period, and regarded as a differentiation marker for glandular cells; however, DPP IV enzyme activity is not detected in endometrial stromal and decidual cells throughout the menstrual cycle or during early pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>In addition, mutations in SEC63 leads to an autosomal dominant disease resulted from defects in protein processing, PCLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Most recently, it has been reported that, the expression of cell adhesion molecules, E-cadherin and Ep-CAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule), were remarkably decreased in liver tissue of PCLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This suggests that, Sec63p might directly or indirectly regulate the secretion of these cell adhesion molecules. Cell adhesion molecules including integrins, selectins, and cadherins are crucial required for the successful interaction between embryo and endometrium. More interestingly, being similar to Sec63p in uterine expression pattern, a high level of E-cadherin expression was also detected specifically at the implantation sites in the endometrium of peri-implantation uterus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Ep-CAM is a glycoprotein presented on most carcinomas, and has positive effects on the epithelial cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. But, the expression pattern of Ep-CAM in uterus is still needed to be investigated. Based on above mentioned clues, we speculated that, during the process of deciduzlization, the intracellular expression of Sec63p is up-regulated and subsequently accelerate the decidualizing stromal cells and decidual cells to secret molecules involved in the regulation of cell growth or/and cell adhesion during the formation of deciduas.</p><p>Furthermore, in present study, a strong staining of Sec63p at the ectoplacental cone on day 8 of pregnancy was also detected. It has been well understood that, local deciduo-placental autocrine-paracrine regulation is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy, and the expression of numerous secretary proteins at the ectoplacental cone have been reported in mice. Selenoprotein P (Sepp), an extracellular glycoprotein, is a selenium transporter and antioxidant. <italic>SEPP </italic>mRNA was detected principally in the ectoplacental cone since embryonic day 7.5 in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Detectable amounts of IL-18 were seen in the basal proliferative stroma in the peri-implantation period, and a high level of IL-18 expression was observed in the ectoplacental cone in the immediate post-implantation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Thus, Sec63p might play important roles not only in embryo implantation, in particular in decidualization, but also in early placentation in mice.</p><p>Collectively, we demonstrated the abundant expression of <italic>SEC63 </italic>gene in the mouse and human decidualized cells during early pregnancy in this study. This is consistent with the transformation of uterine stromal cells into secretory decidual cells during the process of decidualization. Furthermore, the confirmation of uterine expression of Sec63 in the human tissues further strengthens the relevance of the mouse-derived data to the situation of human pregnancy. However, further studies are required to determine the exact function of Sec63p in the uterus and the significance of its up-regulated expression at the implantation site.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our results indicated that uterine <italic>SEC63 </italic>gene expression is up-regulated at the implantation sites during the early pregnancy, consistent with a possible role in regulating the production of some secretory proteins during embryo implantation, especially at the stage of decidualization.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ALP: avidin-alkaline phosphatase; BCIP: 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate; BiP: IgG heavy chain-binding protein; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CPY: carboxypeptidase Y; DIG: Digoxigenin; DPAP B: dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase B; EB: ethidium bromide; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; HRP: horseradish peroxides; IHC: immunohistochemistry; NBT: nitro-blue tetrazolium; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PCLD: polycystic liver disease; RT: Reverse transcription; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulfate; SRP: signal recognition particle; SSC: sodium chloride, sodium citrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RWS carried out the <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and immunohistochemical studies of mouse uterine tissues.
