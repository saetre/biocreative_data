These RCP-driven changes in &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 trafficking led to acquisition of rapid/random movement on two-dimensional substrates and to a marked increase in fibronectin-dependent migration of tumor cells into three-dimensional matrices. Recycling of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin did not affect its regulation or ability to form adhesive bonds with substrate fibronectin. Instead, &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 controlled the association of EGFR1 with RCP to promote the coordinate recycling of these two receptors. This modified signaling downstream of EGFR1 to increase its autophosphorylation and activation of the proinvasive kinase PKB/Akt. We conclude that RCP provides a scaffold that promotes the physical association and coordinate trafficking of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and EGFR1 and that this drives migration of tumor cells into three-dimensional matrices.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: FIP, family of interacting protein; FN, fibronectin; RBD, Rab11-binding domain; RCP, Rab-coupling protein; Rip11, Rab11-interacting protein; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; Tfn-R, transferrin receptor.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell migration is essential to processes such as embryonic development and wound healing but also drives the pathology of diseases such as cancer. Indeed, one of the features of malignant cells, and one that makes cancer so difficult to treat, is their capacity to migrate invasively through the stroma to form metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sahai, 2005</xref>). Cell migration can be random or persistent. In 2D, on stiff substrates, cells tend to adopt a polar form with a leading lamellipodium, whereas in 3D they can assume elongated or amoeboid morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sahai, 2005</xref>). A cell's ability to switch between these migrational modes is likely dictated by the way in which it interacts with and responds to the surrounding ECM. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that physically link the ECM to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton but are also signaling molecules that transduce signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hynes, 2002</xref>). The signaling capacity of certain integrin heterodimers has been linked with particular modes of cell migration. For example, a study on epithelial cells has concluded that activation of Rac downstream of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin promotes slow/persistent migration, whereas engagement of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 that acts via RhoA-ROCK signaling drives rapid/random cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Danen et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Osteopontin is a secreted matrix molecule that becomes incorporated into mineralized bone matrix and a ligand for several cell surface receptors including CD44 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rangaswami et al., 2006</xref>). Increased secretion of osteopontin is associated with a range of malignancies and correlates strongly with tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rittling and Chambers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khodavirdi et al., 2006</xref>). Some tumors secrete large quantities of soluble osteopontin, which does not become incorporated into immobile ECM and is, therefore, unlikely to mediate adhesive interactions between cells and the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rittling et al., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, osteopontin promotes chemotactic cell migration of several cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tuck et al., 1999</xref>). Although it has been shown that osteopontin-driven migration may involve modulation of EGF receptor and c-Src signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tuck et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2004</xref>), the relationship between the binding of osteopontin to &#x003b1;v integrins and the acquisition of tumor cell invasive capacity is not known.</p><p>Surface integrins are continuously endocytosed, and then efficiently returned (or recycled) back to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caswell and Norman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pellinen and Ivaska, 2006</xref>). The way in which integrins are recycled dictates the migrational mode of fibroblasts, and this is largely owing to the influence of recycling pathways on &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 2007</xref>). Small GTPases of the Rab11 family, including Rab11a and Rab25, control recycling of internalized &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caswell et al., 2007</xref>), and this is likely to require the contribution of at least one Rab11 effector protein. The Rab11 family of interacting proteins (Rab11-FIPs) bind to GTP-bound Rab11s and have been shown to be effectors of Rab11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hales et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindsay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindsay and McCaffrey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wallace et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prekeris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horgan et al., 2007</xref>), thus making them potential candidates for components of protein complexes that control &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling. The Rab11-FIPs share a highly homologous C-terminal Rab11-binding domain (RBD) and are categorized into two subfamilies according to their domain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wallace et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prekeris, 2003</xref>). The three identified class I FIPs (Rab-coupling protein [RCP; aka Rab11-FIP1], Rab11-FIP2, and Rab11-interacting protein [Rip11; aka pp75 and Rab11-FIP5]) possess an N-terminal phosphatidic acid/phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate&#x02013;binding C2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lindsay and McCaffrey, 2004a</xref>), whereas the two class II FIPs (Rab11-FIP3 and Rab11-FIP4) can bind to Arf6 as well as Rab11s and are thus considered to be effectors for both these classes of GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hickson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horgan et al., 2004</xref>). It is now becoming clear that Rab11-regulated processes can be linked to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldenring et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, Rab25 contributes to the aggressiveness of breast and ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>) and likely achieves this in part by altering the trafficking of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 to promote invasive migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caswell et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, Rab11 controls recycling of &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;4 integrin in breast cancer cells in a way that may contribute to hypoxia-induced invasive migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoon et al., 2005</xref>). These findings, in combination with the fact that the gene for RCP is located within a small amplicon (8p11-12) prevalent in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gelsi-Boyer et al., 2005</xref>), led us to investigate a potential role for class I Rab11-FIPs in coordinating the trafficking of integrins and other proinvasive receptors as tumor cells migrate in 3D microenvironments in response to tumor-relevant chemokinetic factors such as osteopontin and EGF.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Inhibition of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 promotes &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling in A2780 cells</title><p>We have previously shown that perturbation of &#x0201c;short-loop&#x0201d; &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 recycling leads to a marked increase in &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 2007</xref>), so we sought to determine whether such reciprocative cross talk between these two integrins also occurs in cancer cells. The basal recycling rate of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin A2780 ovarian cancer cells was similar to fibroblasts, with 25&#x02013;30% of internalized integrin returned to the plasma membrane within 15 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, left). However, in cells challenged with either cilengitide (a cyclic RGD peptide known to bind to and inhibit &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;5), cRGDfV (a cyclic peptide with selectivity for &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 over &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;5 integrin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dechantsreiter et al., 1999</xref>), or the soluble &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 ligand osteopontin, &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling increased by at least twofold, whereas a control cyclic peptide (cRADfV) was ineffective in this regard (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, left). Consistent with this, suppression of &#x003b2;3 levels by RNAi (Fig. S1, available at available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804140/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804140/DC1</ext-link>) increased &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling, and treatment of &#x003b2;3 knockdown cells with either cilengitide or osteopontin did not further enhance &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 trafficking (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, right). Cilengitide did not affect the rate at which &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 was internalized by A2780 cells (Fig. S1 B). As cilengitide-driven &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling was Rab11 dependent (Fig. S2 A), these data indicate that &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 functions constitutively to restrain &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling in A2780 ovarian cancer cells and that removal of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 or its occupation/blockade with soluble, non-ECM ligands such as osteopontin or cilengitide releases this constraint to drive Rab11-dependent trafficking of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 to the plasma membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 promotes &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling and association of RCP with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1.</bold> (A) A2780 cells were transfected with a nontargeting shRNA (sh-CON) or a short hairpin&#x02013;targeting &#x003b2;3 integrin (sh-&#x003b2;3; right) or were left untransfected (left).

Biotin remaining at the cell surface was removed by exposure to MesNa at 4&#x000b0;C, and internalized integrin was chased back to the cell surface at 37&#x000b0;C for the indicated times in the absence (BAS) or presence (CIL) of 1 &#x003bc;M cilengitide, 1 &#x003bc;M c-RADfV, 4.4 &#x003bc;M cRGDfV, or 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml soluble osteopontin.

GFP and GFP fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates by incubation with beads coupled to a monoclonal antibody recognizing GFP, and these immunoprecipitates analyzed for the presence of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 by immunoblotting with antibodies recognizing the integrin &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b2;3 chains, respectively.

Increased association of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and RCP was detectable within 8 min and was maximal after 20-min exposure to cilengitide (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804140/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804140/DC1</ext-link>). To further confirm these associations, we immunoprecipitated &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 using antibodies recognizing &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b2;3 integrin, respectively. Western blots of these immunoprecipitates indicated that both endogenous and overexpressed RCP coprecipitated with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 (but not with a control antibody) and that addition of cilengitide strongly promoted RCP's association with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, but correspondingly weakened binding to &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Suppression of &#x003b2;3 expression by RNAi also increased association between RCP and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, and treatment of &#x003b2;3 knockdown cells with cilengitide or osteopontin did not further enhance this (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Furthermore, RCP<sup>621E</sup>, containing a point mutation within the RBD of RCP rendering it unable to interact with Rab11 (and therefore to be considered a dominant-negative inhibitor of RCP function), did not associate with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), indicating that Rab11 likely contributes to &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1&#x02013;RCP complex formation.</p></sec><sec><title>RCP regulates integrin recycling and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-dependent cell movement</title><p>Although cilengitide promoted &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling in cells expressing control RNAi or those overexpressing RCP<sup>wt</sup>, it was completely unable to drive &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling after RCP knockdown or expression of dominant-negative RCP<sup>621E</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

Internalization of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 was not affected by expression of dominant-negative RCP (Fig. S1 B). These data indicate that RCP displays selectivity toward the recycling of specific cargoes (i.e., &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 not Tfn-R) that follow Rab11-dependent routes to the cell surface and that RCP is likely to be the only class I FIP that has a role in trafficking &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Cilengitide and osteopontin drive alterations in &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling and cell migration that are dependent on RCP.</bold> (A) A2780 cells were transfected with a nontargeting shRNA (shRNA-CON), a short hairpin targeting RCP (shRNA-RCP), GFP-RCP<sup>wt</sup>, or dominant-negative GFP-RCP<sup>621E</sup>.

However, upon challenge with cilengitide or osteopontin, or when &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 was suppressed by RNAi, the morphology of migrating A2780 cells was drastically altered, with an apparent collapse of the lamellipodium and the presence of anterior protrusions containing &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin, RCP, and F-actin (Fig. S4). 3D reconstructions indicated that these protrusions were composed of numerous actin-rich ruffles that extended upward from the cell front (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, middle and right). Fluorescence time-lapse imaging showed these cilengitide- and osteopontin-driven structures to be very actively protrusive and always anterior to the direction of migration (Videos 4&#x02013;6), indicating that they were neither dorsal ruffles nor retracting lamellae, but likely locomoting structures contributing to the cell's forward motion.

We, therefore, sought to determine whether cilengitide-driven, RCP-dependent changes in &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 trafficking were sufficient to promote migration into 3D matrices. When &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 was not inhibited, migration of A2780 cells was unaffected by addition of FN to the matrigel (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

As previously observed, A2780 cells migrated rapidly across cell-derived matrices and maintained their overall sluglike morphology as they moved (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref> and Video 7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804140/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804140/DC1</ext-link>). Addition of cilengitide altered the morphology of cells migrating on 3D matrices to extend long pseudopods in the direction of migration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B;</xref> and Video 8). When &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 was not inhibited, migration on cell-derived matrix had no requirement for RCP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>), but expression of RCP<sup>621E</sup> completely abrogated cilengitide-driven pseudopodial extension and markedly decreased both the speed and persistence of cell movement (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>; and Video 9). The dynamic localization of RCP within migrating cells was also strikingly altered by treatment with cilengitide. In untreated cells, GFP-RCP localized to the perinuclear region and to vesicles distributed fairly uniformly throughout the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). However, after addition of cilengitide, GFP-RCP (but not dominant-negative GFP-RCP<sup>621E</sup>) was recruited to the tip of the extending pseudopod (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Although there was considerable movement of RCP-positive tubulovesicular structures in and out of the pseudopodial region, the RCP-containing structures at the distal pseudopod tip appeared to be relatively immobile and closely associated with the plasma membrane. Collectively, these data indicate that inhibition of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 strongly promotes RCP-dependent trafficking of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin, which alters cellular morphology to favor rapid/random movement on plastic surfaces and a pseudopodial-driven mode of migration on a 3D matrix.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Cilengitide drives RCP to the tips of extending pseudopods.</bold> (A and B) Cells were transfected with GFP-RCP<sup>wt</sup> or GFP-RCP<sup>621E</sup> and plated onto cell-derived matrix in the presence and absence of 1 &#x003bc;M cilengitide &#x0223c;4 h before time-lapse microscopy.

We had, therefore, previously hypothesized that endosomal pathways may not function primarily to control the quantity of surface receptors, but that they regulate integrin function in other ways, for example, by &#x0201c;cleaning&#x0201d; internalized integrins of bound ligand, thus maintaining ligand-binding competency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caswell and Norman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 2007</xref>).

Because &#x003c4;<sub>50</sub> is proportional to the number of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrins per cell that are occupied in adhesive bonds, this provides a direct measure of integrin adhesive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boettiger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi and Boettiger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boettiger, 2007</xref>). The generation of &#x003c4;<sub>50</sub> from curve fits of the spinning data (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>) was used to generate a comparison of integrin bond levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Addition of cilengitide reduced the total adhesion, as measured by the spinning disc, by &#x0223c;14% consistent with the contribution that is typically made to adhesion by &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in cells expressing both &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, inhibition of RCP reduces cilengitide-driven &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling by at least threefold. Therefore, if recycling were to influence &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1's ligand-binding capacity, one would anticipate a large alteration in adhesion strength after inhibition of RCP. However, expression of RCP<sup>621E</sup> effected only a small change (10&#x02013;15% reduction) in adhesion strength (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>), indicating that the quantity and strength of integrin&#x02013;ligand adhesive bonds is proportional to the level of surface expression (Fig. S5 B) and not to the proportion of integrin recycled.

To investigate this possibility we probed RCP immunoprecipitates with antibodies recognizing phosphotyrosine. Although cytoskeletal phosphotyrosine-containing proteins such as paxillin were not present in RCP immunoprecipitates (Fig. S3 B), we consistently observed a high molecular mass phosphotyrosine-rich band with the approximate molecular mass of EGFR1 (not depicted). Indeed, addition of cilengitide, osteopontin, or RNAi of &#x003b2;3 drove &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and EGFR1 into a coprecipitable complex with endogenous or overexpressed RCP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>), and this correlated closely with recruitment of EGFR1 to F-actin&#x02013;rich protrusions at the cell front and its colocalization with RCP at these structures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, D&#x02013;F</xref>). Given this coprecipitation of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 with RCP and EGFR1, we sought to determine whether RCP was acting as a molecular bridge to connect &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and EGFR1. First, we found that &#x003b1;5-RNAi prevented coprecipitation of EGFR1 with RCP, whereas EGFR1-RNAi did not reduce association of RCP with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Second, we deployed the mutant RCP<sup>379-649</sup> that lacks an N-terminal portion of the protein, including the C2 domain, but retains the C terminus and Rab11-binding domain. Interestingly, this truncated RCP associated with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin but had no capacity to coprecipitate with EGFR1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>).

Cilengitide, osteopontin, cRGDfV, and &#x003b2;3-RNAi promoted EGFR1 recycling to a similar extent as was previously observed for &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, and knockdown of RCP prevented this (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Furthermore, addition of cilengitide and/or expression of dominant-negative RCP did not affect internalization of EGFR1 by A2780 cells (Fig. S1 B).

Furthermore, expression of RCP<sup>379-649</sup> (which can associate with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 but not EGFR1) had minimal effect on cilengitide-driven &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling, but severely impaired EGFR1 recycling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>).

Moreover, although GFP-RCP<sup>379-649</sup> was localized to vesicular structures toward the cell front (indicating that integrin binding mediates the recruitment of RCP to extending processes), this truncated RCP caused pseudopod bifurcation, suggesting that combined recruitment of EGFR1 and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 is necessary for maintenance of pseudopodial dominance, which is in turn required for cilengitide-driven migration in 3D (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3's modulation of EGFR1 signaling proceeds via RCP and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1</title><p>Cilengitide addition and expression of dominant-negative RCP does not greatly affect the exposure of EGFR1 at the cell surface (Fig. S5 B). However, the way in which receptors are trafficked is now established to modulate the downstream signaling profile of several RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">von Zastrow and Sorkin, 2007</xref>). Indeed, we found that pretreatment of A2780 cells with osteopontin or cilengitide or &#x003b2;3-RNAi (all of which enhance EGFR1 recycling) strongly potentiated the ability of EGF to drive EGFR1 autophosphorylation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>). Pretreatment of cells with either osteopontin or cilengitide enhanced downstream signals to PKB/Akt but phosphorylation of ERK1/2 remained at basal levels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>). Because osteopontin or cilengitide-driven EGFR1 recycling required &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and the association of EGFR1 with RCP, we investigated the involvement of &#x003b1;5 and RCP in EGFR1 signaling. Either RCP- or &#x003b1;5-RNAi or expression of RCP<sup>379-649</sup> blocked the ability of osteopontin to potentiate EGF-driven EGFR1 autophosphorylation and activation of PKB/Akt (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that after inhibition of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3-mediated cell adhesion, EGFR1 was recruited into a physical complex with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and RCP, which enhances EGFR1 recycling to the plasma membrane and its ability to autophosphorylate and to signal via PKB/Akt.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Osteopontin enhances EGFR1 signaling via a mechanism that requires &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, RCP, and association of EGFR1 with RCP.</bold> Cells were transfected with short hairpin vectors targeting &#x003b2;3, &#x003b1;5, &#x003b2;1, RCP or EGFR1 or with truncated GFP-RCP<sup>379-649</sup> as indicated.

Cells can migrate with persistence, allowing their translocation for considerable distances from the starting point. Alternatively, some cells move rapidly but with low persistence, thus remaining nearer their starting point. Previous analyses have shown that persistent migration occurs on FN substrates when &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 is the dominant integrin, but when &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 dominates cells move more rapidly but with reduced persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Danen et al., 2005</xref>). We have shown that alterations in the relative rates at which &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 traffic through the endosomal pathway can switch between slow/persistent and rapid/random migration in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 2007</xref>). When &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 is cycling rapidly and is competent to engage ligand, the recycling of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 is slow and cells migrate persistently. Alternatively, when &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 trafficking is disrupted, &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling is increased and this reduces migrational persistence. Here, we report that treatment of tumor cells with endogenous (soluble osteopontin) and pharmacological (cilengitide and c-RGDfV) antagonists of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 increases the rate at which &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 is transported from endosomes to the plasma membrane. This increased recycling requires the association of RCP with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and thus this Rab11 effector represents a key component of an integrin cross talk system that controls a switch between &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3- and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-mediated migrational modes. Remarkably, we find that although &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-driven migration has little persistence on plastic or glass surfaces (2D), it corresponds to increased migration into a FN-rich 3D gel. Moreover, this type of cell movement was characterized by the extension of long pseudopods at the cell front as cells migrate on a 3D matrix, and RCP was concentrated at the tips of these invasive structures. This implies that &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 functions to promote tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vivo, with &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 acting to restrain this.</p><p>The role of integrin recycling in this switching between &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3- and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-mediated migration suggested that the recycling process itself was affecting integrin function. Although differences in the total levels of surface integrin could not explain the differences, it was possible that integrins required recycling to reactivate or to remove bound ligand fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caswell and Norman, 2006</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we have measured the effect of cilengitide-induced recycling of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin (and its inhibition by dominant-negative RCP) on &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 surface expression and its ability to form adhesive bonds with substrate FN. The formation and the strength of the adhesive bonds was affected only to the extent expected for the contributions of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and the small reduction of surface &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 levels caused by inhibition of recycling. Unlike the common static adhesion assays, this assay measures the force required for cell detachment, which is directly proportional to the number of adhesive integrin bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi and Boettiger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boettiger, 2007</xref>). Therefore, recycling had no effect on ligand binding and adhesive function of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin.</p><p>The absence of an effect of trafficking on integrin adhesive function led us to examine the influence of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 recycling on cell signaling. Studies on tumor angiogenesis in mice show clearly that knockout of &#x003b2;3 leads to increased endothelial cell proliferation and migration owing to increased VEGFR2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reynolds et al., 2004</xref>). Other studies have described physical complexes formed by integrins and RTKs, but the way in which these associations may regulate signaling is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soldi et al., 1999</xref>). Here we have found that RCP is required to bring &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and EGFR1 together into a physical complex and, although our results do not resolve all of the details of the RCP&#x02013;&#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1&#x02013;EGFR1 complex (such as whether these associations involve direct molecular contacts between &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and RCP and EGFR1 and RCP, respectively), we have determined how the trafficking of EGFR1 is coordinated with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1. Clearly knockdown of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 opposes the coprecipitation of RCP with EGFR1, indicating that recruitment of RCP's C-terminal region to &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 may likely be a prerequisite for subsequent association of the N terminus of RCP with EGFR1 and for subsequent enhanced EGFR1 recycling. In this regard, it is possible that &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 is acting as a &#x0201c;receptor&#x0201d; for RCP to guide this Rab effector to a membrane subdomain, whereupon a secondary association with EGFR1 is formed.</p><p>Efficient signaling from EGFR1 to the Ras&#x02013;MEK&#x02013;ERK axis requires receptor internalization, and a close association between EGFR1 and components of the MAPK cascade has been observed to occur at late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">von Zastrow and Sorkin, 2007</xref>). Conversely, it appears that EGFR1-stimulated activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase most likely occurs at or near the plasma membrane and that communication between EGFR1 and PKB/Akt is terminated after receptor endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haugh and Meyer, 2002</xref>). In view of this, we propose that RCP-dependent recycling acts to slow the rate at which EGFR1 reaches later endosomes where sustained activation of MAPKs occurs and favors its localization to the plasma membrane or recycling compartments where the receptor can recruit phosphoinositide-3 kinase and thereby activate PKB/Akt. Indeed a recent study has found that c-Src promotes the trafficking of FGF receptor from endosomes to the plasma membrane and that this favors activation of PKB/Akt over signaling to the MEK&#x02013;ERK axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sandilands et al., 2007</xref>). We find that c-Src binds to RCP and that this kinase is required for integrin and RTK recycling (unpublished data). Osteopontin enhances EGFR1 signaling in a way that involves c-Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2004</xref>), which in light of the data presented here is likely to be mediated by RCP-dependent effects on &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and EGFR1 trafficking. Furthermore, we find that RTK recycling and signaling is influenced by RCP/&#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 in other cell types, including VEGFR2 in endothelial cells and FGF receptor in fibroblasts (unpublished data). It is interesting to note that the genes for RCP and FGF receptor 1 are located close to one another within the 8p11-12 chromosomal region that is amplified in several cancers, including some breast tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gelsi-Boyer et al., 2005</xref>). In this regard, it will be necessary to determine the molecular details of this apparently promiscuous association of RTKs with the RCP&#x02013;&#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 complex and how this influences their trafficking and signaling in cancer types where the 8p11-12 chromosomal locus is amplified.</p><p>In phase I and II clinical trails cilengitide has elicited some enduring responses in glioma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nabors et al., 2007</xref>), but the results for other types of cancer are not encouraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friess et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hariharan et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, the role that &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 plays in cancer-relevant processes is controversial, as some studies implicate &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 as a proangiogenic integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 1994</xref>), whereas other work contradicts this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reynolds et al., 2002</xref>). Our findings support both pro- and antiinvasive roles for &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3, as knockdown of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 can reduce A2780 cell migration but only in the absence of FN or when RCP-dependent processes are compromised. Conversely, when FN is abundant and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and RCP are present (as is the case in many tumor types), inhibition of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 strongly promotes tumor cell migration, thus overriding the capacity for this integrin to function as an antimigratory molecule. We consistently find that cellular responses to cilengitide, c-RGDfV, small molecule inhibitors of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 (unpublished data), and osteopontin are indistinguishable from one another (and from &#x003b2;3 knockdown), indicating the possibility that the lack of efficacy of anti-&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 compounds in cancer may be owing to the capacity of these molecules to mimic the prometastatic effects of osteopontin.</p><p>In conclusion, our surprising finding that inhibition of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 leads to increased tumor cell migration in 3D microenvironments, and the elucidation of the RCP&#x02013;&#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1&#x02013;EGFR1&#x02013;dependent mechanisms that drive this, highlight the need to fully understand how integrin trafficking regulates cell migration if the therapeutic potential of anti-integrin agents is to be maximized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>A2780 cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) serum at 37&#x000b0;C and 10% CO<sub>2</sub>.
