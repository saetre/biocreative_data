We identified the maize WHY1 ortholog among proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with CRS1, which promotes the splicing of the chloroplast <italic>atpF</italic> group II intron. ZmWHY1 localizes to the chloroplast stroma and to the thylakoid membrane, to which it is tethered by DNA. Genome-wide coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that ZmWHY1 in chloroplast extract is associated with DNA from throughout the plastid genome and with a subset of plastid RNAs that includes <italic>atpF</italic> transcripts. Furthermore, ZmWHY1 binds both RNA and DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. A severe Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutant allele conditions albino seedlings lacking plastid ribosomes; these exhibit the altered plastid RNA profile characteristic of ribosome-less plastids. Hypomorphic Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutants exhibit reduced <italic>atpF</italic> intron splicing and a reduced content of plastid ribosomes; aberrant 23S rRNA metabolism in these mutants suggests that a defect in the biogenesis of the large ribosomal subunit underlies the ribosome deficiency. However, these mutants contain near normal levels of chloroplast DNA and RNAs, suggesting that ZmWHY1 is not directly required for either DNA replication or for global plastid transcription.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Plant mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes encode &#x0223c;50 and &#x0223c;100 products, respectively, most of which participate in basal organellar gene expression or energy transduction. Post-transcriptional events play the dominant role in dictating gene product abundance in both organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In fact, the two organelles house a similar repertoire of RNA-processing pathways that includes RNA editing, group II intron splicing and endonucleolytic processing. Genetic and bioinformatic analyses suggest that many hundreds of nuclear genes encode organelle-localized nucleic acid binding proteins and influence organellar gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5">2&#x02013;5</xref>), but only a small fraction of such genes has been studied.</p><p>The protein that is the focus of this study, ZmWHY1, came to our attention during our characterization of the chloroplast RNA splicing machinery. Nine nucleus-encoded proteins that are necessary for the splicing of various subsets of the &#x0223c;20 chloroplast introns in vascular plants have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">6&#x02013;15</xref>). One of the first to be characterized, CRS1, is necessary for the splicing of the group II intron in the chloroplast <italic>atpF</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and binds specifically to that intron <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, the large size of the particles containing CRS1 and <italic>atpF</italic> intron RNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the fact that CRS1 is not sufficient to promote <italic>atpF</italic> intron splicing <italic>in vitro</italic> suggested that additional proteins are involved. We therefore used mass spectrometry to identify proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with CRS1; ZmWHY1 was one such protein.</p><p>ZmWHY1 is a member of the &#x02018;Whirly&#x02019; protein family, whose orthologs in potato (StWHY1) and Arabidopsis (AtWHY1) were reported to be nuclear transcription factors involved in pathogen-induced transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). StWHY1 and AtWHY1 bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) <italic>in vitro</italic>, and StWHY1 adopts a propeller-like structure from which the family acquired its name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). AtWHY1 has also been implicated in telomere binding and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Additional functions for members of the Whirly family were suggested by the fact that GFP fused to each member of the family from Arabidopsis localizes to chloroplasts or mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The copurification of AtWHY1 with a transcriptionally active chloroplast DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and the association of AtWHY2 with mitochondrial nucleoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) confirmed that these proteins have organellar functions, but the nature of these functions is not known. Results presented here show that ZmWHY1 plays an essential role in the biogenesis of chloroplasts, that it is associated with DNA from throughout the chloroplast genome and that it interacts <italic>in vivo</italic> with a subset of chloroplast RNAs that includes the <italic>atpF</italic> intron. ZmWHY1 enhances <italic>atpF</italic> intron splicing and influences the biogenesis of the large ribosomal subunit. However, chloroplast DNA and RNAs in Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutants accumulate to levels similar to those in other mutants with plastid ribosome deficiencies of similar magnitude. These results argue that ZmWHY1 is required neither for chloroplast DNA replication nor directly for global chloroplast transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Purification of CRS1 ribonucleoproteins and mass spectrometry</title><p>Purification of CRS1 ribonucleoprotein particles and mass spectrometry were performed as described for CAF1 and CAF2 particles in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).

When untreated stroma was sedimented through a sucrose gradient, ZmWHY1 was detected in two peaks (&#x0223c;400&#x02013;500 kDa and &#x0223c;600&#x02013;700 kDa) and was also found in pelleted material at the bottom of the gradient.

Treatment of stroma with DNAse reduced the amount of ZmWHY1 in the pellet and in the &#x0223c;400&#x02013;500 kDa peak, but did not reduce its recovery in the 600&#x02013;700 kDa peak. Conversely, RNAse treatment specifically reduced the recovery of ZmWHY1 in the 600&#x02013;700 kDa peak.

To identify RNAs that associate with ZmWHY <italic>in vivo</italic> we used a &#x02018;RIP-Chip&#x02019; assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) as an initial screen: RNAs that coimmunoprecipitate with ZmWHY1 from stromal extract were identified by hybridization to a tiling microarray of the maize chloroplast genome. To ensure that DNA associated with ZmWHY did not contribute to the signal, the extract was treated with DNAse prior to immunoprecipitation, and the nucleic acids recovered from the immunoprecipitation pellet and supernatant were again treated with DNAse. RNAs recovered from the pellet and supernatant were then labeled with red- or green-fluorescing dye, respectively, combined, and hybridized to the microarray. Two replicate immunoprecipitations were analyzed in this manner. To highlight sequences that are enriched in the ZmWHY1 immunoprecipitations, the median enrichment ratio [red(F635)/green (F532)] was plotted according to chromosomal position, after subtracting the median enrichment ratios from control assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

A control immunoprecipitation used antibody to CAF1, a splicing factor that associates with specific chloroplast intron RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Both ZmWHY1 and CAF1 were efficiently immunoprecipitated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn492/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>C), but the DIP-chip data were strikingly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C): nearly all of the DNA in the input stromal sample coimmunoprecipitated with ZmWHY1, whereas very little DNA was recovered in CAF1 immunoprecipitations. These results confirm that ZmWHY1 is associated with chloroplast DNA and show further that ZmWHY1 either binds throughout the chloroplast genome, or binds to specific DNA regions and coimmunoprecipitates all other DNA sequences due to their linkage to ZmWHY1-binding sites. Incubation of the extract with various restriction enzymes prior to the immunoprecipitation did not reveal the specific enrichment of any DNA sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn492/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>B), leading us to favor the interpretation that ZmWHY1 is associated with many sites throughout the chloroplast genome.

A dramatic increase in the ratio of 23S rRNA precursors to mature 23S rRNA in these mutants was confirmed with a poisoned-primer extension assay (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn492/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>C).</p><p>Some steps in rRNA processing are dependent upon ribosome assembly in chloroplasts, as in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The aberrant 23S and 4.5S rRNA processing in Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutants suggested therefore that ZmWHY1 might promote the expression of a gene needed for the assembly of the large ribosomal subunit (an rRNA or ribosomal protein), with loss of the small ribosomal subunit being a secondary effect. It seemed plausible, for example, that ZmWHY1 might promote processive transcription through the chloroplast <italic>rrn</italic> operon; this would differentially affect the large ribosomal subunit due to the distal position of the genes encoding its rRNA components (23S, 4.5S and 5S rRNA) in the operon (see map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). However, the results of chloroplast run-on transcriptions assays argue against this possibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C): the ratio of polymerase transit through the 23S gene in comparison to the 16S rRNA gene, and the ratio of <italic>rrn</italic> operon transcription in comparison to transcription from a different chloroplast locus (<italic>trnG</italic>-UCC) were similar in wild-type and Zm<italic>why1-1/-2</italic> mutant chloroplasts. Furthermore, the rRNA components of the large ribosomal subunit were not reproducibly enriched in ZmWHY coimmunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn492/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2B</ext-link>); this suggests that ZmWHY1 does not interact directly with rRNAs or 50S ribosomal subunits, although such interactions cannot be eliminated based on these negative results. Taken together, these results argue that ZmWHY1 directly impacts the expression of a gene encoding a component of the large ribosomal subunit and/or promotes ribosome assembly.

WHY1 in dicots has been reported to be a ssDNA-binding protein that functions in the nucleus as both a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and as a negative regulator of telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Arabidopsis WHY1 copurified with the &#x02018;transcriptionally active chromosome&#x02019; from chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Our results add another layer to this complex picture. We demonstrate that ZmWHY1 is essential for chloroplast biogenesis, and that it localizes to the chloroplast where it plays multiple roles in gene expression. We also add RNA binding to WHY1's repertoire of biochemical activities and demonstrate that ZmWHY1 is bound to a subset of chloroplast RNAs in chloroplast extract.</p><sec><title>Multiple roles of ZmWHY1 in chloroplast biogenesis</title><p>ZmWHY was identified among proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with CRS1, which is required for the splicing of the group II intron in the chloroplast <italic>atpF</italic> pre-mRNA. We showed that ZmWHY1 is associated with <italic>atpF</italic> intron RNA <italic>in vivo</italic> and that the coimmunoprecipitation of ZmWHY1 and CRS1 is disrupted by RNAse, indicating that they coimmunoprecipitate due to their association with the same RNA molecule. ZmWHY1's association with <italic>atpF</italic> RNA is functionally significant, as <italic>atpF</italic> intron splicing is disrupted in Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutants. However, the splicing of this intron is more sensitive to a partial loss of CRS1 than to a partial loss of ZmWHY1, suggesting that ZmWHY1 plays an accessory function in <italic>atpF</italic> splicing but may not be absolutely required.</p><p>The <italic>atpF</italic> splicing defect in Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutants cannot account for their loss of plastid ribosomes, as the more severe <italic>atpF</italic> splicing defect in <italic>crs1-1</italic> mutants is not accompanied by a substantial plastid ribosome deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The specific role of ZmWHY1 in promoting the biogenesis of the plastid translation machinery remains unclear. Although several RNAs with translation-related functions are among the RNAs that coimmunoprecipitate with ZmWHY1, the abundance and processing of these RNAs are similar in Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutants and in control mutants that exhibit a ribosome-deficiency of similar severity. The specific rRNA deficiencies in Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutants do suggest, however, that ZmWHY1 is most directly involved in the biogenesis of the large ribosomal subunit: the accumulation and processing of the 23S and 4.5S rRNAs are more sensitive to the partial loss of Zm<italic>Why1</italic> function than are those of 16S rRNA, whereas the reverse is true for <italic>hcf7</italic> mutants. Furthermore, in <italic>ppr5</italic> mutants, whose primary defect is in the maturation of a specific plastid tRNA, the rRNAs from the two ribosomal subunits are impacted to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Thus, our results point to the biogenesis of the plastid large ribosomal subunit as one function of ZmWHY1 but definition of its precise role in this process will require additional study. The strong defect in the processing step that separates 23S rRNA from 4.5S rRNA in hypomorphic Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutants is reminiscent of defects reported for mutations in the <italic>DCL, DAL</italic> and <italic>RNR</italic>1 genes in dicots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45 B46">43&#x02013;46</xref>). Although it is unclear whether any of these genes function directly in 23S/4.5S rRNA processing, it is possible that WHY1 acts in concert with one or more of these proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>ZmWHY1 binds both RNA and DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>We show here that chloroplast DNA coimmunoprecipitates with ZmWHY1 from plastid extract, that a fraction of ZmWHY1 is tethered to the thylakoid membrane in a DNA-dependent fashion, that a fraction of stromal ZmWHY1 is found in DNA-containing particles of &#x0223c;400 kDa, and that ZmWHY1 binds ssDNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results are consistent with previous reports that dicot WHY1 binds ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and that it copurifies with a chloroplast &#x02018;transcriptionally active chromosome&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Our findings suggest that ZmWHY1 either binds DNA in a sequence non-specific fashion or that it has many binding sites distributed throughout the plastid genome, because DNA sequences from throughout the plastid genome coimmunoprecipitated to a similar extent with ZmWHY1. It remains possible, however, that ZmWHY1 associates with specific DNA regions <italic>in vivo</italic>, but that these associations were disrupted during lysate preparation. A DNA immunoprecipitation experiment was recently reported for AtWHY2, a mitochondrial-localized Whirly protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), with analogous results: DNA sequences from a variety of regions throughout the mitochondrial genome coimmunoprecipitated with AtWHY2, when assayed by PCR.</p><p>We demonstrate here that ZmWHY1 interacts not only with DNA, as anticipated by previous reports, but that it also binds RNA <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. That ZmWHY1 interacts with RNA is, perhaps, not surprising given that a structural homolog of ZmWHY1 has been shown to bind RNAs involved in kinetoplastid RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), and that many proteins that bind ssDNA also bind RNA. The <italic>atpF</italic> intron RNA was the major RNA ligand of ZmWHY1 detected in the RNA coimmunoprecipitation assays. This RNA is not particularly abundant <italic>in vivo</italic> so its enrichment in ZmWHY1 immunoprecipitations likely reflects a specific interaction <italic>in vivo.</italic> Although intrinsic specificity for this RNA did not emerge from <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays using the entire intron, a high-affinity site within a large RNA such as the <italic>atpF</italic> intron (&#x0223c;800 nt) can be masked <italic>in vitro</italic> due to the overwhelming number of nonspecific sites available for protein binding. Therefore, more detailed studies involving smaller RNA ligands will be required to determine whether ZmWHY1 binds RNA with sequence-specificity or whether it is recruited to the <italic>atpF</italic> intron via protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>What is WHY1's DNA-related function in the chloroplast?</title><p>The association of ZmyWHY1 with DNA sequences from throughout the chloroplast genome suggests that it participates in transcription and/or DNA metabolism. However, our results argue against a general role in transcription, as all plastid mRNAs examined accumulate in hypomorphic Zm<italic>why1</italic> mutants to levels that are comparable to those in the relevant control mutants. The results of chloroplast transcription runon experiments argue that the preferential loss of 23S rRNA in these mutants is due to aberrant ribosome assembly rather than to reduced rRNA transcription rates. It remains possible, however, that ZmWHY1 does play a role in chloroplast transcription but that another gene with a partially redundant function serves this purpose in Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutants.</p><p>It is intriguing that ZmWHY1 binds preferentially to DNA in single stranded form because opportunities to interact with ssDNA <italic>in vivo</italic> are expected to be limited. DNA replication, recombination and repair involve the transient occurrence of ssDNA, and torsional stress can induce DNA unwinding. The Southern blot data showing that plastid DNA levels are no more than minimally decreased in Zm<italic>Why1</italic> null mutants argue against a central role for ZmWHY1 in DNA replication; however participation of ZmWHY1 in DNA recombination or repair remains possible. In fact, the participation of an unrelated ssDNA-binding protein, OSB1, in plant mitochondrial DNA recombination was reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>).</p><p>There are several parallels between our findings with ZmWHY1 and the activities reported for the bacterial protein HU. HU is associated with the bacterial nucleoid, binds preferentially to DNA with irregular structural features (e.g. single stranded gaps and bulges), and is involved in DNA recombination and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Despite its high conservation in bacteria and the presence of an HU homolog in a plastid genome in red algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), HU homologs are not encoded in the nuclear or plastid genomes of vascular plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Thus, alternative proteins have presumably been recruited in vascular plants to fulfill the functions performed by HU in the chloroplast's cyanobacterial ancestor. The nucleoid-associated protein sulfite reductase has been suggested to be one such protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51 B52 B53">51&#x02013;53</xref>), and perhaps WHY1 is another. HU influences global transcription patterns through its effect on nucleoid architecture, and mediates the formation of DNA loops that repress transcription from specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54 B55 B56">54&#x02013;56</xref>). HU is also an RNA-binding protein, and functions <italic>in vivo</italic> to repress the translation of the <italic>E. coli rpoS</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Like HU, ZmWHY1 interacts globally with plastid DNA, but specifically with certain plastid RNAs, and binds preferentially to nucleic acids with single-stranded character. The abundance of several chloroplast mRNAs is increased in Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutants, consistent with a global repressive role for ZmWHY1 in transcription. This possibility is in accord with the recent report that over-expression of AtWHY2 in Arabidopsis causes a reduction in the levels of several mitochondrial RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Although its role in DNA metabolism remains uncertain, our results demonstrate that description of WHY1 as a chloroplast transcription factor is, at best, an over-simplification of the complex roles played by this interesting protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn492/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn492_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkn492_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Rosalind Williams-Carrier for her participation in the purification of CRS1-associated proteins for mass spectrometry, Susan Belcher for maintaining and propagating the mutant lines, and Tiffany Kroeger and Amy Cooke for identifying Zm<italic>Why1</italic> mutants.
