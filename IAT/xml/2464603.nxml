Gram-negative bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Pseudomonas syringae </italic>can deliver effector proteins to plant cells to interfere PAMP-triggered resistance to promote pathogen virulence. As a result, the remaining basal defense is usually insufficient to contain pathogens but can limit their growth in plant tissue. Through co-evolution, some effectors may be specifically recognized by plant resistance (R) proteins and activate strong effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. R gene-activated ETI involves a complex defense program including production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and salicylic acid (SA), rapid programmed cell death (hypersensitive responses, HR) and induction of a large number of host genes including pathogenesis-related (<italic>PR</italic>) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, R gene- and SA-mediated defense mechanisms are effective against biotrophic pathogens that feed on living host tissue during the whole or part of their infection cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Necrotrophic pathogens kill the host to extract nutrients. Many necrotrophic pathogens produce toxins, cell wall-degrading enzymes and ROS to promote disease and macerate plant tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Plant defense mechanisms against necrotrophic pathogens have been analyzed relatively recently and appear to differ from those against biotrophic pathogens in important ways. First, gene-for-gene resistance is common to biotrophic pathogens but not to necrotrophic pathogens. Second, R gene-mediated HR is effective against biotrophic pathogens but does not deter and in some cases actually facilitate infection of necrotrophic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Third, while SA is important for resistance to biotrophic pathogens, its role in defense against necrotrophic pathogens is limited, if any. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, mutations that impair SA biosynthesis or signaling do not affect resistance to <italic>Botrytis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Abolishing SA accumulation in transgenic <italic>nahG </italic>plants resulted in limited increase in susceptibility to <italic>Botrytis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, transgenic <italic>nahG </italic>plants have nonspecific phenotypes (i.g. reduced phytoalexin) independent of SA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the enhanced susceptibility to <italic>Botrytis </italic>observed in transgenic <italic>nahG </italic>plants may not be caused by SA deficiency.</p><p>Although discovered relatively recently, WRKY transcription factors are becoming one of the best-characterized classes of plant transcription factors and are at the forefront of research on plant defense responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Pathogen infection or treatment with pathogen elicitors or SA induces rapid expression of plant WRKY genes. We have shown that in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, for example, expression of 49 out of 72 tested WRKY genes was differentially regulated after pathogen infection or SA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, a large number of defense or defense-related genes, including well-studied <italic>PR </italic>genes and the regulatory <italic>NPR1 </italic>gene, contain W-box elements in their promoters that are specifically recognized by WRKY proteins and are necessary for their inducible expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. More recent studies have provided direct evidence for the involvement of specific WRKY proteins in plant defense responses. For example, mutations of <italic>Arabidopsis WRKY70 </italic>enhance plant susceptibility to both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens including the bacterial pathogen <italic>Erwinia carotovora </italic>as well as fungal pathogens <italic>Erysiphe cichoracearum </italic>and <italic>Botrytis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, <italic>wrky70 </italic>mutants are compromised in both basal and R-gene (<italic>RPP4</italic>)-mediated resistance to the oomycete <italic>Hyaloperonospora parasitica </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. <italic>Arabidopsis wrky33 </italic>mutants are highly susceptible to necrotrophic pathogens but respond normally to biotrophic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These results indicate that WRKY33 plays an important and specific role in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens. Other WRKY proteins can function as negative regulators of plant disease resistance. For example, mutations of <italic>Arabidopsis WRKY7</italic>, <italic>WRKY11 </italic>and <italic>WRKY17 </italic>enhance plant resistance to virulent <italic>P. syringae </italic>strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and mutations of <italic>Arabidopsis WRKY25 </italic>enhance tolerance to <italic>P. syringae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The structurally related WRKY18, WRKY40 and WRKY60 function partially redundantly as negative regulators in plant resistance to <italic>P. syringae </italic>and <italic>E. orontii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Their barley homologues HvWRKY1 and HvWRKY2 also function as suppressors of basal defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The diverse roles of WRKY proteins may reflect the complex signaling and transcriptional networks of plant defense that require tight regulation and fine-tuning.</p><p>We have previously shown that infection of an avirulent <italic>P. syringae </italic>strain or SA treatment induces <italic>Arabidopsis WRKY3 </italic>and <italic>WRKY4</italic>, which encode two structurally closely related WRKY proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the present study, we have shown that both WRKY3 and WRKY4 are nuclear-localized sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. We have also shown that induced expression of <italic>WRKY3 </italic>and <italic>WRKY4 </italic>after pathogen infection or SA treatment was primarily due to plant stress caused by infiltration and spraying of pathogen suspension or SA solution. Both loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutants and transgenic overexpression lines for <italic>WRKY3 </italic>and <italic>WRKY4 </italic>have been generated and examined for responses to the biotrophic bacterial pathogen <italic>P. syringae </italic>and the necrotrophic fungal pathogen <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. These studies strongly suggested that WRKY3 and WRKY4 play a positive role in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens but a negative role in resistance to biotrophic pathogens.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Structures, DNA binding and subcellular localization</title><p>Based on the number and structure of the WRKY zinc fingers, WRKY proteins are classified into three groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The first group contains two zinc-finger motifs while the second and third groups contain only one zinc-finger motif. The Cys<sub>2</sub>HisCys zinc finger in the third group of WRKY proteins is slightly different from the more common Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2 </sub>zinc finger found in the first and second groups of WRKY proteins. WRKY3 and WRKY4 belong to group I WRKY proteins each with two Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2 </sub>motifs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). For group I WRKY proteins, the C-terminal WRKY zinc finger is responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The NMR solution structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding WRKY zinc finger of the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>WRKY4 protein consists of a four-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet, with a zinc binding pocket formed by the conserved Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2 </sub>residues located at one end of the &#x003b2;-sheet to form a novel zinc and DNA binding structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Besides the conserved WRKY domains, WRKY3 and WRKY4 share high levels of similarity throughout their whole protein sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>WRKY3 and WRKY4 sequences and alignment</bold>.

To examine the DNA-binding activity of WRKY3 and WRKY4, we expressed the genes in <italic>E. coli</italic>, purified the recombinant proteins, and assayed their binding to an oligonucleotide containing two direct TTGACC W-box repeats (Pchn0; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) using electrophoretic mobility shifting assays (EMSA). Protein/DNA complexes with reduced mobility were detected when purified recombinant WRKY3 or WRKY4 protein was incubated with the Pchn0 probe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Binding to a mutant probe (mPchn0) in which the TTGACC sequence was changed to TTGAAC was undetectable for WRKY3 and greatly reduced for WRKY4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Thus, binding of WRKY3 and WRKY4 to the TTGACC W-box sequence is highly specific.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>DNA binding activity of WRKY3 and WRKY4</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

The fusion constructs, driven by the <italic>CaMV 35S </italic>promoter, were directly bombarded into onion (<italic>Allium cepa</italic>) epidermal cells. The transiently expressed WRKY3-GFP and WRKY4-GFP fusion proteins were localized exclusively to the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

The reduced <italic>PR1 </italic>expression in the <italic>WRKY4</italic>-overexpressing plants is consistent with reduced resistance of the overexpression plants to the bacterial pathogen.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>WRKY3 </italic>and <italic>WRKY4 </italic>encode two structurally similar WRKY proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and their expression was both responsive to stress conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Stress-induced expression of <italic>WRKY4 </italic>but not <italic>WRKY3 </italic>was further enhanced by pathogen infection or SA treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Independent T-DNA insertion mutants for both <italic>WRKY3 </italic>and <italic>WRKY4 </italic>exhibited significantly more severe disease symptom and supported higher fungal growth than wild-type plants after infection by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen <italic>B. cinerea </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Despite the similar structures of the two WRKY proteins, however, we observed no significant enhancement in the susceptibility to the fungal pathogen in the <italic>wrky3</italic>/<italic>wrky4 </italic>double mutant plants relative to the <italic>wrky3 </italic>and <italic>wrky4 </italic>single mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Thus there appeared to be little functional redundancy between the two structurally similar WRKY proteins in plant resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. We observed no major changes of the <italic>wrky3 </italic>and <italic>wrky4 </italic>single and double mutants to a virulent <italic>P. syringae </italic>strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), although a minor reduction in disease symptom development was observed in the <italic>wrky4 </italic>mutants in some of the experiments. On the other hand, overexpression of <italic>WRKY4 </italic>greatly reduced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen based on strong enhancement in both bacterial growth and development of disease symptoms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). No such enhancement in susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen was observed in transgenic <italic>WRKY3</italic>-overexpressing lines. The different phenotypes of the transgenic overexpression lines could be due to the distinct roles of the two WRKY proteins despite of their similar amino acid sequences. Alternatively, <italic>WRKY3 </italic>transcripts in the transgenic overexpression lines might not be full-length and, consequently, not functional for production of active WRKY3 proteins. Despite enhanced susceptibility of the <italic>wrky3 </italic>and <italic>wrky4 </italic>mutants to <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, we observed no increased resistance to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen in either <italic>WRKY3</italic>- or <italic>WRKY4</italic>-overexpressing lines. This might be due to the fact that the Col-0 wild-type accession, in which the transgenic overexpression lines were produced, is already quite resistant to <italic>B. cinerea </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These results collectively indicate that WRKY3 and WRKY4 play a positive role in plant resistance to <italic>Botrytis </italic>while overexpression of, at least, WRKY4 has a strong negative effect on plant resistance to <italic>P. syringae</italic>.</p><p>SA-mediated signaling pathways are important for disease resistance to <italic>P. syringae</italic>, a biotrophic or more precisely hemitrophic pathogen that rely on living plant tissue during its early stages of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. On the other hand, JA/ET-mediated defense is important for plant resistance necrotrophic pathogens such as <italic>Botrytis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. SA and ET/JA signaling pathways are mutually antagonistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. As a result, mutations of JA signaling regulators such as COI1 and MPK4 can enhance SA accumulation and signaling in pathogen-infected plants, resulting in elevated resistance to biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens. Likewise, blocking SA accumulation can promote JA-regulated genes in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>plants after infection by <italic>P. syringae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Overexpression of WRKY4 resulted in enhanced plant susceptibility to <italic>P. syringae </italic>and reduced expression of SA-regulated <italic>PR1 </italic>gene expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Thus WRKY4 has a negative effect on SA-mediated signaling pathways. On the other hand, WRKY3 and WRKY4 play a positive role in JA/ET-regulated resistance to necrotrophic pathogens based on the susceptible phenotypes to <italic>Botrytis </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These results strongly suggest that WRKY4 and perhaps WRKY3 as well regulate crosstalk between SA- and JA/ET-mediated signaling pathways and, as a result, play opposite roles in resistance to the two different types of microbial pathogens.</p><p>A number of early studies of WRKY transcription factors have suggested their roles in SA-regulated defense responses. Many plant WRKY genes are induced by biotrophic patogens including avirulent <italic>P. syringae </italic>in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in tobacco that are known to induce SA-dependent SAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A reported microarray experiment has revealed that the promoters of genes co-induced with PR1 during the development of SAR in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>are enriched in W boxes, suggesting a critical role of WRKY transcription factors in induction of SAR-associated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We have previously shown that the W box sequences in the promoter of the <italic>NPR1 </italic>regulatory gene required for SA signaling are important for its expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Intriguingly, functional analysis of individual WRKY genes has so far revealed a different picture about the roles of WRKY proteins in SA-mediated defense against biotrophic pathogens. <italic>Arabidopsis wrky7</italic>, <italic>wrky11 </italic>and <italic>wrky17 </italic>mutants are more susceptible to virulent <italic>P. syringae </italic>strains than wild-type plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and mutations of <italic>Arabidopsis WRKY25 </italic>enhance tolerance to <italic>P. syringae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>WRKY18, WRKY40 and WRKY60 function partially redundantly as negative regulators in plant resistance to <italic>P. syringae </italic>and <italic>E. orontii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Their barley homologues HvWRKY1 and HvWRKY2 also suppress basal defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We have also previously shown that <italic>overexpression </italic>of <italic>Arabidopsis WRKY25 </italic>and <italic>WRKY33 </italic>enhances plant susceptibility to <italic>P. syringae </italic>and suppresses pathogen-induced <italic>PR </italic>gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Thus, these characterized WRKY proteins function as negative regulators of SA-mediated defense. Interestingly, some of these WRKY proteins such as WRKY4, WRKY33 and redundant WRKY18, WRKY40 and WRKY60 play a positive role in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. One exception is <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>WRKY70, which is shown to regulate the crosstalk by activating SA signaling but suppressing JA-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Intriguingly, the <italic>wrky70 </italic>mutants, which are expected to be compromised in SA signaling and active in JA signaling, responded normally to <italic>P. syringae </italic>but exhibited enhanced susceptibility to <italic>Botrytis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, the roles of WRKY70 in plant defense signaling pathways might be complicated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Crosstalk between defense signaling pathways is an important mechanism for regulating defense mechanisms against different types of microbial pathogens. Although genes capable of regulating the crosstalk have been reported, the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly understood. Identification of a number of WRKY transcription factors that affect plant resistance in opposite ways to different types of microbial pathogens suggest that the regulation of the crosstalk between these defense signaling pathways occurs at the transcription level. For example, some of these WRKY transcription factors may regulate the crosstalk by activating expression of JA/ET-regulated genes but repressing SA-regulated genes. Such direct and opposite roles in regulation of gene expression would require these WRKY transcription factors acting as transcriptional activators or repressors in a gene-specific manner. Alternatively, the WRKY transcription factors regulate the crosstalk by activating expression of genes associated with JA/ET-mediated signaling pathways, including some encoding transcriptional repressor that suppress SA-regulated gene expression. Further studies on the transcriptional activation/repression activities and direct transcriptional targets of the WRKY proteins could generate important insights into the molecular network of complex plant defense responses to different types of microbial pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p><sup>32</sup>P-dATP (&#x0003e;3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont-New England Nuclear; other common chemicals were purchased from Sigma. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>plants were grown in a growth chamber at 24&#x000b0;C under 100 &#x003bc;E&#x000b7;m<sup>-2</sup>&#x000b7;sec<sup>-1 </sup>light with 12-hr-light/12-hr-dark photoperiod. <italic>Pst</italic>DC3000 were maintained on King's B medium containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of rifampicin and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin.
