The mitotic E3 ubiquitin ligase, known as the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C), in partnership with its activators Cdc20p and Cdh1p, targets these proteins for degradation. In the presence of defective kinetochore-microtubule interactions, APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> is inhibited by the spindle checkpoint, thereby delaying anaphase onset and providing more time for spindle assembly. Cdc20p interacts directly with Mad2p, and its levels are subject to careful regulation, but the precise mode(s) of APC/C<sup> Cdc20</sup> inhibition remain unclear. The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC, consisting of Mad3p, Mad2p, Bub3p and Cdc20p in budding yeast) is a potent APC/C inhibitor. Here we focus on Mad3p and how it acts, in concert with Mad2p, to efficiently inhibit Cdc20p. We identify and analyse the function of two motifs in Mad3p, KEN30 and KEN296, which are conserved from yeast Mad3p to human BubR1. These KEN amino acid sequences resemble &#x02018;degron&#x02019; signals that confer interaction with APC/C activators and target proteins for degradation. We show that both Mad3p KEN boxes are necessary for spindle checkpoint function. Mutation of KEN30 abolished MCC formation and stabilised Cdc20p in mitosis. In addition, mutation of Mad3-KEN30, APC/C subunits, or Cdh1p, stabilised Mad3p in G1, indicating that the N-terminal KEN box could be a Mad3p degron. To determine the significance of Mad3p turnover, we analysed the consequences of <italic>MAD3</italic> overexpression and found that four-fold overproduction of Mad3p led to chromosome bi-orientation defects and significant chromosome loss during recovery from anti-microtubule drug induced checkpoint arrest. In conclusion, Mad3p KEN30 mediates interactions that regulate the proteolytic turnover of Cdc20p and Mad3p, and the levels of both of these proteins are critical for spindle checkpoint signaling and high fidelity chromosome segregation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During mitosis and meiosis cells segregate their replicated genomes to daughter nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Nasmyth1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Importantly, mutation of the N-terminal Mad3p KEN box (<italic>mad3-KEN30AAA</italic>) also completely prevents Cdc20p binding. This mutation blocks MCC formation, dramatically reduces Cdc20p turnover in mitosis, and has a checkpoint null phenotype. We propose that this N-terminal KEN box, which is conserved from yeast Mad3p to human BubR1, is a critical link required for MCC formation and spindle checkpoint inhibition of Cdc20p.</p><p>In addition, we propose that the N-terminal KEN box acts as a degron during G1, leading to Mad3p turnover in a Cdh1-APC/C dependent manner. We analyse the effects of Mad3p overproduction and observe chromosome bi-orientation defects and significant chromosome loss during the recovery from checkpoint arrest.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mad3p contains two conserved KEN boxes</title><p>Mad3p, and its vertebrate homologue BubR1, contain a highly conserved KEN box motif near their N-termini. Indeed this is used to distinguish BubR1 from the related, but functionally distinct, checkpoint component Bub1p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Logarinho1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The Mad3/BubR1 family also contain a second KEN box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The function(s) of these motifs in Mad3/BubR1 has not previously been addressed.</p><p>Our previous studies suggested that the steady state level of Mad3p was relatively constant through the budding yeast cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Hardwick1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. To investigate whether Mad3p was degraded by APC/C-dependent proteolytic turnover we analysed its stability, in mitosis and in G1. To do this we synchronised cells, added cycloheximide to prevent new protein synthesis, and then analysed the level of Mad3p through a time course using polyclonal anti-Mad3p antibodies. The levels of Mad3p after a prolonged G1 arrest were rather low (not shown), presumably because much of it had been degraded. Therefore, we repeated this experiment after a pulse of <italic>MAD3</italic> expression from the strong inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. Mad3p levels fell slowly in nocodazole, and significantly faster in G1 during an alpha factor arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). As the APC/C is very active in G1 this finding is consistent with APC-dependent turnover and Mad3p being a late mitotic/G1 substrate. If the Mad3p KEN boxes act as destruction signals recognised by the APC/C, Mad3p should be stabilised in conditional (ts) alleles of APC/C components, and possibly in the absence of the late APC/C activator, Cdh1p. To test this we carried out cycloheximide chase experiments in G1 arrested cells in <italic>cdc16-123</italic> (apc-ts) and <italic>cdh1&#x00394;</italic>mutants, along with <italic>cdc4-1</italic> and <italic>cdc34-2</italic> strains as controls. The latter are ts alleles of components of another E3 ubiquitin ligase, the SCF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Cardozo1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. All strains expressed Mad3p from the strong inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. The <italic>cdh1</italic> and <italic>cdc16</italic> mutations both stabilised Mad3p (Mad3p stabilisation was also observed in <italic>cdc23-1</italic>&#x02013;data not shown), whereas <italic>cdc34</italic> and <italic>cdc4</italic> did not, demonstrating that Mad3p is degraded in a Cdh1-APC/C-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>/C).</p><p>To analyse the role of the KEN boxes in Mad3p turnover we replaced them, either individually or in combination, with triple alanine (AAA) residues. When we analysed the stability of these mutant Mad3 proteins in G1 arrested cells there was little difference in mad3-KEN296AAAp stability when compared to wild-type Mad3p, but Mad3-KEN30AAAp was clearly stabilised (half-life of &#x0223c;90 minutes cf. 25 minutes for wild-type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Thus Mad3p turnover in G1 is dependent on Cdh1-APC/C activity and its own N-terminal KEN box (KEN30).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Mad3p KEN boxes have checkpoint functions</title><p>Next we analysed the effect of KEN box mutations on spindle checkpoint function(s) of Mad3p. When tested for their ability to complement a <italic>mad3&#x00394;</italic> strain, all three mutants (KEN30AAA, KEN296AAA and the double mutant) were sensitive to the anti-microtubule drug benomyl. Their sensitivity was similar to that of the <italic>mad3</italic> null mutant (<italic>mad3&#x00394;</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Checkpoint assays were also carried out in liquid media containing nocodazole to depolymerise microtubules. These revealed that the <italic>ken</italic> mutants were unable to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion, scored by imaging GFP-marked chromosome IV, and died just as rapidly as the <italic>mad3&#x00394;</italic> in the presence of nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>/C). Time courses and immunoblotting demonstrated that the <italic>mad3-ken</italic> mutants were unable to stabilise key mitotic regulators, Pds1p (Securin) and Clb2p (Cyclin B), when cells were challenged with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Thus both Mad3 KEN boxes are critical for spindle checkpoint function.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The N-terminal Mad3 KEN box is required for Cdc20p binding and for mitotic Cdc20p turnover</title><p>Two clear modes of action of Mad3p have been described in budding yeast, both relating to inhibition of Cdc20p: mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC, which in budding yeast is Bub3p-Mad3p-Mad2p-Cdc20p) formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Hardwick1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and Cdc20p turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Pan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that neither KEN box mutation affected Bub3p complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), from which we conclude that the mutations have had little effect on the overall folding or stability of Mad3p. Importantly, the <italic>KEN30AAA</italic> mutation completely abolished the binding of Mad3p to both Cdc20p and Mad2p. This was not the case for <italic>KEN296AAA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), although in some experiments a minor reduction in MCC levels was observed. Thus KEN30 is required for MCC assembly and/or stability.</p><p>Surprisingly, Cdc20p turnover in early mitosis was shown to be independent of its own destruction boxes, but dependent on the Mad proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Pan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We have found that all of the <italic>mad</italic> and <italic>bub</italic> mutations perturb Cdc20p turnover, and lead to a range of increased stability with <italic>mad3&#x00394;</italic> having the most profound effect (data not shown). We were particularly interested to test whether the Mad3p KEN boxes had a role to play in Cdc20p turnover. To do this we synchronised cells early in mitosis (in several ways&#x02013;see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), added cycloheximide to prevent new protein synthesis, and then took time points to analyse the Mad3p and Cdc20p levels in whole cell extracts. Whilst any effect on Mad3p turnover was subtle in these mitotic time courses, the effects on Cdc20p turnover were very pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>/B). <italic>KEN30AAA</italic> led to stabilisation of Cdc20p, similar to that seen in a <italic>mad3&#x00394;</italic> background (&#x0223c;6-fold stabilisation), whereas <italic>KEN296AAA</italic> had little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Thus in two biochemical assays <italic>mad3-KEN30AAA</italic> behaved like the <italic>mad3&#x00394;</italic> strain: there was no MCC complex and Cdc20p was stabilised. Either or both of these effects could explain its checkpoint-defective phenotype. <italic>Mad3-KEN296AAA</italic> did not significantly reduce Cdc20p binding nor stabilise Cdc20p, whereas the double KEN mutant behaved like <italic>KEN30AAA</italic> in all assays tested. These results demonstrate that Mad3p binding is necessary for Cdc20 turnover, and suggest the intriguing possibility that the N-terminal Mad3 KEN box acts <italic>in trans</italic> as a Cdc20p destruction signal during early mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Mad3 overexpression causes bi-orientation defects</title><p>We have demonstrated that Mad3p is degraded late in mitosis and G1 in a Cdh1-APC/C dependent manner. To understand why Mad3p is subject to such regulation we decided to analyse the effects of Mad3p overexpression.</p><p>We introduced extra copies of <italic>MAD3</italic> and the <italic>mad3-ken</italic> mutants, expressed from the <italic>MAD3</italic> promoter and integrated at the <italic>TRP1</italic> locus, into a strain containing a wild-type <italic>MAD3</italic> gene. Quantitative western blotting revealed that the strains shown expressed &#x0223c;4-fold the wild-type level of Mad3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), and we found that all of these strains were sensitive to benomyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Many transformants were analysed in this manner, and were found to have different expression levels of Mad3p (reflecting different copy numbers of integrated constructs). It was clear that increasing the level of Mad3p expression leads to increased benomyl sensitivity (data not shown).</p><p>Such sensitivity to anti-microtubule drugs could be for a number of reasons, including a defective spindle checkpoint response. We tested whether the strains with excess Mad3p could checkpoint arrest. Cells were pre-synchronised in G1 with alpha-factor, then washed and released into nocodazole-containing media. Analysis of GFP-marked chromosomes indicated that all strains were able to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion relatively efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). Yet, when we scored the same cultures for viability it was clear that, even though they were able to arrest, they died after 2&#x02013;4 hours in nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). We reasoned that the drug sensitivity might be due to an inability to recover properly from the checkpoint arrest. Therefore we quantitated the ability of strains overexpressing <italic>MAD3</italic> to accurately segregate chromosomes in the anaphase following the checkpoint arrest. To do this we pre-synchronised cultures in G1 with alpha factor, released into nocodazole media for 3 hours, and then washed out the nocodazole. We then imaged both spindle poles (SPC42-mCherry) and GFP-marked chromosomes during the ensuing anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). This experiment demonstrated that the Mad3p-overexpressing strains exhibit chromosome mis-segregation (25&#x02013;40&#x00025; for chromosome V), following release from the checkpoint arrest. Such a level of chromosome mis-segregation is significant enough to explain their benomyl-sensitivity.</p><p>To test whether this chromosome mis-segregation was due to a defect in chromosome bi-orientation we employed a strain containing a GFP-marked centromere. This strain has <italic>CDC20</italic> under control of the <italic>MET</italic> promoter, expresses the GFP-Tet repressor and has CENIV &#x0201c;GFP-marked&#x0201d; with an array of Tet operators, and has its SPBs marked with Spc42-tomato. If a replicated chromosome is bi-oriented at metaphase two GFP spots will be observed because the sister centromeres will be pulled apart (centromere breathing) by opposing forces from the two spindle poles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-He1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Mono-oriented or unattached chromosomes are not pulled to both poles simultaneously and display a single spot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Cells were synchronised with alpha factor in G1, and then Cdc20p was depleted by the addition of methionine to the media. Cells were then released from G1 into media containing nocodazole for two hours, enabling them to progress to metaphase. The nocodazole was then washed out, allowing cells to re-form a spindle, but <italic>CDC20</italic> was still repressed to maintain the metaphase arrest. Cells were fixed at 15 minute time points after nocodazole removal and scored for bi-orientation. An excess of Mad3p led to significant bi-orientation defects during recovery from checkpoint arrest: only 25&#x02013;30&#x00025; of cells displayed paired spots after 90 minutes, compared to 50&#x02013;60&#x00025; for control strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). This effect was not significantly affected by mutation of either KEN box (data not shown). Thus, overexpression of Mad3p perturbs chromosome bi-orientation and leads to significant chromosome loss during recovery from checkpoint arrest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have identified the N-terminal Mad3p KEN box as a critical link in MCC formation. Interestingly its mutation not only abolishes the MCC and spindle checkpoint function, but also leads to a striking mitotic stabilisation of the Cdc20p checkpoint effector. The same KEN box then appears to act as a Mad3p degron during late mitosis/G1, and we have shown that this Mad3p turnover is dependent on Cdh1-APC/C activity. Overexpression of Mad3p leads to anti-microtubule drug sensitivity, but this is not due to an inactive checkpoint. Rather, excess Mad3p induces bi-orientation defects, which lead to high levels of chromosome mis-segregation during recovery from spindle checkpoint arrest. Thus, the levels of both Cdc20p and Mad3p are subject to careful regulation, and this is important to ensure efficient checkpoint function and high fidelity chromosome segregation.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Mad3p is degraded in a Cdh1-APC/C dependent manner</title><p>It has recently been shown that the Mps1 protein kinase is an APC/C substrate.

Mps1p turnover was shown to be dependent on its three D boxes, on Cdc20p in anaphase, and on Cdh1p in G1.</p><p>Here we have demonstrated that Mad3p is another component of the spindle checkpoint that is degraded in an APC/C dependent manner. We do not believe that Mad3p degradation is critical to turn off the spindle checkpoint, although it is possible that it could play a role in checkpoint adaptation, and this is currently being explored. Our data is consistent with Mad3p being a Cdh1-APC/C substrate and the N-terminal KEN box acting as a degron. Further experiments are needed to prove this, such as <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assays demonstrating that Mad3p is poly-ubiquitinated by the APC/C in a KEN30-dependent fashion. We believe that the major role of its N-terminal KEN box is to enable Mad3p to bind to Cdc20p. This Mad3p-Cdc20p interaction, which is also dependent on Mad2p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Hardwick1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, is critical for the action of both Mad3p and Mad2p as <italic>in vivo</italic> anaphase inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The Mad3p KEN boxes are both required for spindle checkpoint function</title><p>We have demonstrated that both of the conserved KEN boxes are important for Mad3p checkpoint function. The N-terminal KEN box is required for MCC formation and for Cdc20p turnover in early mitosis, as well as for Mad3p turnover in G1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). It has previously been shown that the two destruction boxes found in Cdc20p are not required for its turnover in early mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Pan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggests a model in which the Mad3 N-terminal KEN box acts <italic>in trans</italic> to regulate Cdc20p turnover in mitosis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). This could simply be because this KEN box is required for MCC formation, or because it acts <italic>in trans</italic> as a degron. Further work is necessary to distinguish these possibilities. Lack of other checkpoint proteins also affects Cdc20p turnover (data not shown and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Pan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>), but lack of Mad3p has the most stabilising effect. These mutations are all known to affect the level of the MCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Hardwick1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Such data suggests that it is a Mad3p-Cdc20p complex, most likely the MCC, which is recognised by the APC/C. Presumably Cdc20p is poly-ubiquitinated more efficiently than Mad3p, and this leads to its relatively short mitotic half-life (&#x0223c;7 minutes for Cdc20p, rather than &#x0223c;90 minutes for Mad3p, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p><p>There is significantly more Mad2p-Cdc20p in budding yeast extracts than there is MCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Poddar1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the role of the Mad2p-Cdc20p complex remains unclear, as it appears to be insufficient to act as an anaphase inhibitor <italic>in vivo</italic>. In many systems including fission yeast, Mad2p overexpression is sufficient for Cdc20p inhibition and metaphase arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-He2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. However, whilst this arrest is independent of most checkpoint components it does require Mad3p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Millband1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Mad2p is necessary for Mad3p to bind stably to Cdc20p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Hardwick1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, and we have now shown that the N-terminal KEN box of Mad3p is also critical for Cdc20p binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). At present we are unable to functionally separate MCC formation from Cdc20p turnover, as both are abolished in <italic>mad3-ken30</italic> and neither are affected in <italic>mad3-ken296</italic>. Until such separation is achieved we are unable to assess the relative importance of these two pathways for Cdc20p inhibition. Interestingly, in the fission yeast <italic>S.pombe,</italic> whilst Slp1 is turned over in mitosis we find no evidence of Mad3p-dependence (<italic>our unpublished data</italic>). To our knowledge this has not been analysed in vertebrate systems, and it is possible that the checkpoint-dependent regulation of Cdc20p levels is specific to budding yeast mitosis.</p><p>However, the general importance of the N-terminal KEN box for checkpoint functions of Mad3p is well conserved. We have analysed equivalent <italic>ken</italic> mutations in <italic>S. pombe</italic> Mad3p with very similar results. Once again, the N-terminal KEN box is required for MCC formation, and the C-terminal motif is not (KGH, <italic>manuscript submitted</italic>). One striking difference from the budding yeast work presented here, is that in <italic>S. pombe</italic> we detect a stable interaction between Mad3p, Mad2p and mitotic APC/C. We found that this APC/C interaction is dependent on the N-terminal Mad3p KEN box and on Slp1p. We have found no evidence for stable Madp-APC/C binding in our budding yeast studies (data not shown, and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Camasses1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates a large BubR1-APC/C complex has recently been described in checkpoint-arrested cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Morrow1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Formation of that complex was shown to be dependent on an active checkpoint signal, and to be promoted by Bub1 and Aurora B kinase activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Morrow1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. It will be interesting to see whether the BubR1-APC/C interaction is dependent on the N-terminal KEN box of BubR1. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments with vertebrate proteins have demonstrated that BubR1 has multiple Cdc20 binding interactions, that this binding is dependent on Mad2, and that mutation of the N-terminus of BubR1 can abrogate checkpoint arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Davenport1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. These data are entirely consistent with our findings, and we conclude that the importance of the N-terminus of Mad3/BubR1, for MCC formation and checkpoint function, is conserved from yeast to human.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Mad3p overproduction</title><p>The vertebrate Emi1 protein has recently been proposed to act as a pseudo-substrate inhibitor of the APC/C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Miller1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. We tested whether <italic>in vivo</italic> Mad3p overproduction is sufficient to compete with Securin for Cdc20-APC/C. If so, Mad3p overexpression should induce a metaphase arrest. This was not the case, which argues against Mad3p acting as a simple pseudo-substrate inhibitor.</p><p>Why is Mad3p subject to Cdh1-APC/C dependent turnover? We found that a four-fold over-expression of wild-type Mad3p (and of the <italic>ken</italic> mutants) was sufficient to perturb mitosis following anti-microtubule drug treatment. Note, we carefully chose transformants expressing the same level of Mad3p, so any stabilising effect of the <italic>ken30</italic> mutation would not be apparent in our overexpression analysis. We provide evidence that the chromosome mis-segregation observed was due to defects in chromosome bi-orientation following spindle checkpoint arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000342-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). RNAi studies have suggested that loss of human BubR1 perturbs the regulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments, possibly by interfering with Aurora B kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Lampson1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that Mad3p over-expression could also perturb Ipl1p (aurora) activities at budding yeast kinetochores. Alternatively, excess Mad3p could perturb Bub1p functions at kinetochores, most simply through competition for Bub3p. Experiments are underway to test such possibilities, but it is clear that Mad3p levels need to be carefully regulated to ensure efficient bi-orientation and checkpoint signalling. We believe that these Mad3p over-expression findings are relevant to human disease. Loss of BubR1 checkpoint function is lethal in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Wang1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, and biallelic BubR1 mutations are associated with childhood cancer and aneuploidy in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Hanks1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it has recently been shown that Mad2 overexpression promotes aneuploidy and tumorigenesis in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Sotillo1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Our Mad3p studies suggest that overexpression, or dominant mutation, of human BubR1 could perturb checkpoint function or chromosome biorientation and thereby lead to the generation of aneuploidy.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that the conserved Mad3p KEN boxes are major determinants of checkpoint-effector (Cdc20p) interaction. We propose that these molecular interactions are central to the mode(s) of Cdc20p-APC/C inhibition by the spindle checkpoint. It is now time to integrate these Mad3/BubR1 findings with the checkpoint models that have been generated from structural studies of Mad2, Mad1 and Cdc20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Yu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-DeAntoni1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent advances in the structural analysis of the Bub proteins are a significant step in this direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Larsen1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Larsen2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we have shown that the N-terminal Mad3 KEN box is an important determinant of the stability of both Mad3p and Cdc20p. The levels of both of these proteins are very carefully regulated in yeast. If there is too much Cdc20p the spindle checkpoint is unable to efficiently inhibit it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Hwang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000342-Pan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, and if there is too much Mad3p cells display bi-orientation defects.
