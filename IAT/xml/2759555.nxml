While the precise role of neurogenesis in cognition has been debated intensely, comparatively few studies have addressed the mechanisms linking environmental exposures to cellular and behavioral outcomes. Here we show that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling mediates the effects of exercise on neurogenesis and cognition in the adult hippocampus. Elective exercise reduces levels of hippocampal BMP signaling before and during its promotion of neurogenesis and learning. Transgenic mice with decreased BMP signaling or wild type mice infused with a BMP inhibitor both exhibit remarkable gains in hippocampal cognitive performance and neurogenesis, mirroring the effects of exercise. Conversely, transgenic mice with increased BMP signaling have diminished hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired cognition. Exercise exposure does not rescue these deficits, suggesting that reduced BMP signaling is required for environmental effects on neurogenesis and learning. Together, these observations show that BMP signaling is a fundamental mechanism linking environmental exposure with changes in cognitive function and cellular properties in the hippocampus.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="22"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural stem cells and their progenitor cell progeny persist throughout life in two specialized niches of the adult brain: the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles.

The DG is comprised of tightly packed, radially organized granule cells, similar to the layers of the cerebellum and neocortex also receiving ascending input from other brain regions. Dentate granule cells receive cholinergic transverse septal fibers from the basal forebrain, glutamatergic medial/lateral perforant path projections from the entorhinal cortex, and GABAergic input from medial septum and local interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Scharfman1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. DG granule cells integrate these signals, and send their own mossy fiber axons to the CA3 region of the hippocampus as part of the classical DG-CA3-CA1 tri-synaptic pathway. Granule cells vastly outnumber the fibers they receive, creating very sparse firing patterns feeding into the rest of the hippocampal circuit. This increases the discriminative capacity of the network, since minor differences amongst similar patterns become separated or &#x0201c;orthogonalized&#x0201d; in their coding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Becker1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Aimone1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Such a lag period suggests a mechanism in which regulation of a signaling pathway initiates cellular changes that may then support behavioral adaptations. To establish whether BMP signaling is regulated by exercise, and could be an activity-dependent determinant of learning and neurogenesis, we compared the time course for changes in the levels of hippocampal BMP signaling molecules, cellular proliferation and cognitive performance. We exposed separate groups of 2 month old C57Bl/6 mice to running wheels for 0,2,4,7 or 10 days. For each exposure group, we used qRT-PCR to measure levels of mRNA for BMP4 and noggin, the primary BMP effectors in the hippocampus. Since changes in mRNA levels do not directly indicate changes in functional signaling proteins, we performed Western blot analysis of BMP4 and noggin proteins in separate groups of mice exposed to running for 0,4,7,10 or 14 days. We also measured levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as a marker for changes in rates of cell division. To determine the temporal association between changes in BMP signaling and cognitive performance, we evaluated Y-maze scores for spontaneous alternation behavior in each group of mice.</p><p>Exercise improved Y-maze performance in most mice by the 7<sup>th</sup> day of exposure, with further increases after 10 days for all mice tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) (p&#x0003c;.01). After only 2 days of running, BMP4 mRNA was reduced to less than half of na&#x000ef;ve levels and it remained decreased for all subsequent time-points (p&#x0003c;.01). Levels of noggin mRNA did not change until 4 days, but had increased 1.5-fold by 7&#x02013;10 days of exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) (p&#x0003c;.001). Thus mRNA for BMP4 was decreased and mRNA for noggin was increased before and during changes in Y-maze performance. After normalization to actin loading controls, densitometric levels of BMP4 protein were reduced by 35&#x00025; after 4 days, and by nearly 50&#x00025; after 7 days exposure, where they remained thereafter. Relative to na&#x000ef;ve levels, hippocampal noggin protein significantly increased by 36&#x00025; after 4 days and remained elevated by 50&#x00025; after 7 days. Hippocampal levels of PCNA were increased above baseline by 39&#x00025; by 7 days, and remained elevated for longer running durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g001">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). This increase in PCNA occurred after changes in levels of noggin and BMP4, but before gains in Y-maze performance. Running also reduced hippocampal levels of the marker of activated BMP signal transduction, pSMAD1/5/8, and particularly decreased the number of cells with strong nuclear (npSMAD1/5/8) staining in the SGZ, further supporting the spatial concurrence of these findings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Thus, exercise decreased production of BMP4 and increased levels of the BMP inhibitor, noggin, in advance of gains in cell proliferation and Y-maze performance. The complementary changes in levels of BMP4 and noggin suggest a conserved physiological process by which down-regulation of BMP signaling precedes the effects of environmental exposure on the cellular properties of the neurogenic niche.</p><fig id="pone-0007506-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007506.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Elective exercise decreases BMP4 and increases noggin expression in the hippocampus.</title><p>Separate groups of C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to running wheels for 0, 2, 4, 7, 10 or 14 days (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8 per exposure group).

Since constitutive knockout or overexpression of BMP4 has major developmental consequences, we placed expression of BMP4 or its inhibitor, noggin, under temporal and tissue-specific control of the promoter for neuron specific enolase (NSE) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Bonaguidi1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Gomes1">&#x0005b;89&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Guha1">&#x0005b;90&#x0005d;</xref>.

To determine the effects of BMP signaling on the SGZ niche, we developed a technique to examine pairs of markers for cell division and progenitor identity, with respect to progression through time and the SGZ lineage, in NSE-noggin, WT running, WT na&#x000ef;ve and NSE-BMP4 mice. The thymidine analogs, chloro-deoxyuridine (CldU) or iodo-deoxyuridine (IdU), were administered at separate times to label cell division before or after exposure to exercise or standard conditions (outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). CldU and IdU are incorporated during DNA synthesis and are labeled by specific antibodies equivalently to BrdU. SGZ cell lineage identity was also labeled with Sox2 or GFAP to mark neural stem cells (NSCs), nestin to mark early progenitors, doublecortin (Dcx) to mark neuroblasts and young neurons, or NeuN to mark mature neurons. All slides were labeled using paired combinations of markers for earlier/later lineage identity and for CldU/IdU birth-dating.

This period between the primer and the start of trial-by-trial training thus requires the rapid adaptation to a novel target and the extinction of a previously rewarded location.

This controls for differences in initial performance seen in other parts of the experiment due to primer learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>). NSE-noggin mice likewise had better daily scores for the latency and the distance traveled to find the hidden platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g005">Fig. 5B&#x02013;D</xref>), while NSE-BMP4 mice were impaired relative to wild type. Because the learning curves for the search times and search distances overlap within each strain, the search velocity did not differ between mice (as also seen on the visible platform control test). Slopes of trial-by-trial learning curves for each day indicate that spatial reference learning was also improved in NSE-noggin mice, but impaired in NSE-BMP4 animals relative to controls. On days 1 and 2, search latency decreased by 49&#x00025; and 45&#x00025; from trial 1&#x02013;4 for NSE-noggin mice, compared with 24&#x00025; and 37&#x00025; for wild type, and 10&#x00025; and 2&#x00025; for NSE-BMP4 mice, irrespective of their initial scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>). Yet by days 4 and 5, trial-by-trial reference learning was improved in NSE-BMP4 mice despite persistent impairments in adaptive learning on the first trial. Thus, the striking gain or loss of functional ability to refine a spatiotemporal performance construct or to adapt to novel episodic information do not depend on each other in the NSE-noggin or NSE-BMP4 mice. In particular, measures of adaptive learning focused on DG processing functions are also more affected by BMP manipulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0007506-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007506.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>BMP signaling regulates multiple aspects of hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance on the water maze test.</title><p>Mice were trained on a water maze task requiring daily adjustment to a new target location.

Both measures indicate memory of the target location, yet differences in the two scores can also suggest the refinement of learning behaviors later in the trial.

We performed a battery of general behavioral tasks including startle/reactivity, rotorod, spontaneous running, activity level and balance beam tests. On the rotorod test for motor ability and learning, all mice showed similar initial performance, indicating equal stamina and coordination. Likewise all mice showed similar learning curves across three additional trials performed at 1-hour intervals, suggesting equivalent motor learning abilities and global response to behavioral training (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s006">Fig. S6A</xref>). When given access to running wheels, all groups learned to use the wheels equivalently and ran similar distances thereafter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s006">Fig. S6B</xref>). This assures the findings in exercise experiments are not explained by differences in the distance run. However studies in C57Bl/6 mice show that running distance varies little between individuals and is not a strong predictor of changes in neurogenesis and learning once above a certain threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-vanPraag1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

To test directly whether exercise and BMP signaling have opposite effects on SGZ lineage properties, we exposed groups of WT and NSE-BMP4 mice to running wheels or standard housing conditions, bounded by CldU/IdU labeling as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Since cell labeling with CldU occurred before exercise or na&#x000ef;ve treatment, differences in CldU&#x0002b; cell counts signify the effects of the ensuing treatment on cell survival, differentiation or subsequent division. Because IdU labeling co-terminates with running exposure, differences in co-labeling for IdU and markers of cell identity represent the effects of exercise on cell cycle reentry at specific points along the neural progenitor lineage. In contrast to WT mice, exposure of NSE-BMP4 mice to running did not increase levels of cell proliferation (IdU&#x0002b;), propagation of recently divided cells (CldU&#x0002b;), generation of new neurons (Dcx&#x0002b;), or the stem-like morphology of GFAP&#x0002b; early progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g006">Fig. 6A&#x02013;I</xref>). Running and na&#x000ef;ve NSE-BMP4 mice both had very low levels of doublecortin expression, with no differences in co-labeling for CldU or IdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g006">Fig. 6G&#x02013;I</xref>). Running exposure in NSE-BMP4 mice also failed to increase the expression of Sox2, nestin, or the co-labeling of Sox2&#x0002b; cells with CldU or IdU, as seen in WT animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). Exercise had little additional pro-neurogenic effect in NSE-noggin mice (data not shown), consistent with the saturation of running-induced BMP changes by transgenic over-production. Analysis of cells co-labeled with CldU and NeuN indicates the effects of running on the survival and integration of new cells after their terminal mitosis. Increased BMP signaling reduced the overall number of cells that divided, left the NPC pool, and began to express NeuN 10 days later (CldU&#x0002b;NeuN&#x0002b;). However it did not block the known effects of exercise to promote the survival and neuronal maturation of such cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). There was no difference between strains or exposures in the span or density of NeuN&#x0002b; cells across the GCL.

To determine if the persistence of impairment in NSE-BMP4 mice could be due to the degree of NPC depletion, rather than the loss of an activity-dependent regulatory mechanism, we performed correlation analysis between baseline proliferation levels and cognitive performance within groups of NSE-BMP4 mice.

This approach mitigated many of the systemic side effects often seen with peripheral administration of anti-mitotic drugs, along with production of toxic metabolic intermediates by the liver. It also allowed much lower overall dosing, since attaining the target CNS dose doesn't require large systemic doses filtering through the blood-brain barrier. Two groups of P60 male NSE-noggin mice were implanted subdermally with Alzet osmotic pumps connected to indwelling intraventricular cannulae to deliver AraC or vehicle over the course of a 15-day experiment.

Noggin infusion diminished the number of strongly ID3&#x0002b; cells across the SGZ, and especially in the area of recently divided IdU&#x0002b; cells, confirming its actions in the SGZ niche. To clarify the hippocampal cell populations affected by noggin-induced ID3 reduction, we analyzed cells co-labeled with ID3 and CldU, IdU or Dcx. Levels of ID3 were significantly decreased in cells adjacent to those expressing IdU and in cells double-positive for IdU and Dcx, consistent with a role promoting cell division along the SGZ lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s014">Fig. S14G</xref>). ID3 was not reduced in CldU&#x0002b; cells that had divided 10 days prior to histological analysis; suggesting low ID3 levels denote a cell's capacity for cell cycle reentry, rather than its NPC identity or neuronal differentiation. We also found that noggin infusion appeared to act through endogenous mechanisms linking ID3 and cell cycle events. Noggin only altered the frequency of ID3low/IdU&#x0002b; cells at the normal sites of cell division, rather than the degree of ID3 reduction or the location of these cells, compared with vehicle treatment. There was little effect of infusion on ID3 expression in cells of the outer third of the GCL or in other hippocampal regions. Further studies will continue to specify the cellular targets of altered BMP signaling, and comparison with hippocampus-specific behavior will provide additional insight.</p><p>Since infusion of noggin reproduced the effects of exercise and transgenic over-expression on hippocampal neurogenesis, we next tested for congruent effects on cognitive behavior. Y-maze testing on the third day of infusion, before the presumed onset of SGZ cellular changes, showed no differences between infusion groups. However, noggin infusion produced significant gains in NOR or Y-maze tests performed later during the infusion, at the time of CldU or IdU labeling for increased proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g008">Fig. 8J,K</xref>). Infusion of AraC or noggin&#x0002b;AraC impaired performance on these DG-centered tasks relative to vehicle controls. AraC also blocked adaptive learning on a MWM task performed between the times of CldU-IdU labeling, irrespective of co-treatment with noggin. However the loss of cell proliferation did not prevent pan-hippocampal spatial reference learning on the same task (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s012">Fig. S12</xref>). Noggin infusion without AraC produced remarkable gains in water maze learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g008">Fig. 8L</xref>), reproducing the cognitive phenotype seen in transgenic mice. As in the AraC infusion study, all mice performed equivalently on control tests for hippocampus-independent learning and motor behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s012">Fig. S12</xref>). Thus, treatment with a single protein was sufficient to reproduce the effects of exercise on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and to promote hippocampus-dependent cognition on a variety of measures. The intersection of our detailed behavioral analysis with multiple methods to manipulate BMP activity and measure its effects on the NPC lineage supports a novel and crucial role for BMP signaling in the effects of exercise on neurogenesis and cognition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Exposure to exercise or environmental enrichment is known to regulate the cellular properties of the hippocampal neurogenic niche and to improve hippocampus-dependent cognition.

However the concordance between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> findings for BMP-mediated regulation of neurogenic potential in hippocampal NPCs is striking. Cultured SGZ progenitors express both BMP ligands and receptors, suggesting a paracrine signaling mechanism directly within the hippocampus.

Culture conditions mimicking neural activity reduce markers of BMP signaling while increasing the size, number and neurogenic potential of neurospheres from the SGZ but not the SVZ. Thus, BMP signaling appears to play a larger dynamic regulatory role in the SGZ than in the SVZ, consistent with the relatively greater effects of exercise therein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Bonaguidi2">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Brown1">&#x0005b;108&#x0005d;</xref>.

We measured levels of BMP signaling via changes noggin and BMP4, which are the main BMP ligand and inhibitor in the hippocampus and are noted functionally by their absolute protein level rather than their sub-cellular location. Levels of BMP4 were reduced and levels of noggin were increased within 4 days of running exposure&#x02013;well before subsequent changes in cell proliferation by day 7 and in behavior thereafter. qRT-PCR analysis mirrored changes in noggin and BMP4 proteins, and showed no compensatory changes in other BMP-related transcripts which cumulatively might mitigate our findings (data not shown). Immunostaining for pSMAD1/5/8 confirmed the cells and locations responding to BMP changes in the DG of WT mice exposed to exercise for 8 days relative to na&#x000ef;ve controls. Together these findings show that physical activity regulates hippocampal BMP signaling, and suggest that BMP alterations could underlie changes in hippocampal behavior or the cellular properties of the hippocampus during exercise. We therefore asked if manipulation of BMP signaling separately from its regulation by exposure to environmental stimuli could recapitulate the phenotypes produced by exercise.</p><p>To clarify the stages at which exercise and BMP signaling act on the SGZ niche, we developed a &#x0201c;dual time-point, dual lineage marker&#x0201d; paradigm for cell fate and lineage analysis. This allows us to analyze patterns of NPC subtype regulation in relation to changes in both a mature neuronal marker and behavioral outcomes. We found that exercise and inhibition of BMP signaling increased the incorporation of both CldU (given early during the experiment) and IdU (given toward the end) in multiple progenitor subtypes. Incorporation of IdU was increased in both early stem/progenitor cells, and in later precursors and neuroblasts. This indicates that exercise and noggin increased proliferation across the SGZ lineage: from quiescent multipotent progenitors (Sox2, GFAP or nestin&#x0002b; cells), to Dcx&#x0002b; species ontologically closer to functional integration. In fact, Dcx&#x0002b; progenitors already receive medial perforant path (MPP) input and project to interneurons linking the DG and CA3, even before the time of their terminal mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Ge2">&#x0005b;109&#x0005d;</xref>.

Remarkably, manipulation of this single pathway can either enhance or impair hippocampal cognitive functions and modulate the effects of exercise. Noggin infusion into adult wild type mice produced the same changes seen in the NSE-noggin animals, indicating that the phenotype of the transgenic mice does not stem from developmental changes. Noggin infusion also reproduced the temporal, histological and behavioral outcomes seen from exercise exposure. The bivalent behavioral phenotypes of the NSE-noggin and NSE-BMP4 mice were remarkably strong and consistent across an array of tests for hippocampus-dependent learning. While these findings differ from the mixed outcomes seen in prior studies, our experimental model focuses on the function and regulation of cell lineages in the DG, rather than the level of cell division required for continued spatiotemporal learning. However, changes in the levels of neurogenesis in our experiments are at least comparable with other reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Saxe2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Singer1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Bergami1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Zhang1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Our behavioral tests entailed enhanced ethological sensitivity, habituation periods and internal controls for confounding factors. No differences were seen between groups of mice for non-specific motor behavior, activity level, arousal or attention in any of the experiments.</p><p>It is especially notable that so many aspects of hippocampus-dependent cognition were enhanced in the noggin-infused and transgenic mice, while other hippocampus-independent behaviors were unaffected. Performance on the Y-maze involves a form of hippocampal spatial memory that does not require task-based rule learning or recall. The dependence on distal cues to discriminate which identical arm is occupied and which should be chosen next in the sequence suggests DG-mediated processing functions. Fear conditioning and NOR/NLR tests utilize separate encoding and recall exposures to measure learning and memory across a span of time. The modified water maze paradigm is designed to test both the recollection of the platform location and the overall task rules, as well as the integration of novel episodic information within this paradigm. Thus, successful maze performance requires synchronized encoding, retrieval and discrimination of relevant spatial information. This behavioral procedure recapitulates the information processing function of simultaneous pattern separation and pattern completion by the DG-CA3 circuit. Likewise, the ability to distinguish novel spatial features on the NLR test may highlight the role of the DG in spatial coincidence detection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Lee2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-GoodrichHunsaker1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Leutgeb2">&#x0005b;102&#x0005d;</xref>. Discrimination of object features on the NOR test is also proposed to be an extension of DG-centered information coding, with additional processing by CA3 and CA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Lee2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Hunsaker1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-OCallaghan1">&#x0005b;95&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, on measures of spatial reference learning and probe trial search strategies, which are less dependent on the presumed functions of the DG, NSE-BMP4 mice displayed intact but delayed learning abilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s005">S5</xref>). Likewise, AraC infusion had little affect on daily trial-by-trial MWM scores for spatial reference learning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s012">Fig. S12</xref>), but caused notable impairment in tasks focused on DG processing functions. The findings that exogenous or transgenic manipulation of BMP signaling and niche properties produced such strong, bidirectional effects on tests requiring discrimination and integration of novel information suggest that BMP signaling plays a central role in hippocampus-dependent cognition.</p><p>We next sought to determine whether the down-regulation of BMP signaling in the hippocampus is required for enhancement of hippocampal cognition and neurogenesis by exercise. Consistent with our hypothesis, running did not increase levels of SGZ cells expressing Sox2, nestin or Dcx in NSE-BMP4 mice. Nor did exercise promote cell division within each NPC subtype in mice over-expressing BMP4, as seen in WT controls. While NSE-BMP4 mice had reduced baseline proliferation levels, aged mice and other strains with similarly low initial levels of cell division still displayed robust gains in neurogenesis after exercise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Kempermann3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Thuret1">&#x0005b;92&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, NSE-BMP4 mice seem to lack an activity-dependent regulatory mechanism for cell cycle reentry, which persists in other animals irrespective of reductions in the substrate on which it acts. Further, baseline NPC counts were not correlated with cognitive test scores after running in individual NSE-BMP4 mice. This suggests that over-expression of BMP4 does not simply deplete a source used for other activity-dependent phenomena, but opposes a mechanism of regulation of SGZ lineage properties and functions during exercise. In fact, the effect of exercise to promote the survival and maturation of cells exiting the NPC pool and becoming NeuN&#x0002b; neurons was still present in these animals. Likewise, NSE-noggin mice, which might have greater cellular stores for other mechanisms but a relative saturation of the BMP modulation seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007506-g001">Figure 1</xref>, showed little additional benefit from running exposure. Constitutively high levels of BMP signaling also blocked improvements from exercise on Y-maze, NOR and NLR performance. However, the ability to regulate other activity-mediated signaling pathways was maintained, since we found that levels of BDNF were increased equally in NSE-BMP4 and wild type mice after exercise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007506.s010">Fig. S10</xref>). NSE-BMP4 mice also retained hippocampal functions less dependent on the DG. These results indicate that regulation of BMP signaling is both sufficient and necessary for the effects of exercise on hippocampal cognition and the cellular properties of the SGZ niche.</p><p>Other factors are also known to increase in the brain or in the general circulation during exercise and to influence levels of SGZ proliferation. VEGF and IGF-1 are produced largely outside the brain, yet may be involved in the regulation of hippocampal function by activity. Within the hippocampus, levels of mRNA for VEGF, IFG-1 or BDNF may be up-regulated during running, yet such findings have been inconsistent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Cao1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Fabel1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Ding1">&#x0005b;116&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Carro1">&#x0005b;119&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, only BDNF knockdown consistently causes impairments in na&#x000ef;ve mice. This suggests that BDNF may help to regulate levels of SGZ neurogenesis at baseline and during activity, but that IGF-1 and VEGF may prompt neurogenesis and learning only during exercise. Indeed, peripheral administration of blocking antibodies to VEGF and IGF-1 has no effect on these outcomes in na&#x000ef;ve mice. However BDNF, VEGF, and IGF-1 all have notable extra-hippocampal effects on synaptic plasticity, stabilization and release probability, and on cellular metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Messaoudi1">&#x0005b;127&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;132&#x0005d;</xref>. There is also much less evidence for the bi-directional regulation of cell cycle reentry and fate commitment by these factors than there is for their promotion of NPC survival later in the neuronal lineage. BMP signaling levels are regulated bi-directionally as part of both normal homeostasis and activity-dependent processes; and manipulation of these levels yields similar bi-directional effects on cell fate decisions and cognitive function in the hippocampus.</p><p>The functional relationship between neurogenesis and behavior remains controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Shors2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Saxe1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Saxe2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-BruelJungerman1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, and is not the focus of our experiments. Yet we found that intraventricular infusion of AraC virtually abolished the beneficial effects of reduced BMP signaling on hippocampus-dependent cognition. This suggests that the behavioral effects of noggin require mitotic progenitor cell populations in the neurogenic niche. Infusion directly into the ventricles improves the specificity of administration, and reduces concerns of systemic side effects which might confound experimental outcomes. Indeed, control tests did not indicate any changes in general well-being, motivation, motor performance or hippocampus-independent behavior between AraC- or vehicle-infused mice. Nor were there any general changes in other hippocampal structures, the thickness of the dentate granule cell layer above the SGZ, or the survival of previously divided (CldU&#x0002b;) cell populations. AraC likewise did not affect the numbers of cells expressing Sox2 or nestin, consistent with their relative quiescence. Thus, cognitive performance is associated more with cell progression through the neurogenic lineage and the number of new neurons than with the number of stem cells in the DG.</p><p>Infusion of noggin or noggin&#x0002b;AraC both reduced the expression of the BMP target gene ID3 in the SGZ, but only noggin increased hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive performance. In fact, infusion with noggin&#x0002b;AraC impaired learning equivalently to AraC infusion alone. This suggests that the behavioral benefits of reduced BMP signaling require ongoing cell proliferation in the adult brain. Noggin infusion reduced expression of BMP target genes directly in the SGZ, and improved hippocampus-dependent behaviors seen to require proliferative capabilities unique to the SGZ and SVZ. However actions outside the hippocampus can not be ruled out. To clarify the mechanism for the effects of noggin on neural function, we analyzed the point of action of BMP reduction within the DG using a novel system to measure temporal/lineage progression and cell signaling markers all within the same section. ID3 expression was reduced in and near cells labeled with IdU marking recent division, and even in later lineage species expressing Dcx at the time of their final divisions. However other Dcx&#x0002b; cells migrating out of the SGZ niche, and/or co-labeled with CldU marking past division, expressed increased levels of ID3. This suggests that reduced BMP signaling and ID3 expression are associated with localized increases in neurogenic potential and with cell cycle reentry of multiple NPC species along the SGZ lineage. It does not seem to designate a broad progenitor identity, or the survival and neuronal maturation of post-mitotic cells during neurogenesis. The morphology of GFAP&#x0002b; progenitor cells is another important indicator of BMP signaling levels and NSC potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Bonaguidi1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>. Noggin infusion promoted a radial, bipolar GFAP&#x0002b; cell type denoting reduced BMP effects in SGZ progenitors, as was also noted by ID3 expression levels. Yet only in the absence of AraC were these changes associated with increased proliferation, neurogenesis and hippocampal cognition. Further experiments will test the location and cell types responsible for the effects of BMP inhibition more directly.</p><p>The intersection of these findings with the results from the transgenic and exercise experiments above describes a central role for BMP signaling in the regulation of hippocampal cognition and the properties of the neurogenic niche. In particular, inhibition of BMP signaling appears to be both sufficient and necessary for the cellular and behavioral effects of exercise exposure focused on mitotic NPC populations and the information coding functions of the dentate gyrus. While no single result proves a direct causal relationship between exposure, time, signaling mechanism, location, cell type and function; our findings address multiple combinations of these factors in great detail. Their remarkable confluence and the striking cellular and behavioral phenotypes of the transgenic and noggin-infused animals all point to a novel and crucial role for BMP signaling in the cellular properties, function and physiological regulation of the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>The creation of the NSE-noggin and NSE-BMP4 transgenic mice was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Bonaguidi1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Gomes1">&#x0005b;89&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007506-Guha1">&#x0005b;90&#x0005d;</xref>.

Hippocampi from each mouse were collected in tubes containing 150 &#x000b5;l ice cold T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce) with 1X HALT protease inhibitors (Pierce) and were manually homogenized on ice with a plastic tissue pestle. The samples of cell lysate were then centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C at 2000 rpm for 10 min followed by 4000 rpm for 5 min and 6000 rpm for 1 min, and the supernatant was collected into a new tube on ice. Total protein concentration was quantified using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) and spetrophotometry. Protein samples were mixed with an equal volume of denaturing buffer and were boiled for 20 min. 55&#x02013;65 &#x000b5;g of total protein from each sample was then loaded onto a 4&#x02013;20&#x00025; Tris-HCl Ready Gel (Bio-Rad) such that each lane signified a unique animal. After electrophoresis and transfer to a Trans-Blot nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), membranes were washed in 1X TBST and then blocked in 5&#x00025; non-fat dry milk in TBST. After blocking, membranes were washed 3X and then incubated with antibodies for noggin (rabbit, 1&#x02236;3850; Chemicon), BMP4 (mouse, 1&#x02236;5000; Chemicon), PCNA (mouse, 1&#x02236;5000, BD), BDNF (rabbit, 1&#x02236;1000, Santa Cruz), synaptophysin (mouse, 1&#x02236;5000, Chemicon), PSD-95 (mouse, 1&#x02236;25,000; NeuroMab), and actin (goat, 1&#x02236;1000; Santa Cruz). Blots were then washed 3x, primary antibodies were labeled with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz), washed 3x, developed with Luminol chemiluminescent reagent (Santa Cruz) and exposed to photographic film. Films were scanned into a computer and analyzed by densitometry using Image J software. Measurements for band densitometry were normalized to actin loading controls for each sample. Statistical analysis was by ANOVA with Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc comparisons for the effects of running duration on protein densitometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>Mice were housed with exposure to running wheels, as above, for 0 (na&#x000ef;ve controls), 2, 4, 7, 10 or 14 days (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7&#x02013;10 per group). At the end of the exercise exposure, mice were tested for spontaneous alternation exploratory patterns on a radial Y-maze test of hippocampus-dependent spatial-sequential processing. Since this test consists of a single discreet exposure and involves no cognitive training, it is unlikely to have an impact on the other experimental measures. After testing, mice were euthanized and their hippocampi were collected as above into ice cold PBS under RNase-free conditions. RNA was prepared from whole hippocampi using an RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion) and was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the ThermoScript RT PCR System (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, and measurements of SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) fluorescent dye incorporation were used to calculate the critical threshold (CT) cycle number for noggin, BMP4 and GAPDH mRNA. A pilot study also measured transcript levels of BMP2, BMP7, BMP10, neurognesin and chordin. Primer sequences are available upon request. CT values were normalized to GAPDH for each animal. CT differences between na&#x000ef;ve and 2, 4, 7 or 10 day running groups were converted to log 2 values for fold change in mRNA and analyzed by ANOVA with Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>CldU and IdU</title><p>Injections occurred over the course of 10 days.

Brains were removed, post-fixed in 4&#x00025; PFA, dehydrated in 30&#x00025; sucrose in PBS, and rapidly frozen for sectioning on a Leica CM3050S cryostat. 10 &#x000b5;m coronal sections were mounted serially, 10 per slide, with successive slides representing the rostro-caudal progression through the hippocampus. Three slides were selected from each animal, balanced along the a-p axis within and between subjects, and the first and last sections were counted from each slide. This defines an objective stereological sampling method to quantify cellular data for each subject and account for internal trends and variability. Sections were processed for antigen retrieval by incubating in 10 mM sodium citrate pH 7.1 at 95&#x000b0;C for 20 min. After cooling for 30&#x02013;40 min, sections were washed in PBS, and were incubated in 2 N HCl at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 min and cooled to room temp for 10 min to expose epitopes in the DNA. After acid treatment, sections were neutralized in 0.1 M Borax pH 8.5 for 5 min, washed in PBS, blocked in 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum for 2 hours, washed again, and exposed to primary antibodies diluted in PBS with 1&#x00025; BSA and 0.25&#x00025; Triton X-100 overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Primary antibodies included CldU (rat anti-BrdU, 1&#x02236;250 Accurate); IdU (mouse anti-BrdU, 1&#x02236;250 Becton Dickinson); Sox2 (rabbit 1&#x02236;200 Chemicon); nestin (rabbit 1&#x02236;400 Abcam); GFAP (rabbit 1&#x02236;400 Dako); ID3 (rabbit 1&#x02236;100 Santa Cruz); NeuN (mouse 1&#x02236;500 Chemicon); pSMAD1/5/8 (rabbit 1&#x02236;100 Cell Signaling); and doublecortin (goat 1&#x02236;400 Santa Cruz). Sections were then washed in PBS and incubated for 2 hours with appropriate fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies (Alexa-Fluor-405/488/594/647; Molecular Probes) to visualize the primary antibodies. Finally, sections were washed, counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma), and mounted with cover slips using ProLong Gold reagent (Invitrogen). Unbiased stereological sampling of 2 sections from each of 3 slides per subject assured balanced and objective counts. The same 40X frame was selected for each section and the number of cells per field was counted using pre-defined, morphological and ultra-structural criteria. Data points from each field were used to determine the mean and variability of cell counts for each subject. We did not apply a conversion factor to extrapolate this data into counts per hippocampus, since normalized findings lose accuracy and validity in describing observed changes and variance in the outcome measures. Yet, readers preferring this convention may multiply the reported values by 500 (2 significant figures). Mean cell counts throughout the hippocampus from each animal were used as a single data point for one-way ANOVA (after tests for homogeneity of the set: <italic>cells x section x slide x animal</italic>). This strategy assures the normality of the data, and provides a more conservative analysis than ANOVA with repeated measures. Levels of pSMAD1/5/8 or ID3 expression were analyzed by densitometry of objectively selected regions using Image J software.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Morris water maze: apparatus and habituation</title><p>The water maze apparatus consisted of a circular pool 120 cm in diameter, a 10&#x000d7;10 cm escape platform, an array of extra-maze visual navigational cues hung from curtains surrounding the pool area and an overhead camera connected to a computer running video tracking software. Water within the pool was kept at 24&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C and was made opaque with non-toxic white tempura paint. During the week before maze training, mice were handled extensively and were habituated to the training room. Mice were also habituated to the pool components by placing their cage on the platform just above the waterline and allowing them to observe the testing arena while still warm and dry. On the third day before testing, mice were incrementally habituated to the pool and platform, which stood 1 cm above the waterline. Mice were taught to rest on the platform in this new environment, and to climb onto the platform from the water and into the experimenter's hand for return to their home cage. On the second day before training, the platform was submerged 0.75 cm below the waterline, but was marked with a 4&#x000d7;4&#x000d7;4 cm metal cube. Mice learned to rest on the submerged platform and the cube, and that they would be returned to their home cage after remaining on the platform for 10 sec. After 5 of these exposures, mice were allowed to rest for two hours and were then tested on a visually cued version of the water maze test (visible platform test). The submerged platform and visible cube marker were moved to a new location within the pool, and mice were tested for their ability to reach the platform from different starting points. Four search trials began from different starting positions, named N, E, S, W, in pseudo-random order for each mouse. The time to find the visually cued platform and the path traveled was recorded for each trial. On the final day before training, mice were placed on the submerged platform with the visible cue present. After 5 seconds, mice were nudged off the platform and allowed to climb back on. After an additional 5 seconds, the cue was removed, and mice were nudged into the water and immediately guided back to the platform where they were allowed to rest for 10 seconds before returning to their home cage. During 3&#x02013;4 following exposures, mice were placed directly onto the unmarked submerged platform for 5 seconds, were nudged off, and were allowed to swim until they regained the platform and rested for 10 seconds without guidance.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Morris water maze: training procedure</title><p>After the three days of habituation, NSE-BMP4, wild type and NSE-noggin mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10, 15, 10) began a 5-day course of training on a submerged platform version of the water maze. Each day, the target platform location was moved to a different quadrant within the pool, with the location on day 5 repeating that of day 1. Two hours before testing, mice were placed on the platform in its new location for 15 seconds as a &#x0201c;primer&#x0201d; exposure for the 4 subsequent training trials that day. To begin each trial, mice were placed in the water facing the wall at the N, E, S, or W starting locations, with the sequence arranged in pseudo-random order to avoid quadrant bias within groups. The 4 trials were spaced 15&#x02013;20 minutes apart: a span well outside the range of working memory for mice, and requiring the hippocampus for recall and learning. Each trial ended when the mouse climbed upon the target platform or after 60 seconds of search time. At the end of each trial (mice not finding the platform were guided to it), mice were allowed to rest on the platform for 10 seconds, reinforcing the associative pairing of location-reward. Mice were then dried off, returned to their home cage and monitored for recovery of warmth. Each trial was stopped with a pneumatic input device connected to a computer running Maze 2020 and HVS Image software. All trials were also recorded with HVS Image video tracking equipment, which measured parameters including path length, average speed and latency to platform. An additional experiment was conducted to control for the effect of initial performance on daily learning curves, and to measure acquisition of learning criteria using a series of &#x0201c;probe trial&#x0201d; tests. NSE-noggin, wild type, and NSE-BMP4 mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;11, 10, 11) received 3 days of habituation and visible platform testing, as in the primary experiment above, but were not exposed to the new platform location prior to the first trial on training day 1. After learning the task parameters on the first day, days 2&#x02013;5 contained an extra trial 60 minutes after the 4<sup>th</sup> training trial in which the hidden platform was removed from the pool. Mice searched throughout the pool for 60 seconds. The proportion of search-time spent in the former target quadrant and the number of &#x0201c;pass through&#x0201d; events over the former platform location during the first 15 seconds were recorded. All statistical analysis was by 2 or 3-way ANOVA for main effects of genotype, trial, or day on search latency/distance, followed by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc tests for multiple pair-wise comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Spontaneous alternation Y-maze</title><p>This is a hippocampus-dependent spatial working memory task which does not require any training, habituation of reinforcement. The task is designed to measure the efficiency of a mouse's exploration strategy in a new environment. The Y-maze consists of three radial arms measuring 60 cm in length, 18 cm deep, 4 cm wide at the bottom and 14 cm wide at the top, constructed of translucent acrylic, providing no distinguishing marks within the maze but allowing a view of the surrounding room. Thus, maze navigation requires hippocampus-dependent spatial-sequential guidance from extra-maze visual cues. Mice were placed into the end of one arm, and were allowed to explore the maze freely for 5 minutes. The sequence and total number of arms entered was recorded for each mouse. Arm entries were counted when a mouse's hind paws had completely left the central hub, and the mouse had taken two steps down the chosen arm. Re-entries into the same arm without completely leaving the central hub were not scored. The efficiency of exploration was measured counting the number of entry triads (any 3 consecutive arm entries) which contain entries into all three arms, divided by the total number of entry triads (total number of arms entered, minus 2). This number indicates the percentage of non-repeat arm entries, and ranges from 100&#x00025; for perfect alternation to 50&#x00025; for chance levels of performance. The outcome measure, &#x00025; alternation, is calculated as follows: <italic>&#x00025; alternation&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x0005b;(triads with 3 unique arm entries)/(total entries&#x02212;2)&#x0005d;&#x000d7;100</italic>. To control for masking of true alternation by an &#x0201c;always turn right/left&#x0201d; arm choice strategy, a pilot study measured perseveration by returning the mouse to the starting position after making the first arm choice. On the following arm choice, choosing the third un-entered arm indicated an alternation-based exploration strategy. Statistical analysis was by ANOVA with Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc tests for pair-wise comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Novel object recognition and novel location recognition tests</title><p>Mice were habituated to the testing arena, consisting of an open, white 35&#x000d7;50&#x000d7;25 cm plastic tub for a 5 min exposure 3 times a day for two days before testing. On the day of testing, mice were placed in the open arena and allowed to explore for 1 minute. Mice were returned to their home cage, the arena was cleaned, and two identical objects were placed into the field in bilateral, mirror image orientation to the mouse's starting position at the front and center of the field. A pilot study was conducted to find a set of objects which appeared to be non-threatening and equally interesting to mice. Upon re-introduction to the field with the two identical objects, mice were allowed to investigate the arena for a cumulative 30 seconds of object-exploration time. Exploration was defined as active examination in which the mouse was sniffing, touching or scrutinizing an object, and not merely sitting in its vicinity or rearing up against it. Cumulative exploration time for each object, and the number and duration of individual exploring events, were recorded using Stopwatch Plus software. After this exposure trial, mice were returned to their home cage for a given delay period, and the arena and objects were cleaned with 70&#x00025; EtOH to remove all olfactory cues. For the novel object recognition test, one of the familiar objects was replaced with a novel object, and mice were re-introduced to the arena after 1.5, 3 or 14 hours, with no mouse tested twice. For the novel location recognition test, one of the familiar objects was moved to a new location within the arena, and mice were re-introduced for the memory trial after 2.5 hours. During the recall trial, mice were again allowed to explore the arena for a cumulative 30 seconds of object-exploration time, and each exploratory event was recorded. Mice have a natural predilection for new items in their environment, so the percentage of time at the new object or location indicates the mouse's degree of memory for the familiar object or location. Statistical analysis was by 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc comparisons for the effects of genotype on object/location recognition for multiple delay time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Fear conditioning</title><p>Male, 60&#x02013;70 day old NSE-noggin, wild type and NSE-BMP4 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9&#x02013;10 per group) were tested using a computer-controlled activity monitor and tone/shock generator (TSE, Bad Homberg, Germany). On the first day of testing, mice were exposed to a Plexiglas chamber (35&#x000d7;20&#x000d7;20 cm with a wire shock grid floor (stainless steel bars, 3 mm diameter, spaced 9 mm apart) for 3 minutes. This chamber was contained inside a second, sound-attenuated chamber (58&#x000d7;30&#x000d7;27 cm) with a gray interior, a 12-W light source and a speaker (Conrad, KT-25-DT). At the end of the 3 minute simple exposure, mice were played a 75 dB, 10 kHz tone for 30 seconds, during the last 2 seconds of which they received a 0.7 mA constant current foot shock. During these exposures to the chamber, tone and shock, the activity level (cm/s) for each mouse was recorded by an infrared beam array detector. After 24 hours, mice were tested for contextual and cued conditioning to the chamber and tone. For contextual conditioning, mice were re-exposed to the training chamber for 3 minutes without tone or shock, and were recorded for stereotyped freezing behavior and general activity level. Afterwards, mice were re-assessed for baseline activity levels, and then tested for cued conditioning to the tone stimulus in a novel context. This environment resembled the training chamber, but had a20-W light source, a solid white floor, and was cleaned with 1&#x00025; acetic acid. General activity levels were measured for 60 seconds; then mice were exposed to the 10 kHz tone for 3 minutes and scored for freezing to the cued stimulus. As with the measurements for freezing to contextual stimuli, behavior was scored by sampling every 10 seconds, for a total of 18 measurements. Statistical analysis was by 1-way ANOVA with Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc tests for the effects of genotype on freezing behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Rotorod test</title><p>Mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9&#x02013;10 per group) received 4 trial of testing on a rotorod device (Med Associates), beginning at 4 rpm and accelerating to 40 rpm over 4 minutes.

Mice were placed on the dowel, 20 cm from its end, 40 cm from the edge of the home cage and were scored for falls, latency to return to the cage opening and latency to return to the cage floor. Each trial lasted until the mouse fell or successfully returned to the home cage. Falls and failures to climb down to the cage floor were both scored as a latency of 90 seconds, yet both events were rare. Mice were tested for 6 trials, spaced 60 minutes apart.

Using sterotactic guidance, a 1 mm cranial defect was drilled &#x02212;0.4 mm and 1 mm lateral to bregma. The dura was opened using a 25-guage needle and the Alzet brain infusion cannula was placed within the lateral ventricle. An Alzet micro-osmotic pump (#1002), pre-loaded with the factor/drug, and attached to the cannula with a 1 cm plastic catheter was implanted into the subcutaneous pocket prior to insertion of the cannula into the ventricle. Each pump delivered noggin (R&#x00026;D) at 50 ng/&#x000b5;l or AraC (2&#x00025; Sigma) for 14 days at a rate of 0.25 &#x000b5;l/hr. Mice show full behavioral and functional recovery very soon after surgery. Infusion was performed in conjunction with cell labeling and cognitive testing as described above. CldU or IdU were given in the drinking water, rather than by injection, for 2 days at the beginning or end of the 10-day paradigm for cell labeling and behavioral testing in order to minimize handling and damage to the pump. Pilot studies confirmed similar cell labeling for both delivery methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4o"><title>Statistical analysis, cell counts, stereology</title><p>All statistics were by Student's 2-tailed t-test or by single or multiple ANOVA with Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc tests for multiple pair-wise comparisons using StatView software. For experiments involving many factors, F tests derived from multiple ANOVA were used to determine the main effect of single or combined variables in describing the changes and variance of the outcome measures. Quantification of histological outcomes proceeded from the null hypothesis that intervention groups would not differ bi-directionally from normal physiological controls. Cells per 40X high power field from coronal sections balanced along the a-p axis were counted for each animal and were compiled directly to obtain data points for analysis and comparison. Sections were selected objectively from each of 3 slides stereologically balanced throughout the hippocampus from each of 4 subjects per group. After testing the normality and homogeneity of the set of counts within and between subjects, the mean count per mouse was used for all group-wise comparisons. This strategy uses stereologic principles&#x02014;up to the point of extrapolation&#x02014;to account for the data and variability within each comparison; and assures the validity and scaling of both normal, control values and the changes from baseline observed in experimental groups. Counts were performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M epifluorescent microscope and Axiovision software with appropriate blinding throughout.</p></sec><sec id="s4p"><title>Blinding</title><p>The experimenter was kept blind to the genotype and treatment for all states of data recording, transfer and analysis.

(B) For probe tests, an additional cohort of NSE-noggin, wild type and NSE-BMP4 mice received an extra test with the target platform removed 60 minutes after the 4th target trial on training days 2&#x02013;5. Upper panel: Percentage of time during the 60 second probe trial spent in the quadrant formerly containing the hidden platform. Noggin transgenic mice show a memory-based search pattern on the first probe test. Wild type mice show memory-based searching by the third probe test and NSE-BMP4 mice show probe learning on the fourth test. By the final probe trial, NSE-noggin mice spend less time in the former target quadrant during the latter half of the 60-second trial, indicative of extinction learning toward the previously rewarded response. Lower panel: The number of pass-through events during the first 15 seconds of the trial is also increased for NSE-noggin mice on the first probe test, and remains elevated for all subsequent days. NSE-BMP4 mice are also delayed in this measure of reference learning relative to wild type mice. &#x0002a; Differs from wild type at p&#x0003c;0.01 by Bonferroni/Dunn pair-wise comparison. &#x0002a;&#x0002a;Significant main effect by multiple ANOVA for group x day and group x trial comparisons with all groups at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p><p>(0.70 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007506.s005.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007506.s006"><label>Figure S6</label><caption><p>Altered Levels of BMP signaling do not affect hippocampus-independent learning or general behavior.
