Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and genome-wide analyses, we here demonstrate that the subtelomeric X and Y' elements have distinct structural and functional properties. Y' elements are transcriptionally active and highly enriched in nucleosomes, whereas X elements are repressed and devoid of nucleosomes. In contrast to X elements, the Y' elements also lack the classical hallmarks of heterochromatin, such as high Sir3 and Rap1 occupancy as well as low levels of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation. Our analyses suggest that the presence of X and Y' elements govern chromatin structure and transcription activity at individual chromosome ends.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, telomeric DNA consists of tandem repeats of (TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>)<italic>n</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Louis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The length of these repeats varies between individual chromosomes and strains, but the average is typically about 300 nucleotides. In addition, two subtelomeric repeat elements called Y' and X are often found associated with the telomeric repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Louis2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The Y' element is located next to the telomeric repeats at many but not all telomeres, and is present either as a single copy or as a tandem repeat of two to four copies. The function of Y' elements are not known, but the structure and distribution of these sequences, are consistent with an origin as a mobile genetic element, even if the Y' elements today only moves via recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Louis3">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The structure of X elements is more variable, ranging in size from 300 bp to 3 kb, but each X element contains a &#x0201c;core-X&#x0201d; repeat that is found at nearly all telomeres. Based on the distribution of these structural elements, the budding yeast chromosome ends can be divided into X and X-Y' types.</p><p>Genes placed near telomeres are transcriptionally repressed, which is a phenomenon termed the telomere position effect (TPE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Ottaviani1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. TPE was discovered by placing a reporter gene immediately adjacent to the telomeric TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> tract, thereby generating a telomere that lacked both X and Y' elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Gottschling1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. TPE is also observed at native yeast telomeres, but the level of TPE can vary substantially from telomere to telomere, even in the same strain background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Pryde1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. At some chromosome ends, telomere-adjacent genes are repressed in a small percentage and at others in 100&#x00025; of the cells. Hence, telomeres do not only have different subtelomeric structures, but they also exhibit different levels of TPE. Mutations analysis suggest that X elements may contribute to TPE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Mondoux1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In some organisms, heterochromatin near telomeres can even contain active genes. For instance, the <italic>rolled</italic> gene in Drosophila is located in heterochromatin and its expression is essential for viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Eberl1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Another interesting phenomenon is transcription of telomeric repeats found in fission yeast and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Azzalin1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Prominent among these are the Sir complex proteins (Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4), the Ku heterodimer (Ku70 and Ku80), and Rap1, a sequence-specific telomeric DNA binding protein, which spread into subtelomeric regions. Rap1 and Ku have been show to bind telomere repeat DNA and subsequently recruit the Sir proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Kyrion1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The Rap1/Ku/Sir complex propagates towards the subtelomeres via interactions between the Sir proteins and histone tails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Pina1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Sir2 has a histone deacetylase activity, which deacetylate lysine 16 on histone H4 (H4K16) and enables Sir3 and Sir4 to bind the hypoacetylated tails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Tham1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we compare the histone density and nucleosome distribution at X and Y' elements. Unexpectedly, we find that X elements lack histones and a defined nucleosome structure. In contrast, Y' elements display high nucleosome density. Furthermore, at telomeres only containing X elements, we fail to observe significant H4K16Ac levels. In contrast, we do observe, significant levels of H4K16Ac at some regions in Y' elements and transcription analysis reveals that Y' elements are transcriptionally active. The Sir3 protein binds to X elements, but not Y' elements, and deletion of the <italic>SIR3</italic> gene leads to derepression of X element transcription. Our results reveal that X and Y' elements in budding yeast have distinct chromatin structure and this variation may help to explain the variations in TPE seen at different telomeres.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Histone distributions in subtelomeric regions</title><p>We first measured histone H3 and H4 occupancy at chromosome ends. We used 5 different primer pairs.

The other primer pairs amplified multiple X elements. The P1, P3, and P4 primer pairs amplified between 3 to 12 different X elements, whereas the primer pair P2 amplified 13 different Y' elements (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006363.s005">table S1</xref>).

We designed primers, which covered large regions of the chromosome end and monitored histone occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006363-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). All primer pairs were specific, except that for the X element, which also recognized similar elements in other chromosomes. At C7L, we observed low levels of histones over the X element situated near the TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> repeats and increasing levels of histones at positions at a distance of 1.5, 4, and 6 kb from the chromosome end.</p><p>We next analyzed histone occupancy at different positions in Y' elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006363-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As previously, the primers detected Y' elements present at multiple chromosome ends (for details see supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006363.s005">table S1</xref>). The histone density remained high over the entire Y' element as measured by primer pairs situated at 0.8 kb, 1.8 kb, and 3.0 kb from the chromosome end. As controls we used a primer pair detecting X elements and another primer detecting the coding region of the <italic>IMD2</italic> gene located 1.3 kb from the X-element in the C8R chromosome end. As previously, X elements contained low levels of H3, whereas the coding region of <italic>IMD2</italic> contained H3 levels similar to Y' elements.</p><p>Our observations so far suggested that histones are absent or at least very scarce on X elements. To further address this possibility, we analyzed positioning of nucleosomes over telomeres using DNA microarray technology. We isolated 146-bp mononuclesomes from micrococcal nuclease digested chromatin. The purified 146-bp mononucleosomal DNA was hybridized to a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> tiling array (Affymetrix). Naked genomic DNA randomly digested with micrococcal nuclease was also hybridized to tiling arrays and used to define the background. The data were normalized with the Affymetrix Tiling Array software (TAS) and visualized with the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB).

The left end has a X-Y' organization, whereas the right end has only an X element. On the left end, nucleosome density is significantly higher than the genome wide average level and nucleosomes cover the entire Y' element. Consistent with our histone ChIP results, nucleosomes are almost completely absent from the X elements, regardless if the X element is located at the extreme telomere end (right end) or after an adjacent Y' element (left end). The same pattern was evident at all X-Y' type chromosome ends analyzed (Supplementary information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006363.s001">Figure S1 A &#x02013; D</xref>).</p><p>Our results therefore demonstrate that X and Y' elements differ in histone as well as nucleosome density. To further confirm that X elements lack a nuclesomal organization, we used micrococcal nuclease mapping and indirect labeling to map nucleosome positioning at the right end of chromosome V.

These differences in chromatin structure may contribute to the formation of unique telomere structures, which will enable cellular processes to distinguish between different chromosome ends. The X elements do not interact with core histones and are devoid of nucleosomes. Instead of nucleosomes, we here demonstrate that X elements are bound by Sir3 and Rap1. In support of this finding, X elements have a strong silencing effect on adjacent genes, which are derepressed upon loss of Sir proteins or Rap1, lending functional evidence for a role of these proteins in X element chromatin architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Pryde1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The MNase digest generated specific, but somewhat blurry bands, which could suggest that the specific translational positions in the subtelomeric region of chromosome V is more relaxed than what has been observed at promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Bresnick1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The MNase digestion therefore argues against stably positioned nucleosomes in the X-element region. In combination with ChIP analysis showing the absence of Histone H3 and the presence of Sir3, our data suggest that X-elements lack a defined nucleosomal structure.</p><p>In contrast to the X elements, the Y' elements display high histone occupancy and contains positioned nucleosomes. Moreover, H4K16Ac, which is associated with transcriptional activation and the maintenance of euchromatin, cannot be observed on X elements, but is present on Y' elements. In keeping with an active chromatin conformation, we could not observe Sir3 and Rap1 binding to Y' elements. Finally, Y' elements are actively transcribed, whereas X elements are silent. These findings support the idea that Y' elements possess anti-silencing properties and limits the spreading of silent chromatin. In X-Y' chromosome ends, the Y' element is located between the TG repeats and the X element. In spite of this, genes located near the Y' element are not silenced and a foreign reporter genes inserted in a Y' element can still be transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Pryde1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, these data suggest that transcription silencing does not depend on the exact distance to the chromosome end, but vary depending on the exact chromosome context. The distinct chromatin structure of Y' elements also supports the idea that these repeated regions originated as mobile elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Louis3">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. A role for mobile genetic elements in telomere maintenance has been demonstrated in other eukaryotes. Instead of the simple telomeric repeats, <italic>Drosophila</italic> uses retrotransposons to elongate its chromosome ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Pardue1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It has been proposed that yeast telomeres form fold back loops and that this process is dependent on the Sir proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-StrahlBolsinger1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. A looping back model have been suggested previously to explain the repression patterns observed at native telomeres<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006363-Pryde1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The finding of Sir3 and Rap1 proteins at X elements located at a distance from the TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> repeats could therefore indicate that they play a role in this loop formation. We would like to propose that the Rap1 and Sir proteins interacting with TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> repeats, fold back and contact the Rap1/Sir protein structure on X elements. We will address this interesting possibility in future work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains and Cell culture</title><p>Strains used for this study were BY4741 (<italic>MATa; his3&#x00394;1; leu2&#x00394;0; met15&#x00394;0; ura3&#x00394;0</italic>) and Y07110 (BY4741; <italic>YLR442c::kanMX4</italic>), obtained from EUROSCARF.

Briefly, we cultured yeast cells to a OD595 of 0.6 to 0.8, then crosslinked in 1&#x00025; formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, quenched with 125 mM glycine, and spun down at 4&#x000b0;C for 5 min at 3000 rpm. Pellets were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in 400 &#x000b5;l cold lysis buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The fixed cells were lysed with 500 &#x000b5;l acid washed glass beads (sigma) in a FastPrep machine (FP120, BIO101 Savant) using the following program: 5 cycles,, 6.5 m/s, 20 seconds on and 1minute off. The extracts were sonicated to chromatin fragments (Bioruptor 200, Diagenode) with 5 cycles (30 seconds on, 1 minute off) at high power output. To confirm that heterochromatin is fragmented by sonication with the same efficiency as eurochromatin, we carried out southern blot analyses with 3 different probes, directed towards X elements (X1), Y' elements (Y1), and the coding region of TEF1 as an example of a euchromatin region (TEF1) (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006363.s004">figure S4</xref>). Southern blot results showed that the length of most sonicated fragments is around 500&#x02013;1000 bp. The X and Y' elements displayed exactly the same size distribution as euchromatin. For core histone H3 and H4, chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the core histone C-termini (ab1791, ab2423, and ab61240 from Abcam; and 05-858 from Upstate biotechnology Inc.) coupled to protein A beads (Sigma). For ChIP analyzes of Sir3 occupancy, we used antibodies kindly provided Dr. Hiten Madhani and Dr. Fred van Leeuwen. After wash and elution, samples were treated with proteinase K and the crosslinks were reversed overnight at 65&#x000b0;C.
