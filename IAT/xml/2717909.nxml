Gonads appear first rather similarly, but only the left one undergoes full differentiation and gives rise to a functional ovary. The right gonad, in which the cortex does not develop, remains restricted to the medulla and finally regresses. Opportunity was taken of this left-right asymmetry to perform a suppression subtractive hybridization screening to select for transcripts preferentially expressed in the developing left ovary as compared to the right one, and thus identify genes that are potentially involved in the process of ovarian differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One of these transcripts, named <italic>Ovex1 </italic>according to its expression profile, corresponds to an endogenous retrovirus that has not been previously characterized. It is transcribed as full-length and singly spliced mRNAs and contains three uninterrupted open reading frames coding potentially for proteins with homology to Gag and Pro-Pol retroviral polyproteins and a third protein showing only a weak similarity with Env glycoproteins. <italic>Ovex1 </italic>is severely degenerated; it is devoid of typical long terminal repeats and displays some evidence of recombination. An orthologous <italic>Ovex1 </italic>locus was identified in the genome of zebra finch, a member of a different bird order, and similar sequences were detected in turkey, guinea fowl, and duck DNA. The relationship between these sequences follows the bird phylogeny, suggesting vertical transmission of the endogenous retrovirus for more than 100 million years.</p><p><italic>Ovex1 </italic>is transcribed in chicken gonads with a sex-dependent and left-right asymmetrical pattern. It is first expressed in the cortex of the left indifferent gonads of both sexes. Expression is transient in the left testis and absent in the right one. In developing ovaries, <italic>Ovex1 </italic>transcription increases sharply in the left cortex and is weakly detected in the medulla. After folliculogenesis, <italic>Ovex1</italic>-expressing cells constitute the follicular granulosa cell layer. <italic>Ovex1 </italic>expression highlights a striking desquamation process that leads to profound cortical remodeling associated with follicle morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Evidence for a selection pressure at the protein level suggests that this endogenous retrovirus, expressed in the ovarian supporting cell lineage, might play an active role in bird ovarian physiology.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In chickens, as in most birds, gonad differentiation is characterized by left-right (L/R) asymmetry. In the female, only the left gonad becomes a functional ovary. The right one fails to fully differentiate and ultimately disappears. By contrast, both male gonads, initially asymmetrical, become functional testes. Bird sex determination is not fully understood. The heterogametic sex, with a ZW karyotype, is female and the homogametic sex, with two Z chromosomes, is male. Unlike in mammals, the initial genetic sex trigger is not clearly identified (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]).</p><p>Gonad organogenesis begins around the 4<sup>th </sup>day of incubation (E4), with identification of the genital ridge, a thickening of the coelomic epithelium on the medial aspect of the mesonephros, in which primordial germ cells, migrating from the germinal crescent, are going to settle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In both sexes, the gonad epithelium is characterized by the expression of the Lim homeodomain-containing protein Lhx9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The subjacent mesenchyme, which will give rise to the so-called "medulla", expresses the steroidogenic factor SF-1 (Nr5a1/Ad4BP), Wnt-4, and by day 5, anti-M&#x000fc;llerian hormone (AMH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Early L/R asymmetry is observed in both sexes. The left gonad is larger, has a thicker epithelium, usually called "cortex", and is colonized by a greater number of primordial germ cells. This asymmetry, more pronounced in females than in males, is considered an early sign of some sex differentiation, prior to other morphological changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. L/R asymmetrical expression of several genes (<italic>estrogen receptor ER-&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>FET-1</italic>, <italic>Bmp7</italic>, <italic>R-Spondin1</italic>) in female gonads had been reported and was related to the asymmetry of their differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, the mechanism responsible for this asymmetry has been identified only recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It depends on the bicoid type homeobox gene <italic>Pitx2 </italic>(Pituitary homeobox 2), a general actor in early embryo L/R differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In both sexes, <italic>Pitx2c </italic>is asymmetrically expressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm, and later in the epithelium of the left coelomic cavity in the region of gonad formation. This factor is sufficient to induce the differentiation of gonads along a "left pathway". The action of Pitx2c results from its effect on retinoic acid (RA) signaling. A balance between RA-synthesizing enzymes (RALDH2) and RA-metabolizing enzymes (CYP26) controls RA levels. In both sexes, <italic>Pitx2c </italic>is expressed in the cortex of the left gonad. Pitx2c repression of RALDH2 synthesis prevents RA formation. In the cortex of the right gonad, where <italic>Pitx2c </italic>is not expressed, RA is formed and, as CYP26 is absent, the RA cascade is activated. RA suppresses transcription of <italic>ER-&#x003b1; </italic>and of <italic>SF-1</italic>, a factor required for the expression of the cell cycle mediator <italic>cyclin D1</italic>, thus limiting cortical cell proliferation. Conversely, in the left cortex, where RA is absent, <italic>ER-&#x003b1; </italic>and <italic>SF-1 </italic>are expressed, and cyclin D1-stimulated cell proliferation is activated. In the medulla of both gonads, RA is degraded by Cyp26A1, which allows some <italic>ER-&#x003b1; </italic>expression.</p><p>After 6.5 days of incubation, ovaries and testes can be distinguished histologically by the differentiation in the internal region of the male gonads of testicular cords delimited by a basement membrane, enclosing germ cells and supporting Sertoli cells. These somatic cells express high levels of SOX9, DMRT1 and AMH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>At the same time, aromatase (P450 arom), the enzyme converting androgens to estrogens, begins to be present in the female gonads but is not expressed in the male ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Estrogens are essential for ovarian differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The medulla is rather similar in both female gonads. It expresses the estrogen receptor ER-&#x003b1;, aromatase and FoxL2, a forkhead transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. On the other hand, the expression of ER-&#x003b1; in the left cortex and its absence in the right one leads to an asymmetry in the estrogen-mediated differentiation of the gonads. Primordial germ cells and somatic cells multiply in the left ovarian cortex. Germ cells enter meiosis at E15.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Folliculogenesis occurs after hatching at E21, with the progressive formation of follicles constituted of an oocyte surrounded by a layer of somatic granulosa cells. In contrast, the development of the right gonad is limited. The surface epithelium devoid of ER-&#x003b1; is not stimulated by estrogens and does not proliferate. The few germ cells do not enter meiosis, and the gonad becomes vestigial after hatching. The female right gonad does not have the physiological potential to form a functional ovary and even, in the case of left ovary castration, differentiates into a testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, early <italic>Pitx2c </italic>ectopic expression is able to overcome the degenerative fate of the right gonad and to direct it toward an ovarian differentiation pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>With the purpose of finding yet unknown factors involved in the early steps of ovarian cortex differentiation, we took advantage of the differential fate of the two female gonads in chicken. Suppression subtractive hybridization screening (SSH) was used to select transcripts expressed in the left differentiating ovary and underrepresented in the right gonad. In the course of this study, we identified a new endogenous retroviral element that we named <italic>Ovex1</italic>, whose specific expression in gonads is characterized by a sexual dimorphism and a L/R asymmetry.</p><p>More than 30,000 endogenous retroviruses or ERVs, representing 2.9% of the DNA, are present in the chicken genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. They are remnants of ancestral retroviruses that have gained access to the germ line of a host, leading to vertical transmission of the integrated provirus to the offspring in a Mendelian fashion. They are characterized by the presence of two long terminal repeats (LTRs), flanking sequences coding for structural and enzymatic viral proteins. The genomic organization of simple retroviruses is 5'LTR-<italic>Gag-Pro-Pol-Env</italic>-3'LTR. Viral protein expression is controlled by the promoter and enhancer elements located in the 5' LTR. The polyprotein Gag (group specific antigen) is a structural component of the virus particle. Pro encodes an aspartyl protease required for processing of the Gag precursor. The polyprotein Pol contains domains for reverse transcriptase (RT), RNase H, and integrase (IN). The envelope protein (Env) is composed of two domains, a surface region (SU) and a transmembrane domain (TM). After their initial integration, ERVs can copy themselves to different locations within the genome, giving rise over long periods of time to a family of related ERV elements, most of them inactivated by mutations (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]). Retroviruses are divided into three major classes. Class I contains elements related to gammaretroviruses (such as Moloney murine leukemia virus, MMLV) and epsilonretroviruses (as Walleye dermal sarcoma virus, WDSV). Class II elements are related to alpharetroviruses (as the Avian leukosis virus, ALV), betaretroviruses (as Mouse mammary tumor virus, MMTV), deltaretroviruses (as Human T-lymphotropic virus, HTLV) and lentiviruses (as Human immunodeficiency virus, HIV). Class III contains elements related to spumaviruses (as Human foamy virus, HFV) and ERV-L elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Some fish viruses, as the Snakehead fish retrovirus, SnRV, have an intermediate position and are said to be epsilon-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Endogenous retroviruses of the chicken remain incompletely described in spite of intensive studies. The most studied chicken ERVs are class II elements specific for <italic>Gallus </italic>species. The existence of retroviral sequences, related to human ERVs and representative of the other classes of retroviruses has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], but little is known about these elements.</p><p>Chicken <italic>Ovex1 </italic>contains three long open reading frames (ORF). The first two consecutive ORFs are similar to <italic>Gag </italic>and <italic>Pro-Pol </italic>retroviral sequences. The third ORF in a different frame is possibly related to <italic>Env</italic>. A sequence orthologous to chicken <italic>Ovex1 </italic>was found in the genome of zebra finch. We also detected the presence of similar <italic>Gag </italic>and <italic>Pol </italic>sequences in the DNA of three other domestic birds. Expression of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>was analyzed by RT-PCR and by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization in chicken gonads from embryonic day-5 to adulthood. It depends both on the sexual determinism and on the L/R asymmetry pattern of gonad differentiation. This gene is specifically transcribed in somatic cells of the ovarian cortex involved in the formation of the follicles and in granulosa cells of the adult hen ovary. Its expression enlightens the profound remodeling of the ovarian cortex that occurs during follicle morphogenesis, an important phase of the ovarian differentiation which has not yet received much attention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of differentially expressed genes in chicken embryonic ovaries using SSH</title><p>In order to identify unknown factors involved in early steps of the ovarian cortex differentiation, we performed a suppression subtractive hybridization screening (SSH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] to selected transcripts expressed in the chicken differentiating left ovary and underrepresented in the right gonad in which the cortex does not differentiate. The 8-day embryonic stage (E8) was chosen because the process of cortex development is at its beginning; meiosis has not yet started; and the gonads are easily dissected. We generated a left ovary cDNA-enriched library (LO-RO), by subtracting <italic>Rsa</italic>I-digested cDNAs from the left ovary (LO) with those of the right ovary (RO), and a right ovary cDNA-enriched library (RO-LO) by the opposite screening. Two hundred and fifty clones from the (LO-RO) library were pick-up randomly and submitted to differential hybridization screening. Macroarrays established with the PCR-amplified inserts were hybridized with labeled cDNA probes prepared with either the (LO-RO) or the (RO-LO) subtracted libraries. Asymmetry of expression was quantified by the ratio of (LO-RO)/(RO-LO) counts. We report here the study of one clone, OG43, which had a differential hybridization-screening ratio of 154, and a high expression in gonads, preferentially the ovaries, with left-right asymmetry. This clone was shown to correspond to an endogenous retroviral element not yet identified that we named <italic>Ovex1 </italic>(<underline>Ov</underline>ary <underline>ex</underline>pressed, #1) in relation to its expression pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence analysis of the <italic>Ovex1</italic> locus</title><p>Identification of the insert of clone OG43 was performed by BLAT screening of the May 2006, v2.1 draft assembly of the chicken genome (galGal3).

Some of them extend 5' from the locus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), suggesting that transcription might start further upstream. Interestingly, the next locus upstream from LOC422926 in the galGal3 draft assembly, LOC422925, displays also a strict ovarian expression. It corresponds to a predicted gene, [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XM_430004">XM_430004</ext-link>], coding for a hypothetical protein of unknown nature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and extends from nucleotide 15 to 2461 of the sequence given in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. None of the already published ESTs overlaps with the two loci. To examine if there might be a relationship between these two neighboring loci that have the same orientation and display the same specificity of expression, we tried to amplify overlapping cDNA fragments from one locus to the other by RT-PCR using embryonic ovary mRNA. The series of fragments obtained demonstrates that the two loci constitute in fact a single transcription unit (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Complete nucleotide sequence of chicken <italic>Ovex1 </italic>and predicted translation products (first part)</bold>.

Additional 5'RACE experiments confirmed this result, one with a primer (Ov6061a) located downstream from the acceptor splice site which allows only amplification of the short spliced transcript, and the second with a primer (Ov654a) located in the intron to amplify the unspliced mRNA. Both experiments gave the same 5'-terminal sequences, indicating that the cap site of the two mRNAs is presumably G<sub>+1 </sub>or A<sub>+4 </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), a few bases upstream from the putative start of LOC422925.

However, the efficiency of these signals <italic>in vivo </italic>is low as demonstrated by the RT-PCR amplification of cDNA fragments D, E, and F (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and the existence of ESTs overcoming the signals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To verify if polyadenylation at these internal signals would affect differently the spliced and unspliced mRNAs we performed RT-PCRs using sense primers located upstream from the polyadenylation signals, either into the intron to amplify the unspliced mRNA, or across the splice site to amplify the spliced product. Several antisense primers, upstream or downstream from the four polyadenylation signals, were tested in both cases. The amplification of cDNAs overrunning the signals indicates that at least a substantial fraction of both types of mRNAs is transcribed unto the final polyadenylation site (additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2, Effect of the internal polyadenylation signals).</p><p>The complete sequence of chicken <italic>Ovex1</italic>, obtained by sequencing the cDNA fragments and the cloned RACE products, is given in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.

This <italic>Ovex1 </italic>homolog is located on zebra finch chromosome 4, syntenic to chicken chromosome 4 long arm, between the <italic>CD8 </italic>and <italic>SMYD1 </italic>loci as for chicken <italic>Ovex1</italic>.

The sequence of zebra finch <italic>Ovex1 </italic>is given in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> (Figure S3, Partial zebra finch <italic>Ovex1 </italic>sequence). Conservation of the TATA box, the polyadenylation signal, and of sequences surrounding the donor and acceptor splice sites suggests that zebra finch <italic>Ovex1 </italic>is transcribed and spliced as chicken <italic>Ovex1</italic>.</p><p>The first two thirds of the <italic>Ovex1 </italic>sequence appear to be present as a single copy in chicken (galGal3) and zebra finch (taeGut1) genomes. In contrast, in both species the last third of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>contains sequences identified by RepeatMasker as the internal part of a multi-copy LTR-containing element, GGLTR11-int [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In addition, an imperfect antisense 3'-fragment of CR1-Y4, member of the large family of chicken CR1 non-LTR retrotransposons (LINE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], is included in the 3'-UTRs. These sequences are indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> (Figure S3, Partial zebra finch <italic>Ovex1 </italic>sequence).</p></sec><sec><title>Repeated sequences</title><p>Endogenous retroviruses are usually bordered by two LTRs classically divided in U3-R-U5 regions. The 5' U3 region contains promoter and enhancer elements. Transcription is initiated at the 5' U3-R junction and terminates at the 3' R-U5 junction. We looked for repeated sequences in the chicken <italic>Ovex1 </italic>gene and flanking sequences. Direct repeats of 120&#x02013;122-bp were found on each side of the gene, from nucleotide -6 to +114, 17-bp after the TATA box, on the 5'-side, and from nucleotide 9023 to 9144, 46-bp before the polyadenylation signal, on the 3'-side (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These repeats, which have only 73% identity, might be degenerated forms of the R region of previous LTRs. Identity of the zebra finch repeats is even lower (69%). No other repeated sequences corresponding to the U3 and U5 regions were found in the genomic sequence in and around the gene. No sequence complementary to the 3'-end of a chicken tRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] that might be the primer tRNA binding site (PBS) required for reverse transcription was identified, thus precluding classification of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>according to this usual criterion. The 3'-UTR contains a 13-purine sequence that may correspond to the polypurine tract that precedes the 3'-U3 region in retroviruses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Conservation of the 5'-UTRs between chicken and zebra finch is globally low (65%), but the sequence surrounding the splice donor site is well conserved. By contrast, the 3'-UTRs are very similar (80% identity score).</p><p>Chicken and zebra finch <italic>Ovex1 </italic>5'-proximal DNA sequences were screened to detect transcription factor binding sites, using the MatInspector program. Among putative responsive elements conserved with a similar position in the 5'-flanking regions, we identified a TATA box and sites for Ras-responsive element binding proteins, forkhead domain factors, estrogen-related receptors, GATA binding factors, and bicoid-like homeodomain transcription factors, in particular Pitx2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. These sites are shown in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> (Figure S4, Alignment of chicken and zebra finch 5'-proximal DNA sequences).</p></sec><sec><title>Open reading frames</title><p>As seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, the unspliced chicken mRNA contains three large uninterrupted open reading frames (ORF). The first two ORFs are contiguous in frame and separated by a stop-codon. The third one is in a different frame and non-overlapping. The spliced mRNA contains only the third ORF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). The conceptual translation is given in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> for chicken and in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> for zebra finch (Figure S3, Partial zebra finch <italic>Ovex1 </italic>sequence). Protein similarity queries using Blastp have shown that the unspliced mRNA potentially encodes Gag and Pro-Pol polyproteins and that the spliced mRNA encodes a protein that might be an envelope protein. Chicken and zebra finch <italic>Ovex1 </italic>display the same organization, which is typical of numerous retroviruses. Alignment of these proteins is shown in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> (Figure S5, Alignment of Ovex1 putative proteins).</p><sec><title>Gag polyprotein</title><p>The <italic>Gag </italic>initiation codon is usually the first AUG after the cap site. In the chicken unspliced mRNA, the first AUG, in position 313, initiates potentially a 5-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide. Initiation may also occur at the next AUG downstream, by reinitiation or leaky scanning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The next AUG is at position 370, in a correct context for initiation of the translation (CUCACU<underline>AUG</underline>AUGU). If translation starts effectively at this codon, the ORF would encode a 565-residue protein till the first stop-codon (nucleotide position 2065 to 2067) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, a second AUG, immediately following this initiation codon in a seemingly less favorable context, has been chosen as initiator for the hypothetical protein encoded by LOC422925. The putative protein was analyzed using Blastp. Gag polyproteins are constituted by the matrix, the capsid and the nucleocapsid domains. The C-terminal region (from the amino-acid residue 248) has 22% identity with the capsid domain of an epsilon-like retrovirus, Snakehead fish retrovirus (SnRV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The Ovex1 protein contains a sequence EK<underline>Q</underline>NPE<underline>E</underline>RPDAYVN<underline>R</underline>KKMLY corresponding to the major homology region (MHR) with the three underlined fundamental residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This region, which provides the interface for capsid binding and dimerization, is present in all retroviruses with the exception of the spumaviruses. No zinc finger domain was identified here, unlike in SnRV and most retroviruses except the spumaviruses. In the N-terminal region, no sequence similarity was detected with other Gag proteins, even with that of SnRV, but they do have some homology. As in SnRV, the protein N-terminus is presumably not myristylated, and the N-terminal region contains a polybasic sequence (residues 50 to 61) with two successive consensus nuclear localization signals, <underline>KKPK<bold>PTNKCKK</bold></underline>R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. As in SnRV, the protein has a region of strong probability of coiled-coil structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], between residues 62 and 114, like in the rod domain of myosin-type proteins. In addition, the Ovex1 protein contains a L(X)<sub>6</sub>L(X)<sub>6</sub>L(X)<sub>6</sub>L leucine zipper motif (residues 88&#x02013;109) seen in numerous regulatory proteins. Thus, this protein may be classified as a Gag polyprotein by analogy with that of the SnRV and from the position of its coding sequence preceding a <italic>Pol </italic>sequence, but its functionality remains to be demonstrated. The uninterrupted zebra finch Gag polyprotein is well conserved, with 90% sequence identity to chicken Gag, and contains the same functional domains (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> (Figure S5, Alignment of Ovex1 putative proteins)).</p></sec><sec><title>Pro-Pol polyprotein</title><p>The second long ORF immediately follows the <italic>Gag </italic>amber codon in the same translational frame and is presumably translated by suppression of this codon as seen for SnRV, gamma- and epsilonretroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Translation results in a 1786-amino-acid Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein unto the next stop-codon. Analysis of the conceptual translation of this ORF allows the identification of retroviral aspartyl protease (Pro) and Pol polyprotein domains: reverse transcriptase (RT), Rnase H, and integrase (IN) (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In zebra finch, the <italic>Pol </italic>region is only partially sequenced and most of the <italic>Rnase H </italic>domain is unknown. Chicken and zebra finch Pol sequences display 81% identity in their common regions and the same characteristics (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> (Figure S5, Alignment of Ovex1 putative proteins)).</p><p>The aspartyl protease domain, approximately between residues 583 and 686, contains the active site M<underline>LIDTGA</underline>SYSIL and presents 29 to 26% identity with the proteases of <italic>Sphenodon </italic>endogenous virus SpeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], immunodeficiency viruses and porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). As for SpeV, we note the absence of the conserved GRD/N motif present in all retroviral proteases, except for spumaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>The RT domain, from residue 767 to 965, displays a similarity with RTs of foamy viruses, fish viruses: Walleye epidermal hyperplasia viruses WEHV 1 and 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], Walleye dermal sarcoma virus (WDSV), SnRV (33&#x02013;30% identity), and with the partially sequenced reptilian SpeV. However in chicken as in zebra finch Ovex1, several fundamental RT residues are not conserved, in particular two of the three aspartates that make up the catalytic active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], a difference resulting presumably in the loss of the enzyme activity.</p><p>The chicken Rnase H core domain, between amino-acid residues 1211 and 1357, is similar to those of SnRV (35% identity) and Moloney murine leukemia virus, MMLV (32%) with, in particular, the conserved WFVDGSN and FSDS motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The distance between this sequence and the RT domain is consistent with the presence of the tether region that separates RT and Rnase H domains in vertebrate retroviral <italic>Pol </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>The integrase (INT) has a similarity with those of MMLV, WEHV2, foamy viruses and SnRV. It contains a putative zinc finger: H(X)<sub>3</sub>H(X)<sub>29</sub>C(X)<sub>2</sub>C, as most retroviral integrases. The core domain, rve, between residues 1500 and 1647, is only partially conserved. Where other integrases have the catalytic triad D(X)<sub>55&#x02013;60</sub>D(X)<sub>35</sub>E, the motif is E(X)<sub>59</sub>D(X)<sub>35</sub>E in chicken and E(X)<sub>59</sub>E(X)<sub>35</sub>E in zebra finch Ovex1. The difference is important since substitution of the first aspartate by a glutamate drastically impairs the integrase activity of Rous sarcoma and HIV viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The C-terminus does not contain the consensus GPY/F motif but a WM<bold>GPV</bold>RV sequence that might be the degenerated remnant of this motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>ORF3: an envelope protein?</title><p>The <italic>Ovex1 </italic>third ORF (<italic>ORF3</italic>) is located downstream from <italic>Gag-Pol</italic>. It is entirely contained in the second exon of the singly spliced transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). A similar organization occurs for the envelope protein of gammaretroviruses. The ORF starts 11 bp after the splice site and encodes a putative protein of 873 amino acids. This ORF is potentially interrupted by the presence of the internal polyadenylation signals that do not appear very efficient <italic>in vivo</italic>, as demonstrated above. In zebra finch, the third ORF encodes an 874-amino-acid putative protein with 81% identity with the chicken protein and similar characteristics (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> (Figure S5, Alignment of Ovex1 putative proteins)).</p><p>This region is quite complex. Segments of sequence on gray background in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> were identified by RepeatMasker as weakly similar to GGLTR11-int, a consensus sequence quoted in Repbase as internal part of an ERV1 chicken endogenous retrovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Nucleotide conservation with GGLTR11 is rather low (60%) and better-conserved copies of ERV1 can be found in the chicken genome. Furthermore, the first two GGLTR11-like sequences are separated by 30 nucleotides in GGLTR11 while located 960 nucleotides apart in <italic>Ovex1</italic>. The intervening region, not identified by RepeatMasker, is locally similar to sequences found in chromosome Z. A similar presence of GGLTR11-related sequences is detected in zebra finch <italic>ORF3</italic>, as seen in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> (Figure S3, Partial zebra finch <italic>Ovex1 </italic>sequence). The conceptual translation of GGLTR11 is given in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> (Figure S6, Structure and conservation of <italic>ORF3</italic>-encoded proteins). Unlike <italic>Ovex1 ORF3</italic>, it contains stop-codons and frameshift mutations.</p><p>Significant similarity of the ORF3 putative protein with other proteins was found only in an avian retrovirus, the Tetraonine endogenous retrovirus (TERV). This defective ERV of the ruffled grouse, <italic>Bonasa umbellus</italic>, a member of the galliform order as chicken, contains 5' and 3' LTRs, a Gag-like protein and a truncated region considered as an envelope TM domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The similarity between Ovex1 and TERV is limited to this envelope domain, with 52% identity over a 92-amino-acid region (residues 754 to 845) that can be extended upstream to amino acid 645, with stop-codons and frameshifts in the TERV sequence. This TERV region is closer to the consensus GGLTR11 than is the Ovex1 sequence. The main arguments sustaining the identity of the TERV envelope are its position just before the 3' LTR and some similarity with envelope proteins of MMLV and PERV. Identity of ORF3 with these retroviral envelopes is even more limited.</p><p>The protein potentially encoded by <italic>ORF3 </italic>is larger than prototypical retroviral envelope proteins. It contains two hydrophobic regions shown in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> (Figure S6, Structure and conservation of <italic>ORF3</italic>-encoded proteins). One is close to the N-terminus, and the second, located in the C-terminal part, corresponds to the identified transmembrane anchor and is preceded by a sequence susceptible to adopting a coiled-coil structure (residues 753 to 780). The cytoplasmic domain, C-terminal to the TM region is short. Retroviral envelopes are glycosylated. Four conserved potential N-glycosylation sites are present in the sequence. However, the protein does not seem to possess a signal peptide. Retroviral envelope precursors are cleaved between the surface and transmembrane domains at specific RX(R/K)R sites. The proteins encoded by <italic>ORF3 </italic>in chick and zebra finch contain conserved potential cleavage sites. However, neither these proteins nor TERV's contain the conserved CWLC sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], the consensus immununosuppressive motif CKS17, and the disulfide bonded loop C(X)<sub>6</sub>CC that precede the TM region in many retroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Thus, despite its position and its homology with the TERV predicted envelope, the identity of the <italic>ORF3 </italic>product as an envelope protein is still uncertain, given its limited similarity with other retroviral envelope proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)</title><p>Differences between the sequence of chicken <italic>Ovex1 </italic>transcripts and the genomic galGal3 draft assembly are exclusively point substitutions reported in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> (Table S7, Polymorphisms in chicken <italic>Ovex1 </italic>sequences). Among 14 substitutions in <italic>Gag</italic>, <italic>Pol </italic>and <italic>ORF3 </italic>coding sequences, 12 are silent. These differences reflect the polymorphism between two types of <italic>Gallus gallus </italic>derived from a common ancestor: the wild Red Jungle fowl and the domestic White Leghorn strain. In addition, direct sequencing of RT-PCR products from pools of gonads allowed the detection of the presence of two nucleotides in variable proportions at some positions of the sequence. This heterogeneity is presumably due to polymorphism within the Leghorn chicken population. Some of these differences are also found in ESTs. In the sequence coding for Gag-Pol, these SNPs correspond to silent differences. In ORF3, conservative and non-conservative substitutions are observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Presence of <italic>Ovex1</italic>-related sequences in other birds</title><p>To investigate the presence of sequences related to <italic>Ovex1 </italic>in the genome of other birds, we performed PCR amplifications with primers corresponding to <italic>Ovex1 Gag </italic>and <italic>RT </italic>regions, using DNA from turkey (<italic>Meleagris gallopavo</italic>), guinea fowl (<italic>Numida meleagris</italic>) and duck (<italic>Anas platyrhynchos</italic>). Direct sequencing of the fragments gave unique sequences, corresponding to ORFs highly similar to those obtained from chicken. The 132-bp-long <italic>Gag </italic>fragment, which contains the nuclear localization signals, has no analog in nucleic-acid and protein databases. Conservation for turkey, guinea fowl and duck with respect to chicken is 98%, 96% and 92% at the nucleotide level and 100%, 100% and 98% at the protein level. The 400-bp-long RT fragments present 94%, 92% and 84% of nucleotide conservation. Although it is not proven that the amplified <italic>Gag </italic>and <italic>Pol </italic>sequences are linked in the DNA of turkey, guinea fowl and duck, the result suggests that <italic>Ovex1 </italic>orthologs exist in these birds.

(i) The <italic>Gag-Pro-Pol </italic>coding sequences are in the same frame and translation of the Pro-Pol polyprotein results likely from the translational suppression of the <italic>Gag </italic>stop-codon, as in gamma-, epsilon- and intermediate epsilon-like retroviruses.

This is in contrast to the SnRV, which displays some similarity with Ovex1 Gag but has one zinc finger. (iii) No dUTPase domain was detected, unlike in MuERV-L. The absence of the integrase GPY/F motif is not discriminating as for spuma-like viruses, since a degenerated sequence may be present. A single splicing event and no obvious accessory ORFs were found in <italic>Ovex1</italic>, unlike in complex retroviruses like SnRV, WEHV and spumaviruses. In the analysis, it is necessary to distinguish the <italic>Gag-Pol </italic>and the <italic>ORF3 </italic>regions of <italic>Ovex1</italic>.</p><p>RT is the most conserved retroviral domain generally used for phylogenetic analysis, allowing detection of the relationship between distant elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. We performed the alignment of a 159-amino-acid sequence of chicken and zebra finch putative RTs (Gag-Pol polyprotein residues 759 to 917) to that of representative retroviral elements and retroviruses, using ClustalW2 (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> (Figure S8, Alignment of Ovex1 RT and homologous sequences). The derived neighbor-joining unrooted dendrogram presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> displays three groups of sequences. They correspond to the class I and class II of retroviral elements and to a third group more dispersed (similar to group I in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]) that contains class III elements and the intermediate epsilon-like retrovirus SnRV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Ovex1 RT is not closely related to any known avian retroviral sequence. On the basis of this analysis, Ovex1 does not belong to class II. Despite some similarity with the epsilonretroviruses WEHV and WDSV, it is not included either in class I elements. It appears more related to the third group of sequences. However, its relation with members of this group is not well defined. Ovex1 does not cluster with spumaviruses or spuma-related elements MuERV-L and HERV-L. It is not either similar to the Repbase GGERV-L element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] or to avian sequences like ENS-3 (Chicken Embryonic Normal Stem cell gene 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] and the bird Tinamou retrovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].

A few germ cells are present in the gonad.</p><p>At this stage, the morphological L/R asymmetry of the gonads is less obvious in males. Testicular differentiation becomes morphologically visible in both gonads. Sertoli cells, that start to express <italic>Sox9 </italic>and a high level of <italic>AMH</italic>, are clustering to form the sex cords [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

Expression of <italic>ER-&#x003b1; </italic>is asymmetrical.

The male-specific marker <italic>Sox9 </italic>identifies the Sertoli cells that express also <italic>AMH</italic>. In the left testis, <italic>Ovex1 </italic>transcription is restricted to a small apical zone where the epithelium is thicker (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>).

The fibronectin-positive medulla is formed of groups of loosely connected cells and contains lacunae in its inner region. The interface between cortex and medulla is underlined by a thick deposit of fibronectin. The cortical fibronectin-negative nests contain clusters of germ cells and somatic cells.

Fadrozole treatment has been shown to lead to female to male sex reversal. The right gonad differentiates into a testis and the left one into an ovotestis or a testis.

It revealed the existence of a locus that we called <italic>Ovex1 </italic>according to its expression pattern. <italic>Ovex1 </italic>has a structure similar to that of simple endogenous retroviruses, with ORFs coding for potential proteins related to retroviral Gag and Pro-Pol polyproteins and a third one (ORF3) which displays only a faint similarity with retroviral envelope proteins. In the chicken ovary a full-length genomic mRNA and a singly spliced subgenomic transcript encoding only the third protein are present. Translation of the <italic>Pro-Pol </italic>ORF results presumably from read-through of the <italic>Gag </italic>stop-codon, like in gamma, epsilon and intermediate epsilon-like retroviruses.</p><p>A homologous sequence was found in the genome of zebra finch, a distantly related bird species. The location of these sequences, at similar positions in synthenic chromosomes, indicates an orthologous relationship. Partial sequences corresponding to <italic>Gag </italic>and <italic>Pol </italic>regions were also detected in turkey, guinea fowl and duck, suggesting the presence of similar genes in these species. Protein similarity of the five Ovex1 RT fragments follows the phylogenetic relationship of the bird species. This relation is indicative of the vertical transmission of an ERV integrated into the genome of a common ancestor of these birds, therefore before the split between Galloanserae (chicken, turkey, guinea fowl, duck...) and Neoaves (zebra finch...) some 122 Myr (million years) ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Investigation for similar sequences in Paleognathae (tinamou and ratites), which diverged from the lineage leading to other birds 139 Myr ago, would be necessary to ascertain the precise time of insertion.</p><p>Available data indicate that only one copy of the <italic>Ovex1 Gag</italic>-<italic>Pol </italic>region exists in the genome of chicken and zebra finch, in contrast to most ERVs that constitute families of related sequences derived from an initial integrated virus. This region is not closely related to other known avian retroviruses. According to the RT-based phylogenetic analysis, <italic>Ovex1 </italic>is mostly related to SnRV and class III retroviral elements but its relationship with these elements is very distant. Its closest relative is SpeV, an endogenous retrovirus of the tuatara (<italic>Sphenodon)</italic>, last representative of an archaic reptilian lineage that already existed 220 Myr ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. However the identity is rather low. In SpeV, only a part of the <italic>Pro </italic>and <italic>RT </italic>domains have been sequenced and the comparison is limited. More information would be required to confirm the relationship of these ERVs.</p><p>In contrast, the region of <italic>Ovex 1 ORF3 </italic>and the 3'UTR contain sequences similar to an ERV I repeated element and a fragment of CR1 that are similarly located in chicken and zebra finch DNA. This means that <italic>Ovex1 </italic>is likely a composite element and that the recombination events occurred in an ancestral genome before divergence of the two bird clades 122 Myr ago. Such a chimerism resulting from exchange of <italic>Pol </italic>and <italic>Env </italic>is frequently observed in the ERVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>The obvious deficiency of chicken and zebra finch <italic>Ovex1 </italic>in comparison with other ERVs is the absence of identifiable LTRs. However, two imperfect direct repeats, located in the regions at the start and end of the transcription unit are the presumable remnants of former LTRs. Retroviral LTRs, generated from a single template during reverse transcription of RNA into DNA, are identical at the time of integration into the host genome. Over time, they will diverge in sequence because of mutations occurring during cellular DNA replication. Differences between the two repeats can be used to estimate the time that has elapsed since the ERV integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The lack of full LTRs and the high divergence of the remaining 5' and 3' repeats are consistent with the ancient origin of <italic>Ovex1</italic>.</p><p>The great majority of ERVs, having suffered random mutations since their insertion, have accumulated deletions, frameshifts and stop-codons that interrupt their ORFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. In chicken <italic>Ovex1</italic>, all three ORFs are uninterrupted (though small deletions or local frameshifts might have remained undetected) and in zebra finch at least two of them. This is a rare event, unless the ERV has a very recent origin, which is not the case. <italic>In vivo </italic>translation of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>transcripts remains to demonstrate. However, conservation of the ORFs suggests the existence of a selection pressure acting to retain not only the RNA but also the encoded proteins. The effect of selection can be revealed by comparing the rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) nucleotide substitutions in chicken and zebra finch coding sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. dN/dS ratios &#x0003c;1 indicate the effect of a purifying selection acting to eliminate divergent protein sequences. <italic>Gag </italic>is under a strong purifying selection, with a dN/dS ratio of 0.08, close to the mean value (0.085) for genes located on macrochromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. <italic>Pol </italic>and <italic>ORF3</italic>, with dN/dS ratios of 0.18 and 0.16, display less constraint in the purifying selection. In addition, we detected a certain number of single nucleotide substitutions between the wild Red Jungle fowl and the White Leghorn chicken, a domestic strain derived from the same <italic>Gallus gallus </italic>ancestor after some 10,000 years of domestication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Most of these substitutions are silent (as seen in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> (Table S7, Polymorphisms in chicken <italic>Ovex1 </italic>sequences)). This is in support of an ongoing purifying selection that appears more stringent for <italic>Gag </italic>and <italic>Pol </italic>than for <italic>ORF3</italic>.</p><p><italic>Ovex1</italic>, devoid of homologous LTRs, is likely unable to propagate its sequence. Gag and Pol have retained enough conservation to be identified, but are nevertheless considerably different from proteins of other retroviruses. Important amino-acid residues implicated in viral enzyme activity are not present in chicken and zebra finch Ovex1 sequences whereas they are conserved in all retroviruses including Ovex1's closest relative, SpeV. RT and Int, if translated, are presumably inactive. The protein encoded by <italic>ORF3</italic>, if it is an envelope protein, appears also highly defective. Conservation of uninterrupted retroviral ORFs during more than 100 Myr despite the presence of a high number of presumably invalidating mutations can hardly occur just by chance and might indicate that these proteins fulfill some unknown biological function and are useful to the host.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>in chicken gonads</title><p>The <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization study shows that expression of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>is restricted to specific cells of the gonads and thus tightly controlled. This expression is characterized by L/R asymmetry and is dependent on sex differentiation. In both sexes, <italic>Ovex1 </italic>transcription is initiated at E5 in the cortex of left gonads before the onset of evident sex differentiation. At this stage, asymmetry of the gonads is already determined by the asymmetrical expression of <italic>Pitx2c </italic>in the epithelium of the left coelomic cavity, including the genital ridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In both sexes, Pitx2c inhibition of retinoic acid synthesis allows expression of <italic>ER-&#x003b1; </italic>and <italic>SF-1 </italic>and cortical cell proliferation in the left gonad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The patterns of expression of <italic>Pitx2c </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and <italic>Ovex1 </italic>at E5 and their transient expression in the left testis are rather similar, and it is plausible that Pitx2c controls <italic>Ovex1 </italic>expression, directly or indirectly. In this context, the presence of a conserved Pitx2 responsive element in the promoter region of chicken and zebra finch <italic>Ovex1 </italic>is interesting and deserves further study.</p><p>From E6 thereon, aromatase, the key enzyme of estrogen synthesis, is present in female gonads, not in male ones. Consequently, in female embryos, the cortex of the left gonad and both medullas, where the estrogen receptor ER-&#x003b1; is present, become direct physiological targets of estrogens. After E6 in the female, an increased and sustained transcription of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>occurs in the cortex of the left ovary and a low expression is observed in the medulla of both gonads. In the male, the cortical region of the left testis able to express <italic>Ovex1 </italic>becomes more and more limited. As <italic>Pitx2c </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], <italic>Ovex1 </italic>is no longer expressed at E18. The absence of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>transcription in testicular medullas suggests that estrogen stimulation might be required for the medullar expression. Estrogen deprivation by fadrozole treatment leads to the masculinization of female gonads with an inhibition of the left ovarian cortex development and the apparition in the medulla of epithelial structures analogous to testis cords. <italic>Ovex1 </italic>expression is strongly decreased in the medulla as well as in remnants of the cortical region, showing the requirement for estrogens to get a sustained expression. This effect might be due to a direct action of estrogens on the <italic>Ovex1 </italic>promoter but reflects also the role of the hormone in proliferation and/or differentiation of cortical and medullar cells able to express <italic>Ovex1</italic>.</p><p>During the embryonic differentiation of the ovary, most of the <italic>Ovex1</italic>-expressing cells are tightly associated with germ cells in the left cortex (or in close vicinity in the subcortical medulla). After hatching, they constitute the granulosa cell layer surrounding the oocyte in the forming follicles. This is in contrast with other markers of the granulosa like <italic>FoxL2</italic>, <italic>AMH </italic>and <italic>Wnt4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which are not expressed in cortical cells during embryogenesis, but in the medullar compartment, and start to be expressed in granulosa cells only when follicles form. The continuity of expression of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>makes this factor an interesting marker of the filiation between cortical somatic cells and granulosa cells.</p><p>The expression of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>enlightens the dramatic remodeling of the ovarian cortical surface that occurs around hatching preceding the folliculogenesis. The previously compact cortex, which contained nests of tightly packed meiotic germ cells and somatic cells covered by a continuous surface cell layer, suffers an important morphological change. The surface cell layer loses <italic>Ovex1 </italic>expression; patches of cells undergo apoptosis, and local disruptions lead to an exfoliation of the superficial region of the cortex. <italic>Ovex1</italic>-expressing cells appear to constitute a barrier resisting the desquamation process before follicle formation. A more limited phenomenon has been observed by scanning electron microscopy in human and mouse ovaries. The extrusion of germ cells and satellite somatic cells through temporary breaks of the ovarian surface epithelium under the pressure of the subjacent highly proliferating tissue has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Putative roles of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>in the gonads</title><p><italic>Ovex1 </italic>expression constitutes an interesting marker of ovarian morphogenesis in chicken, but can it be an actor in this process? In the male, the transient <italic>Ovex1 </italic>transcription in the left testis is dispensable for testis function since the right gonad becomes a functional testis despite the absence of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>expression. The same conclusion cannot be drawn for female gonads.</p><p>ERV transcription in vertebrates is not an exception and displays variable tissue specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. In mammals, expression of several ERV envelopes is detected in various cancer cells, in particular ovarian cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] and in several normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. However, the role of these retroviral proteins in vertebrate cells &#x02013; if they are translated &#x02013; is not often known. The unique but prototypical example is the recruitment of the fusogenic properties of retroviral envelopes for the specific mammalian function of placenta morphogenesis. HERV-W and HERV-FRD envelope proteins, named syncytin 1 and 2, are responsible for trophoblast cell fusion in placenta syncytiotrophoblast formation in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Envelope proteins of various retroviruses have been independently recruited to fulfill the same function in other mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. However, it does not seem that embryonic ovary differentiation involves cell fusion. Another positive role of ERVs for the vertebrate host is protecting cells against infection by viruses of the same family. Endogenous envelope proteins saturate viral cell receptors, thus preventing exogenous virus entry. In addition, the Gag protein of MuERV has been shown to be closely related to the murine Fv1 gene that controls the replication of MMLV and prevents disease in mice infected by this retrovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Such a role might be useful in the ovary.</p><p>It is noticeable that <italic>Ovex1 </italic>is not the only retroviral sequence expressed in the embryonic chicken ovary. <italic>FET-1 </italic>(female expressed transcript 1), a W-chromosome gene asymmetrically expressed in the left ovarian cortex between E4.5 and E6 has also a retroviral origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We found that it is similar to the consensus GGLTR7A retrovirus (described in RepBase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] over 87% of its length and encodes potentially an Env-like protein with similarity to the HERV-FRD Env protein (syncytin 2). A common role and/or a common regulation of <italic>FET-1 </italic>and <italic>Ovex1 </italic>might be investigated. To speculate further about the function of <italic>Ovex1 </italic>(and <italic>FET-1</italic>) in the ovary, it would be necessary first to establish whether the encoded proteins are actually translated, and if so, whether they retain viral functions, in particular if the putative envelope possess fusogenic properties. Alternatively, these proteins might have acquired new functions. The presence of nuclear localization signals and of a leucine zipper motif in Ovex1 Gag protein suggests a possible role in nuclear regulations.</p><p>In a recent screening for ESTs present in adult hen ovarian follicles, an EST [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EC912004">EC912004</ext-link>] that corresponds to <italic>Ovex1 </italic>has been found to be expressed at a rate 6-time lower in hen ovaries of a chicken strain selected for its high egg production, compared with another strain with low egg production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. <italic>Ovex1</italic>, which is expressed in supporting somatic cells in close contact with germ cells in the embryonic cortex and in follicles up to adulthood, might play a role in regulating hen fertility at different stages: germ cell proliferation, meiosis, folliculogenesis, follicular survival or rate of follicle recruitment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Ovex1 </italic>is an ERV present in both chicken and zebra finch genomes. Similar sequences are detected in three other domestic birds. Sequencing of more bird and reptile genomes will presumably enlarge the family of <italic>Ovex1</italic>-containing species. Unlike most ERVs that are represented in the host genome by a family of related sequences, most of the <italic>Ovex1 </italic>sequence (<italic>Gag </italic>and <italic>Pol </italic>regions) exists as a unique copy in the genome of chicken and zebra finch. However, these genomes are not fully investigated and random divergence of elements inserted more than 100 Myr ago may impair their identification. The conserved copy of this ERV might have been preserved because of a specific function. Specifically expressed in the gonads, <italic>Ovex1 </italic>constitutes an interesting marker of the granulosa cell lineage useful for the study of ovarian morphogenesis. The future objective will be to determine if it is only a witness or if it is an actor. The involvement of a retroviral element in crucial processes of the ovarian development would be very exciting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>RNA preparation</title><p>Commercial White Leghorn chicken eggs were incubated at 38&#x000b0;C.

The insert of each clone was PCR-amplified, using PCR-Select nested primers 1 (5'TCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT3') and 2R (5'AGCGTGGTCGCGGCCGAGGT3'). Four identical macroarrays were prepared by spotting 2-&#x003bc;L aliquots of each PCR reaction mixture on nylon membranes (Hybond-N<sup>+</sup>, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Denaturation of the DNA was achieved by blotting the membranes onto 0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl-impregnated Whatman 3 MM paper for 2 min, followed by neutralization with 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH7.4, 1.5 M NaCl for 5 min and 3xSSC for 5 min, under the same conditions. Dry membranes were then exposed to ultraviolet light (0.6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) to perform DNA cross-linking.
