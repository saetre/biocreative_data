By use of UV-crosslinking experiments between the peptide and its salivary gland target protein, we have identified the <italic>Anopheles</italic> salivary protein, saglin, as the receptor for SM1. Furthermore, by use of an anti-SM1 antibody, we have determined that the peptide is a mimotope of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoite Thrombospondin Related Anonymous Protein (TRAP). TRAP binds to saglin with high specificity. Point mutations in TRAP's binding domain A abrogate binding, and binding is competed for by the SM1 peptide. Importantly, <italic>in vivo</italic> down-regulation of saglin expression results in strong inhibition of salivary gland invasion. Together, the results suggest that saglin/TRAP interaction is crucial for salivary gland invasion by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Transmission of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the causative agent of malaria, requires the completion of a complex life cycle in the mosquito, which includes invasion of the salivary glands. This invasion depends on the recognition of mosquito salivary gland surface components by the parasite.

Thus, the complex life cycle of the parasite in the mosquito constitutes a potential weak link that could be exploited for malaria control.</p><p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> transmission is initiated with the ingestion by the female mosquito, of gametocytes from an infected individual. Soon after ingestion, gametocytes differentiate into male and female gametes that mate to produce zygotes within the mosquito midgut. Within the next day, these differentiate into motile ookinetes that invade the midgut epithelium. After emerging on the hemocoel side, ookinetes differentiate into sessile oocysts that mature one or two weeks later (depending on <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species) releasing thousands of sporozoites into the open hemolymph circulation. Of all mosquito tissues and cell types that the sporozoites come in contact with, they invade only one: the salivary glands. The transmission cycle is completed when an infected mosquito bites another individual releasing some of its sporozoites.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that sporozoite invasion of the salivary gland requires specific receptor-ligand interactions.

It was therefore possible that the SM1 peptide binds to a carbohydrate that is common to the two epithelia. In a preliminary test, we tested for the ability of eight different lectins to bind to salivary glands.

When salivary glands were treated with sodium periodate, binding of WGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000265-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and several other lectins (results not shown) was lost, indicating that this treatment results in effective removal of surface carbohydrates. Importantly, binding of SM1 was unimpaired by periodate treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000265-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that SM1 does not bind to a carbohydrate moiety.

Yet, exhaustive data base searches for <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins with sequence similarity to SM1 did not reveal any viable candidates. We reasoned that SM1 peptide conformation (rather than primary sequence) may be related to that of a sporozoite protein involved in salivary gland invasion.
