They have been implicated in growth regulation and have been shown to be involved in both pre-mRNA and pre-rRNA processing. More recently, however, these proteins have been reported to act as transcriptional co-activators for estrogen-receptor alpha (ER&#x003b1;). Furthermore these proteins were shown to interact with co-activators p300/CBP and the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Taken together these reports suggest a role for p68 and p72 in transcriptional activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this report we show that p68 and p72 can, in some contexts, act as transcriptional repressors. Targeting of p68 or p72 to constitutive promoters leads to repression of transcription; this repression is promoter-specific. Moreover both p68 and p72 associate with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), a well-established transcriptional repression protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is therefore clear that p68 and p72 are important transcriptional regulators, functioning as co-activators and/or co-repressors depending on the context of the promoter and the transcriptional complex in which they exist.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The DEAD/H box family of RNA helicases has been demonstrated to be involved in virtually all processes that require manipulation of RNA including transcription, pre-mRNA and pre-rRNA processing, RNA export, ribosome assembly and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Although, <italic>in vitro</italic>, several members of this family have been shown to unwind RNA duplexes, relatively few appear to be true processive helicases and it is clear that, in the cell, many are likely to be involved in unwinding of short base paired regions of RNA or in the modulation of RNA-protein interactions.</p><p>DNA helicases belong to a superfamily of proteins that is distantly related to DEAD/H box RNA helicases and includes the Werner syndrome protein (WRN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and the Xeroderma pigmentosum XPB and XPD proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], which have well established roles in transcription. Although the functions of DEAD/H box RNA helicases in other cellular processes, such as pre-mRNA processing and translation have been well studied, their role in transcriptional regulation is only now emerging. Examples of DEAD/H box RNA helicases involved in transcription include RNA helicase II (RHII/Gu) and RNA helicase A (RHA/NDHII). RHII/Gu was demonstrated to be a cofactor for c-Jun-activated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and was shown to translocate from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm after UV or anisomycin treatment (which activates JNK signalling). Although RHII/Gu was found to associate with phosphorylated c-Jun in a non-phosphorylated state, this association was observed to increase after anisomycin treatment, implying a stronger interaction when c-Jun is phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. RHA is a homologue of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>maleless (MLE) gene product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and is thought to be important for gene dosage compensation on the X-chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. RHA has been shown to be required for complex formation between the transcriptional co-activator, CREB binding protein (CBP), and RNA polymerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, different regions of the RNA helicase protein were found to interact with both CBP and RNA polymerase II. The association of RHA with RNA polymerase II was further investigated, and narrowed down to a 50 amino acid stretch, outwith the conserved helicase motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; this study also showed that RHA could regulate CREB-dependent transcription either through recruitment of Pol II or by ATP-dependent mechanisms. A later study reported that RHA acts as a bridging molecule between the breast tumour specific transcriptional activator, BRCA1 and the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These reports thus provide clear evidence of a role for RNA helicases as transcription factors.</p><p>p68 is a prototypic member of the DEAD box family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and an established RNA helicase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The subsequent discovery of p72 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the finding that p68 and p72 share remarkable homology (90% over the central conserved core and 60% and 30% at the N- and C-terminal extensions respectively) suggests that these proteins may form a specific sub-group of DEAD box proteins and may have similar, but perhaps subtly different, functions in the cell, perhaps through interaction with different RNA substrates or proteins. <italic>In vitro</italic>, both proteins exhibit the RNA-dependent ATPase and RNA helicase activities characteristic of members of the DEAD box family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and have also been reported to catalyse rearrangement of RNA structure via branch migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover p68 and p72 can interact with each other, as well as self-associate, and appear to preferentially form heterodimers in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This provides the potential for a wide range of functions for p68 and p72 with the possibility of their co-operation in some contexts.</p><p>More recently p68 and p72 have been shown to be involved in a range of processes in the cell, including pre-mRNA and pre-rRNA processing and alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. p68 and p72 have also been shown to be growth- and developmentally-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and, furthermore, p68 appears to be over-expressed and poly-ubiquitylated in colorectal tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly p68 has been shown to act as a transcriptional co-activator, specific for the activation function 1 (AF-1) domain of estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This interaction was dependent upon phosphorylation of AF-1 at serine<sup>118</sup>, a residue phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Interestingly the RNA helicase function of p68 appeared to be dispensable for this activity as a mutant p68 (Lys<sup>144 </sup>to Arg) in the ATP binding site (conserved motif I) retained the ability to co-activate ER&#x003b1;, although in a later study RNA binding appeared to be required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. p72 was subsequently shown to share this property and both proteins were shown to interact with the activation domain 2 (AD2) of p160 co-activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Furthermore p68 was also found to interact with the CBP co-activator and RNA polymerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. More recently p68 has been shown to be recruited to the promoter of the ER&#x003b1; target gene pS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], suggesting a direct involvement in transcriptional regulation.</p><p>In this report we explore further potential mechanisms through which p68 and p72 may contribute to transcriptional regulation. We find that, in some contexts, p68 and p72 can also act as transcriptional repressors and that these proteins exhibit clear promoter specificity in this function. By directing GAL4-tagged p68/p72 (GAL4 DNA binding domain aa1-147) to promoters containing GAL4 binding sites, we show that both p68 and p72 can repress transcription from the <italic>herpes </italic>virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter but not the simian virus 40 promoter/enhancer. Moreover, while p72 can repress transcription from the <italic>Adenovirus </italic>major late promoter, p68 appears to have no effect, suggesting that these proteins do not behave in an identical way in all contexts. Furthermore we show, by co-immunoprecipitation, that both p68 and p72 interact with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and that HDAC1/p68/p72 co-elute by gel filtration, indicating that they exist in the same complex in the cell and suggesting a possible mechanism by which these proteins may exert their repressive effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>p68 and p72 differentially repress constitutively active promoters/enhancers</title><p>In order to determine whether, in addition to their reported role as co-activator proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], p68 and p72 helicases have any intrinsic transcriptional activity we generated plasmids to express p68-/p72-GAL4 DNA binding domain (aa1-147) fusion proteins (p68G4 and p72G4). U2OS cells were then co-transfected with p68G4, p72G4, or GAL4-tagged pcDNA3 (pcG4) plasmid as a control, and a <italic>Herpes virus </italic>thymidine kinase promoter/chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter plasmid (TK-CAT) bearing 5 copies of the GAL4 binding site, and CAT activity was measured in standard assays. The amount of TK-CAT used had previously been titrated to give a basal level of activity within the linear range of measurement in the CAT assay system used (data not shown). Interestingly, we observed a marked decrease in CAT activity for both p68G4 and p72G4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). This was confirmed using other cell lines, including MCF-7 and 293 HEK (data not shown). As many transcription factors have been shown to act differentially depending upon promoter context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we also tested the transcriptional activity of p68 and p72 with the <italic>Adenovirus </italic>major late promoter (MLP-CAT), and the SV40 promoter/enhancer (SV40-CAT). In each case we used the same amount of p68G4/p72G4 DNA as previously and appropriate amounts of the reporter constructs that would give similar basal levels of CAT activity using the GAL4 control plasmid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). The amounts of reporter plasmid DNA transfected had again been titrated previously to give similar basal levels, which were within the linear range (data not shown). We also confirmed that p68 and p72 were not limiting under these conditions (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref> and data not shown). Surprisingly p68 and p72 acted differentially with the MLP promoter, with p72 acting as a repressor, while p68 had no significant effect on CAT activity. Furthermore, neither p68 nor p72 repressed transcription from the simian virus 40 promoter/enhancer (SV40-CAT-Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Western blotting, using an antibody against GAL4 confirmed that p68 and p72 were expressed at similar levels in these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Taken together these results reveal not only that p68 and p72 appear to have a previously unknown transcriptional repressive ability, but also that this activity is variable depending on the promoter context.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Effect of GAL4-tagged p68 and p72 on transcriptional activity as measured by CAT assays using the TK-CAT, MLP-CAT and SV40-CAT promoter-reporter plasmids, each harbouring 5 copies of a GAL4 binding site fused to the promoter.

In each case U2OS cells were co-transfected with pcG4 or plasmids expressing GAL4-tagged p68/p72 (p68G4/p72G4) and the appropriate promoter-reporter construct.

In this experiment neither p68 nor p72 significantly reduce transcription of the TK-CAT reporter, suggesting that the repression observed with the GAL4-tagged p68/p72 plasmids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) is not due to competing out of an essential factor required for TK-CAT transcription but, instead, implies an active mechanism of repression in which the p68/p72 proteins are required to be directed to the TK-CAT promoter via the GAL4 tag.</p><p>The possibility still remained that p68 and p72 were repressing transcription by direct interference with the transcriptional machinery of the TK-CAT promoter (e.g. perhaps by physically blocking the promoter). To rule out this possibility, we used a similar TK-CAT promoter construct, which had, however, a 1.6 kb DNA 'spacer' between the GAL4 binding sites and the promoter (the inserted DNA is reported to have no effect on transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). Both GAL4-p68 and -p72 retained the ability to repress transcription, almost to the same degree as previously (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Furthermore, a titration using the GAL4- p68/p72 fusion proteins clearly shows a dose-dependent concentration curve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>) as would be expected for active repression. In addition, p68 and p72 have been observed to interact with p300/CBP co-activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore it remained possible that the observed transcriptional repression was due to competition for, or interference with, p300/CBP. If this were the case co-expression of p300/CBP would be expected to relieve repression by p68/p72. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>, no such relief of expression was observed. Thus our findings that transcriptional repression by p68/p72 was dose-dependent and not due to steric blocking of the promoter or competition/interference with p300/CBP, suggest that it is an active process.</p></sec><sec><title>Deletion experiments do not identify a distinct repression domain for p68 or p72 but reveal an activation domain</title><p>To determine whether specific regions or domains of p68 and p72 act as transcriptional repressors, we performed CAT assays, again using the TK-CAT reporter, but with a range of deletion derivatives of p68/p72 covering the entire coding region. Deletion derivatives encompassing domains between amino acids 1&#x02013;478 and 1&#x02013;474 for p68 and p72 respectively repressed transcription in this assay while the C-terminal region for both proteins (aa 477&#x02013;614 for p68 and 468&#x02013;650 for p72) acted as a strong transcriptional activator (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a,3b</xref>). Residues 1&#x02013;478 of p68 and 1&#x02013;474 of p72 include all the conserved motifs that characterise the DEAD box family of proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Within this conserved core we have shown that there are three domains, which can independently repress transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>), while the complete region (aa 1&#x02013;478/474) can repress as well as the full-length respective proteins. Additionally, the finding that the C-terminal regions of p68 and p72 activate transcription is consistent with earlier reports of transcriptional activation by p68/p72 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, ATPase inactive mutants of p68 and p72 (in which the DEAD motif had been mutated to NEAD) as well as the more recently identified p82 (a derivative of p72 which uses an alternative non-AUG upstream translation initiation codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) also repress transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Thus ATPase and helicase activity appear to be dispensable for transcriptional repression suggesting that this function of p68/p72 may not specifically require RNA unwinding; again this is consistent with reports that helicase activity is not required for co-activation of ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] although another report suggested that p68 helicase activity is required for synergism with the transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Deletion mapping of potential repression/activation domains in a) p68 and b) p72 as observed in CAT assays using the TK-CAT promoter-reporter plasmid.

Additional proteins tested in this assay included the ATPase/helicase GAL4-tagged inactive mutants of p68/p72 (p68N/p72N) and the alternative upstream initiation product of the p72 gene (p82).

To test whether the observed transcriptional repression by p68 and p72 was dependent on HDAC activity, CAT activity assays were performed as before, using the TK-CAT and MLP-CAT reporter plasmids, in the presence and absence of the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). The relief of repression by TSA was then determined for p68-/p72-GAL4 compared with that observed for the GAL4 vector alone since TSA will also increase basal levels of transcription. No effect was observed with the TK-CAT promoter (data not shown). For the MLP-CAT promoter repression was relieved two-fold in the case of p72 while no effect was seen with p68 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). This is not surprising since p68 does not repress transcription from this promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These findings therefore suggest that HDAC activity appears to be important for transcriptional repression of the MLP promoter by p72 and imply that repression of the TK-CAT may employ a different mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The involvement of HDAC activity in transcriptional repression by p68/p72. a) Relief of p68/p72 repression of MLP-CAT transcription by TSA. 1 &#x003bc;g of pcDNA3-GAL4 (pcG4) or GAL4-tagged p68/p72 (p68G4/p72G4) were co-transfected with 9 &#x003bc;g of MLP-CAT and TSA was added 16 hr after transfection, at a final concentration of 300 nM.

Plasmids expressing myc-tagged p68 and p72 were expressed in 293 cells (with myc tag plasmid vector as a negative control) and the tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the myc epitope antibody, 9E10. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated protein bound to the antibody, as confirmed by western blotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>), were then used in an HDAC activity assay (Biomol) in the presence and absence of TSA. In this assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>) p72 was found to co-immunoprecipitate a HDAC activity, which is abolished by TSA, while p68 did not. These findings are consistent with p72 interacting with a HDAC and repressing transcription in a HDAC-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>p68 and p72 associate with HDAC1 in cells</title><p>Three classes of HDACs have been described. Class I HDACs, which include HDAC1, 2 and 8, are expressed in the nucleus and have been shown to bind several transcription factors and to mediate transcriptional repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Since HDAC1 is the prototypical member (in mammalian cells) and has been well studied we decided to examine whether p68 and/or p72 associate with HDAC1 in cells. We had previously shown that a large proportion of p68 and p72 co-elute by gel filtration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore we examined fractions from a DNAse/RNAse-treated 293 cell lysate, which had been separated by gel filtration, by western blotting using antibodies against p68, p72 and HDAC1, and showed that a significant proportion of HDAC1 co-elutes with the majority of p72 and a substantial proportion of p68 in the cell in complexes that are of a size consistent with p68/p72 interacting with HDAC1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Since co-elution does not, in itself, indicate an interaction, we went on to examine whether p68 and or p72 co-immunoprecipitate with HDAC1 from cell lysates. For p68, nuclear extracts were prepared from U2OS cells and HDAC1 was immunoprecipitated with an HDAC1-specific antibody. Immunopreciptiated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and the presence of p68 was detected by western blotting with a p68-specific antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). As currently available antibodies against p72 cross react with other nuclear proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] 293 cells were transfected with myc-tagged p72 and interactions between the myc-tagged p72 and HDAC1 were examined. In this case, therefore, nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected cells, HDAC1 was immunoprecipitated as before and associated myc-tagged p72 was detected by western blotting using the myc epitope-specific antibody, 9E10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). In each case, the presence of HDAC1 in the immunoprecipitate was confirmed by western blotting with the HDAC1-specific antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a,6b</xref>). As an additional control we carried out a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment in which nuclear extracts from 293 cells transfected with myc-tagged p68/p72 were prepared, the myc-tagged p68/p72 proteins were immunoprecipitated using the myc epitope-specific antibody and associated HDAC1 was detected by western blotting using the HDAC1-specific antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). Cells that had not been transfected were used as a control. Additionally, since deletion derivatives encompassing residues 1&#x02013;478 of p68 and 1&#x02013;474 of p72 can repress transcription as well as the respective full-length proteins, we examined whether these deletions could co-immunoprecipitate with HDAC1. We therefore transfected 293 cells with GAL4-tagged proteins containing residues 1&#x02013;478 of p68 and 1&#x02013;474 of p72, prepared nuclear extracts, immunoprecipitated HDAC1 and western blotted for associated GAL4-tagged p68/p72 with a GAL4-specific antibody. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>, these deletion derivatives co-immunoprecipitate efficiently with HDAC1, suggesting that this region of p68/72 interacts with HDAC1. These findings thus indicate that p68 and p72 associate with HDAC1 in cells and that the interaction appears to be mediated by the regions which, in our system, are responsible for the transcriptional repression activity of p68 and p72. Moreover, since the immunoprecipitations were performed with extracts that had been treated with DNase/RNase (see Materials and Methods), the interactions of p68/p72 and HDAC1 are not mediated by nucleic acid.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Western blots showing gel filtration elution profiles of p68, p72 and HDAC1. p68, p72 and HDAC1 in the fractions were detected by western blotting using appropriate antibodies.

When targeted to the TK-CAT promoter-reporter construct they both strongly repress transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Furthermore, this transcriptional repression does not appear to be due to either squelching or physical blocking of the transcription apparatus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), implying an active transcriptional mechanism. Moreover repression of TK-CAT was observed in several cell lines (U2OS, 293, MCF-7) suggesting that it is not cell line dependent. In order to determine whether this repression activity exhibited any promoter specificity we also tested the ability of p68 and p72 to repress transcription of other constitutively active promoter-reporter constructs with high basal levels of transcription, namely MLP-CAT and SV40-CAT. Interestingly MLP-CAT revealed a difference in the ability of p68 and p72 to repress transcription, with p72 strongly repressing transcription of this promoter-reporter and p68 having no effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This observation suggests that, although highly homologous (70% overall identity at the amino acid level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]) p68 and p72 proteins may act differently in some contexts, perhaps through the association with different protein partners. Neither p68 nor p72 repressed transcription of SV40-CAT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) suggesting that the repression by p68 and p72 is promoter context-dependent, an observation that has been reported for other transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These findings thus are consistent with the observed repression activity of p68/p72 being an active process. Interestingly, in this context, another DEAD box protein DP103 (Ddx20) has been found to act as a co-repressor of the Ets repressor METS/PE1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Using a series of deletion derivatives of p68 and p72 we identified three domains, within the core conserved among the DEAD box family of proteins, which can independently repress transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Moreover regions encompassing residues 1&#x02013;478 of p68 and 1&#x02013;474 of p72, which contain the complete conserved core (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>), can repress transcription as well as the respective full-length proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a,3b</xref>). In contrast, the C-terminal extension of both proteins acts as a transcriptional activator in this context (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) consistent with earlier reports of these proteins acting as transcriptional co-activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, using this system, we have shown that there are separable transcriptional repression and activation domains within p68 and p72.</p><p>Since HDAC proteins have been extensively implicated in the repression of transcription, it was important to examine whether these proteins are likely to play a role in transcriptional repression by p68 and/or p72. Firstly, the ability of the HDAC inhibitor, TSA, to relieve repression was examined. No effect was observed on repression of TK-CAT (data not shown) implying the involvement of a HDAC-independent mechanism in repression of the TK promoter. In contrast, repression of MLP-CAT by p72 was relieved two-fold compared with the vector control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) suggesting the involvement of HDACs in this process. (Since p68 did not repress MLP-CAT transcription, the lack of effect by TSA is not surprising.) Supporting these data, p72 was found to co-immunoprecipitate a HDAC activity which was abolished by the addition of TSA, while p68 did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). We chose to investigate whether p68 and/or p72 associate with HDAC1, since it is a well-studied example of Class I HDACs. Both p68 and p72 co-immunoprecipitate with HDAC1 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>); furthermore HDAC1, p68 and p72 co-elute in similar sized complexes by gel-filtration, which are of an appropriate size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) supporting the idea of interactions between p68/p72 and HDAC1 in cells. Moreover, the finding that these proteins co-immunoprecipitate and co-elute from extracts which had been treated with DNase/RNase suggest that these represent protein-protein interactions rather than merely interactions via nucleic acid. While an interaction between HDAC1 and p68 is not supported by the results of the HDAC assay, or the TSA experiment, it is possible that, in some instances, p68 does recruit HDAC1 and that this mechanism is not being triggered in the MLP-CAT assay or HDAC assay. Alternatively, it is possible that the observed co-immunoprecipitation of p68 and HDAC1 is occurring through the interaction between p68 and p72 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or that HDAC1 associated with p68 may have other, possibly non-transcriptional, roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, the data are entirely consistent with p72 recruiting HDAC1 to achieve active repression of transcription. Future investigations should also reveal whether the differential ability of p68 and p72 to recruit <italic>active </italic>HDAC proteins is responsible for the difference observed upon the MLP promoter.</p><p>Our attempts at correlating the different repressive functions of p68 and p72 to specific domains of the respective proteins, using deletion derivatives, were unsuccessful, as the equivalent regions of both either caused transcriptional repression or activation. While this might suggest that both helicases repress transcription in the same manner, it is more likely that the HDAC recruitment by p72 may be an additional mechanism of repression, used at specific promoters. We also cannot rule out the recruitment of other repression complexes at this stage. Our findings that p68 and p72 differ in their ability to repress the MLP promoter and to recruit HDAC activity suggest that, at least in some contexts, p68 and p72 repress transcription by different mechanisms.</p><p>In summary, it is clear that p68 and p72 act to repress transcription in a differential manner dependent upon promoter context. It will be important to determine which endogenous promoters are subject to repression by p68/p72 in a physiological context. However, until the signal transduction pathways, which target these proteins to the appropriate promoters, are elucidated it will be necessary to use a targeting system (such as GAL4) to undertake a molecular analysis of transcriptional repression by p68 and p72. Since it is now clear that p68/p72 can act both to activate and repress transcription future work will involve dissection of the transcriptional activation/repression complexes in which p68 and p72 are involved, as well as characterisation of the molecular 'switch' which determines whether these proteins will be part of transcriptional activation or repression complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that the highly related RNA helicases p68 and p72 can repress transcription in a promoter context-dependent manner. Both proteins associate with HDAC1, a well-established transcriptional repressor protein. Strikingly, however, p68 and p72 behave differently in their ability to repress transcription from different promoters and in their ability to recruit HDAC activity suggesting that they may, at least in some contexts, repress transcription by different mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>U2OS human osteosarcoma cells and 293 human embryo kidney cells were maintained at 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C in DMEM with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin (all supplied by Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>A pcDNA3-GAL4 expression plasmid was used to express full-length and deletion derivatives of p68/p72/p82 tagged at the N-terminus with the DNA binding domain (amino acids 1&#x02013;147) of GAL4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].
