In the postgenomic era, it is recognised that one such key organisational step lies in the formation and regulation of multiprotein complexes. The capacity of one protein to bind to and modify the function of another, through such diverse mechanisms as covalent modification, steric hindrance, protein bridging, or restriction of subcellular location, provides a level of control that individual proteins cannot achieve alone &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Recent high-throughput postgenomic technologies have opened the way to identify proteins and their interacting partners. Of these techniques, three complementary approaches are most widely used: yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analyses, which allow the identification of potential binary protein interactions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;; cellular proteomic purification techniques, coupled with mass spectrometry, which can be used to isolate intact protein complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;; and RNA interference (RNAi) analysis, which provides functional information on individual proteins and their known interactors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The organisation of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton by MT-associated proteins (MAPs) provides one example of how protein&#x02013;protein interactions regulate function. MTs play diverse and important roles in many cellular processes. These dynamic protein polymers form from dimers of two related proteins, &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-tubulin, that exist in a soluble, cytosolic pool and that incorporate into existing MTs with predetermined polarity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. In most animal cells, MTs are nucleated from and anchored at an organising centre, the centrosome, which resides juxtaposed to the nuclear envelope. The intrinsic polarity of the MT can therefore be translated into subcellular positional information, allowing the efficient transport of materials from one location to another &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, the ability of MTs to grow and shrink dynamically provides a single cell with the capacity to form multiple populations of MTs possessing different functional properties at a single point in time &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. This elaborate temporal and spatial organisation of MT function within the cell is regulated, in a large part, by the proteins that interact with MTs, so-called MAPs. Although the term was originally applied to structural proteins isolated from axons, which bind to and stabilise MTs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, MAPs can equally describe any protein that associates with MTs in vitro or in vivo, including MT motors and their cargoes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, proteins that bind MT ends &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, or those that associate with MTs in a cell cycle&#x02013;dependent manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Many MAPs elicit their effects as part of multiprotein complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b018">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, due to the ability of many MAPs to directly or indirectly affect MT dynamics during cell division, proteins that associate with MTs have been widely explored as potential anticancer targets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. We have taken a combinatorial approach to identify MAP complexes with roles in cell cycle regulation and mitosis, from the fruit fly <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos are an ideal tissue from which to isolate MTs and associated MAPs of this nature &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our analysis identified 270 MAPs from early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, 83 of which are encoded by previously uncharacterised genes. By subsequently combining a secondary RNAi screen with a bioinformatics analysis based primarily on Y2H data, we have identified a MAP complex containing the Skp1 homolog, SkpA, and a novel protein we term SkAP. We confirm that SkpA and SkAP associate with each other in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, localise to centrosomes, and show that both proteins regulate centrosome duplication in vivo. Our approach is therefore able to identify novel MAP complexes with important roles in mitosis and cell cycle regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Over 250 Proteins Associate with MTs in Early <italic>Drosophila</italic> Embryos</title><p>In order to identify MAPs from early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, we made use of a well-characterised and previously described MT cosedimentation assay &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. In this assay, a cytoplasmic extract of 0&#x02013;4-h-old embryos is incubated at 25 &#x000b0;C in the presence of GTP to promote the polymerisation of endogenous tubulin. Subsequent addition of Taxol drives further MT polymerisation by lowering the critical concentration of MT growth, and irreversibly stabilises the MTs formed. By centrifuging this MT-enriched extract through a dense cushion of sucrose at 4 &#x000b0;C, MTs and MAPs pellet together, while other proteins remain in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

To ensure that the features present in the MT-MAP pellet were consistent between experiments, we repeated the cosedimentation assay on three separate occasions. In addition, we undertook a control experiment in which Taxol was excluded from the extract. Any MTs initially formed in this control extract depolymerise prior to centrifugation. Therefore, proteins present in the control pellet constitute contaminants. Such a control pellet contained approximately 200-fold less protein than the MT-MAP pellet, and identified only approximately 80 features (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060098-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). Using customised image analysis software to compare individual experiments (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>), and to exclude features present on the control gel, we identified 592 common MT-MAP features. As a complementary approach, we also analysed the MT-MAP pellet using 1D PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Although 2D PAGE provides much greater resolution of lower molecular weight proteins than 1D PAGE, it is not suitable for resolving high molecular weight proteins. In agreement with previous studies, we found many distinct MAP bands ranging in size from 25 kDa to greater than 250 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). No features were visible by 1D gel electrophoresis when similar proportions of the control pellet were analysed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060098-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B).</p><p>To determine the identities of the proteins cosedimenting with MTs from early embryo extracts, we used MS. Given the high number of features identified using 2D PAGE, we chose to analyse a total of 300 features on the basis of spot intensity. To minimise the likelihood of identifying posttranslationally modified forms of the same protein, we avoided cutting more than one spot from a cluster in the same region of the gel; one phosphorylation usually induces a pI shift of 0.2 units of pH towards the acidic end of the gel with almost no detectable change of molecular weight (e.g., red box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In addition, we avoided the large tubulin features present at approximately 50 kDa (arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In the 1D gel experiment, the lane was excised and cut into 31 blocks. Following reduction, alkylation, trypsin digestion, and peptide extraction of spots or blocks, the 2D and 1D protein mixtures were analysed using liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS). Raw spectra were processed, and the peak lists searched in-house using Mascot Daemon 2.1. MS analysis of the 2D PAGE MT-MAP pellet identified 239 proteins, whereas 113 proteins were identified from the 1D PAGE gel blocks. Searching against a randomised database, we estimate the false-positive rate for the combined 2D gel spots and 1D gel LC-MSMS experiment to be 2.4&#x00025;. By combining the two approaches, and after removal of redundant and low-scoring hits, we identified 270 potential MAPs from early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060098-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>To initially validate the results of the cosedimentation assay and the MS, we chose ten MAPs for which antibodies were readily available and confirmed their ability to cosediment with MTs using Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Additionally, we analysed their localisation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Whereas some of these were proteins already known to bind or localise to MT populations (e.g., D-TACC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; and Klp10A &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;), others had not previously been shown to associate with MTs (e.g., eIF-4E, Reptin, and G&#x003b2;13F). We were able to confirm that nine of the ten proteins both bound to MTs in vitro and localised to MT structures in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g001">1</xref>E). In addition, although antibodies against the remaining protein, Patj, failed to recognise any specific bands on Western blots, they recognised central spindle and midbody MTs in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Therefore, we can be confident that our proteomic approach is able to identify previously unidentified MAPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Proteins That Associate with MTs Have Diverse Cellular Functions</title><p>Although our approach did not detect some proteins previously shown to bind MTs in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (e.g., CP60, Asp, and DmINCENP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b030">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;), it identified many more proteins with the ability to bind MTs than anticipated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. To classify the 270 proteins on a functional basis, we first characterised the MAPs according to the Gene Ontology (GO) database &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d; supported by additional manual data mining of previously published work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060098-st002">Table S2</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-0060098-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Functional Classification of 270 Drosophila Embryonic MAPs</title><p>A pie chart showing the classification of identified MAPs according to Gene Ontologies, assisted by manual data mining of references in Flybase.

Interestingly, although 126 MAPs (47&#x00025;) do not have a primary ontology suggesting MT binding, there is evidence that many of these do, in fact, function in association with MTs. For example, four proteins classed within the &#x0201c;Translation&#x0201d; GO, eIF4E, Cup, Mat31B, and Aubergine have all been shown to be involved in the regulation of Oskar ribonucleoprotein (RNP) translation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Components of this complex, which is essential for posterior patterning in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte, are localised in a MT-dependent manner, so it is not perhaps surprising that they associate with MTs in the early embryo. Some proteins, classed with &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d; functions, have also been shown to have roles in MT organisation during mitosis, although this is not described as their primary ontology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060098-st002">Table S2</xref>). For example, Calmodulin has recently been shown to directly bind the MAP Asp during mitosis, and RNAi against Calmodulin leads to defects in spindle morphology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We also identified a number of MAPs for which there are currently no data suggesting an association with MTs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but that possess homologs that have been shown to localise to MT populations. For example, we identified many components of the nuclear pore complex. Of these, Ran was placed within the ontology &#x0201c;Mitosis/Cell Cycle&#x0201d; due to its clear role in chromatin-mediated MT nucleation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. However, other subunits, such as Pendulin (Importin &#x003b1;), Karyopherin &#x003b2;, fs(2) Ketel (Importin &#x003b2;), Nup358 (RanBP2), and Nup 214/CAN were placed within the &#x0201c;Nuclear Envelope&#x0201d; category.

Although methodology and scoring of hits differed between that screen and ours, we found significant overlap between the studies. Of the 83 uncharacterised MAPs identified here, the Goshima screen positively identified ten with RNAi phenotypes, all of which we independently recorded as strong hits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060098-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060098-st004">S4</xref>).

Computer algorithms were constructed to identify binary interactions within the MAP dataset.</p><p>Of our 270 MAPs, in-house computer algorithms identified interaction data for 216. An analysis of the binary protein interactions between these proteins identified 66 MAPs, contributing to 92 interactions (counting both &#x0201c;A&#x02013;B&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;B&#x02013;A&#x0201d;) within 21 putative complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). As all of these proteins were originally isolated on the basis of their association with MTs, we would expect binary interactions to occur between the MAPs with a higher frequency than between a set of randomly selected proteins. To test this hypothesis, computer algorithms were devised to randomly select a set of 216 <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins obtained from Flybase, and count the pairwise interactions of that set. This analysis was repeated 1,000 times to obtain a distribution of interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060098-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). On average, a random set of 216 proteins showed 42.7 binary interactions (standard deviation &#x0005b;s.d.&#x0005d; &#x000b1; 13.1). The 92 interactions within our MAP dataset falls 3.8 standard deviations away from this mean.

Peptides were eluted to the mass spectrometer using a 45-min 5&#x00025;&#x02013;95&#x00025; acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1&#x00025; formic acid at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Spectra were acquired in positive mode with a cone voltage of 40 V and a capillary voltage of 3,300 V. The MS to MS/MS switching was controlled in an automatic data-dependent fashion with a 1-s survey scan followed by three 1-s MS/MS scans of the most intense ions. Precursor ions selected for MS/MS were excluded from further fragmentation for 2 min. Spectra were processed using ProteinLynx Global server 2.1.5 and searched against the SWISS-PROT, MSDB, and NCBI databases using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix science). Searches were restricted to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> taxonomy, allowing carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidised methionine as a potential variable modifications. Data were searched allowing 0.5 Da error on all spectra and up to two missed tryptic cleavage sites to accommodate calibration drift and incomplete digestion. A standard score, based upon a number of criteria including number and size of peptides matched, was assigned to each spectra. Proteins identified with a score of greater than 30 were considered significant, whereas all lower-scoring proteins were either included or discarded after inspection of individual spectra. This resulted in the inclusion of seven additional proteins with scores of between 26.87 and 29.36 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060098-st001">Table S1</xref>). Where peptides from the same 2D feature or 1D gel block resulted in two possible identities of similar scores, both possibilities were included in our final count and are differentiated by a numerical subfix (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060098-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Data were checked for consistent error distribution, and false-positive rates were determined by searching against a randomized database.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Cell culture, RNA interference, and transfection.</title><p>S2 cells were treated with dsRNA corresponding to each gene or a negative control (bacterial &#x003b2;-lactamase) as previously described (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060098-st003">Table S3</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060098-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;.

The cells were then fixed with &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C methanol and immunostained for DNA, &#x003b1;-tubulin, and a mitotic marker, phospho-H3 (Ser<sup>10</sup>). As even untreated S2 cells show abnormalities to some extent, all scoring and statistical analysis compared each gene with the negative control (&#x003b2;-lactamase dsRNA) in the same experiment. The mitotic index (the frequency of phospho-H3&#x02013;positive cells) was calculated for each sample (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; &#x0223c;500 cells per sample). All mitotic cells with spindle abnormalities were classified into one of the following categories: monopolar, bipolar with no asters, bipolar with one aster, tripolar, multipolar, or others (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; &#x0223c;60 mitotic cells per sample). Abnormal chromosome distribution was also scored but only when the spindle was bipolar. Interphase microtubule organisation was categorised into four classes: extended (normal), bundled, compact, and curved. Any other abnormalities were noted separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060098-st004">Table S4</xref>).</p><p>The &#x003c7;-square test was used for statistical analysis. The frequency of abnormalities for each gene was individually compared to that of the control on the same experiment either in each individual category or categories combined. Genes which reproducibly give <italic>p</italic>-values lower than 0.05 were considered hits, and ones which give <italic>p</italic>-values lower than 0.01 were considered strong hits.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Bioinformatics analysis.</title><p>MS identities were received in the form of database accession numbers.
