Ethylnitrosourea (ENU)&#x02013;mutagenesis has been a valuable approach for generating new animal models of deafness and discovering previously unrecognized gene functions. Here we report on the characterization of a new ENU&#x02013;induced mouse mutant (nmf329) that exhibits recessively inherited deafness. We found a widespread loss of sensory hair cells in the hearing organs of nmf329 mice after the second week of life. Positional cloning revealed that the nmf329 strain carries a missense mutation in the <italic>claudin-9</italic> gene, which encodes a tight junction protein with unknown biological function. In an epithelial cell line, heterologous expression of wild-type claudin-9 reduced the paracellular permeability to Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and the <italic>nmf329</italic> mutation eliminated this ion barrier function without affecting the plasma membrane localization of claudin-9. In the nmf329 mouse line, the perilymphatic K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration was found to be elevated, suggesting that the cochlear tight junctions were dysfunctional. Furthermore, the hair-cell loss in the claudin-9&#x02013;defective cochlea was rescued <italic>in vitro</italic> when the explanted hearing organs were cultured in a low-K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> milieu and <italic>in vivo</italic> when the endocochlear K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-driving force was diminished by deletion of the <italic>pou3f4</italic> gene. Overall, our data indicate that claudin-9 is required for the preservation of sensory cells in the hearing organ because claudin-9&#x02013;defective tight junctions fail to shield the basolateral side of hair cells from the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-rich endolymph. In the tight-junction complexes of hair cells, claudin-9 is localized specifically to a subdomain that is underneath more apical tight-junction strands formed by other claudins. Thus, the analysis of <italic>claudin-9</italic> mutant mice suggests that even the deeper (subapical) tight-junction strands have biologically important ion barrier function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Hereditary deafness is a common birth defect in the human population, yet the majority of genes required for audition is thought to be unidentified. Genetic approaches in the mouse have greatly contributed to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie hearing. Random mutagenesis of mice, identification of deaf mutants, and subsequent analysis of the deafness-causing gene defects has led to the discovery of several previously unrecognized gene functions. Here, we report on the characterization of a new mutant mouse line (nmf329) that exhibits profound hearing loss and loss of sensory cells in the auditory organ. Genetic analysis reveals that these animals carry a mutation in the <italic>claudin-9</italic> gene, which encodes a protein with hitherto unknown biological function. We have found that normal claudin-9&#x02014;but not a mutant form&#x02014;inhibits the paracellular movement of certain ions. The lack of the claudin-9 ion barrier in the inner ear leads to changes in ionic conditions that can account for the loss of sensory cells in the mutant mice. Within the cell&#x02013;cell junctions, the claudin-9 layer is located basal to those of other claudins. Thus, our analysis of claudin-9&#x02013;deficient animals suggests that even the deeper layers of claudins have important ion barrier function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The separation of compositionally distinct extracellular fluids is a vital function of the epithelial and endothelial cells that line the lumens of organs and blood vessels, respectively.

Twenty-four claudins have been identified in humans. Each of these is a four-pass transmembrane protein with intracellular N- and C-termini and two extracellular loops. The first extracellular loop is responsible for the selective ion barrier function of the claudin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Colegio1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Alexandre1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and is also critical for the polymerization of neighboring claudins into strands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Mrsny1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

The claudin C-terminus binds to scaffolding proteins such as zonula occludens-1, -2, -3 and MUPP-1, which link the tight junction to the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Umeda1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Hamazaki1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The expression of individual claudins can have diverse effects on the paracellular permeability of solutes.

The properties of tight junctions are further diversified by the expression of multiple claudins in most epithelial cells.

The stereocilia of the cochlear sensory hair cells are surrounded by the endolymph, in which the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration is high (&#x0223c;140 mM) and the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration is low (&#x0223c;1 mM). In contrast, the basolateral side of hair cells is bathed in the perilymph, which has low K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and high Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations (&#x0223c;2 mM and &#x0223c;140 mM, respectively). These ion gradients are generated by the <italic>stria vascularis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000610-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which also produces an endocochlear potential (EP, &#x0223c;80 mV) between the endolymphatic and perilymphatic spaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Salt1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The EP amplifies the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> driving force. In this context, sound-induced deflections of stereocilia result in the entry of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> into the hair cell through apical ion channels.

In these experiments, the cells were seeded on Transwell filters, and the main salt component of the assay buffer was diluted 2-fold on one side of the MDCK monolayer, while osmolarity was maintained by adding mannitol. Asymmetric dilution of a salt on the apical versus basolateral side of an epithelial monolayer generates concentration gradients of the diluted anions and cations. This leads to transepithelial ion fluxes at different rates, depending on the anion and cation permeabilities of the epithelium. The unequal transepithelial fluxes of anions and cations generate a voltage termed the dilution potential. In control (i.e. claudin-9 &#x0201c;off&#x0201d;) MDCK monolayers, permeability to Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was greater than that to Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, as indicated by the apically negative dilution potential that was generated when both Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> were diluted on the basolateral side. In MDCK monolayers expressing claudin-9<italic><sup>wt</sup></italic>, basolateral dilution of NaCl led to a much smaller voltage change (compare &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000610-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

In addition to being expressed in the cochlea, claudin-9 has been detected in the vestibular system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Kitajiri2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Zheng1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, and developing kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Abuazza1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, yet <italic>claudin-9</italic> mutant mice exhibited no signs of vestibular, hepatic, or renal defects. Thus, the ion barrier function of claudin-9 is essential in the cochlea, but appears to be dispensable in other organs.</p><p>Sound detection requires uniquely large K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and voltage gradients across the sensory hair cells of the hearing organ. During sound stimulation, hair cells are depolarized by an apical influx of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions. Subsequently, hair cells repolarize as K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions are exported into the basolateral fluid. An increase in the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration in the basolateral fluid is known to inhibit repolarization and to be toxic to hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Hibino1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Wangemann1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the basolateral fluid of hair cells must be insulated from the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-rich apical milieu. This insulation is likely to be impaired in the nmf329 mice because: 1) the <italic>nmf329</italic> mutation eliminated the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> barrier function of claudin-9, 2) the timing of hair-cell degeneration in the nmf329 mice coincided with the development of EP, 3) the OHCs of <italic>claudin-9</italic> mutant mice did not degenerate <italic>ex vivo</italic> under normal culture conditions, and 4) the OHCs of <italic>claudin-9</italic> mutant mice were rescued from degeneration by a second gene defect that reduces the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-driving force in the cochlea. Since K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> can freely diffuse from the basolateral fluid of the hair cells to the perilymph in the <italic>scala tympani</italic>, it may seem surprising that the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration was only marginally elevated in the <italic>scala tympani</italic> of <italic>claudin-9</italic> mutant mice. However, the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration in the bulk of the perilymph may be significantly lower than the local K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> level in the basolateral fluid, because K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is likely to become proportionally diluted as the distance from the &#x0201c;leaky&#x0201d; epithelium increases. In addition, simple diffusion is insufficient to protect the hair cells from K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> intoxication. Indeed, even during the normal hearing process, K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is thought to be removed from the basolateral fluid by the K-Cl co-transporters of the supporting cells known as Kcc3 and Kcc4, rather than by diffusion, and genetic deletion of either <italic>Kcc3</italic> or <italic>Kcc4</italic> causes hair-cell degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Boettger1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Boettger2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we suggest that the claudin-9 defect of nmf329 mice leads to toxic levels of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in the basolateral fluid of hair cells, but that K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions are diluted to a nearly physiological concentration as they diffuse across the basilar membrane into the <italic>scala tympani</italic>.</p><p>The extent of hair-cell degeneration in the nmf329 cochlea was not uniform throughout the organ. More OHCs were missing at the basal turn than at the apex, and the OHCs were more affected than the IHCs. A similar pattern of hair-cell loss is often observed in damaged cochleas. However, in nmf329 mice, the pattern of OHC loss was not mirrored by the frequency distribution of the ABR thresholds: we detected uniformly elevated auditory thresholds whether the sound stimulated the base or the apex of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000610-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These data suggests that although the majority of OHCs at the apex of the claudin-9-deficient cochlea survive, they do not function properly. Thus, a &#x0201c;sublethal&#x0201d; functional defect of OHCs may be ubiquitous in the claudin-9-deficient cochlea. This functional defect may culminate in the loss of OHCs, depending on the susceptibility of individual OHCs to the local basolateral K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration.</p><p>IHCs are the primary sensory cells of the auditory system, whereas the OHCs are eletromechanical amplifiers that improve hearing sensitivity by more than 40 dB. A previous study showed that the ABR threshold to pure tone sounds was increased by 40 dB when the OHCs (but not the IHCs) in parts of the cochlea were destroyed by kanamycin treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Ryan1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the hearing threshold was elevated by 40&#x02013;60 dB in mice deficient of prestin, a molecule key to eletromechanical amplification by OHCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Liberman1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, the phenotype of nmf329 mice is compatible with a predominantly OHC defect, and the IHCs seem to retain at least some sensory function in the mutant mice up to P28.</p><p>Claudin-9 is widely expressed in the inner ear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Kitajiri2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, so it is surprising that the <italic>claudin-9</italic> mutation does not lead to reductions in either the endolymphatic K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration or the EP.

Some of these proteins are present at low levels or can be detected only in certain areas of the cochlea. Nevertheless, the collective expression pattern of multiple claudins may restrict the paracellular leak of claudin-9-deficient tight junctions to a limited area such as the organ of Corti. A localized K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> leak may be compensated by increased K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> secretion from the <italic>stria vascularis</italic>, and this could stabilize both the EP and the endolymphatic K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration.</p><p>Claudin-9<italic><sup>F35L</sup></italic> was localized to tight junctions in transfected MDCK cells and in cochlear epithelial cells. Furthermore, heterologous expression of claudin-9<italic><sup>F35L</sup></italic> reduced the tightness of tight junctions in MDCK cell cultures and increased the paracellular permeability to K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Based on these data, we propose that claudin-9<italic><sup>F35L</sup></italic> is incorporated into tight-junction strands, resulting in the disruption of the paracellular cation barrier. Thus, a phenotype might be expected not only in the <italic>nmf329/nmf329</italic> mice but also in the <italic>nmf329/&#x0002b;</italic> animals. However, the <italic>nmf329/&#x0002b;</italic> mice exhibited normal auditory thresholds and intact OHCs at each time point investigated. This suggests that tight-junction strands containing both claudin-9<italic><sup>wt</sup></italic> and claudin-9<italic><sup>F35L</sup></italic> are sufficiently tight to prevent cochlear degeneration. Alternatively, claudin-9<italic><sup>wt</sup></italic> and claudin-9<italic><sup>F35L</sup></italic> may be sorted into separate tight-junction strands, and the number of claudin-9<italic><sup>wt</sup></italic>-containing strands may be sufficient to maintain the paracellular cation barrier. An additional possibility is that claudin-9<italic><sup>wt</sup></italic> is expressed at a higher level than claudin-9<italic><sup>F35L</sup></italic> in the heterozygous mice.</p><p>The claudin-9 sequence is highly conserved between mouse and human (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000610.s009">Figure S9</xref>), which raises the possibility that a claudin-9 deficiency may cause hearing loss not only in mice but also in humans.

Thus, the phenotypes of <italic>claudin-9</italic> mutant mice and <italic>claudin-14</italic> &#x0201c;knock-out&#x0201d; animals are similar. In the junctional complexes of OHCs, claudin-14 and claudin-9 are sorted into two separate subdomains; claudin-14 is found only in the most apical tight-junction strands, whereas claudin-9 is detected solely in the deeper (subapical) strands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Nunes1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, both claudin-9 and claudin-14 form paracellular ion permeability barriers for K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000610-g006">Figure 6</xref> and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-BenYosef1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>). Therefore, in the organ of Corti, claudin-14 would be expected to render claudin-9 redundant. In contrast to this expectation, analysis of the nmf329 mice suggests that not only the apical tight-junction strands, but also those that are subapical, can contribute significantly to the ion barrier capacity of junctional complexes. In summary, our characterization of the nmf329 mouse line not only reveals the biological significance of claudin-9, but also provides insight into the functional architecture of tight-junction complexes in the hearing organ.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse lines and genotyping</title><p>Heterozygous nmf329 mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://C57BL/6J-nmf329/J)">C57BL/6J-nmf329/J)</ext-link> and hemizygous <italic>pou3f4</italic> mutant mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://C3HeB/FeJ-Pou3f4del-J/J">C3HeB/FeJ-Pou3f4del-J/J</ext-link>) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.

Short DNA sequences (&#x0223c;500 bp) encompassing the SNPs were PCR amplified, and the PCR products were denatured by heat and re-annealed by slow cooling. Thus, if two different alleles were amplified, they formed heterodimers with a single nucleotide mismatch. For the detection of DNA heterodimers, the re-annealed PCR products were treated with a plant enzyme (CEL1) that cleaves DNA at points of mismatch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000610-Oleykowski1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.

At the end of the incubation period, Transwells were mounted into a custom-made Ussing chamber system (Jim's Instruments, Iowa City, Iowa). The apical and basal chambers were filled with one of the following solutions: NaCl buffer, NaAsp buffer, ArgCl buffer, or KCl buffer. These four buffers differed only in their main salt component, as indicated by their names (140 mM NaCl, 140 mM NaAsp, 140 mM ArgCl, and 140 mM KCl); the other components were identical in every buffer (2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, 5 mM Tris, pH was adjusted to 7.3 with HCl).</p><p>The Ussing chambers were connected to Ag/AgCl electrodes via 3 M KCl agar bridges, and the electrodes were connected to a Quick Data Acquisition DT9800 USB board (Data Translation, Inc, Marlborough, MA) to record the voltage between the apical and basal chambers. The asymmetry of voltage-sensing Ag/AgCl electrodes and the liquid junction potentials were corrected using an offset-removal circuit. During the experiment, buffers were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C and bubbled constantly with air. Dilution potentials were measured by replacing the buffer on the basal side with a &#x0201c;&#x000bd; buffer&#x0201d;. In select experiments, the assay buffer was diluted on the apical side of MDCK cultures to verify that the absolute value of the dilution potential did not depend on the direction of the ion gradients. The &#x000bd; NaCl, &#x000bd; NaAsp, &#x000bd; ArgCl, and &#x000bd; KCl buffers contained half the concentration (70 mM) of the salt indicated by their names, and mannitol at a concentration of 140 mM (to maintain osmolarity); concentrations of the other buffer components (i.e. Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, glucose, Tris, H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) were not altered.
