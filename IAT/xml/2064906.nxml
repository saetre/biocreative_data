The neuroprotective effect of SN was attributed to inhibition of microglial activation, since SN significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;, prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by microglia. In addition, from the therapeutic point of view, we focused on sub-picomolar concentration of SN for further mechanistic studies. We found that 10<sup>-14 </sup>M of SN failed to protect DA neurons against MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced toxicity in the absence of microglia. More importantly, SN failed to show a protective effect in neuron-glia cultures from mice lacking functional NADPH oxidase (PHOX), a key enzyme for extracellular superoxide production in immune cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SN reduced LPS-induced extracellular ROS production through the inhibition of the PHOX cytosolic subunit p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>translocation to the cell membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings strongly suggest that the protective effects of SN are most likely mediated through the inhibition of microglial PHOX activity. These findings suggest a novel therapy to treat inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Increasing evidence has shown that the production and accumulation of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic factors by over-activated microglia are closely associated with the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and the AIDS dementia complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Microglia are the main immune cells in the brain, which provides the CNS immune protection against infection under normal physiologic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, in pathological conditions microglia may easily become over-activated and produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, prostaglandins, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which result in neuronal death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Microglia are found in great abundance in the midbrain region that encompasses the substantia nigra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, it has been suggested that activation of nigral microglia and subsequent release of these pro-inflammatory neurotoxic factors is a critical component of the degenerative process of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in PD. Unfortunately, therapies using specific inhibitors to prevent the production of individual pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic factors have not been particularly successful, suggesting that the mechanism of inflammation-mediated damage to DA neurons has yet to be elucidated. In addition, current DA replacement therapy for PD is only able to treat the symptoms, and fails to slow down the progression of the disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop drugs that have wide spectrum anti-inflammatory effects and which are able to slow down or curtail the progression of the degenerative process.</p><p>The alkaloid sinomenine (SN) is a pure compound extracted from the Chinese medicinal plant, <italic>sinomenium acutum</italic>, which has been utilized to treat inflammatory diseases for many centuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Clinical trials have demonstrated that purified SN has significant therapeutic efficacy for patients who suffer from rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Previous pharmacological studies have demonstrated that the pharmacological profile of SN includes immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], arthritis amelioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], anti-inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and protection against hepatitis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, in studies using intramuscular injection and multiple dosing, a combination of SN and cyclosporin A showed immunomodulatory effects in a cardiac transplant model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Up to now, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which SN exhibits immunomodulatory effects.</p><p>Based on its molecular structure, SN belongs to the family of morphinans. Morphinans are a series of compounds structurally similar to morphine, but lacking the E ring as well as the 6-OH and the 7, 8-double bond. Our previous studies have clearly shown that several morphinan compounds, including naloxone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and dextromethorphan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], are neuroprotective anti-inflammatory agents. Given the reported anti-inflammatory properties of SN, the record of its effective use in clinical therapy, its natural abundance, and its relative low cost in purification and preparation, we theorized that this compound might be a better alternative than synthetic morphinan compounds in inhibiting inflammatory destruction of DA neurons. Moreover, the finding that it is a naturally occurring dextrorotatory morphinan isomer indicates that it would have minimal interaction with opiate receptors, and therefore prove to be a much safer alternative than some other morphinan compounds when used chronically to treat PD. In this study, we report that SN shows a significant neuroprotective effects against both LPS- and MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced DA neurotoxicity, and that this protection is mediated through microglia. The finding that SN is acting to inhibit NADPH oxidase (PHOX) activity, which then results in the inhibition of a wide array of pro-inflammatory mediators produced by activated microglia, suggests that SN may be a potential novel and safe therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>PHOX-deficient (gp91phox<sup>-/-</sup>) and wild-type C57BL/6J (gp91phox<sup>+/+</sup>) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).

This indicates that sub-picomolar concentration of SN protects against the neurotoxic effects of MPP<sup>+</sup>, but there is a level of toxicity mediated by the direct toxic effect by MPP<sup>+ </sup>on neurons that is independent of the protective effects of SN.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>SN protects against MPP<sup>+</sup>-elicited DA neurodegeneration through microglia.

Results showed that SN had no effect on the toxic effects of MPP<sup>+ </sup>in neuron-enriched cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> &#x02013; N), demonstrating that SN does not function by directly protecting neurons from MPP<sup>+</sup>-mediated toxicity. We then investigated if glial cells were the target for the neuroprotective activity of SN by reconstituting neuron-enriched cultures with either 10% purified microglia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> &#x02013; N + 10% MG) or 50% astroglia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> &#x02013; N+50% AS). The percentage of glial cells chosen for reconstitution was based on the fact that our standard mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures contain ~10% microglia and ~50% astrocytes in addition to DA and other neurons. We found that while SN is not able to protect DA neurons in neuron-astroglia reconstituted cultures, SN was able to reduce neurotoxicity in neuron-microglia reconstituted cultures to a level similar to that seen in the original neuron-glia cultures. This result indicates that there is an additional, indirect microglia-mediated neurotoxicity by MPP<sup>+ </sup>through reactive microgliosis, a process initiated when the death or damage of neurons triggers further activation of microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Previous work from our laboratory and others have indicated that oxidative stress plays a very important role in the progressive neurodegeneration, and MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced reactive microgliosis has been clearly linked with microglial activation and closely associated with increased production of oxygen free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore, we sought to determine whether SN is able to reduce MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced ROS production. Rat mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures were pretreated with SN (10<sup>-14 </sup>M) before the addition of MPP<sup>+</sup>. Release of superoxide from activated microglia was then determined on day 4 after treatment. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, treatment of cultures with SN significantly inhibited MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced superoxide production. Interestingly, we found that while significant superoxide production was detected following MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced reactive microgliosis, the production of other inflammatory mediators, including TNF-&#x003b1; and nitrite, were not detectable at any time during the 7-day MPP<sup>+ </sup>treatment in neuron-glial cultures (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrated that SN can inhibit ROS production induced either directly by LPS stimulation or indirectly by MPP<sup>+</sup>-mediated reactive microgliosis, and lend further evidence to the idea that superoxide production, rather than TNF-&#x003b1; or nitrite production, is the mechanism of neurotoxicity in reactive microgliosis.</p></sec><sec><title>PHOX is essential for SN mediated neuroprotection</title><p>Previous reports from our laboratory indicated that PHOX is the major enzyme in microglia that produces extracellular superoxide anions and is a major contributor to the increase of the intracellular ROS, which in turn enhances TNF-&#x003b1; production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To further study the role of ROS in SN-mediated neuroprotection, neuron-glia cultures were prepared from PHOX-deficient (PHOX<sup>-/-</sup>) and wild-type (PHOX<sup>+/+</sup>) mice. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, LPS treatment of cultures prepared from PHOX<sup>+/+ </sup>mice reduced [<sup>3</sup>H]-DA uptake by 50%, while SN (10<sup>-14 </sup>M) significantly attenuated the decrease. In contrast, LPS treatment reduced the uptake capacity by 27% in PHOX<sup>-/- </sup>mice, but SN failed to show any protective effect. LPS-induced TNF-&#x003b1; production in PHOX<sup>-/- </sup>mice is only half of that in PHOX<sup>+/+ </sup>mice, and while SN was able to significantly reduce TNF-&#x003b1; production in PHOX<sup>+/+ </sup>mice, no significant change was seen in PHOX<sup>-/- </sup>mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Similarly, SN at 10<sup>-14 </sup>M significantly inhibited intracellular ROS production in PHOX<sup>+/+ </sup>mice, but not in PHOX<sup>-/- </sup>mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). These results strongly support the hypothesis that inhibition of ROS production and subsequently TNF-&#x003b1; production is critical to the neuroprotective effect of SN.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Microglial PHOX is critical for sub-picomolar SN neuroprotection.

Since SN significantly inhibits superoxide production and fails to protect DA neuron damage induced by LPS in PHOX<sup>-/- </sup>mice, we sought to determine if SN inhibits PHOX activation by preventing the p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>translocation from cytosol to membrane following LPS stimulation in HAPI cells, a microglial cell line from rat. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that in un-stimulated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panel I and II) or in cells treated with SN alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panel VII and VIII), p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>was found primarily localized in the cytosol. In contrast, ten minutes after LPS stimulation, we detected virtually all the p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>clustered at the membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panel III and IV). However, the addition of 10<sup>-14 </sup>M SN significantly prevented this LPS-induced p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>translocation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panel V and VI). Consistent with the results of the confocal microscopy study, western blot assay clearly showed an increase in the immunoreactivity of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>in the membrane fraction of HAPI cells 10 min after LPS treatment and this increase in the immunoreactivity was significantly blocked in the presence of SN at 10<sup>-14 </sup>M. LPS did not show any effects on gp91 protein expression at this time point (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Therefore, one mechanism by which SN inhibits superoxide production in microglial cells is through inhibition of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>translocation to the cell membrane following LPS stimulation.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopical analysis of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>localization in LPS-stimulated microlgia cells.

Using both LPS and MPP<sup>+</sup>-mediated PD models, we are the first to demonstrate that SN could be effective in diminishing inflammation-induced neurodegeneration at both micro- and sub-picomolar concentrations in primary midbrain neuron-glia cultures. Mechanistic studies revealed that inhibition of microglial PHOX activity is the target for SN-mediated neuroprotection in both LPS- and MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced DA neurotoxicity. The mechanism underlying SN-mediated inhibition of PHOX activity occurs at least in part through the inhibition of the translocation of PHOX cytosolic component p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>to the plasma membrane, a key event required for extracellular ROS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We are currently investigating the effects of SN on the activity of the other subunits of the PHOX enzyme, including p67<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, p40<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, gp91<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, p22<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>and Rac2. The inhibition of PHOX leads to a subsequent reduction in the production of other pro-inflammatory mediators, such as intracellular ROS, TNF-&#x003b1;, NO and PGE<sub>2</sub>. Our studies suggest that reduction in PHOX activity by SN at the site of inflammation diminishes host tissue damage, thereby underlying the neuroprotective effect of SN for both LPS- and MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced DA neurotoxicity.</p><p>Although SN has been used clinically as an anti-inflammatory agent in several inflammation-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], so far only a few studies have addressed the immunomodulatory mechanism of this herbal medicine. For example, it has been reported that SN inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, PGE<sub>2</sub>, leukotriene C4 and NO from macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our observations have not only extended the above findings to microglia, but more importantly, our studies indicate that the reduction in the release of these pro-inflammatory factors by SN could be due to the inhibition of superoxide production through the inhibition of microglial PHOX activity. Our earlier studies established that inhibition of microglial production of superoxide was most effective in protecting neurons, indicating that superoxide was a dominant degenerative factor for the DA neurons in the culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Our evidence that SN significantly inhibits the production of superoxide induced by either LPS or MPP<sup>+</sup>, as well as the observation that ROS production is the only inflammatory mediator that can be detected after exposure of neuron-glial cultures to MPP<sup>+</sup>, led us to examine the role of PHOX in neurotoxicity in greater detail by using PHOX-deficient mutant mice. Our findings that sub-picomolar SN could significantly lessen the LPS-induced DA uptake reduction in wild-type mice, has no significant protective effect in PHOX<sup>-/- </sup>mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) strongly support the conclusion that PHOX activity is critical to SN-mediated DA neuroprotection. Moreover, the production of intracellular ROS and release of TNF-&#x003b1; are both reduced in PHOX<sup>-/- </sup>mice, suggesting PHOX can indirectly regulate intracellular ROS concentration and ultimately the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. We can not rule out the possibility that cells other than microglia are producing superoxide, and that PHOX is not the only enzyme which may play a role in ROS production. However, only microglia express LPS receptors and are activated by LPS, and therefore no other cell is likely to produce ROS upon stimulation with LPS. In addition, no extracellular superoxide production has been detected in cultures from PHOX<sup>-/- </sup>mice (Qin et al., 2004), suggesting that PHOX is the only enzyme involved in superoxide production in these cultures. It has been found that an increase of intracellular ROS can intensify the activation of NF-kB, which leads to higher TNF-&#x003b1; and PGE<sub>2 </sub>production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, it has been reported that PHOX inhibitors prevent LPS/IFN&#x003b3;-induced degradation of IkB and, thus, inhibit the activation of NF-kB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These data are consistent with the notion that PHOX plays a central role in both inflammation-induced neurotoxicity, as well as in the regulation of the inflammatory response by microglial cells, and that SN can inhibit these inflammatory responses by inhibiting PHOX activity.</p><p>The bimodal dose response of SN in the inhibition of LPS-induced superoxide production and neuroprotection adds SN to the list of compounds which show the same pattern of responsiveness, including dynorphins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], enkephalins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], endorphin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (4&#x02013;6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Currently it is still not clear how both micro- and sub-picomolar concentrations of SN and the other compounds inhibit PHOX activation. To further understand how SN inhibits PHOX activity, we performed the translocation experiment using confocal microscopy. We found that the translocation of the p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>subunit from the cytosol to the plasma membrane following LPS stimulation was inhibited by SN. As the activation of a functional PHOX enzyme requires the phorsphorylation of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>followed by the translocation of the p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, p67<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, and p40<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>complex to the plasma membrane, our results suggest that SN works on one of the earliest stages of PHOX activation to inhibit the assembly of the PHOX enzyme complex. Presently the molecular mechanisms by which SN leads to the inhibition of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>translocation are under investigation.</p><p>It is interesting to note that SN has protective effects in both the LPS and the MPP<sup>+ </sup>model of PD, although the mode of action for these two agents to produce neurotoxicity is different. In the LPS model, it is clear that direct activation of microglia by LPS leads to the activation of PHOX, which results in the production of superoxide that mediates the neurotoxicity, and that direct inhibition of PHOX by SN in microglia can prevent this destruction. However, even though MPP<sup>+ </sup>directly targets DA neurons to produce toxicity, SN still shows a significant protective effect in these cultures as well. This is most likely due to the fact that a significant portion of the MPP<sup>+</sup>-mediated neurotoxicity requires the presence of microglial cells, suggesting that MPP<sup>+ </sup>works both directly to kill a subset of DA neurons, but also indirectly to activate microglia through reactive microgliosis. Recent evidence indicates that neuronal death or damage triggers activation of microglia through either release of soluble factors or loss of cell-cell contact inhibition between neurons and microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This activation of microglia by dying neurons then continuously damages the remaining DA neurons, and creates a self-propelling inflammatory cycle, which may underlie the progressive nature of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. Reports from our laboratory and others have indicated that MPP<sup>+ </sup>can cause reactive microgliosis, and that oxidative stress is involved in MPTP/MPP<sup>+ </sup>-induced neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our observation that MPP<sup>+</sup>-mediated neurotoxicity is significantly less in PHOX<sup>-/- </sup>animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and that SN does not protect DA neurons from MPP<sup>+</sup>-mediated toxicity in neuron-enriched or neuron-astroglial cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), supports the notion that SN protects MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced neurotoxicity mainly through the inhibition of ROS production, which in turn slows down the self-propelling cycle and prevents further neuronal death. In addition, although LPS and MPP<sup>+ </sup>work in different ways to produce neurotoxicity, the death of neurons induced by both LPS and MPP<sup>+ </sup>will further activate microglia through the process of reactive microgliosis, in which superoxide plays a critical role.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study is the first report indicating that SN is a potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent that acts through inhibition of microglial PHOX-generated superoxide by inhibiting the translocation of p47<sup><italic>phox </italic></sup>to the plasma membrane. We have previously reported that several morphinan compounds, such as naloxone, exert their neuroprotective effects independent of the conventional opioid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], because the dextrorotatory form of this compound, which binds poorly to the opioid receptors, is equipotent with its levorotatory isomer. SN, being a natural dextrorotatory form of morphinan that can be easily extracted and purified from its herb plant, is an ideal alternative for other synthesized dextrorotatory form morphinan compounds since the dextrorotatory isomers are extremely expensive to fabricate. In view of its potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, its safe record of clinical usage to treat rheumatoid arthritis, and its relatively low cost, SN is an ideal candidate for animal and clinical trial studies to evaluate its therapeutic potential as a neuroprotective agent for PD and other inflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LQ performed experiments and drafted the manuscript.
