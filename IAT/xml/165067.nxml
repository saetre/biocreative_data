The zinc-finger protein tristetraprolin (TTP) has been identified as a major regulator of TNF biosynthesis. To define its intracellular location and examine its regulation of TNF, a quantitive intracellular staining assay specific for TTP was developed. We establish for the first time that in peripheral blood leukocytes, expression of endogenous TTP is confined to the cytoplasm. Baseline expression of TTP was higher in monocytes than in lymphocytes or neutrophils. After <italic>in vitro </italic>incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), leukocyte TTP levels increased rapidly, peaking after approximately 2 hours. Monocytes showed the greatest response to LPS stimulation and lymphocytes the least. TTP levels were also studied in leukocytes isolated from healthy volunteers infused with a bolus dose of LPS. TTP expression and initial upregulation in response to LPS infusion were consistent with the <italic>in vitro </italic>data. Neutrophil TTP levels responded first, reaching an initial peak within 1 hour, monocyte levels peaked next at 2 hours, followed by lymphocytes at 4 hours. This response paralleled plasma TNF levels, which peaked 2 hours after infusion and were no longer detectable after 12 hours. A second rise in intracellular TTP levels, which did not parallel plasma TNF levels, was observed in all leukocyte populations, starting 12 hours after infusion. These data establish the cytoplasmic location of TTP, supporting a major role for this protein in regulating TNF production, and suggest that TTP levels are not regulated solely by TNF.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>endotoxic shock</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>lipopolysaccharide</kwd><kwd>tristetraprolin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been implicated in the development and pathogenicity of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders, such as septic shock, arthritis, and hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory cascade and, together with IL-1 and IL-6, has been shown to mediate the acute-phase response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Confirmation of its significance in disease comes from the success of clinical trials using anti-TNF therapy to treat rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or endotoxin, is found only in Gram-negative bacterial cell walls; it can on its own induce the acute inflammatory response and the clinical characteristics associated with sepsis. After administration of LPS, TNF and other inflammatory mediators are released [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Infusion of TNF initiates an inflammatory process leading to a phenotype that is indistinguishable from bacterial sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Recent work on tristetraprolin (TTP) has provided a new perspective on the regulation of TNF biosynthesis. TTP (also referred to as NuP475, TIS11, or GOS24) is a member of the family of zinc-finger proteins that was originally identified through genetic screens designed to identify immediate early response genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. TTP was shown to be an unusually proline-rich protein with a predicted molecular weight of 33.6 kDa. Its name derives from the presence of three PPPPG amino acid repeats that are conserved across species. There are two Cys-Cys-Cys-His (CCCH) zinc fingers, which are responsible for RNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. There are no studies of the subcellular localization or the regulation of expression of native TTP in freshly isolated cells or tissue. Transfection studies using nonhematopoietic cell lines or prolonged cell culture have suggested that TTP is found in both cytoplasm and the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>A deficiency of TTP is associated with a profound proinflammatory phenotype. TTP-deficient mice exhibit cachexia, with dermatitis, medullary and extramedullary hyperplasia, erosive polyarthritis, and autoimmunity with autoantibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This phenotype is similar to that observed in mice that overexpress TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In agreement with these data, TTP-deficient mice were shown to overproduce TNF, and weekly injections of a neutralizing antibody to TNF eliminated the predominant features of this phenotype. In addition, mice with the double deletion of TTP and TNF receptor (TNFR)-1 do not manifest the aggressive inflammation observed in TTP-deficient mice. In contrast, mice deficient in TTP and TNFR-2 show a more severe phenotype, suggesting a protective role for this receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The increase in TNF biosynthesis in TTP-deficient mice is associated with increased mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. TTP binds to the AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3' untranslated region of TNF mRNA, which regulates TNF mRNA turnover <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The interaction between TTP/TNF and the ARE promotes the turnover of TNF mRNA. TTP also regulates the stability of GM-CSF (granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor) mRNA through the ARE, and therefore TTP deficiency is associated with increased production of GM-CSF and with myeloid hyperplasia. This is not a TNF-dependent effect, since the phenotype is not affected by the removal of either TNFR-1 or -2 or by the addition of TNF antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Recent studies have suggested a potential interaction between TTP and both IL-3 and IL-8 via the ARE in their mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>All studies of TTP expression to date have relied on transfected cells and cell lines; there have been no studies on the localization of expression of human TTP, or on its regulation <italic>in vivo </italic>or in freshly isolated normal cells. To examine the kinetic relation between TNF production and TTP expression in models of septic shock, we developed an intracellular flow cytometric assay. By this method, expression of TTP was determined in peripheral blood leukocytes after the response to <italic>in vitro </italic>stimulation with LPS. TTP was initially upregulated in all the cells in response to LPS, as shown by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The contribution of TNF to this LPS-induced upregulation was confirmed using a humanized monoclonal antibody to TNF. The kinetics of TTP production was also examined in four individuals infused with LPS. After <italic>in vivo </italic>exposure to LPS, the initial rise in TTP expression correlated with the plasma TNF level. We also observed secondary increases in some individuals, without parallel increments in TNF. These observations suggest that there are multiple factors involved in the regulation of TTP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of antihuman TTP polyclonal antibody</title><p>A peptide corresponding to the C terminus (amino acids 302&#x02013;328) of human TTP was synthesized, purified by HPLC, and coupled to KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin; Macromolecular Resources, Fort Collins, CO, USA). Anti-human TTP polyclonal antibody was generated by immunization of New Zealand white rabbits with the KLH-coupled TTP C-terminal peptide (GeneMed, San Francisco, CA, USA). The rabbit antiserum obtained was affinity-purified by passage over a Sulfolink column (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) to which disulfide linkage of the peptide had been used to immobilize the peptide.

Cells were scanned for fluorescence using the 488-nm line from a 15-mW Kr/Ar laser and two photodetectors (522/32-nm dichroic for FITC fluorescence and 585-nm longpass for propidium iodide fluorescence). A 63&#x000d7; Plan-APO 1.4 NA objective (Carl Zeiss Inc, Thornwood, NY, USA) was used in conjunction with an iris setting of 2.5, which allowed for detection of optical sections of the fluorescence image that were approximately 0.5 &#x003bc;m thick.

Blood was sedimented in dextran, extracellularly stained for CD14, and fixed with 1% formaldehyde. The cells were stored overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and then stained for intracellular TTP. A human TNF ELISA kit (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used to determine the concentration of TNF in plasma from peripheral blood, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

There was a concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), which was standardized using fluorescent microspheres in order to compare different experiments and cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The optimum concentration of antibody was determined to be 3.8 &#x003bc;g per 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells, where the intensity curve began to flatten. At higher concentrations, the MESF value for the control sera increased concordantly, indicating nonspecific binding. Specificity of the TTP antibody was determined by blocking with the identical peptide sequence used to generate the polyclonal antibody. In the presence of blocking TTP peptide, at concentrations either 10 or 50 times the amount of TTP antibody used, the detection of the TTP protein within the transfected cells was nearly eliminated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>).</p><p>Confocal sectioning of transfected 293 cells showed that the presence of TTP protein was primarily in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Z sections taken every 0.5 &#x003bc;m through the cell showed little, if any, TTP within the nucleus. In nontransfected 293 cells, a small amount of TTP was detected by flow cytometry and confirmed by confocal microscopy. Transfected 293 cells expressed nine times as much TTP as the untransfected cells at the optimal working concentration of antibody. Preincubation of the nontransfected 293 cells with TTP peptide blocked the activity, confirming its identity. These results confirmed our previously published data in which Western blot analysis showed that TTP was localized in the cytoplasmic extract of 293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of TTP in the THP-1 cell line</title><p>Since TNF biosynthesis in macrophages is rapidly triggered by treatment with LPS, the effects of this endotoxin on TTP expression were examined. THP-1 cells, a human myelomonocytic cell line, were incubated with and without LPS (0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml) for up to 24 hours. At representative time points, a sample was removed and stained with either anti-TTP or the IgG control, as described in Materials and methods. The addition of LPS rapidly increased the expression of TTP by THP-1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Increases in TTP were detectable 1 hour after stimulation and were still evident in the cytosol 4 hours after LPS treatment. Analysis of the cells by confocal microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>) confirmed the upregulation and indicated that the TTP was expressed intracellularly, relatively homogeneously but confined to the cytoplasm. These data show that LPS stimulation rapidly increases human TTP protein expression in the cytoplasm. The kinetics of induction by LPS parallels that seen with TTP mRNA in bone-marrow-derived murine macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>TTP induction with LPS in peripheral blood leukocytes</title><p>Modulation of TTP expression by LPS was subsequently examined in normal peripheral leukocytes. Whole blood from eight healthy volunteers was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C alone or with LPS (0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml) for up to 24 hours. At periodic time points, a sample was taken and leukocytes were purified by dextran sedimentation, fixed, permeabilized, and then stained with either anti-TTP or control antibody. In leukocytes, constitutive expression of TTP ranged from approximately 9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>to 35 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>MESF. Monocytes constitutively expressed over three times as much TTP as either lymphocytes or neutrophils (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Stimulation with LPS <italic>in vitro </italic>produced an increase in TTP expression in all leukocyte subpopulations. This was maximal 2 hours after stimulation. TTP levels increased to a higher maximal level in monocytes than in other leukocytes (+8.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>MESF; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Two-color flow cytometry indicated that CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T lymphocytes expressed equivalent amounts of TTP (data not shown). The kinetics of TTP induction with LPS was consistent and monophasic in all leukocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3i</xref>). The change in TTP expression was greatest in neutrophils and least in lymphocytes. Since lymphocytes lack Toll-like receptor 4 and express little or no CD14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], we conclude that the induction of TTP in these cells was occurring indirectly, presumably through stimulation with TNF, although other cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, could contribute to this response.</p><p>LPS-induced TTP upregulation was confirmed in all cell types by confocal microscopy. Analysis confirmed an increase in TTP in neutrophils 2 hours after stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Similar data were obtained for lymphocytes and monocytes (data not shown). Distribution in resting levels and after stimulation with LPS was primarily cytosolic, which is in accord with our data for 293 and THP-1 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation of <italic>in vivo </italic>TTP production with TNF after LPS bolus</title><p>To study the kinetics of TTP induction <italic>in vivo</italic>, we infused 4 ng/kg of clinical-grade endotoxin at time 0 in four volunteers.

Beyond the 1-hour time point, the neutrophil cell count increased, reaching a peak at 12 hours. It then decreased to baseline values at 24 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Lymphocyte and monocyte data showed similar initial kinetics. The lymphocyte and monocyte curves were biphasic, peaking at 4 hours, dropping to baseline at 12 hours, and beginning a second increase at 48 hours.</p><p>Plasma TNF levels were analyzed throughout the study. The circulating TNF level increased to a peak at 2 hours after infusion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). After 12 hours, there was no detectable TNF in any of the four volunteers. This monophasic peak was consistent with findings in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of TTP expression in leukocyte populations before and after LPS infusion revealed a biphasic induction, with an initial peak occurring within 4 hours and a second after 12 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a,5b,5c</xref>). Baseline and maximum TTP expression in each cell type for each volunteer is presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. The expression and initial upregulation of TTP in response to LPS in all leukocyte populations was consistent with the data found <italic>in vitro</italic>. Neutrophils responded rapidly to LPS infusion, reaching an initial peak within an hour of infusion, although the average increase in the four volunteers appears to be moderate (50%). Analysis of monocytic TTP showed an increase in expression, peaking at 2 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Lymphocyte TTP expression peaked at 4 hours, which was later than the initial peak response of neutrophils and monocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). A second, more dramatic, rise, which did not parallel changes in plasma TNF levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>), was observed 12 hours after infusion in all leukocyte populations.</p></sec><sec><title>TNF contribution in LPS induction of TTP</title><p>The human <italic>in vivo </italic>studies described here show increases in circulating plasma TNF that preceded TTP induction in all the leukocyte types investigated. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that LPS mediates induction of TTP through the production of TNF. However, this hypothesis does not explain the second rise in TTP we observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, which was not associated with TNF. To examine this phenomena in more detail, THP-1 cells were cultured with LPS or TNF in the presence of blocking TNF antibody. The antibody sequesters TNF in the supernatant, preventing its interaction with TNF receptors. LPS induced greater TTP expression than TNF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a,6b</xref>). When THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence of the blocking TNF antibody, the TTP response was reduced but not eliminated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). In fact, the initial induction of TTP detectable during the first hour was unaffected, suggesting that TNF was not solely responsible for the LPS-induced rise. In contrast, TNF induction of TTP by THP-1 cells was completely blocked in the presence of the blocking TNF antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first to evaluate the expression and regulation of endogenous human TTP in myeloid and lymphoid cells. It is the first to examine the subcellular localization of native TTP protein in freshly isolated cells, since all previous studies relied on prolonged cell culture or transfection/overexpression approaches using cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We show that endogenous human TTP is expressed in neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. They are significant in their demonstration that native human TTP is totally cytoplasmic; there was little evidence of nuclear localization in these studies, an observation that is consistent with previous work with human TTP, in which immunoblotting showed cytoplasmic localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The discrepancy between our findings and findings of nuclear localization of TTP may be due to several factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. First, most of those studies did not measure endogenous TTP but usually relied on transfection of cell lines, perhaps resulting in mislocalization due to the presence of an epitope tag or overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Second, by definition, those cells were largely cycling and thus were not representative of normal hematopoietic cells. Third, mouse or rat TTP was used in those studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although highly conserved, it is possible that human TTP is subtly different from rodent TTP. We think this unlikely, as immunoprecipitation studies of bone-marrow-derived murine macrophages show murine TTP predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This matter requires further analysis once improved antibodies to murine TTP are generated.</p><p>Our studies clearly showed human TTP in lymphocytes and neutrophils, in addition to monocytes. Early work by Carballo and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] showed the importance of macrophages, not lymphocytes, in the development of the phenotype associated with TTP deficiency. This highlights the importance of macrophages in the production of TNF, supported by current hypotheses on the pivotal role of this cell type in TNF overproduction in autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Thus, our findings suggest that TTP serves an entirely different role in other leukocytes, relative to their role in regulating cytokine production by macrophages, and that TNF production is not simply regulated by TTP.</p><p>Despite these potential differences in the function of human TTP based on cell type, our studies show a common pattern of induction by LPS in monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. The upregulation of human TTP occurs rapidly, within the first hour of stimulation. This is consistent with murine data demonstrating that upregulation occurs within 30 min of LPS stimulation, remaining high for 4 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Using confocal imaging, we found TTP was primarily detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, confirming our earlier immunoblotting studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>LPS stimulation of peripheral blood leukocytes <italic>in vitro </italic>revealed TTP-induction kinetics analogous to that observed for THP-1 cells. We used a whole blood assay, since the cytokines produced after <italic>in vitro </italic>incubation with LPS are analogous to those produced after <italic>in vivo </italic>infusion, providing an important model of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Baseline expression of TTP was higher in monocytes than in either lymphocytes or neutrophils. Lymphocytes responded the least to LPS stimulation, whereas monocytes responded the most. Monocytes were not followed beyond 4 hours after stimulation with LPS, because of the low numbers of cells retrieved, probably due to upregulation of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>The induction of TTP expression by either LPS or TNF has not been studied in an <italic>in vivo </italic>system before. In this study, four human volunteers were infused with LPS and the subsequent changes in leukocyte cell count, TTP expression in leukocyte subpopulations, and levels of TNF were followed over a 72-hour period. Although there was some individual variability in the overall kinetics, basal levels and the initial induction of TTP by LPS were within the range observed <italic>in vitro </italic>(Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). All cell types showed an increase in TTP expression within the first hour. Interestingly, TTP was induced by LPS <italic>in vivo </italic>more slowly (after 4 hours vs 1&#x02013;2 hours) and to a lesser degree in the lymphocyte population than in neutrophils or monocytes. The absence of LPS-signal transducers (CD14, Toll-like receptor 4) on most lymphocytes relative to monocytes and neutrophils may account for this altered expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Since lymphocytes express TNF receptors and TNF itself can induce TTP mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], these data are consistent with the interpretation that TTP induction in lymphocytes is transduced not by LPS binding, but by TNF produced by monocytes and/or neutrophils acting on lymphocytes.</p><p>The initial fall in leukocyte cell count observed <italic>in vivo </italic>is in accord with published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The numbers of monocytes and neutrophils dropped within the first hour, by approximately 98% and 76%, respectively, and of lymphocytes, by 80% after 4 hours. This decrease is consistent with data suggesting that the reduction in leukocytes results from a decrease in granulocytes and monocytes as they become activated, migrating and adhering to vascular endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This drop in cell numbers was followed by an increase in all leukocyte populations, beginning at 12 hours and continuing through the 72-hour time point. This raises the issue of whether the apparent changes in TTP expression were due, in part, to differential rates of margination by leukocyte subpopulations. Since the levels of TTP induction seen in the first hour <italic>in vivo </italic>approximate those seen <italic>in vitro</italic>, we believe that this induction reflects the increased synthesis and expression of TTP by all leukocyte subpopulations and is consistent with the kinetics of their mRNA induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>TTP and TNF are reportedly involved in a negative-feedback loop, in which increases in TNF concentration are associated with induction of TTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In these studies, LPS, which induces the release of TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], produced a rise in TTP within 4 hours of stimulation. Although the initial rise in TTP <italic>in vivo </italic>paralleled a rapid and considerable increase in plasma TNF, the second, late increases in intracellular TTP did not reflect TNF levels. This change may have been mediated by other cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-8) whose levels have been shown to increase with kinetics that parallel this rise in TTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Alternatively, the late rise in cytoplasmic TTP may be due to release from the bone marrow of leukocytes that have high levels of TTP or an adaptive response to endotoxemia.</p><p>TNF overproduction mediates both sepsis and chronic inflammatory disorders such as RA. Its production may be modulated at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Many of the effects observed after LPS stimulation can be attributed to subsequent production of TNF. Moreover, infusion of TNF initiates inflammatory processes, with a resulting phenotype that is indistinguishable from bacterial sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We investigated the contribution of TNF in the LPS-mediated induction of TTP in THP-1 cells using a blocking TNF antibody. TNF induction of TTP expression was almost completely eliminated by incubation with the TNF inhibitor, proving the direct effect of TNF on TTP induction. LPS, however, induced much greater levels of TTP in THP-1 cells than TNF did. In the presence of blocking TNF antibody, LPS induction of TTP was initially unaffected but began to decline after 1 hour, suggesting that LPS itself may mediate the initial increases in TTP and showing that the prolonged induction of TTP is dependent on TNF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown through an intracellular staining assay that human TTP expression is modulated by LPS and TNF. LPS-induction of TTP was partly dependent on the production of TNF. The ability of LPS to induce TTP independently of TNF may account for the earlier response observed in neutrophils and monocytes that have LPS-signaling transduction molecules. In contrast, lymphocytes demonstrate a delayed and lower TTP response and are probably responding to TNF, or other cytokines, produced by myeloid cells. In addition, a second rise in TTP expression was observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, which did not correlate with any detectable rise in TNF concentration, implying that there are additional factors involved in the regulation of this intracellular protein. TNF is a predominant proinflammatory cytokine, particularly in sepsis and chronic inflammatory disorders suggesting that the role of its negative regulator, TTP, may be of functional importance in the development and pathogenesis of disease. Investigating any potential abnormalities in expression or regulation may prove to be a valuable therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>APC = allophycocyanin; ARE = AU-rich element; CM = complete media; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FACS = fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FITC = fluorescein isothiocyanate; IL = interleukin; KLH = keyhole limpet hemocyanin; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; MESF = milliequivalents of soluble fluorescein; RPMI = Roswell Park Memorial Institute [medium]; RT-PCR = reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; TNF = tumor necrosis factor; TNFR = TNF receptor; TTP = tristetraprolin; WBC = white blood cell.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Supported in part by grants from NH-IRC (PKW), NIH Grant P20 RR16437 from the COBRE Program of the National Center for Research Resources (PKW), Hitchcock Foundation Grant 90461 (MY, AJR), NRSA Predoctoral Training grants 02T32 AI07363 and AR07576 (KH, JC), and the Grimshaw-Gudewicz Foundation and Joint Research Board of St Bartholomew's Hospital (XMSR) (AMF).
