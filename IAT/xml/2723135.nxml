To date, many studies have defined spontaneous home-cage activity as total distance or total counts of activity within a test period. However, spontaneous activity is, in fact, a composite of elements of 'temporal' and 'intensity' that is similar to 'velocity'. Here, we report on quantitative trait loci for different components of spontaneous activity, an important step towards dissection of the underlying genetic mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the analysis of total home-cage activity (THA) after habituation in female mice, KJR strain exhibit higher activity than C57BL/6J (B6). In this study, THA was partitioned into two components: active time (AT) was an index of the 'temporal element' of THA, average activity during active time (AA) was an index of 'intensity'. Correlation analysis using B6xKJR F<sub>2 </sub>female mice indicated that AA is a major component of THA, whereas AA and AT were associated to a lesser degree. To explore the genetic basis of the activity differences, we conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis on data of THA and its components, AT and AA. Three significant QTL affecting variation of different components of home cage activity were identified, two linked QTL <italic>Hylaq1 </italic>and <italic>Hylaq2 </italic>on Chr 2, and <italic>Hylaq3 </italic>on Chr 10. Chromosomal positions of these QTL were previously implicated in locomotor activity (Chr 2) or open-field ambulation (Chr 10). The results indicated that <italic>Hylaq1 </italic>influences AT, <italic>Hylaq2</italic>, AA, while <italic>Hylaq3 </italic>is associated with both AA and AT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Through this study, we found that variation in total home cage activity over a 3 day period is affected by variation in active time and intensity of activity. The latter two variables are distinct components of home cage activity with only partially overlapping genetic architecture.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Spontaneous activity is a key feature of an animal's interaction with its environment reflecting a variety of metabolic, physiological and neurological processes. It has been reported that many laboratory strains of rodents exhibit variation in locomotor activity that are influenced by genetic factors. For example, Plomin et al. identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to locomotor activity in the open field using Recombinant inbred mouse strains (BXD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Several other genetic studies focused on differences of the open-field activity between various kind of mouse strains and found many QTLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In rats, Hendley et al. established a Wistar-Kyoto hyperactive (WKHA) strain that exhibits increased spontaneous activity in a novel environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A subsequent genetic study clarified QTL related to open-field activity in WKHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>However, ambulation or locomotion in open-field often reflects motivational and situational influences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. From this point of view, measuring home-cage activity is more suitable for estimating spontaneous or general activity, but there are not many reports on QTL related to spontaneous activity in a home cage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Koyner et al. found QTL related to basal activity on Chr 1, 5 and 9 using an arena apparatus covered with standard laboratory bedding that mimicked the home-cage environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. By conducting genetic analysis using similar apparatus, QTLs related to basal activity were identified on Chr 1, 9 and 19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; Chr 1, 2 and 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; Chr 4, 8, 11, 14, 18 and X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; and Chr 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recently, QTL mapping was conducted using automated home-cage measuring apparatus and mapped a locus related to spontaneous activity on Chr 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Previously, our laboratory conducted multi-phenotype behavioral characterization using a series of inbred strains derived from wild mice in addition to commonly used laboratory strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The results showed great diversity among strains in terms of the behavioral patterns, including spontaneous locomotor activity in the home cage. In particular, the activity of the KJR/Ms (KJR) strain was significantly higher than that of BLG2 and C57BL/6J (B6). Linkage analysis in the KJR and BLG2 backcross showed that two loci, <italic>Loco1 </italic>on Chr 3 and <italic>Loco2 </italic>on Chr17 influenced spontaneous locomotor activity in the home-cage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, the actual level of spontaneous locomotor activity during a defined period of time can be achieved by either short bursts of rapid movement or by steady, slow movement throughout the period, furthermore, the frequency of the bursts of activity may also vary. In fact, in most instances both 'temporal' and 'intensity' elements contribute to total activity to varying degrees. Importantly, each of those elements is likely to reflect the function distinct biological mechanisms and recent reports suggested that the genetic variation can differentially influence temporal and velocity (intensity) phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For instance, the pattern of the bursts of activity is determined by CNS mechanisms influencing sleep and activity, whereas the intensity of activity might be an outcome of neuromuscular function. Therefore, in the present paper we attempted extract additional information about the mechanism contributing to spontaneous home cage activity by partitioning it into two components.</p><p>The KJR strain is derived from wild mice captured in Kojuri, Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and belongs to the musculus subspecies group that is widely distributed from east Europe to Asia. KJR mice have retained some aspects of the wild phenotype, e.g. quick movement, pronounced inter-male aggressive behavior and high emotionality. In particular, KJR mice move quickly for long periods, resulting in high counts in the three-day measurement of spontaneous locomotor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>B6 is derived from European fancy mice and belongs to the domesticus subspecies group that is distributed in West Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Compared to KJR, B6 shows typical features of laboratory mice, e.g. slow movement and low-impulsive behavior. In addition, B6 showed intermediate level total home-cage activity among the tested strains, but this was significantly lower than that of KJR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, KJR and B6 are hypothesized to have different genetic mechanisms involved in spontaneous activity in the home cage.</p><p>In the present study we aimed to identify the genetic architecture underlying temporal and intensity components of home cage activity using phenotypically divergent inbred strain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mouse strains and maintenance</title><p>C57BL/6J (B6) and KJR/Ms (KJR) inbred strains were maintained in the animal facility at the National Institute of Genetics (NIG), Mishima, Japan. KJR was established as an inbred strain after 20 generations of brother-sister mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. For genetic mapping, F<sub>2 </sub>populations (B6xKJR F<sub>2</sub>) were generated by an intercross of the F1 mice (B6xKJR F<sub>1</sub>). Based on the previous report in which a significant difference in home-cage activity was observed between B6 and KJR in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], 274 female B6xKJR F<sub>2 </sub>mice aged between 8 and 12 weeks were generated and used to measure activities in the home-cage. All mice were maintained at NIG on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle with lights coming on at 8:00 a.m. Temperature was maintained at 23 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C with humidity at 50 &#x000b1; 10%. Mice were fed a pelleted diet (CE-2; CLEA Japan Inc, Tokyo, Japan) ad libitum, and autoclaved tap water. Mice were maintained according to NIG guidelines, and all procedures were carried out with approval (No. 18-18 and 19-6) from our institutional animal care and use committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement and analysis of spontaneous activity in home cage</title><p>The spontaneous activity in the habituated home cage was measured according to the method described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The spontaneous home-cage activity was assessed for individual mice with an infrared sensor, AB-system 24 (Neuroscience Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for a 4-day period, with the first day used for habituation. The photo beam counts were collected for each minute from 08:00 a.m. of the second day to 08:00 a.m. of the fifth day for each mouse. Total spontaneous home-cage activity (THA) was the index of total activity in the home cage and calculated as the sum of total beam counts across the three days.</p></sec><sec><title>Calculation of heritability</title><p>Broad-sense heritability (H<sup>2</sup>) is the fraction of the total phenotypic variance (V<sub>T</sub>) that is due to genetic differences among individuals in a population (V<sub>G</sub>) and calculated as follows;</p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-10-40-i1.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>In this study, V<sub>T </sub>was calculated as a variance of B6xKJR F<sub>2 </sub>population, and environmental variance (V<sub>E</sub>) was the variance among the B6xKJR F<sub>1 </sub>population (N = 11).

To explore possible pleiotropic effects on the home-cage activity phenotypes, QTL analysis of each trait was also conducted with a correlated phenotype as a covariate. For each analysis, genome-wide thresholds for suggestive (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.63), significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) and highly significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) QTL were determined by 1000 permutations.</p></sec><sec><title>Composite interval mapping performed with QTL Cartographer</title><p>Composite interval mapping (CIM, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]) was performed with QTL Cartographer ver. 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] to study whether multiple QTL exist on the same chromosome where significant QTL were found in the interval mapping analysis.

Thus, we can easily test a model of the influence of the detected QTLs to the phenotype through this analysis. SEM can graphically illustrate the network among multiple genetic and phenotypic factors for spontaneous activity.

Pearson correlation analysis between AT and AA showed a low score (r = 0.400), indicating that these two measurements reflect largely distinct biological processes, AT is temporal (how much time from the total period of 72 hours animals were active) whereas AA is the average amount of activity within a 1 minute period. A high correlation between AA and a collective total home cage activity, THA, (0.935) indicated that the intensity of activity within 1 min time period predicted the total activity across 3 days. Partitioning of THA into AA and AT provided information about the effects of the genetic variation on the processes contributing to the overall spontaneous activity. This is consistent with a previous study which also demonstrated that a 'temporal element' and 'velocity' in a home-cage are controlled by different genetic bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>QTL analysis identified three loci, <italic>Hylaq1</italic>, <italic>Hylaq2 </italic>and <italic>Hylaq3</italic>, associated with spontaneous home-cage activity.
