Previous studies showed that LRP6 was important for efficient intoxication of human M2182 prostate carcinoma cells but other studies performed with cells from gene-knockout mice demonstrated no role for either LRP6 or the related LRP5 protein in anthrax toxin entry. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that LRP6 may be important for anthrax toxin entry into human, but not mouse, cells. To test this idea we have investigated the effect of knocking down LRP6 or LRP5 expression with siRNAs in human HeLa cells. We show here that efficient knockdown of either LRP6, LRP5, or both proteins has no influence on the kinetics of anthrax lethal toxin entry or MEK1 substrate cleavage in these cells. These data argue against a human-specific role for LRP6 in anthrax toxin entry and suggest instead that involvement of this protein may be restricted to certain cell types independently of their species of origin.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, the etiological agent of anthrax, secretes a tripartite toxin, which is one of two major virulence factors.

Evidence in favor of a specific role was provided by Cohen and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001817-Wei1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In that study, LRP6 was identified through a genome-wide antisense RNA screening approach to be important for intoxication of human M2182 prostate carcinoma cells by PA and FP59, a recombinant toxin comprised of the N-terminal portion of LF fused to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> exotoxin A. Consistently, siRNA-mediated knockdown of LRP6 levels in these cells reduced their toxin sensitivity by several orders of magnitude, an effect that was partially overcome by expression of an siRNA-resistant form of LRP6. LRP6 deficiency in M2182 cells was also associated with reduced levels of PA binding and pore formation, and expression of a dominant-negative form of LRP6, lacking its cytoplasmic domain, rendered these cells resistant to intoxication. This group also showed that LRP6 could be co-precipitated with both ANTXR1 and ANTXR2. Furthermore, they showed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of LRP6 rendered RAW264.7 mouse macrophages resistant to intoxication by PA and LF, although this effect was much more modest (&#x0223c;3-fold) than that seen with M2182 cells. LRP6-specific antibodies also protected RAW264.7 cells from intoxication.</p><p>By contrast, Duesbury and colleagues found that LRP6<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and LRP5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were just as susceptible to killing after LeTx injection as wild-type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001817-Young1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. LRP5 is a protein that is highly related to LRP6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001817-Brown1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, they showed that mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) that were isolated from LRP6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or LRP5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were just as susceptible to intoxication by PA and FP59, and to MEK1 cleavage by LF and PA, as those isolated from wild-type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001817-Young1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. They went on to show that there is no obvious receptor-specific role for LRP6 since knocking down this protein had no effect on the toxin sensitivity of PA receptor-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells that were engineered to express either ANTXR1 or ANTXR2.</p><p>Duesbury and colleagues put forward several possible explanations for the discrepant results. Since their data argue against an anthrax toxin receptor-specific role for LRP6, and there is no evidence for functional redundancy between LRP6 and LRP5 in toxin entry, they suggested that instead LRP6 might function in either a human-specific or cell type-specific manner. In this report we show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of LRP6 and/or LRP5 levels has no impact on the kinetics of anthrax toxin entry into human HeLa cells. These data argue against a human-specific role for either LRP6 or LRP5 in anthrax toxin entry and suggest that the requirement for LRP6 might be restricted to certain cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Efficient siRNA-mediated knockdown of LRP6 and LRP5 expression in HeLa cells</title><p>HeLa cells were chosen as a model human cell type because they have been used extensively for anthrax toxin entry studies and they are efficiently transfected with siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001817-Abrami1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001817-Abrami3">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001817-Boll1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.
