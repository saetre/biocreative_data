However, the downstream signaling events underlying these functional properties remain unclear. Here, we identify cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (cPLA<sub>2</sub>) as a central molecule in NKG2D-mediated cytolysis in CTLs. Furthermore, we report that NKG2D induces, upon recognition of MIC<sup>+</sup> target cells, the release of arachidonic acid (AA) by CTLs to promote tissue inflammation in association with target killing. Interestingly, IL-15, which licenses NKG2D-mediated lymphokine killer activity in CTLs, cooperates with NKG2D to induce cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation and AA release. Finally, cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation in intraepithelial CTLs of celiac patients provides an in vivo pathophysiological dimension to cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation in CTLs. These results reveal an unrecognized link between NKG2D and tissue inflammation, which may underlie the emerging role of NKG2D in various immunopathological conditions and define new therapeutic targets.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>NKG2D is a NK cell receptor expressed by all human CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) that recognizes MHC class I&#x02013;related chain (MIC) and UL-16&#x02013;binding protein (ULPB) molecules expressed on stressed and transformed target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). NKG2D has been implicated in antitumor immunity mediated by both NK cells and CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) and in T cell&#x02013;mediated immune disorders such as celiac disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), and NOD mouse model for juvenile type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In humans, NKG2D associates exclusively with DAP10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), an adaptor with a YINM cytoplasmic tail motif that activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), but not the syk/ZAP-70 kinase family. Because of these similarities with the CD28 signaling pathway, NKG2D&#x02013;DAP10 was initially thought to function mainly as a co-stimulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) and to play a role in autoimmunity by promoting activation of autoreactive T cells. However, several studies indicate that NKG2D&#x02013;DAP10 in human can also mediate cytolysis independently of TCR engagement in effector CTLs exposed to IL-15 or high doses of IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). This layer of effector T cell regulation by NKG2D at the level of cytolysis may serve to effectively and rapidly eliminate infected or transformed target tissue cells independently of antigen specificity, and may participate in aberrant tissue destruction in diseases in which IL-15 expression is dysregulated (for review see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>]).</p><p>The downstream co-stimulatory and cytolytic signaling pathways recruited by NKG2D in CTLs remain incompletely characterized. Intriguingly, several studies suggest that cPLA<sub>2</sub> may be involved in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). However, how cPLA<sub>2</sub> drives immunopathological processes and whether it involves CTLs is poorly understood. Interestingly, several reports point to a potential role of cPLA<sub>2</sub> in T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Furthermore, cPLA<sub>2</sub> was shown to be involved in granule exocytosis by neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), hormonal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), and granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), suggesting that it might also be implicated in granular release occurring in the context of cytolysis and cytokine secretion in T cells. Finally, cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation by surface receptors is dependent on phosphorylation at Ser<sup>505</sup> by MAP kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), and NKG2D induces c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase (ERK) activation in CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Together, these observations prompted us to examine a potential link between cPLA<sub>2</sub> and NKG2D effector function in CTLs and its relevance in celiac disease.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>cPLA<sub>2</sub> plays a critical role in direct NKG2D-mediated cytolysis</title><p>NKG2D is licensed to mediate cytolysis independently of TCR activation in CTLs when they are in an effector stage and in the presence of IL-15 or high doses of IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Importantly, under these conditions it is possible to assess how cPLA<sub>2</sub> affects NKG2D effector functions independently from other receptors. To determine that our findings were not restricted to a particular subset of effector CTLs, we analyzed the effect of cPLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition in a variety of effector CTLs. Specifically, we studied freshly isolated effector intestinal intraepithelial CTLs (IE-CTLs) that were prestimulated in vitro with IL-15, normal IE-CTL clones, IE-CTL clones derived from celiac patients, peripheral blood effector CTL (PB-CTL) clones, and the leukemia TALL-104 CD8 T cell line. This latter cell line was previously used as a model to study the NKG2D cytolytic signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). All clones and cell lines were grown in the presence of a high concentration of IL-2, which is known to substitute for IL-15.</p><p>The cPLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor AACOCF3 (CF3) impaired NKG2D-mediated cytolysis in antibody-redirected cytolytic assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, left). Importantly, this finding could be extended to cytolytic assays using MIC-transfected C1R cells as targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, right). Furthermore, arachidonic acid (AA) significantly restored cytolysis, strongly arguing against a nonspecific effect of the cPLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor AACOCF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, right). Finally, AACOCF3 and AA had a dose-dependent effect on NKG2D-mediated cytolysis in freshly isolated IE-CTLs (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071887/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071887/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>NKG2D-mediated cytolysis in CTL is cPLA<sub>2</sub> dependent.</bold> (A) cPLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition by the pharmacological inhibitor AACOCF3 (CF3) blocks NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity. Fresh IE-CTL prestimulated with IL-15 for 48 h, celiac IE-CTL clones, PB-CTL clones, and TALL-104 leukemia CTLs were pretreated for 30 min with vehicle control or CF3 before the cytolysis assay. Depending on the nature of the CTLs studied, distinct E/T ratios were used to achieve similar levels of specific lysis (50:1 for fresh IE-CTLs and PB-CTLs, 15:1 for celiac IE-CTLs, and 5:1 for TALL-104 leukemia CTLs). Data are means &#x000b1; SD of three independent experiments for each cell line. P values reported are from a Tukey-adjusted pairwise comparison. (left) Cytolysis of Fc&#x003b3;R<sup>+</sup> P815 cells was significantly blocked by 20 &#x000b5;M CF3 in the presence of anti-NKG2D, but not anti-CD3, antibody. (right) Cytolysis of C1R/MIC transfectants was blocked upon pretreatment of CTLs with 20 &#x000b5;M CF3 and restored when 100 &#x000b5;M AA was added 1 h after the beginning of the cytolysis assay. Importantly, CF3 did not affect the level of intracellular granzyme and perforin expression (Fig. S2). (B) Knockdown of cPLA<sub>2</sub> in TALL-104 CTLs significantly impairs NKG2D-mediated cytolysis, but not TCR-mediated cytolysis under optimal conditions of stimulation. Untransfected cPLA<sub>2</sub> and control siRNA-transfected TALL-104 CTLs were studied 72 h after transfection. (left) cPLA<sub>2</sub> siRNA significantly decreases cPLA<sub>2</sub> expression without affecting JNK and ERK activation. Untransfected and transfected TALL-104 were cultured for 72 h, serum-starved overnight, and stimulated for 5 min (p-ERK) or 15 min (p-JNK), respectively, with anti-NKG2D. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-cPLA<sub>2</sub>, then stripped and blotted with anti-phospho-ERK (p-ERK) or -JNK (p-JNK) mAbs. <italic>Right panel:</italic> cPLA<sub>2</sub> siRNA inhibited significantly NKG2D-mediated cytolysis in a redirected cytolytic assay using <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled Fc&#x003b3;R<sup>+</sup> P815 targets.

(D) AA reconstitutes NKG2D cytolytic function against C1R/MIC<sup>+</sup> target cells in TALL-104 transfected with cPLA<sub>2</sub> siRNA.

(left) Knock-down of cPLA<sub>2</sub> did not affect 5-LO expression, whereas 5-LO siRNA decreased significantly 5-LO expression without affecting cPLA<sub>2</sub> expression. Cells were sorted into transfected (GFP<sup>+</sup>) and untransfected cells (GFP<sup>-</sup>) cell populations 24 h after transfection with cPLA<sub>2</sub> siRNA, control siRNA or 5-LO siRNA in addition to GFP plasmids. Cell lysates were analyzed 12 h later by Western blot with anti-cPLA<sub>2</sub> antibody, then stripped and immunoblotted with anti-5-LO antibody.

Importantly, cPLA<sub>2</sub> siRNA specifically targeted cPLA<sub>2</sub> expression, as it affected neither ERK nor JNK expression (not depicted) and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, left), nor 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, left). The effect of cPLA<sub>2</sub> knock down on NKG2D-mediated cytolysis was assessed in two ways. First, in redirected cytolytic assays, as expected, NKG2D-mediated cytolysis was inhibited by up to 50% in the presence of cPLA<sub>2</sub> siRNA, but not control siRNA. In contrast, TCR-mediated cytolysis remained essentially intact for this level of specific cytolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, middle). The level of inhibition observed for NKG2D-mediated cytolysis was highly significant considering that some residual cPLA<sub>2</sub> could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, left). Second, similar results were obtained when using MIC<sup>+</sup>C1R target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Importantly, addition of AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), but not a control polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (LA), rescued NKG2D-mediated cytolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, right). The assays were performed either with global unsorted siRNA-transfected CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and D</xref>, right), or with CTLs sorted into GFP<sup>+</sup>-transfected and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-untransfected CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, middle).</p><p>Having shown that cPLA<sub>2</sub> played a role in NKG2D-mediated cytolysis, we wanted to more specifically demonstrate its role in the release of cytolytic granules. We previously reported, that ligation of NKG2D receptors expressed on CTLs with monoclonal anti-NKG2D mAb triggered granule release using a BLT esterase assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). As anticipated, knock down of cPLA<sub>2</sub> by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) blocked degranulation. Similar results were obtained in the presence of the pharmacological inhibitor CF3 (unpublished data). Importantly, cPLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition did not affect the level of granzyme and perforin expression in CTLs (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071887/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071887/DC1</ext-link>), further suggesting that cPLA<sub>2</sub> plays a role in NKG2D-mediated degranulation.</p><p>Interestingly, cPLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition by AACOCF3 or knock down by siRNA affected only marginally TCR-mediated cytolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation is necessary for NKG2D cytolytic co-stimulatory functions.</bold> Inhibition of cPLA<sub>2</sub> blocks NKG2D augmentation of cytolytic T cell functions and AA reverses this blockage. Co-stimulation of cytolytic T cell functions by NKG2D was studied using three different PB-CTL clones (#411, #414, and #348) that were generated and cultured with low IL-2 (5 U/ml), in which NKG2D does not mediate direct cytolysis. Representative experiments of clone 411(top) and 414 (middle) are shown. PB-CTLs were pretreated with vehicle or CF3. Redirected cytolysis was performed against <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled FcgR<sup>+</sup> P815 targets (E/T ratio of 50:1) in the presence of anti-CD3 mAbs at the indicated concentration in combination with either anti-NKG2D mAbs or isotype control IgG1 at fixed concentration (1 &#x000b5;g/ml).

How these upstream signaling events are interconnected in CTLs remains to be determined. NKG2D-mediated cytolysis requires activation of cPLA<sub>2</sub> and AA release, suggesting that the level of calcium mobilization achieved upon NKG2D cross-linking is insufficient to allow membrane fusion events and exocytosis. Cytosolic PLA<sub>2</sub> activation itself is mediated through two independent pathways, Vav-1&#x02192;JNKK1/2&#x02192;JNK1/2&#x02192;cPLA<sub>2</sub> and PI3-K&#x02192;MEK1/2&#x02192;ERK&#x02192;cPLA<sub>2</sub>.

Interestingly, IL-15, which licenses NKG2D killing in CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), enhances NKG2D-mediated JNK, ERK and cPLA<sub>2</sub> phosphorylation, and AA release. Once released, AA can potentially be reincorporated into phospholipids, mediate the biosynthesis of eicosanoids and induce granulocyte activation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20071887_RGB_Fig7"/></fig><p>The molecular basis for exocytosis is a field of high investigation. It involves trafficking of granules to the plasma membrane and membrane fusion events. There is increasing evidence that exocytosis can be triggered, either under conditions of high-level calcium mobilization sufficient to activate snare-mediated membrane fusion (for review see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>]), or under conditions of low levels of calcium mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>) involving AA and its eicosanoids metabolites, which are known as fusogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). This latter mechanism is thought to play a role in neutrophil and neuroendocrine cell degranulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). It may be particularly relevant for surface receptors that, similar to NKG2D, signal through an adaptor molecule lacking an ITAM motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), and induce relatively low levels of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071887/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071887/DC1</ext-link>). Pharmacological studies performed in the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>) suggested that inflammatory lipid mediators may play a role in NK cell&#x02013;mediated lysis in human and rodents without defining the receptors involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). More recently, cPLA<sub>2</sub> was proposed to contribute to NKR-P1A&#x02013;induced cytolysis in rat NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). However, recent findings in human indicate that engagement of NKR-P1A by its ligand LLT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>) inhibited rather than induced NK cell&#x02013;mediated lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). Furthermore, the nature of the adaptor molecule associated with NKR-P1A remains undefined. Thus, the role of cPLA<sub>2</sub> could not be ascribed to particular cytolytic signaling pathways and to individual NK receptors in human. Our study unambiguously identifies the NKG2D&#x02013;DAP10 in human CTLs as an immunoreceptor complex that requires cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation and AA release as integral components of its cytolytic machinery. In addition, our preliminary data indicate that this finding is not limited to CTLs, because the NKG2D cytolytic pathway in NK cells also involves cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation (unpublished data). Interestingly, our data suggest that cPLA<sub>2</sub> is not significantly involved in TCR-mediated cytolysis. Future studies will determine whether, more generally, ITAM-signaling receptors mobilizing high levels of calcium mediate granule exocytosis independently of cPLA<sub>2</sub>. In agreement, NK cell receptors associated with ITAM-bearing adaptor molecules induce high levels of calcium flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) and cPLA<sub>2</sub>-independent cytolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Importantly, however, even though cPLA<sub>2</sub> is not directly involved in TCR-mediated cytolysis, it plays a critical role in the co-stimulation of cytolytic T cell responses. Notably, NKG2D was unsuccessful to induce cPLA<sub>2</sub> phosphorylation in resting CD8<sup>+</sup>TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> peripheral blood lymphocytes. This finding may explain why NKG2D fails to exert co-stimulatory function in resting noneffector CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). Together, these observations are in agreement with the general concept, reported by Bryceson et al.

A critical role for Vav in natural killer signaling and cytotoxicity has been reported in mouse and human by several groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref>). Vav is thought to play a role similar to that of ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>) in cytolysis by promoting granule polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>). This study reveals that Vav1 is upstream of JNK in the NKG2D cytolytic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). More importantly, it sheds a new light on the role of the PI3K&#x02013;ERK and Vav&#x02013;JNK pathways in NKG2D-mediated cytolysis by showing that ERK and JNK critically regulate cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation, which in turn critically regulates NKG2D-mediated degranulation and cytolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Whether AA, which is released upon cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation, plays a role in granule exocytosis as fusogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>) or indirectly through its role in the biosynthesis of eicosanoids remains to be determined. AA serves as a substrate to 5-LO and cyclooxygenase (COX), which drive the leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis pathways, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Interestingly, although NKG2D engagement induces 5-LO and COX activation, only 5-LO is involved in NKG2D-mediated cytolysis (unpublished data). These observations are in agreement with reports suggesting that leukotrienes, but not prostaglandins, play a role in lymphokine-activated killer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>) and NK-mediated cytolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref>).</p><p>Convergent observations suggest that IL-15 and NKG2D may coordinately regulate CTL effector functions and mediate organ-specific immunopathology (for review see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>]). For instance, the role of NKG2D as a direct mediator of cytolysis was shown in celiac disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Celiac disease is an inflammatory intestinal disorder with an autoimmune component triggered by dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>). Although the role of gluten-specific, DQ2- or DQ8-restricted CD4 T cells in the lamina propria was accepted early on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref>), the role of IE-CTLs was questioned because no gluten-specific IE-CTLs could be identified (for review see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref>]). Our finding that IL-15 primed NKG2D in CTLs to kill MIC-expressing enterocytes in celiac disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) provided an explanation as to how IE-CTLs could cause intestinal damage and malabsorption, despite their inability to recognize gluten. Licensing by IL-15 was shown to involve up-regulation of NKG2D and DAP-10 expression, and activation of the PI3-K&#x02192;ERK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). We now show that IL-15 is also involved in the activation of JNK. More importantly, we demonstrate that IL-15&#x02013;mediated licensing of the NKG2D cytolytic pathway requires cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation, and that cPLA<sub>2</sub> is highly activated in IE-CTLs of active celiac patients. Interestingly, cPLA<sub>2</sub> is concomitantly activated in the intestinal epithelial cells. This activation of cPLA<sub>2</sub> may be secondary to the activation of enterocytes by IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref>) and/or AA released by IE-CTLs.</p><p>Finally, our study reveals that NKG2D and IL-15 signaling in effector CTLs causes CTLs to release AA and potentially eicosanoids, such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins. Eicosanoid synthesis by CTLs is supported by our findings that NKG2D induces AA production and activates 5-LO and COX (unpublished data). Interestingly, AA and eicosanoids favor granulocyte recruitment and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref>). These findings establish an unrecognized link between CTLs, NKG2D, IL-15, and inflammation, which may have as of yet unrecognized pathological implications. In particular, it may be relevant in immune-mediated diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease, where NKG2D and IL-15 play a pathogenic role (for review see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>]) and where granulocytes are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">80</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">84</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our findings invite us to reexamine the role of IL-15 and NKG2D in inflammation and autoimmunity, and develop therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking cPLA<sub>2</sub> in diseases associated with dysregulated IL-15 expression and NKG2D activation. Future studies will determine whether 5-LO and COX should also be targeted. Our preliminary observations suggest that 5-LO, but not COX, is involved in NKG2D-mediated immunopathology. In addition, in view of observations suggesting that prostaglandins inhibit NK cell cytolytic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">86</xref>), blocking COX activation may even be deleterious.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Human subjects.</title><p>For immunohistochemical studies, six adult patients with active celiac disease and four control aged-matched individuals undergoing biopsies for functional intestinal disorders of nonceliac origin were studied.
