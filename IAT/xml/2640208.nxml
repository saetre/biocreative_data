Although its precise function remains largely unknown, parkin seems to play a neuroprotective role. Several studies indicate that changes in parkin solubility induced by post-translational modifications, such as S-nitrosylation or dopamine modification, comprise one mechanism of parkin inactivation associated with disease. Protein phosphorylation events have recently been linked to the molecular mechanism(s) underlying PD, but the role of this post-translational modification for parkin function has remained unclear. Here we report that compound phosphorylation of parkin by both casein kinase I and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) decreases parkin solubility, leading to its aggregation and inactivation. Combined kinase inhibition partially reverses the aggregative properties of several pathogenic point mutants in cultured cells. Enhanced parkin phosphorylation is detected in distinct brain areas of individuals with sporadic PD and correlates with increases in the levels of p25, the activator of cdk5. These findings indicate that casein kinase I and cdk5 may represent novel combinatorial therapeutic targets for treating PD.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive and substantially disabling neurodegenerative disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C3">3</xref>). Its clinical symptoms primarily result from the progressive and rather selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Besides cell death, a pathological hallmark of PD in surviving neurons comprises Lewy bodies, ubiquitylated intraneuronal inclusions rich in &#x003b1;-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C4">4</xref>).</p><p>Even though largely a sporadic disorder, there are several genes associated with inherited forms of PD. One commonly implicated is PARK2, the gene encoding for parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C5">5</xref>). Indeed, mutations in the parkin gene are responsible for a large percentage of autosomal-recessive, juvenile-onset parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C7">7</xref>). A variety of homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations have been reported, and although mutations that reduce but do not abolish parkin function are accompanied by dopaminergic cell loss in the presence of Lewy bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C9">9</xref>), homozygous loss-of-function parkin mutations seem to be associated with a lack of Lewy bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C10">10</xref>), raising the possibility that parkin may be involved in Lewy body biogenesis. Furthermore, parkin may also play a role in sporadic PD, given that it is present in Lewy bodies from sporadic PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C12">12</xref>).</p><p>Parkin functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C13">13</xref>), and inactivation of its catalytic activity may lead to dopaminergic cell death due to the accumulation of toxic substrate protein(s). Recent studies suggest that changes in parkin solubility comprise a major mechanism of parkin inactivation both in familial and sporadic PD. For example, a wide range of pathogenic parkin point mutations result in decreased parkin solubility and promote its aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C16">16</xref>). In addition, an array of oxidative stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C17">17</xref>), as well as direct post-translational parkin modifications, including dopamine modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C18">18</xref>) or S-nitrosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C20">20</xref>), lead to dramatic changes in the solubility of parkin, thereby highlighting a mechanism for parkin dysfunction in the pathogenesis of idiopathic PD.</p><p>Protein phosphorylation is another post-translational modification which has recently been linked to mechanism(s) underlying PD (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C21">21</xref>). As protein kinases are tractable drug targets, these findings may help in the design of novel therapeutic strategies. Parkin has been previously described to be subject to phosphorylation by casein kinase I or by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), with modest changes in its enzymatic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in either case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C23">23</xref>). Given that compound or hyperphosphorylation of proteins can have profound effects on their aggregative properties, we sought to determine whether compound phosphorylation of parkin may modulate its aggregative properties. We hypothesized that such phosphorylation-induced changes could contribute directly to the inactivation of parkin and concomitantly reduced survival of dopaminergic neurons in PD.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Compound phosphorylation of parkin <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells</title><p>We first carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation experiments using a set of purified protein kinases and recombinant full-length human parkin protein, or select domains thereof (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN407F1">1</xref>A and B).

Together, these data show that inhibiting compound phosphorylation of parkin can regulate its aggregative properties in culture, indicating that such treatment is useful in maintaining parkin's protective function in cultured cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we report that parkin, a protein essential for the sustained survival of dopaminergic neurons, is subject to compound phosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cultured cells. Such compound phosphorylation by casein kinase I and cdk5 enhances its insolubility, leading to aggregation and concomitant inactivation. Although phosphorylation does not change parkin's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, increased aggregation effectively decreases the amount of soluble parkin protein able to exert a neuroprotective role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C33">33</xref>). Notably, only simultaneous, but not individual phosphorylation by either casein kinase I or cdk5 seems to alter parkin solubility. Moreover, phosphorylation of parkin by one kinase seems to enhance its susceptibility to serve as a substrate for the other kinase. In this manner, simultaneous activation of both kinases may cooperatively contribute towards parkin inactivation.</p><p>To assess whether parkin phosphorylation may occur in humans, we analyzed samples from caudate nucleus, cortex and cerebellum of control and PD brains. We observed enhanced parkin phosphorylation in PD when compared with control in the caudate, with no changes in the cortex. Of note, parkin phosphorylation could not be detected in the cerebellum in either control or PD samples. The neuroanatomical differences in parkin phosphorylation between control and sporadic PD samples correlate with the relative extent to which these distinct brain areas are affected by disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C28">28</xref>), indicating that abnormal parkin phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation may contribute to neuronal degeneration in sporadic PD.</p><p>We further examined whether the increase in parkin phosphorylation in PD brains may correlate with increases in the levels of cdk5, its activator p25/p35 or casein kinase I. Although we observed no changes in the levels of cdk5 or the levels of distinct casein kinase isoforms, we did find an increase in the levels of p25 in the caudate in PD when compared with control samples, with no changes in the cortex and the absence of detectable p25 in the cerebellum. In this context, it is interesting to note that p25 is known to lead to prolonged activation of cdk5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C34">34</xref>) and that cdk5 and p35 have been reported to accumulate in Lewy bodies in postmortem PD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C36">36</xref>). Furthermore, an increase in cdk5 levels and activity has been observed in an 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C37">37</xref>), and various neurotoxic insults induce generation of p25 from p35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C38">38</xref>), indicating that the activity of cdk5 may play a key role in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C39">39</xref>).</p><p>Little is known regarding de-regulation of casein kinase I activities during neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C40">40</xref>), but most casein kinase I isoforms seem to be basally active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C41">41</xref>). Our present data suggest that increased cdk5-mediated parkin phosphorylation would lead to a concomitant increase in casein kinase I-mediated phosphorylation events, as detected here using phospho-state-specific antibodies, thereby generating a compound phosphorylated protein with decreased solubility.</p><p>Finally, the generally high basal casein kinase I and cdk5 activities suggest a very active role for protein phosphatases in controlling the steady-state levels of parkin phosphorylation. Indeed, a variety of studies indicate that inhibition of phosphatase activities, with concomitant hyperphosphorylation of proteins, can lead to PD-related neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C43">43</xref>). Thus, a complex balance between kinase and phosphatase activities, possibly in a cell-type and region-specific manner, may be subject to acute and/or chronic regulation.</p><p>To determine whether inhibition of casein kinase I and cdk5 activities would display beneficial effects in decreasing the aggregative properties of pathogenic parkin-mutant protein, we chose to analyze three distinct point mutants whose pathogenic mechanism of action seems to involve enhanced aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C16">16</xref>). Importantly, using a combination of inhibitors against casein kinase I and cdk5, we could decrease the number of cells displaying parkin aggregates for two out of three mutants tested (R256C and R275W). For the third point mutant (C289G), which displayed the most dramatic aggregative phenotype, combined kinase inhibition led to a decrease in the number of cells displaying large perinuclear aggregates, indicating beneficial effects of such inhibitor treatment in modulating the profound aggregation even of this pathogenic mutant.</p><p>In conclusion, our experiments indicate that regulating the phosphorylation status of parkin has beneficial effects in reducing parkin aggregation and concomitant inactivation. Although future studies will be necessary to determine the neuroprotective or beneficial effects of combined kinase inhibition for PD subjects, the present results may have additional implications for other approaches in treating this neurodegenerative disorder, including gene replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C45">45</xref>) or transplantation therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C46">46</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Human full-length parkin was amplified by PCR (primer sequences: 5&#x02032;-TTA TGA ATT CAT ATA GTG TTT GTC AGG TTC AAC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-TTT AAA GCT TTT ACA CGT CGA ACC AGT GGT CCC-3&#x02032;) using a full-length piTrex human parkin cDNA construct and cloned into the <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Hin</italic>dIII restriction sites of the pGEX-KG vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN407C47">47</xref>).

Perinuclear aggregates were independently verified to be aggresomes by double-staining with a monoclonal anti-vimentin antibody (1:200, clone V9, Sigma) and a goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor-594-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen). For all determinations, between 250 and 1000 transfected cells were analyzed, and in all cases, additional analysis was performed by an observer blind to conditions.
