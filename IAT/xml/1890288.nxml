We show that the expression patterns of <italic>Sp5</italic>, <italic>Sp8</italic>, and <italic>Sp9</italic>, members of the <italic>Sp8</italic>-like family that are homologues of <italic>Drosophila buttonhead</italic>, correlate during early embryonic development with these three telencephalic patterning centers. To study potential functional relationships, we focused on <italic>Sp8</italic>, because it is transiently expressed in the CoP coincident with the expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic>, a morphogen implicated in area patterning of the neocortex. We also show that <italic>Sp8 </italic>is expressed in cortical progenitors in a high to low anterior-medial to posterior-lateral gradient across the ventricular zone. We used <italic>in utero </italic>electroporation of full-length and chimeric expression constructs to perform gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies of interactions between <italic>Sp8 </italic>and <italic>Fgf8 </italic>and their roles in cortical area patterning.

Ectopic expression of Sp8 in anterior or posterior cortical poles induces significant anterior or posterior shifts in area patterning, respectively, paralleled by changes in expression of gene markers of positional identity. These effects of <italic>Sp8 </italic>on area patterning oppose those induced by ectopic expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic>, suggesting that in parallel to regulating <italic>Fgf8 </italic>expression, <italic>Sp8 </italic>also activates a distinct signaling pathway for cortical area patterning.

Vertebrate homologues of <italic>ems </italic>and <italic>otd</italic>, which encode the Emx and Otx families of transcription factors (TFs), respectively, have been studied extensively, particularly their roles in mammalian forebrain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Vertebrate homologues of <italic>btd</italic>, a member of the <italic>Sp1</italic>-Zn finger family of TFs, have also been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], but in contrast to homologues of <italic>ems </italic>and <italic>otd</italic>, they have been studied relatively little, particularly their roles in brain development.</p><p>Nine genes have been identified in mammals as <italic>btd </italic>homologues and the proteins they encode share <italic>btd </italic>and Zn finger domains. Based on the domain structures of their protein products, these nine genes are divided into a <italic>Sp1</italic>-like family (<italic>Sp1-4</italic>) and a <italic>Sp8</italic>-like family (<italic>Sp5&#x02013;9</italic>). However, because <italic>Sp8 </italic>can rescue the defects in head development in <italic>Drosophila btd </italic>mutants, whereas <italic>Sp1 </italic>cannot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], <italic>Sp8 </italic>and its family are viewed as the functional homologues of <italic>Drosophila btd</italic>. Mice deficient for either <italic>Sp5 </italic>or <italic>Sp8 </italic>have been reported. <italic>Sp5 </italic>knockout mice reportedly have no overt phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In contrast, analyses of <italic>Sp8 </italic>knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], complemented by retrovirus-mediated overexpression studies in embryonic chicks using dominant negative and active forms of <italic>Sp8 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], indicate that <italic>Sp8 </italic>is required for limb and head formation.</p><p>A prominent role for <italic>Sp8 </italic>in limb development is to maintain the expression of several morphogens, including fibroblast growth factor (<italic>Fgf</italic>)<italic>8</italic>, bone morphogenic protein (<italic>Bmp</italic>)<italic>4</italic>, and Sonic hedgehog (<italic>Shh</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Because these morphogens have prominent roles in forebrain development, we examined the expression of the <italic>Sp8</italic>-like family members in the developing mouse forebrain to determine their potential for roles in forebrain patterning, particularly the patterning of the neocortex into 'areas', which are anatomically and functionally distinct divisions with specialized functions in sensory perception, motor performance, learning and memory.</p><p>The genetic mechanisms that control cortical area patterning, that is, arealization, have come under intense study in the past few years, but remain sketchy. Current evidence indicates that morphogens secreted by signaling centers located at the perimeter of the developing dorsal telencephalon (dTel) establish gradients of TFs across the dTel ventricular zone (VZ), which in turn determine the area fate of cortical progenitors and their progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These morphogens include Fgf8 expressed by the anterior neural ridge (ANR), which later becomes the commissural plate (CoP), located at the anterior midline of the dTel, and also members of the <italic>wingless-int </italic>(<italic>Wnt</italic>s) and <italic>Bmp </italic>families expressed by the cortical hem and choroid plexus epithelium (CPe), located at the dorsal midline of more posterior dTel. In addition, the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (<italic>Shh</italic>) is expressed in the forebrain, but in ventral structures, including the prechordal plate and the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE).</p><p>Here we describe that each of these three major signaling centers in mouse forebrain is uniquely associated with the discrete expression patterns of a member of the <italic>Sp8</italic>-like <italic>btd </italic>family, <italic>Sp5</italic>, <italic>Sp8 </italic>and <italic>Sp9</italic>. These associations are suggestive of functional interactions between the <italic>Sp </italic>family members and the respective morphogens. To address this issue, we focused on functions of <italic>Sp8</italic>, which at early stages of cortical development is expressed in association with the expression domain of <italic>Fgf8 </italic>in the ANR/CoP. We employed both gain and loss of function strategies using <italic>in utero </italic>electroporation to manipulate gene function in a localized manner, a technique similar to that recently used by others to show roles for <italic>Fgf8 </italic>in cortical area patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We complemented these <italic>in vivo </italic>studies with <italic>in vitro </italic>assays of inductive pathways and interactions. These approaches allowed us to overcome the early embryonic lethality and forebrain defects exhibited by <italic>Sp8 </italic>knockout mice, including the failure of the anterior neural tube to close and the cerebral cortex to develop, that preclude an analysis of <italic>Sp8 </italic>in cortical patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>We show that <italic>Sp8 </italic>and <italic>Fgf8 </italic>can robustly induce one another, and that the induction of <italic>Fgf8 </italic>by <italic>Sp8 </italic>is repressed by the homeodomain TF, Emx2, which itself has been implicated in controlling area patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The reciprocal induction between <italic>Sp8 </italic>and <italic>Fgf8 </italic>exhibits significant specificity among family members. In addition, we show that <italic>Sp8 </italic>affects cortical area patterning, but in a manner that opposes that of <italic>Fgf8</italic>, raising the possibility that Sp8 influences area patterning not only by regulating Fgf8 and its signaling pathway, but also through a distinct mechanism. Our findings show that <italic>Sp8 </italic>interacts with <italic>Fgf8 </italic>to balance the anterior-posterior (A-P) area patterning of the cortex.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Forebrain expression of the <italic>Sp8</italic>-like family, mouse btd homologues, and correlation with signaling centers in the forebrain</title><p>We used <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization to analyze the expression patterns of the <italic>Sp8</italic>-like family members (<italic>Sp5&#x02013;Sp9</italic>) on brain whole mounts at E9.5 and sections through the forebrain from E9.5 through E13.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; data not shown).

The pattern of Sp5 expression is considerably more extensive than the cortical hem/CPe, but most of the caudomedial part of the Sp5 expression domain contains the Wnt2b expression domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c, f, i</xref>), a marker for the cortical hem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

The <italic>Sp8 </italic>domain is associated with the <italic>Fgf8 </italic>expression domain in the CoP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b, c</xref>).

Another possibility, and not mutually exclusive, is that a repressor of Sp8 induction of <italic>Fgf8 </italic>is present in the dTel but not the CoP.

Anterior EP of Sp8 expression constructs has an opposing effect on area patterning to that of Fgf8, and results in an anterior shift in cortical areas. Posterior EP of either Fgf8 or Sp8 have the opposing effect on area patterning compared to their anterior EP. These opposing effects of ectopic expression of Sp8 on area patterning compared to Fgf8 indicate that Sp8 activates a signaling pathway(s) that can overcome the effect of Fgf8 signaling, perhaps by interfering with Fgf8 signaling or dominating it. Furthermore, Sp8 expression in cortical progenitors may trigger distinct signaling pathways that function to facilitate posterior area identity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-8104-2-10-12"/></fig><p>This interpretation is consistent with the report that the domain of <italic>Fgf8 </italic>expression expands in dTel beyond the CoP in <italic>Emx2 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, our findings provide an explanation for the report that ectopic expression of <italic>Emx2 </italic>constructs electroporated into the CoP of forebrain slices can repress <italic>Fgf8 </italic>expression when done at E11.5 embryonic stages but not at E13.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

It is possible that Sp8-mediated Fgf8 upregulation could be due to a suppression of Bmp signaling, because Fukuchi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] reported that Noggin, a Bmp inhibitor, induces Fgf8 expression in vivo when overexpressed in forebrain. We thus tested whether manipulating Bmp activity can mediate Sp8 transcriptional activation of Fgf8 (see Legend to Additional file 1 below). First, we tested if C3H10T1/2 cells in our assay respond to manipulation of Bmp signaling. For this purpose, we used a Id1-reporter construct that has been shown to be activated by Smad1-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] In a condition of culture containing 1% FBS, we detected endogenous Bmp-mediated Id1 reporter activation compared to a deletion construct lacking Smad binding sites. Addition of Noggin reduced the reporter activity to the similar level of mutant reporter, indicating that basal activity of the reporter is due to Bmp-like activity in the 1% FBS and Noggin effectively blocks extrinsic Bmp activity in this system. In addition, co-transfection of constitutively active BMP receptors (CA-Alk3), also induced Id1 reporter activation, that was not blocked by an intracellular antagonist Noggin. Addition of Bmp2 protein, in a dose-dependent manner, stimulated the reporter activity. We thus conclude that C3H10T1/2 cells respond to Bmp signaling. We next tested whether Noggin elicits the expression of the Fgf8 reporter construct in C3H10T1/2 cells. We hypothesized if Sp8 induction of Fgf8 is mediated by the inhibition of Bmp pathways, such as an induction of Noggin as shown by Fukuchi et al in vivo, we expect that Sp8-mediated Fgf8 reporter expression will be affected by the presence of Noggin or Bmp proteins. However, we did not observed a significant upregulation of Fgf8 reporter expression in the presence of Noggin, though it slightly upregulates it (see error bar). If this minor change by Noggin reflects synergistic action of the inhibition of Bmp signaling and Sp8-mediated Fgf8 regulation, we would see that oppose effect of Bmp2 to the addition of to Noggin, i.e., suppression of Sp8 induction of Fgf8 reporter expression by Bmp. However, again, we did not see any significant downregulation of reporter expression by Bmp2 presence. Thus we conclude that altered Bmp signaling in our in vitro reporter assay does not mediate Sp8-mediated Fgf8 upregulation. In support of our conclusion, it was previously shown that Fgf8 upregulation by Noggin is observed when Noggin is overexpressed at E9.5, but not later than this time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In contrast, we detect Fgf8 upregulation by Sp8 when Sp8 expression construct is introduced at E11.5, the time point that overexpression of Noggin no longer upregulate Fgf8 in forebrain. So we propose that the Bmp signaling restricts Fgf8 expression in early stages, but not in later stages when still Sp8 regulates Fgf8 expression. (A) C3H10T1/2 cells respond to Bmp signaling. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with reporter construct of Id1 promoter (Id1-Luc) or mutated construct lacked Smad binding sites that does not respond to either serum in culture medium or Bmp2 protein (100 ng/ml). Transfection of Alk3, constitutively active BMP receptors (CA-Alk3), induces Id1 reporter expression in a Smad-dependent manner. Addition of Noggin (100 ng/ml) inhibits endogenous Bmp signaling. Bmp2 can elicit Id1 reporter expression in a dose dependent manner and saturated at 10 ng/ml. (B) Sp8-mediated Fgf8 upregulation is independent from Bmp signaling. The expression of Fgf8 reporter construct mediated by Sp8, or endogenous factors, is not significantly affected in the presence or the absence of Noggin, or Bmp2 proteins.</p></caption><media xlink:href="1749-8104-2-10-S1.tiff" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for file</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S2"><caption><title>Additional File 2</title><p>Tangential sections of ROSA26 reporter mouse brains electroporated with a <italic>CAG-VP16 </italic>control expression vector (A, C) or a dominant active <italic>CAG-Sp8-VP16 </italic>expression vector (B, D) together with a <italic>CAG-Cre </italic>expression vector. Counterstaining of LacZ in sections indicates the position of the cells electroporated with a nuclear-localized-signal (nls)-Cre. Direct detection of GFP signal shows that approximately 80% of cases electroporated at E11.5 and analyzed at E13.5 have accurately positioned electroporations. However, because the eGFP reporter co-electroporated at E11.5 with the <italic>Sp8 </italic>constructs is not detectable at P7, to confirm these results, we repeated these studies using ROSA26 reporter mice by co-electroporating a CAG-Cre Recombinase construct with the <italic>Sp8-VP16 </italic>dominant active construct and the <italic>VP16 </italic>control construct.
