Several biochemical changes occur in response to BCR engagement, including activation of the Syk tyrosine kinase. Although Syk activation appears to be necessary for some downstream biochemical and cellular responses, the signaling events that precede Syk activation remain ill defined. In addition, the requirements for complete activation of the Syk-dependent signaling step remain to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A mutant form of Syk carrying a combination of a K395A substitution in the kinase domain and substitutions of three phenylalanines (3F) for the three C-terminal tyrosines was expressed in a murine B cell lymphoma cell line, BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 to interfere with normal Syk regulation as a means to examine the Syk activation step in BCR signaling. Introduction of this kinase-inactive mutant led to the constitutive activation of the endogenous wildtype Syk enzyme in the absence of receptor engagement through a 'dominant-positive' effect. Under these conditions, Syk kinase activation occurred in the absence of phosphorylation on Syk tyrosine residues. Although Syk appears to be required for BCR-induced apoptosis in several systems, no increase in spontaneous cell death was observed in these cells. Surprisingly, although the endogenous Syk kinase was enzymatically active, no enhancement in the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins, including phospholipase C&#x003b3;2 (PLC&#x003b3;2), a direct Syk target, was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data indicate that activation of Syk kinase enzymatic activity is insufficient for Syk-dependent signal transduction. This observation suggests that other events are required for efficient signaling. We speculate that localization of the active enzyme to a receptor complex specifically assembled for signal transduction may be the missing event.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is a multi-subunit complex that acts as a key sensor regulating the response of lymphocytes to their environment (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). In mature B cells, activation through the BCR stimulates cellular proliferation and differentiation. In immature B cells, activation through the BCR induces either a state of unresponsiveness, termed anergy, or death by apoptosis, depending on the physical nature and concentration of the antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In some B cell lymphomas, activation through the BCR can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis <italic>in vitro </italic>and tumor dormancy <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The core of the multi-subunit BCR is membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg), which is non-covalently associated with two co-receptor molecules, CD79a (Ig&#x003b1;) and CD79b (Ig&#x003b2;), products of the mb-1 and B29 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The biochemical changes induced by engagement of the BCR are extensive and include an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins, hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, fluxes in the concentration of intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, activation of several serine/threonine kinases including components of the MAP kinase pathway, and changes in the activities of a panel of transcription factors. Although much is known about the biochemical changes occurring in response to BCR-mediated activation, the differences in the signal transduction pathways that give rise to the different cellular responses following activation of the same receptor in immature versus mature cells have yet to be elucidated completely (discussed in detail in refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]).</p><p>Some of the earliest changes that occur following BCR engagement are the activation of several non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), including p55<sup><italic>blk </italic></sup>(Blk), p59<sup><italic>fyn </italic></sup>(Fyn) and p53/56<sup><italic>lyn </italic></sup>(Lyn) of the Src family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], Btk of the Itk/Tec family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and p72<sup><italic>Syk </italic></sup>(Syk) of the Syk/ZAP-70 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The importance of Syk in BCR signaling and lymphocyte development has been clearly demonstrated using gene inactivation approaches. Although <italic>syk</italic>-deficient mice die perinatally, analysis of radiation chimeras reconstituted with fetal liver from <italic>syk</italic>-deficient mice has demonstrated a block in the transition from proB cells to preB cells, indicating that signal transduction through Syk is required for early B cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Inactivation of the <italic>syk </italic>gene in the chicken DT40 B cell lymphoma leads to a loss in the activation of PLC&#x003b3;2, the increase in intracellular free Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and the apoptotic response following engagement of the BCR. In contrast, BCR-mediated activation of Lyn kinase was largely maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The Syk-dependent signaling pathway appears to be facilitated by the adaptor molecule BLNK (also known as SLP-65 and BASH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Syk can induce the phosphorylation of BLNK in co-transfection experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], which may be important for the recruitment of other Syk substrates like PLC&#x003b3;2 through a scaffolding function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. BLNK function is necessary for signal transduction since no Ca<sup>2+ </sup>flux or PLC&#x003b3;2 phosphorylation is observed in response to BCR engagement in BLNK-deficient DT40 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The formation of large protein complexes associated with the membrane receptor through specific protein-protein interactions appears to be an early step in BCR-mediated signal transduction. In response to receptor activation, Syk becomes non-covalently associated with the BCR through tandem SH2 domains located in the amino terminal half of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Following engagement of the BCR, phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) found within the cytoplasmic tails of CD79a and CD79b provides docking sites for Syk localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The ability of phosphorylated ITAM peptides to selectively enhance Syk kinase activity <italic>in vitro </italic>suggests that recruitment of Syk to the receptor complex may serve to activate the kinase, in part, through allosteric changes in the structure of the Syk protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Upon activation, Syk and the receptor complex become localized in detergent-resistant cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (lipid rafts), resulting in the segregation of the BCR complex from other membrane components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we describe the use of a mutant form of Syk that leads to the constitutive activation of the endogenous wildtype Syk kinase when introduced into B cells &#x02013; a dominant positive effect &#x02013; in the absence of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation. It was anticipated that the presence of a constitutively active Syk enzyme could help in delineating the signaling events that occur upstream and downstream of Syk activation in the BCR signal transduction pathway. However, although these cells carry a highly active Syk kinase, no evidence for downstream signaling was found. These data indicate that activation of Syk kinase enzymatic activity in cells is insufficient for signal transduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>BCR engagement induces apoptosis and Syk activation</title><p>Stimulation through the BCR has been shown to induce changes in cell growth and viability in several B cell systems, including the human Daudi, chicken DT40 and mouse WEHI-231 and BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 B cell lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. For example, stimulation of BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 through the BCR suppressed exponential population growth in cell culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Using flow cytometry to measure membrane permeability and DNA content of cells, BCR stimulation resulted in a 5-fold increase (6.5 to 32.6%) in the proportion of apoptotic cells after 24 hrs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>BCR engagement induces growth arrest associated with apoptosis in BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 </bold>(A) BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 cells were plated at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml for 24 hours and then incubated with 15 &#x003bc;g/ml of rabbit anti-IgM (anti-IgM &#x02013; closed circle) or control rabbit anti-ovalbumin (anti-ova &#x02013; open circle) antibody on day 0.

The autophosphorylation activity of Syk increased dramatically with the addition of anti-IgM; Syk activity responded in a dose dependent manner and reached a plateau at 10 &#x003bc;g (lane 4) in which activity was ~15 fold higher than in unstimulated cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Syk kinase activation and phosphorylation in response to BCR engagement </bold>(A) The immune complex kinase assay (ICKA) was used to determine Syk activity in BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 cells after incubation with rabbit anti-IgM antibody (0 &#x02013; 20 &#x003bc;g; lanes 1 &#x02013; 5) or control rabbit anti-ova antibody (20 &#x003bc;g; lane 6) for 0.5 minutes. Samples were lysed in an NP-40 lysis buffer, Syk was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Syk-coated protein A agarose beads, and incubated with &#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P ATP. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized using a phosphorimager.

After the cells were lysed, Syk was immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-PY antibody (top panel). The blot was stripped and reprobed with an anti-Syk antibody (bottom panel).

Maximal Syk activation occurred within 1 min of receptor engagement (lane 3) and decreased to intermediate levels at times thereafter (lanes 4 and 5). Additional experiments revealed that even 1 hour after BCR stimulation, Syk activity remained slightly elevated in comparison with unstimulated cells (data not shown).</p><p>The increase in Syk activity in response to BCR engagement in BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 was accompanied by an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk protein in cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). No phosphorylated tyrosine residues were detected on Syk in unstimulated or control treated cells (lanes 1,4, and 5). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk peaked after 30 seconds of BCR stimulation (lane 2) and decreased by 5 minutes (lane 3). The rapid induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and its subsequent reduction paralleled the kinetics of Syk kinase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of a (K395A/3F) mutant Syk results in a dominant positive effect</title><p>BCR-mediated apoptosis was preceded by an increase in Syk kinase activity in BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3. Syk has also been implicated in BCR-induced apoptosis found in the chicken B lymphoma line, DT40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To determine the role of Syk kinase activation in the apoptotic response in BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3, overexpression of a mutant form of Syk was used in an effort to alter the level of Syk activation following BCR engagement. Site-specific mutations were placed in two regions of Syk. A lysine at amino acid position 395, predicted to be critical for kinase activity, was replaced by an alanine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Three carboxy-terminal tyrosines (positions 624&#x02013;6), hypothesized to play regulatory roles, were replaced by phenylalanines. Based on the effects of similar mutations in other kinases it was expected that the combination of these replacements in (K395A/3F)Syk might produce a dominant negative effect.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of the (K395A/3F)Syk molecule is associated with constitutive Syk kinase activity </bold>(A) The amino acid changes introduced into wildtype Syk to create the (K395A/3F) Syk mutant include the substitution of lysine at amino acid 395 with alanine and the substitution of three tyrosines at amino acid positions 624&#x02013;6 in the carboxy-terminus with phenylalanines. (B) The strategy for simultaneously detecting both the (K395A/3F)Syk and endogenous Syk mRNA by RT-PCR involves the use of three primers. In this case, Primer 3 is complementary to sequences in both the transgene and endogenous <italic>syk </italic>gene cDNAs, while Primers 1 and 2 are specific for sequences in the transgene and endogenous <italic>syk </italic>gene cDNA, respectively. The PCR products produced with Primers 1 and 3 from the transgene cDNA template are larger than the PCR products produced with Primers 2 and 3 from the endogenous gene cDNA template. The size difference can be assessed following separation by agarose gel electrophoresis. (C) mRNA expression levels of the (K395A/3F)Syk transgene (T) and endogenous (E) Syk gene in BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 (lane 2), a clone infected with the empty retroviral vector (lane 3), and (K395A/3F)Syk mutant clones (lanes 4&#x02013;10) were determined using the RT-PCR strategy described above. All samples were prepared with (+R.T., upper panel) or without (-R.T., lower panel) reverse transcriptase to control for amplification of contaminating genomic DNA. (D) Syk activity was evaluated following immunoprecipitation with anti-Syk antibodies from unstimulated (-) or stimulated (+; 15 &#x003bc;g of anti-IgM for 30 seconds) BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 or (K395A/3F)Syk-containing clones (2.1.6, 2.4.2, 2.1.2, and 2.1.7) by the ICKA. Anti-ova was used as an immunoprecipitation control (C; lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15). (E) BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3, cells infected with the MSCV2.1 expression vector alone (vector control) and (K395A/3F)Syk-infected clones 2.1.2 and 2.1.6, were incubated with or without 15 &#x003bc;g of anti-IgM or anti-ova for the indicated times and Syk activity evaluated by the ICKA (lanes 1&#x02013;6). Anti-ova-coated beads were used as an immunoprecipitation control (C; lane 7). (F) Syk was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated (no antibody (-) or anti-ova (C)) or stimulated (+; 15 &#x003bc;g anti-IgM for 0.5 minutes) BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3, a vector control clone, and (K395A/3F)Syk clones 2.1.2 and 2.4.2. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and evaluated by anti-PY immunoblotting (upper panel). The blot was stripped and reprobed with an anti-Syk antibody (lower panel). Our data suggests that the binding activity of the antibody used for immunoprecipitation is partly influenced by the phosphorylation status of Syk; although phosphorylation is not required for antibody binding, the amount of Syk present in the immunoblot reflects the level of phosphorylation of the protein to some degree.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2172-3-16-3"/></fig><p>BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 cells were infected with defective retroviruses expressing wildtype or (K395A/3F) mutant Syk. Clones expressing varying levels of wildtype or mutant Syk mRNA were identified using a three-primer reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Using this approach, PCR products differing in size were simultaneously amplified from the transgene and the endogenous syk cDNAs in the same PCR reaction. (K395A/3F)Syk expression varied relative to endogenous Syk and ranged from undetectable levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>; lanes 8&#x02013;10) to equivalent expression levels (lane 4). The highest transgene expression was found in clone 2.1.2.</p><p>The ICKA was used to determine the effect of (K395A/3F)Syk expression on endogenous Syk. Syk activity was measured in parental BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3) and cells that express the (K395A/3F)Syk molecule (lanes 4 &#x02013; 15). Surprisingly, cells that expressed the (K395A/3F)Syk molecule displayed constitutive Syk activity in unstimulated cells (lanes 4,7, and 10). A correlation between constitutive kinase activity and mRNA expression levels of (K395A/3F)Syk was observed (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> with Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>); clones with higher levels of (K395A/3F)Syk mRNA (e.g. clone 2.1.2) had higher levels of constitutive kinase activity, while clones with lower levels of (K395A/3F) Syk mRNA (e.g. clones 2.1.6, 2.4.2 and 2.1.7) had lower levels of constitutive kinase activity. Thus, it appeared that introduction of this mutant form of Syk resulted in a dominant positive effect on kinase activity rather than a dominant negative effect.</p><p>To determine if the observed Syk activity is an artefact of the <italic>in vitro </italic>assay, a series of immune complex kinase assays of Syk precipitated from mixtures of lysates was performed. Most significantly, a mixture of a lysate from unstimulated BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 cells harbouring wildtype Syk with a lysate from unstimulated DT40 expressing the K395A, 3F mutant Syk (see below), at 1:5, 1:1 and 5:1 ratios, showed no activity in the immune complex kinase assay (data not shown). These data indicate that the mutant Syk protein must be expressed together with the wildtype enzyme in cells to generate the dominant positive phenotype, and suggest that it's effect is indirect. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the kinase activation is occurring during the isolation procedure, the results of the mixing experiment suggest that the wildtype Syk enzyme is active <italic>in vivo </italic>under these conditions.</p><p>To determine if expression of the (K395A/3F)Syk mutant resulted in a change in BCR responsiveness, the kinetics of Syk activation were measured in clones 2.1.2 and 2.1.6 following BCR stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Incubation with anti-IgM induced a rapid increase and delayed reduction in Syk activity with kinetics similar to that of control clones. Although the basal levels of Syk activity were elevated in clones that expressed the (K395A/3F)Syk molecule, the cells were still responsive to BCR signaling.</p><p>To determine if the constitutive Syk activity observed in unstimulated cells carrying the (K395A/3F) transgene was accompanied by constitutive Syk tyrosine phosphorylation, the levels of phosphotyrosine on Syk were determined by immunoblotting after immunoprecipitation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Syk from unstimulated BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 and vector control clones had undetectable levels of phospho-tyrosine (lanes 1,3,4, and 6, upper panel). Syk from unstimulated clones carrying the (K395A/3F) transgene, which had constitutive Syk activity, also had undetectable levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (lane 7, 9, 10 and 12, upper panel). Thus, despite constitutive Syk activity observed in these infectants, tyrosine phosphorylation did not correlate with activity (compare lanes 7 and 10 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> with lanes 10 and 7 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Syk from all clones analyzed became tyrosine phosphorylated after BCR stimulation (lanes 2, 5, 8 and 11). It was possible that more Syk in the immunoprecipitate was required for detection by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. However, even when more protein was present in the immunoprecipitate, little if any phosphotyrosine was detected in unstimulated cells (lanes 13 and 15). These results indicate that Syk activation does not require tyrosine phosphorylation.</p><p>Two hypotheses were considered to explain the high level of Syk autophosphorylation in the ICKA. In unstimulated clones expressing the (K395A/3F)Syk molecule, the possibility existed that the intense band observed in the ICKA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> lanes 4, 7, and 10) was not due to increased Syk activity, but rather to the ability of the background levels of active endogenous Syk to preferentially phosphorylate the (K395A/3F)Syk molecule due to possible changes in its three-dimensional structure.

To examine the ability of Syk from cells that expressed (K395A/3F)Syk to phosphorylate an exogenous Syk target, c3b-GST was added to the Syk ICKA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, lower panels).

However, the presence of Syk kinase activity was still expected to lead to increased phosphorylation of protein targets in the absence of stimulation through the BCR. To examine this possibility, the levels of protein phosphotyrosine were evaluated by immunoblotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Basal levels of phosphotyrosine-containing protein were detected in all clones analyzed (lanes 1,4,7, and 10). However, no increase was observed in cells with constitutive Syk activity. After stimulation of BCR, many intracellular proteins became highly phosphorylated on tyrosine to equivalent levels in all clones, regardless of the level of Syk kinase activity (lanes 2, 5, 8 and 11). These data indicate that despite elevated basal and induced Syk kinase activity in clones carrying the (K395A/3F)Syk mutant, global phosphorylation of cellular proteins was not increased.</p><p>The anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot used is a relatively crude measure of Syk kinase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. The possibility remained that any specific effects of constitutive Syk on its downstream targets might be masked by the combined effects of the other tyrosine kinases activated in response to BCR signaling. To focus the investigation on downstream events of Syk activation, the phosphorylation state of PLC&#x003b3;2, an authentic, direct downstream target of Syk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], was evaluated.

The studies presented here have demonstrated that stimulation of the BCR resulted in the rapid and transient activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Syk. Previous studies have implicated Syk in BCR-induced apoptosis in other cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To examine the putative role of Syk in BCR-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3, we attempted to alter Syk activity through the expression of mutant forms of Syk. When the (K395A/3F)Syk mutant was co-expressed with endogenous Syk in BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 cells, a constitutive Syk activation phenotype was observed. The presence of elevated Syk activity allowed us to evaluate the role of Syk activation on the growth and viability of BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3, and on other biochemical changes associated with BCR signaling. To our surprise, no evidence for downstream signaling was found in cells with high levels of Syk kinase activity.</p><p>Two novel observations were obtained from these studies. First, expression of the (K395A/3F)Syk molecule in BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 results in constitutive activation of endogenous Syk. Since (K395A/3F)Syk was enzymatically inactive when transfected into Syk-deficient DT40 cells, the observed constitutive kinase activity must be derived from endogenous Syk and not from the (K395A/3F)Syk protein. Mutant molecules that inhibit the activation or function of the wildtype counterpart in the same cell have been defined as dominant-negative molecules. Since (K395A/3F)Syk has an activating effect on endogenous wildtype Syk, we propose that (K395A/3F)Syk is a dominant-positive molecule.</p><p>It is likely that the replacement of the three carboxy-terminal tyrosine residues with phenylalanine is necessary for the dominant-positive phenotype. Zeitlmann et al. found that transfection of a mutant Syk expression construct carrying only the 3F alteration into a T cell lines could overcome the need for TCR occupancy for IL-2 expression in PMA-treated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. However, since the mutant Syk used retained kinase activity, these studies could not distinguish between a gain-of-function effect versus a dominant-positive effect as found here.</p><p>The mechanism by which the (K395A/3F)Syk molecule activates endogenous Syk is unknown. One hypothesis is that a negative regulator of Syk is bound and sequestered by the (K395A/3F)Syk molecule. By sequestering this negative regulator, expression of the mutant Syk molecules gives rise to the activation of the endogenous wildtype protein in the absence of specific stimulation, leading to a constitutively active Syk phenotype. Several negative regulators of Syk have been reported. BCR-induced interaction between Cbl and Syk increases the susceptibility of Syk to proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], possibly through enhancement of ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Expression of a dominant-negative SHP-1 phosphatase in the mature murine B cell line K46 resulted in an increase in BCR-induced Syk kinase activity as measured by C3b phosphorylation in an ICKA and enhanced BCR-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>fluxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. It remains to be determined if interference with any of these known regulatory proteins is responsible for the dominant-positive effect.</p><p>The second novel observation, that Syk kinase enzymatic activity was insufficient for signal transduction, suggests that multiple biochemical processes may be required for the Syk-dependent step of signal transduction. Presently, it is unclear what biochemical changes, other than enzymatic activation, are required. However, in light of the present model of signaling through the BCR, perhaps appropriate subcellular localization to the BCR protein complex and the ITAMs of CD79b (Ig&#x003b2;) is also required. In support of this hypothesis, Syk did not co-precipitate with IgM in (K395A/3F)Syk-containing cells, without stimulation (data not shown). This is not surprising since the ITAMs in CD79, which are proposed to be docking sites for Syk, are unlikely to be phosphorylated in the absence of BCR stimulation since phosphorylation of these residues likely requires activation of Src family tyrosine kinases expressed in B cells. Therefore, despite constitutive Syk kinase activity, the ITAMs in the dominant-positive-expressing cells remain hypophosphorylated because kinases that are upstream of Syk and/or are Syk independent are not active in the absence of BCR crosslinking.</p><p>This result implies that in addition to enzymatic activation, localization of Syk to the BCR might be required for functional signal transduction. There is precedence for this model. Mutation of tyrosine 130 in Syk to glutamic acid had two effects. First, the Y130E mutation resulted in constitutive activity of Syk. Second, molecules with the Y130E mutations did not co-immunoprecipitate with the BCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. A second example involves an <italic>in vitro </italic>model of histamine release in the Syk-deficient RBL-2H3 cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. When tyrosines 519 and 520 were mutated and introduced into Syk-deficient RBL-2H3 cells, these Syk molecules were capable of phosphorylation of c3b substrate in an ICKA. However, despite this activity, there was no high affinity IgE receptor (Fc&#x003b5;RI)-induced degranulation. Further analysis demonstrated neither increases in phosphotyrosine nor phosphorylation of PLC&#x003b3;2.</p><p>Alternatively, the absence of signal transduction in the presence of Syk activity may be related to its ability to interact with its downstream targets. Within Syk there are two phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 domains, allowing for protein-protein interactions. In addition, phosphotyrosine residues in Syk would provide additional sites for protein-protein interactions. Perhaps, further modification is necessary to increase its affinity for downstream binding partners, e.g. BLNK or PLC&#x003b3;2.</p><p>The absence of signaling in the presence of constitutive enzymatic activity described for Syk in different systems implies that execution of the Syk-dependent step in this signaling cascade is a multi-step process. Multiple requirements for progression through this step in the signal transduction pathway may serve to integrate the cellular response to multiple environmental cues. In this case, the ultimate cellular response to the activation of the BCR signaling pathway is cell death. Each of these required steps may provide a regulatory site where other signal transduction pathways could intersect the default response to antigenic stimulation giving rise to an altered cellular outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, here we describe the use of a mutant Syk construct to produce a dominant-positive effect on endogenous Syk activation in the absence of BCR engagement. The presence of a dominant-positive effect under these conditions suggests that the Syk kinase is kept inactive in resting cells by an active suppression mechanisms, which is disrupted by the presence of the (K395A/3F)Syk mutant. The specific target for this dominant-positive effect remains to be identified. Although the Syk enzyme is active under these conditions, it lacks any detectable phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. This observation indicates that the current paradigm that Syk activation results from tyrosine phosphorylation may be incorrect. Finally, the presence of a highly active Syk enzyme in cells was insufficient for downstream signal transduction as evidenced by a lack of change in global tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of PLC-&#x003b3;2 or enhanced spontaneous or induced apoptosis. These data suggest that the Syk-dependent step in signal transduction requires biochemical changes in addition to enzymatic activation, perhaps proper localization of the active enzyme to a signaling receptor complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic>-adapted BCL<sub>1</sub>.3B3 cell line was previously selected from the BCL<sub>1 </sub>mouse B cell lymphoma for growth in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].
