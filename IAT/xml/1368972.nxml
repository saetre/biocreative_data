Pim-3 was also able to phosphorylate other sites in Bad <italic>in vitro</italic>, including Ser170, another potential <italic>in vivo </italic>site. Mutation of Ser136 to alanine prevented the phosphorylation of Ser112 and Ser155 by Pim kinases in HEK-293 cells, suggesting that this site must be phosphorylated first in order to make the other sites accessible.

Pim-1 was first identified as an oncogenic gene in murine T-cell lymphomas, which became activated after pro-viral insertion in the 3'UTR of the Pim-1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Insertion in this region stabilised the mRNA for Pim-1 thus up-regulating the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Over-expression of the Pim-1 gene in B and T cells in transgenic mice resulted in a high level of lymphoma development in these mice, confirming the oncogenic properties of this protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A second related gene, Pim-2, was also identified as a common site of viral insertion in murine lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Like Pim-1 the over-expression of Pim-2 in transgenic mice predisposes the mice to the development of lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The precise mechanism by which Pim-1 and 2 promote the formation of lymphomas is not fully understood, however it has been suggested that Pim-1 synergises with c-myc in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Pim-1 also appears to be important in the development of human cancers, as the Pim-1 gene maps to an area showing karyotypic abnormalities in leukaemia, and the mRNA for Pim-1 has been shown to be up-regulated in prostate cancer and leukaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A third isoform, Pim-3, which is 72% identical to Pim-1 also exists in mammalian cells although the oncogenic properties of this protein are less well studied. Pim-3 has recently been shown to be up-regulated in Ewing's tumour cell lines, is a transcriptional target for the oncogenic EWS transcription factors and is able to promote anchorage-independent cell growth in tissue culture models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Recently, over-expression of Pim-3 has been demonstrated in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma, although the functional role of Pim-3 was not determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Several substrates have been suggested for Pim-1 including mdm2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], cdc25 phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and c-myb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], all proteins involved in control of the cell cycle. Pim-2 has been reported to maintain phosphorylation of the translational repressor 4EBP-1 and to phosphorylate and inactivate the pro-apoptotic protein Bad on Ser112 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Pim-1 has also been reported to be able to phosphorylate Bad on Ser112 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], however the ability of Pim-3 to phosphorylate Bad is unknown. Both Pim-1 and Pim-2 therefore appear to act as survival or proliferation signals <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with this Pim-1 expression has been shown to promote cytokine independent growth of haematopoetic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In contrast, less is known about the substrates of Pim-3, and its function <italic>in vivo </italic>is still largely unclear.</p><p>Bad is a pro-apoptotic member of the BH3 family of proteins. Active Bad induces apoptosis by binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>. This allows other pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK to aggregate, inducing cytochrome C release from the mitochondria and caspase activation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). The activity of Bad is repressed by phosphorylation, and three residues (Ser112, Ser136 and Ser155) have been identified as the predominant <italic>in vivo </italic>phosphorylation sites. In addition to Pim-2 several kinases have been identified as potential kinases for Bad, including PKB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], RSK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], PAK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], p70S6K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It seems likely that multiple kinases may phosphorylate Bad on these sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, depending on the cell type and situation. Consistent with this, several of the proposed kinases preferentially phosphorylate one or two of the three sites in Bad. For instance, <italic>in vitro </italic>RSK phosphorylates Ser112 and to a lesser extent Ser155, while PKB phosphorylates Ser136 and PKA preferentially phosphorylates Ser155 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition to these phosphorylation sites, an unidentified kinase has been shown to inhibit apoptosis by phosphorylating Bad on Ser170 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Conversely, phosphorylation by Cdc2 of Ser128 in Bad was found to promote the apoptotic activity of Bad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>In this paper we examine the specificity of Pim-1, 2 and 3 for the Ser112, 136 and 155 phosphorylation sites in Bad, both <italic>in vitro </italic>and in HEK-293 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Pim kinases phosphorylate Bad on three sites <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Bad has been described previously to be phosphorylated on three sites, Ser112, Ser136 and Ser155 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Peptides from around these sites were used as substrates for purified Pim-1, 2 or 3 in <italic>in vitro </italic>kinase assays. All three Pim kinases were found to phosphorylate the Ser112 peptide efficiently (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). In contrast the Ser136 and Ser155 peptides were much less effective substrates for Pim-1 and Pim-3 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and very poor substrates for Pim-2 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As phosphorylation of synthetic peptides does not always give a true reflection of a kinases ability to phosphorylate the corresponding site in a protein, the ability of Pim kinases to phosphorylate recombinant Bad protein was also examined. As expected Bad was phosphorylated by all three Pim kinases, with maximum phosphorylation occurring in the first 5 to 10 min (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D&#x02013;F</xref>). This activity was due to the Pim kinase, as incubation of the Bad protein in the absence of Pim (Fig D-F), or with kinase dead Pim (data not shown), did not result in any incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P into Bad. To determine the sites phosphorylated by Pim-1, 2 or 3, recombinant Bad was phosphorylated with <sup>32</sup>P labelled ATP and digested with trypsin. Peptides were then resolved by reverse phase HPLC and ms/ms used to identify the phospho peptides eluted (data not shown). The position of the phosphate in each peptide was also confirmed by solid phase sequencing reactions and measuring the cycle at which radioactivity was released. Pim-1 phosphorylated 4 major peptides in Bad, designated P1, P2 P3 and P4 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Peak P1 was found to correspond to phospho Ser155, P2 to Ser136 while both P3 and P4 corresponded to phospho Ser112 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The different elution times of the Ser112 peptides is probably explained by different oxidation states of the methionine residue in the peptide. Analysis of the cpm in each peak showed that Ser112 was the site most highly phosphorylated by Pim-1, with approximately 7 times the level of phosphorylation than occurred at either Ser136 or Ser155. This was consistent with what was found for the rate of phosphorylation of the synthetic peptides for each site (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Pim-2 was found to phosphorylate two major peaks that eluted at an identical position to the P3 and P4 peaks in the Pim-1 phosphorylated Bad (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Ms/ms analysis confirmed that these peptides also corresponded to Bad phosphorylated on Ser112. Small peaks were also seen corresponding to P1 and P2 in the Pim-2 phosphorylated Bad HPLC trace, and these were confirmed to correspond to phospho Ser155 and Ser136. The amount of phosphate incorporated at these sites was 15 times less than that at Ser112 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phosphorylation of peptides derived from Bad and recombinant Bad protein by Pim kinases</bold>.

Of the three kinases Pim-3 gave the highest phosphorylation of Ser136 and Ser155 compared to Ser112 in Bad (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Five further smaller phospho peptide peaks (P5-9) were also observed in the HPLC when Pim-3 was used to phosphorylate Bad. These sites were not however significantly phosphorylated by Pim-1 or Pim-2. P5 was observed in the flow through of the column and peptides in this fraction were not identified by mass spectrometry. Prediction from the Bad sequence shows that tryptic digest would give 2 small peptides that contain serine or threonine that could have been phosphorylated. Phosphopeptides from P9 were also not successfully identified by mass spectrometry. P7 was identified as the peptide AATNSHHGGAGAMETR (residues 92 to 107 of Bad) with 1 phospho group. Ms/ms analysis suggested that this was a mixture of phosphorylation on either Thr94 or Ser96. Solid phase sequencing confirmed this result, and also suggested that Ser96 was the predominant site (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). P6 and P8 were identified by mass spectrometry as SAGTATQMR (residues 170 to 178 in Bad) phosphorylated at Ser170. The phosphorylation of Ser170 was confirmed by solid phase sequencing for both P6 and P8. Surprisingly, solid phase sequencing also showed that in P8 the 4<sup>th </sup>residue in the peptide was also phosphorylated, suggesting that Thr 173 may also be phosphorylated by Pim-3.</p></sec><sec><title>Pim kinases are constitutively active in HEK-293 cells and phosphorylate Bad on Ser112, 136 and 155</title><p>To examine the regulation of Pim-1, 2 and 3 in cells, FLAG tagged Pim kinases were expressed in HEK-293 cells by transient transfection.

Consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], stimulation of the cells with PMA resulted in a modest increase in Ser112 phosphorylation whilst forskolin resulted in increases in Ser155 phosphorylation and, to a lesser extent, Ser136 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Co-expression of Pim-1 and Bad resulted in increased phosphorylation of Ser136 and phosphorylation of Ser112 and Ser155, when compared to Bad expressed in the absence of Pim-1. Similar results were also obtained for co-expression of Pim-2 or Pim-3, although Pim-2 had a reduced effect on Ser136 phosphorylation in Bad compared to co-expression with Pim-1 and Pim-3 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The phosphorylation of Bad by Pim kinases was not further increased by PMA stimulation, although Ser155 phosphorylation was further increased by Forskolin stimulation. The phosphorylation of Bad was dependent on the kinase activity of Pim kinases, as co-expression of kinase dead versions of Pim-1, 2 or 3 and Bad did not result in the phosphorylation of Bad (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>The ability of Pim-1 to phosphorylate Bad in which one of the phosphorylation sites had been mutated was also determined by co-expression. As expected the mutation of Ser112 to alanine prevented phosphorylation of this site by Pim-1, but did not significantly affect the phosphorylation of either Ser136 or Ser155 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Similarly, mutation of Ser155 prevented phosphorylation of this site by Pim-1 but did not significantly affect phosphorylation of Ser112. Surprisingly mutation of Ser155 to alanine did cause a reduction in the level of Ser136 phosphorylation by Pim-1 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and a similar reduction in Ser136 phosphorylation was also seen in Ser112/Ser155Ala mutants (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Mutation of Ser136 to alanine not only blocked phosphorylation of Ser136 by Pim-1, but also greatly reduced Ser112 and Ser155 phosphorylation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

To test the ability of Bad to interact with 14-3-3, GST-Bad was co-expressed in HEK-293 cells with Pim-1, and 14-3-3 overlay assays were used to determine if Bad could bind 14-3-3 proteins. In the overlay assay, recombinant 14-3-3 protein was used to detect the presence of proteins on a Western blot capable of binding 14-3-3. GST-Bad isolated by glutathione-Sepharose pull downs from the cell lysates was tested for its ability to bind to 14-3-3. In the absence of Pim-1 co-expression, GST-Bad was not significantly phosphorylated on Ser112, 136 or 155 and did not bind 14-3-3 in the overlay assay (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Co-expression of Pim-1 however resulted in phosphorylation of all three sites and promoted interaction of the GST-Bad with 14-3-3 in the overlay assay. Mutation of either Ser112 or Ser155 to alanine resulted in a modest reduction in the ability of the Pim-1 phosphorylated GST-Bad to interact with 14-3-3 proteins in the overlay assay (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). As expected, mutation of Ser136 to alanine, which also blocks the phosphorylation of Ser112 and Ser155, completely blocked the ability of GST-Bad to interact with 14-3-3 proteins. Mutation of Ser136 to an acidic residue also blocked the ability of Bad to bind to 14-3-3 proteins in the overlay assay, even though Pim-1 was able to phosphorylate both Ser112 and Ser155 in the Ser136Asp or Ser136Glu Bad mutants (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). These data suggest that Ser136 is the major 14-3-3 binding site. Consistent with this, a double mutant of both Ser112 and Ser155 to alanine, which was phosphorylated on Ser136 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), was still able to interact with 14-3-3 proteins in the overlay assay (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Similar to Pim-1, when Pim-2 or Pim-3 were co-expressed with GST-Bad, they were also able to promote 14-3-3 binding in the overlay assay (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). To test if Pim kinases promoted the interaction of Bad and 14-3-3 proteins in cells, Pim kinases and GST-Bad were co-expressed in HEK-293 cells and the GST-Bad isolated by glutathione-Sepharose pull downs and blotted for the presence of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins using a pan 14-3-3 isoform antibody (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). In the absence of Pim kinase co-expression, 14-3-3 proteins were not detected in the GST-Bad pull downs, however expression of Pim-1, 2 or 3 was found to promote the binding of 14-3-3 to GST-Bad in cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). The ability of Pim kinases to promote the interaction of Bad and 14-3-3 was dependent on their kinase activity, as co-expression of kinase dead Pim-1, 2 or 3 did not promote 14-3-3 binding as judged by either co-precipitation or 14-3-3 overlay assays (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>).</p><p>Phosphorylation of Bad has been shown to prevent an interaction with Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

Pim-2 was found to be the most specific of the Pim kinases for Ser112 of Bad <italic>in vitro</italic>, although it was also able to phosphorylate Ser155 both <italic>in vitro </italic>and when over-expressed in HEK-293 cells. Pim-2 was a poor Ser136 kinase <italic>in vitro </italic>and, consistent with this, was the least effective of all the Pim kinases at phosphorylating this site in cells. In agreement with this Pim-2 has previously been described to phosphorylate Ser112 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Ser136 and Ser155 by over-expression of Pim-2 has been suggested to be dependent on the cell line used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Both previous results and our results suggest this may reflect different over-expression levels of Pim-2 achieved in the different cell types used. Pim-1 was able to phosphorylate Ser112, Ser136 and Ser155 in Bad, however phosphorylation of Ser112 was significantly more efficient than phosphorylation of the other sites <italic>in vitro</italic>. Pim-1 has previously been found to phosphorylate Ser112 in Bad, although its ability to phosphorylate Bad on other sites has not previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The ability of Pim-3 to phosphorylate Bad has not previously been addressed. Here we report that Pim-3 is also able to phosphorylate Ser112 in Bad. Interestingly Pim-3 was the most effective kinase <italic>in vitro </italic>for Ser136 of Bad. Unlike Pim-1 or Pim-2, which demonstrated a marked preference for Ser112, Pim-3 was also effective at phosphorylating Ser136, and to a lesser extent Ser155, when Bad protein was used as an <italic>in vitro </italic>substrate (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In addition Pim-3 was also able to phosphorylate other sites in Bad including Ser170 <italic>in vitro</italic>. This site has been reported to be phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the kinase responsible was not identified in the initial study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Mutagenesis of Ser170 in Bad has suggested that phosphorylation of this site, like phosphorylation of Ser112, 136 and 155, inhibits the pro-apoptotic activity of Bad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Phosphorylation of this site by Pim-3 would therefore be consistent with the pro-survival function of Pim-3. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report a Pim-3 cellular substrate.</p><p>The interaction between the phosphorylation sites in Bad and their roles in Bad function is complex. Phosphorylation of Ser136 appears to be required for the phosphorylation of Ser112 and Ser155 to occur when Bad is over-expressed in cells. Similarly, Ser136 appears to be the major 14-3-3 binding site in Bad (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], while Ser155 is suggested to be required for binding to Bcl-X<sub>L </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Despite this, phosphorylation of endogenous Bad on Ser136 has proven hard to demonstrate <italic>in vivo</italic>. This may reflect the poor sensitivity of the antibodies available, however it has also been suggested that this site may not be physiologically important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In contrast to this, studies using transfected Bad have suggested that phosphorylation of this site is essential for the phosphorylation of Ser112 and Ser155 and 14-3-3 binding, which are required to inhibit the apoptotic activity of Bad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Studies on Ser112 have suggested that this site may be a 'gatekeeper' site, and that dephosphorylation of this site is required to recruit a phosphatase that then dephosphorylates Ser136 and Ser155 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. An extension of this idea lead to the proposal that Pim-1 only directly phosphorylates Ser112, and that an increase in Ser136 phosphorylation when Pim-1 was over-expressed was due to a decrease in the rate of Ser136 dephosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Whilst this cannot be completely excluded, it is not consistent with our data that Pim-1 can promote the phosphorylation of a Ser112Ala Bad mutant in cells. The interplay between the different Bad phosphorylation sites is thus very complex and further work is required to completely understand these mechanisms. An added degree of complexity is the number of physiological kinases for Bad, including Pim-1-3, PKB, PAK, RSK, PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and possibly other kinases potentially playing a role. The exact context in which Pim phosphorylates Bad <italic>in vivo </italic>may therefore depend on both cell type and stimulus and remains to be fully understood.</p><p>The ability of Pim kinases to phosphorylate Bad is consistent with the suggested role of these kinases in pro survival or proliferation pathways. The finding that all three Pim kinases can phosphorylate similar sites in Bad could in part explain the redundancy between Pim kinases in providing a cellular survival signal. The knockout of Pim kinase might therefore be expected to have a severe phenotype, however a triple knockout of Pim-1, 2 and 3 has recently been reported. Surprisingly these mice were found to be viable, and while they were smaller in size than wild type mice they displayed no obvious health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. These mice did however show reduced proliferation of some haematopoietic cells in response to growth factors. Interestingly, a triple knockin mutation of Bad (resulting in the mutation of Ser112, 136 and 155 to alanine) in mice was also found to be viable and did not show increased levels of apoptosis in tissues under normal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. These mice also displayed reduced numbers of T and B cells and reduced cytokine induced survival of these cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, a phenotype with some similarity to that of the triple Pim kinase knockout.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present here biochemical evidence that all three isoforms of Pim kinase are able to phosphorylate Bad. The major site of Bad phosphorylation for all three isoforms of Pim kinase is Ser112. However, we also demonstrate that Pim kinases are able to phosphorylate Bad to a lesser extent on Ser136 and Ser155 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly Pim-3 exhibits less specificity for Ser112 than Pim-1 or Pim-2, and was the most effective pim isoform for Ser136 and Ser155 phosphorylation in Bad <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also provide evidence that Pim kinases may modulate the phosphorylation of Bad on Ser112, Ser136 and Ser155 in HEK-293 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The coding region for an amino-terminal extended version of human Pim-1 (NCBI Acc.

Murine Pim-3 was cloned with an N-terminal His-tag and expressed in a Baculovirus expression system using <italic>Sf</italic>9 insect cells. Murine Bad was cloned with an N-terminal GST-tag and expressed in bacteria. All recombinant proteins were purified using standard affinity chromatography techniques on glutathione or Ni-NTA sepharose as appropiate. Purified recombinant Pim-kinases (10 mU) were incubated with 2 &#x003bc;g of recombinant Bad over the indicated time period in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 &#x003bc;M PKI, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.1 mM [&#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer and samples analysed on a 4&#x02013;12% Novex gel (Invitrogen).

For phospho site mapping, the protein was reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were applied to a Vydac 218TP5215 C18 column equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and the column developed with a linear gradient of acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min while collecting 0.1 ml fractions. <sup>32</sup>P radioactivity was recorded with an on-line monitor. Phosphorylation site mapping was performed essentially as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Identification of <sup>32</sup>P labelled peptides was performed by MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry on an Applied Biosystems 4700 using a matrix of 10 mg/ml alpha-cyanocinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/10 mM ammonium phosphate. Sites of phosphorylation within the peptides were determined by a combination of MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry and solid phase Edman sequencing. Solid phase sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Procise 494C after coupling the peptide covalently to a Sequelon-arylamine membrane and measuring by Cerenkov counting the <sup>32</sup>P radioactivity released after each cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>GST-Bad pull down</title><p>Lysates were incubated with glutathione-sepharose for 2 hours at 4&#x000b0;C.

Briefly, proteins from cell extracts or GST pull downs were separated on 4&#x02013;12% Novex gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were then treated as for immunoblots. Digoxygenin (DIG)-labelled 14-3-3 proteins were incubated with the membranes in place of the primary antibody, followed by incubation with a secondary anti-DIG horseradish peroxidase antibody.
