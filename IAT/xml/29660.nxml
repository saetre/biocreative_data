DNMT2 contains all 10 sequence motifs that are conserved among m<sup>5</sup>C MTases, including the consensus <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine-binding motifs and the active site ProCys dipeptide. DNMT2 has close homologs in plants, insects and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, but no related sequence can be found in the genomes of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> or <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The crystal structure of a deletion mutant of DNMT2 complexed with <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-homocysteine (AdoHcy) has been determined at 1.8 &#x000c5; resolution. The structure of the large domain that contains the sequence motifs involved in catalysis is remarkably similar to that of M.<italic>Hha</italic>I, a confirmed bacterial m<sup>5</sup>C MTase, and the smaller target recognition domains of DNMT2 and M.<italic>Hha</italic>I are also closely related in overall structure. The small domain of DNMT2 contains three short helices that are not present in M.<italic>Hha</italic>I. DNMT2 binds AdoHcy in the same conformation as confirmed m<sup>5</sup>C MTases and, while DNMT2 shares all sequence and structural features with m<sup>5</sup>C MTases, it has failed to demonstrate detectable transmethylase activity. We show here that homologs of DNMT2, which are present in some organisms that are not known to methylate their genomes, contain a specific target-recognizing sequence motif including an invariant CysPheThr tripeptide. DNMT2 binds DNA to form a denaturant-resistant complex <italic>in vitro</italic>. While the biological function of DNMT2 is not yet known, the strong binding to DNA suggests that DNMT2 may mark specific sequences in the genome by binding to DNA through the specific target-recognizing motif.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x8d1e0a0.0x9520ba8" notes-type="data_link"><p>PDB no. 1G55</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Until recently Dnmt1 was the only known mammalian DNA cytosine methyltransferase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c1">1</xref>). However, it had long been speculated that <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferases (MTases) distinct from Dnmt1 would be found to act during gametogenesis and the early stages of development. Unequivocal evidence for additional DNA MTases came from the demonstration that Dnmt1 null embryonic stem cells are capable of methylating newly integrated proviral DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c2">2</xref>). Within the last two years, three DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (m<sup>5</sup>C MTase) homologs (Dnmt2, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) have been identified from databases of expressed sequence tags based on their content of diagnostic m<sup>5</sup>C MTase motifs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c1">1</xref>). The DNMT1, 2 and 3 families are distantly related to each other and probably diverged early in eukaryotic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c1">1</xref>). Dnmt3a and 3b have been shown to have enzymatic activity and are encoded by essential genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c3">3</xref>); inactivation of the catalytic domain of DNMT3B in patients with ICF (<underline>i</underline>mmunodeficiency, <underline>c</underline>entromere instability and <underline>f</underline>acial anomalies) syndrome causes demethylation limited almost exclusively to the inactive X chromosome and classical satellite DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c4">4</xref>). However, no transmethylase activity has been demonstrated for Dnmt2 and embryonic stem cells which lack Dnmt2 appear to have normal <italic>de novo</italic> and maintenance MTase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c5">5</xref>).</p><p> Dnmt2 is a relatively small protein of 391 amino acids and lacks the large N-terminal domains present in the Dnmt1 and Dnmt3 families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c6">6</xref>). The gene appears to be well conserved among eukaryotes, not only in organisms whose genomes are methylated (mammals, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and <italic>Danio rerio</italic>), but also in organisms lacking detectable cytosine methylation, such as <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Dnmt2 is ubiquitously expressed with multiple mRNA species in most human and mouse adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c6">6</xref>). Patterns of Dnmt2 expression in human and mouse tissues are very similar to those of Dnmt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c6">6</xref>). The expression of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> Dnmt2 has been reported to be developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c7">7</xref>), although a different pattern of expression in this species has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c8">8</xref>).</p><p> We present the X-ray crystal structure of human DNMT2 complexed with <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and report the unusual DNA-binding properties of DNMT2. Although no transmethylase activity has been detected in Dnmt2, our results reveal a two-domain structure of DNMT2 that closely resembles M.<italic>Hha</italic>I, a prokaryotic m<sup>5</sup>C MTase. Sequences involved in AdoHcy binding (catalytic domain) and putative DNA recognition (target-recognizing domain, TRD) are structured in the same geometry as M.<italic>Hha</italic>I. Unlike other m<sup>5</sup>C MTases, DNMT2 was found to be capable of binding DNA in a denaturant-resistant and probably covalent complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Overexpression and purification</title><p>The full-length open reading frame from the human DNMT2 cDNA was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE9 (Qiagen) and DNMT2 protein was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (McrBC-deficient strain ER2488) with a six-histidine tag at the N-terminus. Soluble recombinant proteins were purified from the supernatants on a nickel chelate column (Qiagen), followed by Mono-Q column chromatography.</p></sec><sec><title>Limited proteolysis of DNMT2 protein</title><p>Protease V8 (100, 10 or 1 ng) was added to 1 &#x000b5;l of 15 mg&#x0002f;ml DNMT2 for 15 min on ice in a 10 &#x000b5;l reaction of 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1&#x00025; &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was stopped with SDS sample buffer and the products were separated on a 13&#x00025; SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel. One large fragment and two closely migrating smaller fragments were observed. Denaturing the cut protein with 4 M urea and passing through a Ni&#x02013;agarose column demonstrated that only the large fragment contained the His tag and therefore represented the N-terminal cleavage product. The masses of all three fragments were determined with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. The N-terminal sequence of the smallest fragment was determined using an Applied Biosystems 491A Pulsed-Liquid Sequencer on-line with an Applied Biosystems 140S PTH Analyzer (Procise-HT). Combining these results and the specificity of V8 protease allowed us to deduce that the large fragment represents residues 1&#x02013;190 and the two smaller fragments represent residues 234&#x02013;391 and 238&#x02013;391. The N- and C-terminal fragments remained tightly associated after proteolysis and could be co-purified by chromatography and crystallized.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction and purification of DNMT2&#x00394;47</title><p>DNMT2&#x00394;47 was generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis that removed the sequences encoding residues 191&#x02013;237 and was expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> as a glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) fusion. A thrombin cleavage site was introduced between the DNMT2&#x00394;47 and GST moieties. The fusion protein, GST&#x02013;DNMT2&#x00394;47, was purified on a glutathione&#x02013;agarose column (Pharmacia) and DNMT2&#x00394;47 was cleaved from the GST moiety by on-column thrombin digestion, resulting in the final DNMT2&#x00394;47 protein, which contains three additional N-terminal amino acids (GlySerArg). The DNMT2&#x00394;47 protein was separated from thrombin by Mono-Q column chromatography. Binary complexes of DNMT2&#x00394;47 and AdoHcy were formed by incubation of DNMT2&#x00394;47 (in 20&#x000a0;mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1&#x00025; &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol) and AdoHcy (in water) at a protein:AdoHcy molar ratio of 1:1.5, either before or after protein concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Crystallization and X-ray data collection</title><p>Crystals were obtained in hanging drops containing &#x0223c;20 mg&#x0002f;ml DNMT2&#x00394;47&#x02013;AdoHcy complex in 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 1&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 0.1&#x00025; 2-mercaptoethanol and 150 mM NaCl, with concentration by vapor diffusion against 1.3&#x02013;1.4 M ammonium sulfate, 8&#x00025; glycerol, 100 mM glycine&#x02013;NaOH pH&#x000a0;9.0, at 16&#x000b0;C. Glycerol and 2-mercaptoethanol were found to be essential for successful crystallization. One molecule of glycerol bound in a surface cavity on the small domain by making six hydrogen bonds (three proton acceptors and three proton donors) to the main chain nitrogen and oxygen atoms. One molecule of 2-mercaptoethanol was found to react with the sulfur atom of Cys24 and to occupy a surface cavity of the crystallographically related neighboring protein molecule.</p><p> Crystals were of space group I4<sub>1</sub>, determined based on the systematic absence of reflections along the <italic>z</italic>-axis, with unit cell dimensions <italic>a</italic> &#x0003d; <italic>b</italic> &#x0003d; 116.5 &#x000c5; and <italic>c</italic> &#x0003d; 69.8 &#x000c5;.

Three xenon molecules locate in the large domain, in the hydrophobic interfaces between the &#x003b2; sheet and the helices on each side.</p><p> In addition, a lead derivative was obtained by soaking a crystal in 10 mM trimethyllead acetate for 6 days. The lead atom did not directly interact with the protein side chains, but instead interacted with a SO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x02013;2</sup> molecule (from the crystallization procedure) which was held in position by the side chains of Arg108, His101 and the symmetry-related Lys334.</p></sec><sec><title>Crystal twinning</title><p>Several lines of evidence indicated possible twinning in the I4<sub>1</sub> crystal.

The detwinned data contain one DNMT2&#x00394;47&#x02013;AdoHcy complex per asymmetric unit.

DNMT2 homologs are highly conserved in those eukaryotes in which they occur, but no related sequences could be found in the genomes of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> or <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The m<sup>5</sup>C MTases (EC 2.1.1.73 for bacterial enzymes and EC 2.1.1.37 for animal and plant versions) share six strongly conserved and four weakly conserved sequence motifs that are diagnostic of this class of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c19">19</xref>). All members of the DNMT2 family contain all 10 MTase motifs in the typical order, with motif I occurring within a few amino acids of the N-terminus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f1">1</xref>). In addition to the 10 motifs, all DNMT2 homologs share a distinctive conserved stretch of 41 amino acids (266&#x02013;306 of DNMT2), including an invariant CysPheThr tripeptide and an AspIle dipeptide between motifs VIII and IX, in a region corresponding to the TRD of the bacterial MTases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c18">18</xref>). The characteristic CysPheThr tripeptide conserved in the DNMT2 family was not found in other eukaryotic enzymes (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, masc1 and masc2) or in approximately 90 bacterial MTases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c20">20</xref>). This high degree of internal conservation in the region surrounding the CysPheThr motif suggests that DNMT2 homologs are members of a subfamily of m<sup>5</sup>C MTases that may recognize a specific kind of target through the specific TRD, although the nature of the target is not yet known.</p></sec><sec><title>Structure determination</title><p>Structure determination involved production of a recombinant deleted form (DNMT2&#x00394;47) in which residue 190 was fused to residue 238 (see Materials and Methods).

DNMT2&#x00394;47 was found to bind DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays as efficiently as the wild-type protein (data not shown).

As in M.<italic>Hha</italic>I, the DNMT2 structure can be divided into three parts: the large domain (strands &#x003b2;1&#x02013;&#x003b2;8 and helices &#x003b1;A&#x02013;&#x003b1;E and &#x003b1;X), the small domain (strands &#x003b2;9&#x02013;&#x003b2;12 and helices &#x003b1;F&#x02013;&#x003b1;J) and the two parallel helices (&#x003b1;K and &#x003b1;L) hinge region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f2">2</xref>D). With respect to the primary sequence, the small domain and the hinge consists of contiguous sequences, whereas the large domain is composed of elements from the N-terminal region and C-terminal helix &#x003b1;X.</p><p> The large domain is composed of an eight-stranded &#x003b2; sheet with three helices (&#x003b1;A, &#x003b1;B and &#x003b1;X) on one side and four helices (&#x003b1;C, &#x003b1;C&#x02032;, &#x003b1;D and &#x003b1;E) on the opposite side. Strands &#x003b2;1&#x02013;&#x003b2;7 adopt a well-characterized AdoMet-dependent MTase fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c21">21</xref>). M.<italic>Hha</italic>I does not have an equivalent of the short strand &#x003b2;8 in DNMT2. The large domain contains nine of 10&#x000a0;conserved motifs, including the proposed active site nucleophile (Cys79, which reacted with a mercury atom in one of the crystals) and other catalytic residues, as well as the cofactor-binding pocket. The loop containing Cys79 between strand &#x003b2;4 and helix &#x003b1;D is in an open conformation in the absence of DNA substrate (indicated by the red loop in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f2">2</xref>A and B). The structure presented here has AdoHcy bound in a way that is identical to the primed catalytically competent conformation observed in M.<italic>Hha</italic>I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c22">22</xref>).</p><p> The small domain has a short four-stranded antiparallel propeller (&#x003b2;9&#x02013;&#x003b2;12) and five surrounding helices (&#x003b1;F&#x02013;&#x003b1;J). M.<italic>Hha</italic>I structure has a similar propeller, but does not have the equivalent of the three helices &#x003b1;H, &#x003b1;I and &#x003b1;J (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f2">2</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>Deleted segment</title><p>The dashed line in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f2">2</xref>A identifies the non-conserved segment (residues 189&#x02013;247) of the protein, part of which (&#x00394;47) was deleted to allow crystallization. This segment is clearly present in mammalian and <italic>X.laevis</italic> Dnmt2, but absent in the DNMT2 homologs of <italic>S.pombe</italic>, <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and <italic>B.mori</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f1">1</xref>). In <italic>A.thaliana</italic> and <italic>D.rerio</italic> sequences of similar length are present but share little or no sequence similarity with the mammalian and <italic>X.laevis</italic> sequences.</p><p> The segment that had to be deleted to allow crystallization is inserted into the connecting loop between the two structured domains and could fold into an independent domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f2">2</xref>A). BLAST searches did not reveal any significant homology between this domain and any known protein. This 58 residue segment (7 kDa) was expressed, purified and eluted as a 24&#x000a0;kDa globular protein on a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia). Reconstitution of DNMT2&#x00394;47 and this segment did not form a complex that survived chromatography, which indicated that residues 189&#x02013;247 represent an independent protein domain that does not interact strongly with the remainder of the protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conserved motifs</title><p>Inspection of the DNMT2&#x00394;47&#x02013;AdoHcy structure showed that DNMT2 contains perfect matches to all 10 consensus motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f1">1</xref>), with three exceptions. First, <italic>S.pombe</italic> pmt1p contains the sequence ProSerCys instead of ProProCys in motif IV, the proposed active site. Deleting the serine to partially restore the consensus ProCys sequence was reported to create an active enzyme that methylates dcm (CCWGG) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c23">23</xref>), which are normally methylated in <italic>E.coli</italic>. This was not true of DNMT2, which normally bears the canonical ProProCys motif but does not display this activity. Second, motif I (with the consensus Phe-X-Gly-X-Gly) of DNMT2 contains a tyrosine in place of the canonical phenylalanine, except for the <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> homolog. The Tyr10 phenol ring forms an edge-to-face van der Waals contact with the adenine moiety of AdoHcy (as does the Phe benzene ring observed in M.<italic>Hha</italic>I) and its hydroxyl group forms two hydrogen bonds with the Ser98 hydroxyl oxygen atom and the main chain nitrogen atom of Phe99 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f3">3</xref>A). Ser98 and Phe99 are located at the N-terminus of helix &#x003b1;D and mark the C-terminal boundary of the proposed active site loop containing Cys79. The <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> homolog contains a Phe at the same position but was catalytically inactive <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c24">24</xref>). Interestingly, a Phe&#x02192;Tyr mutation in motif I of M.<italic>Msp</italic>I, a bacterial MTase, caused an 8-fold increase in the time required for covalent complex formation when assayed with fluorinated target DNA but did not abolish catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c25">25</xref>). These data suggest that the presence of a Tyr in motif I is unlikely to prevent methyl transfer by DNMT2. Third, DNMT2 motif VIII (with consensus Gln-X-Arg-X-Arg) contains an Asn in place of the canonical Gln, except for <italic>A.thaliana</italic> and <italic>D.rerio</italic>, which contain a Tyr and Gln, respectively, at this position. The Asn158 side chain makes several hydrogen bonds to the TRD loop (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f3">3</xref>B): some of these contacts are mediated by a water molecule due to the shorter side chain of Asn, whereas in M.<italic>Hha</italic>I the equivalent Gln makes direct contacts. A single point mutation that restores the consensus sequence (Asn158&#x02192;Gln) in DNMT2 did not restore methyl transfer activity (P.Kearney and X.Cheng, data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that the Gln&#x02192;Asn substitution causes DNMT2 to be inactive.</p></sec><sec><title>Conserved TRD</title><p>m<sup>5</sup>C MTases usually contain a TRD between conserved motifs VIII and IX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c18">18</xref>). The variable TRD sequences determine the substrate specificity of individual enzymes. Although enzymes that have identical specificity often have related TRDs, TRDs of enzymes with different specificity share little sequence conservation, except for a ThrLeu dipeptide diagnostic of most TRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c27">27</xref>). In the co-crystal structure of M.<italic>Hha</italic>I with DNA Thr250 of the dipeptide is located at the interface between the DNA backbone and the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c28">28</xref>). Its side chain hydroxyl oxygen interacts with one of the phosphate oxygen atoms of the nucleotide immediately 5&#x02032; to the target cytosine. When the M.<italic>Hha</italic>I and DNMT2 structures are superimposed (with a root mean square deviation of &#x0003c;1 &#x000c5; for the corresponding C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> positions) the backbone atoms for residues 289&#x02013;295 in DNMT2 and 247&#x02013;253 in M.<italic>Hha</italic>I overlay well (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f3">3</xref>C). In M.<italic>Hha</italic>I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c28">28</xref>) as well as in M.<italic>Hae</italic>III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c29">29</xref>) this structurally conserved loop forms part of the scaffold that supports the residues interacting with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c27">27</xref>). The dipeptide in DNMT2 that corresponds to Thr250-Leu251 of M.<italic>Hha</italic>I is Cys292-F293. It should be noted that a Thr250&#x02192;Cys mutant of M.<italic>Hha</italic>I behaves very similarly to the wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c20">20</xref>). However, it would be interesting to see whether swapping the TRD between DNMT2 and M.<italic>Hha</italic>I will generate an active hybrid MTase.</p><p> Among DNMT2 family members the 41 residue stretch surrounding the TRD (266&#x02013;306) contains many highly conserved residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f1">1</xref>). The structure of DNMT2 offers a rationale for their conservation. Most of the conserved hydrophobic residues (Tyr266, Leu268, Leu273, Leu282, Phe293 and Tyr297), along with Leu340, Tyr342 and Phe343 of motif IX and Tyr370 of motif X, are involved in structural packing of the small domain and intramolecular interactions (Asp281&#x02026;Ser306). The arginines (Arg275, Arg288 and Arg289) and Lys295 are located on the potential DNA-binding surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f4">4</xref>A).</p></sec><sec><title>Model of the DNMT2&#x02013;DNA complex</title><p>No protein that contains the conserved DNA MTase motifs has previously failed to show methyl transfer activity in biochemical assays or genetic tests. However, abnormalities of methylation patterns were not detected in Dnmt2-deficient mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c5">5</xref>) and no detectable methyl transfer activity was observed for wild-type DNMT2 in assays that measured incorporation of methyl groups from &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H-<italic>methyl</italic>&#x0005d;-AdoMet into a variety of DNA substrates <italic>in vitro</italic> &#x0005b;including mammalian and <italic>E.coli</italic> genomic DNA, &#x003bb; DNA, plasmid DNA, poly(dI&#x000b7;dC), poly(dC&#x000b7;dG), random sequence oligonucleotides and RNA; J.A.Yoder and T.H.Bestor, data not shown&#x0005d;. The DNMT2&#x00394;47&#x02013;AdoHcy structure shows that the cofactor analog AdoHcy binds normally (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f4">4</xref>A and B) and the protein bears the consensus active site ProCys sequence in motif IV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f1">1</xref>).</p><p> A GRASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c30">30</xref>) representation of the electrostatic surface potential of DNMT2&#x00394;47 shows that AdoHcy binds in an acidic (red) pocket next to a surface enriched in basic (blue) residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f4">4</xref>B), which indicates a potential DNA-binding surface. The high degree of structural similarity between DNMT2 and M.<italic>Hha</italic>I allows us to create a model of DNMT2 bound to DNA. Using the coordinates for the ternary structure of M.<italic>Hha</italic>I&#x02013;DNA&#x02013;AdoHcy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c31">31</xref>), we superimposed the protein components and then positioned DNA over the basic surface of DNMT2&#x00394;47. The resulting model showed that DNMT2&#x00394;47 could contact B-form DNA without physical distortion of either the protein or DNA component (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f4">4</xref>C). It is possible that upon association with DNA the catalytic loop (colored light blue in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f4">4</xref>C) would adopt a closed conformation similar to that of M.<italic>Hha</italic>I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c28">28</xref>). From the structure there is no apparent reason why DNMT2&#x00394;47, which is strikingly similar to M.<italic>Hha</italic>I in size and structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f2">2</xref>C) and in AdoHcy binding (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f3">3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f4">4</xref>A), fails to demonstrate transmethylation activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and why it should be so strongly conserved in <italic>S.pombe</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, organisms whose DNA is not methylated and whose genomes do not contain homologs of Dnmt1 or the Dnmt3 family. We set out to investigate the biochemical properties of DNA binding by DNMT2.</p></sec><sec><title>Formation of DNMT2&#x02013;DNA complexes is resistant to denaturation and is inhibited by ES cell extracts and nucleoside triphosphates <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>It has been well established that m<sup>5</sup>C MTases can form an irreversible covalent bond with 5-fluoro-2&#x02032;-deoxycytosine (FdC) within an oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c33">33</xref>). Surprisingly, DNMT2 was found to form denaturant-resistant complexes with oligonucleotides independent of FdC, i.e. DNMT2 forms complexes with both FdC and control oligonucleotides in which FdC has been replaced with dC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f5">5</xref>A). The time course of product accumulation was linear for &#x0003e;2 h.</p><p> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f5">5</xref>B shows several aspects of the DNMT2&#x02013;DNA interaction. First, as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c16">16</xref>), Dnmt1 from ES cells is visible as a strictly FdC-dependent protein&#x02013;DNA complex (lanes 1 and 5), but not with control oligonucleotides that bear cytosines at the positions of the FdC residues (lanes 2 and 6). Second, DNMT2 forms complexes with both FdC and control oligonucleotides (lanes 3 and 4). This indicates that DNMT2 forms a complex with DNA in a manner that differs from that of Dnmt1 and bacterial m<sup>5</sup>C MTases, which are completely dependent on FdC for stable covalent complex formation. Third, the unidentified protein&#x02013;DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c16">16</xref>), indicated with chevrons, are also FdC independent, but have mobilities distinct from that of the DNMT2&#x02013;DNA complex. Fourth, it was reasoned that recombinant DNMT2 might be lacking accessory factors essential for methyl transfer activity; this seemed especially likely given that DNMT2 lacks the large N-terminal domain of DNMT1 which is necessary for normal function of the latter enzyme (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c1">1</xref>). ES cells are a likely source of accessory factors as they are capable of <italic>de novo</italic> methylation and maintain trace levels of m<sup>5</sup>C when homozygous for null mutations in <italic>Dnmt1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c2">2</xref>). Lysates of ES cells were cleared of nucleic acids by absorption to DEAE&#x02013;Sephacel as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c16">16</xref>) and added to reactions containing purified DNMT2 and DNA. The ES cell extracts did not activate a latent transmethylase activity of DNMT2 but actually inhibited complex formation with both FdC and control oligonucleotides (lanes 5 and 6).</p><p> As shown in lanes 1&#x02013;4 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f5">5</xref>C, the formation of denaturant-resistant complexes by DNMT2 is inhibited by 1 mM ATP, GTP or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ATP&#x003b3;S. M.<italic>Sss</italic>I, a CpG-specific bacterial DNA MTase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c34">34</xref>), was insensitive to these compounds (lanes 5&#x02013;8), as was M.<italic>Hha</italic>I (A.Dong and X.Cheng, data not shown). Inhibition of stable DNMT2&#x02013;DNA complex formation was largely reversed by addition of equimolar AdoMet (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke125f5">5</xref>C). Hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphate was not required for inhibition, as shown by equal inhibition by ATP&#x003b3;S. The competitive inhibition of AdoMet by NTPs suggests that nucleoside triphosphates can occupy the binding sites of both AdoMet and DNA and compete with binding of both. If this is the case, physiological concentrations (low mM) of nucleoside triphosphates would be expected to eliminate AdoMet binding, which is thought to be at cytoplasmic concentrations in the low &#x000b5;M range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c35">35</xref>). Therefore, DNMT2 differs from authentic DNA MTases in its formation of a denaturant-resistant complex with DNA and sensitivity of DNA binding to nucleoside triphosphates.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Is DNMT2 a DNA MTase? The remarkable isostery with M.<italic>Hha</italic>I and the presence and correct spatial organization of all of the motifs diagnostic of m<sup>5</sup>C MTases suggest that DNMT2 is a DNA MTase, but it lacks observable <italic>in vitro</italic> transmethylase activity. Abnormalities of methylation patterns were not observed in ES cells homozygous for mutations in the <italic>Dnmt2</italic> gene and the mutant cells retained the capacity to methylate newly integrated retroviral DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c5">5</xref>). However, the absence of a phenotype in Dnmt2 null ES cells and <italic>in vitro</italic> detectable transmethylase activity do not rule out a cellular function for Dnmt2. The lack of Dnmt2 activity could be due to a requirement for a specific post-translational modification or stage-specific cofactor or for a complex DNA target structure not easily mimicked in an <italic>in vitro</italic> setting. Like Dnmt2, <italic>Ascobolus immersus</italic> Masc-1 lacks detectable <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c36">36</xref>). However, genetic data showed that Masc-1 plays an essential role in methylation induced premeiotically, which requires the pairing of duplicated sequences occurring during the premeiotic phase of sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c36">36</xref>). If Dnmt2 has a similar role, or plays some role in imprinting, a phenotype may not be appreciated until Dnmt2 null mice are generated and the reproductive phenotypes and the phenotypes of offspring of homozygous parents are determined.</p><p> It is also possible that DNMT2 is not a DNA MTase. In addition to a lack of detectable <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic activity, DNMT2 homologs are expressed in at least two eukaryotes (<italic>S.pombe</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>) whose DNA lacks m<sup>5</sup>C and in these organisms the DNMT2 homologs are the only proteins with similarity to known m<sup>5</sup>C MTases. All eukaryotes known to methylate their DNA have been found to express at least two DNA MTases, one of which is related to DNMT1 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c1">1</xref>). The presence of DNMT2 homologs in organisms not known to methylate their genomes suggests that DNMT2 may not be an active DNA MTase. In addition, Liu and Santi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c37">37</xref>) have reported that m<sup>5</sup>C RNA MTases, which employ the same reaction mechanism and share sequence similarities, including the ProCys sequence, with m<sup>5</sup>C DNA MTases, use a downstream Cys residue in catalysis. The Cys residue within the CysPheThr tripeptide could have catalytic function within members of the DNMT2 family, although there is at present no reason to believe that DNMT2 is an RNA MTase.</p><p> The strong sequence conservation of DNMT2 homologs in diverse eukaryotic taxa suggests an important biological function, but further genetic analysis has thus far failed to identify a role for DNMT2 or its homologs. Human <italic>DNMT2</italic> maps very near the <italic>SCIDA</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c38">38</xref>), which is involved in a radiation-sensitive form of recessive <underline>s</underline>evere <underline>c</underline>ombined <underline>i</underline>mmuno<underline>d</underline>eficiency (SCID) common among Athabascan-speaking American Indians. The normal formation of signal joints and defective formation of coding joints during V(D)J recombination in SCIDA patients could involve defects in a DNA-binding protein such as DNMT2. However, mutations in the <italic>DNMT2</italic> gene could not be found in DNA from Navajo SCIDA patients (L.Li, M.J.Cowan, J.Russo, X.Qu and T.H.Bestor, data not shown). The <italic>D.melanogaster</italic><italic>Zucchini</italic> (<italic>Zuc</italic>) gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;flybase.bio.indiana.edu&#x0002f;.bin&#x0002f;fbidq.html?FBgn0004056">http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;flybase.bio.indiana.edu&#x0002f;.bin&#x0002f;fbidq.html?FBgn0004056</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c39">39</xref>) maps very near <italic>dDnmt2</italic> within 33B3&#x02013;F2. Mutations in the intronless <italic>dDnmt2</italic> gene were not observed in three independent ethylmethanesulfonate-induced alleles of <italic>Zuc</italic> (K.Wehr, G.Schupbach and T.H.Bestor, data not shown).</p><p> The denaturant-resistant and probably covalent binding to DNA suggests an evolutionary pathway in which a DNA MTase lost the ability to transfer methyl groups but instead marked sites in the genome by attaching directly to DNA. The catalytic mechanism of m<sup>5</sup>C MTases normally involves a transient covalent transition state intermediate formed by addition of a cysteine thiolate to the cytosine 6 position. After methyl transfer, abstraction of a proton from the 5 position allows reformation of the 5,6 double bond and release of free enzyme by proton elimination. A mutation that delayed or prevented proton abstraction would cause stable covalent bonding between enzyme and DNA in a manner that does not depend on methyl transfer. Regulated abstraction of a proton from the 6 position would release bound enzyme, making the DNMT2&#x02013;DNA complex much more reversible than 5-methylcytosine. While a probable role of DNMT2 and its homologs has not yet been determined, it may be significant that centromere structure and function is conserved among those organisms that contain DNMT2 homologs but is divergent in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C.elegans</italic>, which do not possess DNMT2 homologs. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has very short discrete centromeres that bind a group of proteins that are largely distinct from the well-conserved proteins associated with the centromeres of most eukaryotes and <italic>C.elegans</italic> has holocentric chromosomes rather than discrete centromeres. These phylogenetic findings suggest the possibility of a role in centromere function, and epigenetic inheritance of the state of centromere function in mammals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c40">40</xref>) and <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke125c41">41</xref>) provides an evolutionary link with epigenetic inheritance of the transcriptionally silent state mediated by DNA MTases. However, if DNMT2 functions via a mechanism that does not involve methyl transfer, the retention by DNMT2 homologs of so much of the character of m<sup>5</sup>C MTases in terms of sequence and structure becomes an interesting issue, given the strong conservation of DNMT2 homologs in taxa that underwent ancient phylogenetic separation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke125f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Alignment of Dnmt2 homologs.

DNMT2 (4 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml) was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with oligonucleotides (1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml) in 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT and 40 &#x000b5;M AdoMet. Reactions were terminated at the indicated times by addition of SDS to 2&#x00025; and glycerol to 12&#x00025; and heating to 65&#x000b0;C for 10 min, subjected to 6&#x00025; SDS&#x02013;PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and autoradiographed.

The synthesis, radioactive labeling and purification of FdC oligonucleotides have been described (16). The control oligonucleotide duplexes were not methylated, while FdC duplexes were hemimethylated (16). Methylation status did not affect formation of complexes (data not shown).

Where indicated, purified DNMT2 (0.4 &#x000b5;g) was added at the beginning of the reaction. Reactions were terminated after 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C by addition of SDS to 2&#x00025; and heating to 65&#x000b0;C for 10 min, subjected to 6&#x00025; SDS&#x02013;PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and autoradiographed.

Incubation of DNMT2 with FdC oligonucleotide and 1 mM ATP, GTP or ATP&#x003b3;S prevented complex formation but had no effect on the reaction of M.<italic>Sss</italic>I with the FdC oligonucleotide. The inhibitory effect could be largely overcome by addition of equimolar amounts of AdoMet (lanes 5 and 6).
