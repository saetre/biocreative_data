There are at least two major classes of mammalian monocyte and microphage scavenger receptors, termed as SR-A and SR-B, and they are involved in binding/uptake of oxLDL to macrophages and endothelial cells leading to atherosclerotic pathogenesis, and they also function in the recognition, and clearance of damaged tissues or apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>CD36, an 88 kDa membrane glycoprotein, is found in several cell types, such as platelets, monocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. CD36 has been reported to be a multifunctional receptor and it recognizes a wide variety of ligands including OxLDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], thrombospondin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], apoptotic neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and anionic phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Further studies demonstrated that CD36 expressed in COS 7 or Sf9 cells functioned as a high-affinity receptor not only for OxLDL, but also for HDL, LDL and VLDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Several regions of CD36 have been implicated as binding domains for its different ligands, including amino acids 28&#x02013;93 as the OxLDL binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and amino acids 93&#x02013;120 as the thrombospondin binding region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>CD36 protein has been characterized to have two hydrophobic domains at their N- and C-termini and these domains are essential for protein folding and targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, Pucent Navazo et al (1996) suggested that only the transmembrane domain and the C-terminal end of CD36 function in membrane anchoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Even though different ligand-binding domains on CD36 molecules have been characterized, there specific functions still remain inconclusive. To this end, several attempts were made to define domains for specific ligands and their functions on CD36. Pearce et al. (1998) used a series of GST/CD36 fusion proteins to define the domains of CD36 that specifically bind to Ox-LDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Stewart and Nagarajan (2006) created a soluble CD36 cDNA by replacing a signal peptide sequence of a type I membrane protein, CD59, at the N-terminus and a human IgG1 CVH2-CH3 Fc domain at the C-terminus of CD36. Their results confirmed that the chimeric sCD36-Ig is secreted and folded correctly, and it competitively inhibits oxLDL binding to membrane-expressed CD36 and oxLDL-induced monocyte adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In other studies, different ligand-binding domains of CD36 molecules were detected immunologically with a large group of antibodies raised against CD36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we first tagged the green fluorescent protein to both the N- and C-termini of huCD36 and investigated their cellular expression and influences on lipoprotein and pRBC binding.

The coding sequence of huCD36 was PCR amplified from pCDNA3-huCD36. For the pEGFP-C3-CD36 construct, two primers were used as 5' ATTAAGCTTATGGGCTGTGACCGGAACTGTG and 5' ATTGGTACCTTATTTTATTGTTTTCGATCTGCA. While for construction of pEGFP-N3-CD36, a stop codon at C-terminal of CD36 was deleted by using the backward primer as 5' ATTGGTACCTTTTATTGTTTTCGATCTGCA. For both PCR-amplified CD36 products, a Hind III site was created at N-terminal and a Kpn I site was created at the C-terminus. Both PCR-CD36 products were restriction-enzyme cut with Hind III and Kpn I and gel-purified. The purified PCR-CD36 was inserted into either peGFP-C3 or pEGFP-N3 vectors by normal ligation procedures. Ligated pEGFP-C3-CD36 and pEGFP-N3-CD36 were transformed into Xl-1Blue competent cells and amplified.

Both constructs, as well as GFP-encoding plasmid and the CD36 cDNA clone, were normally expressed once they were transiently-transfected into CHO cells. By immunostaining with antiCD36 antibody, the results revealed that the CD36 proteins collectively existed in cellular membrane and GFPs, however, were concentrated in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Then, we assayed whether the fusion to the GFP protein could have influence on the physiological function of CD36 in the recombinant proteins. Firstly, we attempted to detect if co-expressed GFP proteins could modify Ox-LDL binding on CD36. Two kinds of binding assay methods, uptake and surface binding, were carried out. To our surprise, p-EGFP-N3-CD36 showed a normal binding to OxLDL in both of the binding assays. However, pEGFP-C3-CD36 showed almost no OxLDL binding in uptaking, and a much increased surface binding. Then we assayed for pRBC binding and the results confirmed that CD36 proteins expressed from both pEGFP-C3-CD36 and pEGFP-N3-CD36 showed normal adhesion to pRBCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), and their bindings are similar to those as observes in normal CD36 expressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>CD36 has been well defined as a membrane receptor that can function as a molecule with specificity for multiple ligands including collagen, pRBCs, TSP, apoptotic cells and modified lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Several earlier reports suggested that each ligand has a discrete non-contiguous region on CD36 molecule that may be spatially proximal. OxLDL bound to an immobilized fusion protein containing the amino-termini of p6&#x02013;143 and p28&#x02013;93 showed an approximately similar affinity as intact CD36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which provided a conclusive evidence for oxLDL binding domain at P28&#x02013;93 on CD36. However, the amino acid region at 93&#x02013;120 was only for the TSP binding, but not for oxLDL binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In contrast, one report by using a chimeric CD36 construct with the murine sequence 155 &#x02013; 183 substituting the equivalent human sequence suggested that the p155&#x02013;183 domain may be critical for oxLDL binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Crandall et al (1999) reported that OxLDL competitively inhibits the adherence of pRBCs to CD36 but they suggest that, although oxLDL competitively inhibits the adherence of pRBCs, these ligand interact with distinct domains on the CD36 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Imach et al (2000) reported that the scavenger receptor class A, CD36, or CD68 can specifically recognize damaged apoptotic cells and they may play a major role in the clearance of apoptotic cells in the thymus, mediating the recognition and ingestion of apoptotic thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. All of the above reports seemed to come to a conclusion that CD36 embeds specific regions for binding of different ligands and some of them may co-interact. By sequence alignment of CD36 proteins from different species and other CD36 gene family members the N-terminal region from the amino acid 31&#x02013;190 shows significant sequence conservation indicative of its functional importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], possibly in oxLDL binding.</p><p>The approach using recombinant fusion protein seemed to be a potent technique to detect specific amino acid domains and to analyze protein-protein interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In our study, we used GFP-tagged to CD36 to investigate if the CD36 could be expressed in CHO cells and if GFP could affect CD36 function to interact with oxLDL and pRBCs. We choose to use GFP as fusion proteins based on the following reasons: The green fluorescent proteins (GFP), have been recently used for many cellular biology approaches to investigate target proteins' localization, physiological function and signal transduction, as well as gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Typically, proteins tagged to GFP were used to detect protein localization in living cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Also, GFP as a marker was used for gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], protein trafficking and secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and apoptosis assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Also GFP was extended to assay cellular physiological changes of enzyme activities and signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In this study, our results observed that when CD36 attached to the C-terminal of GFP, binding of ox-LDL was deleted, but when CD36 was attached to the N-terminal, there is no much effect on ox-LDL binding. There are two possibilities that may cause this to happen: (1) the Ox-LDL binding domain is located at the N-terminal of CD36 and it closely contacts with GFP proteins, the expressed GFP proteins may directly affect oxLDL binding via protein-protein interaction, or change of protein conformation; (2) the expressed GFP proteins may directly or indirectly affected CD36 protein's physiological function. This finding indicated that preventing of atherosclerosis could be achieved via CD36 protein recombination.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was carried out at Dr. Ian Crandall's laboratory under his supervision and financial support.
