In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, as in other eukaryotes, a number of evolutionarily conserved effectors, such as the p34-cyclin-dependent protein kinase Cdc28&#x0002f;Cdc2, play a critical role in driving the division cycle. The movement across major cell cycle transitions (G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S, G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M and M&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub>) is controlled by timed activation&#x0002f;inactivation of these specific effectors, many of which are very well studied. Cells also use the general cellular&#x0002f;metabolic processes for efficient regulation of cell cycle events. For example, although the ubiquitous 26S proteasome degrades all ubiquitin-tagged proteins, its activity is harnessed by specific ubiquitin ligases (E3 enzymes) to degrade cell cycle phase-dependent substrates. Such regulatory controls exemplify how the general cellular machinery for protein degradation, though not particularly specialized for cell cycle control, is utilized to drive the cell cycle with critical specificity. Although links between the cell cycle and RNA processing events are indicated by genetic studies in budding and fission yeasts and biochemical studies in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c6">6</xref>), they have not been investigated thoroughly.</p><p>In this report, we have investigated the connections between cell division and splicing with a special focus on <italic>PRP17&#x0002f;CDC40</italic>. <italic>PRP17</italic> encodes a protein essential for viability at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c7">7</xref>). Studies on <italic>cdc40-1</italic> and a null allele showed a role in both initiation of DNA replication and nuclear division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c8">8</xref>). Independent genetic screens identified Prp17 as a pre-mRNA splicing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c10">10</xref>). Sequence identity between <italic>PRP17</italic> and <italic>CDC40</italic> shows them to be the same gene. <italic>In vivo</italic> analysis of several intron-containing transcripts and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with the <italic>ACT1</italic> pre-mRNA implicate a role for Prp17 in the second transesterification reaction during splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c12">12</xref>). This function is apparently conserved even in the human Prp17 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c14">14</xref>) that partially complements growth defects of yeast <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic>. While <italic>PRP17</italic> is not essential for viability, it exhibits extensive genetic interactions with <italic>PRP18</italic>, <italic>PRP16</italic>, <italic>SLU7</italic>, <italic>PRP8</italic>, <italic>PRP22</italic>, U5 snRNA and U2 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c16">16</xref>). With the exception of <italic>PRP18</italic>, all the others are essential for the second step of splicing.</p><p>In addition to Prp17, a few other yeast splicing factors affect the cell cycle. The <italic>prp3</italic> allele <italic>dbf3-1</italic>, the <italic>prp8</italic> allele <italic>dbf5</italic> and alleles of <italic>prp22</italic> and <italic>cef1</italic> were uncovered in cell cycle mutant screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c18">18</xref>). The diverse phenotypes of <italic>prp17&#x0002f;cdc40</italic>-null cells hint that Prp17 influences more than one stage in the division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c7">7</xref>). This prompted us to examine the role of Prp17 closely in specific events of the division cycle. Using different temperature-sensitive missense alleles of <italic>prp17</italic> in various arrest&#x0002f;release protocols, we have assessed the execution points for this splicing factor. We show that Prp17 is required for the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S and G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M transitions. The latter requirement is due in part to the highly compromised splicing of &#x003b1;-tubulin transcripts from the <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> genes, which contain non-standard introns. This analysis in <italic>prp17</italic> and in several second-step splicing factor mutants demonstrates a differential dependence of these cellular RNAs on some splicing factors. The contribution of Prp17 to <italic>TUB3</italic> intron splicing was also studied <italic>in vitro</italic>. We find an inefficient second step even in wild-type extracts, a defect exacerbated in the absence of Prp17. Altogether, our data suggest a role for a non-essential pre-mRNA splicing factor in efficient progression through cell cycle transitions.</p></sec><sec><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p>YPH274&#x00394;17a <italic>MATa prp17::LEU2 ade2-101 his3</italic>&#x00394;<italic>200 ura3-52 lys2 trp1 leu2-3 leu2-112 bar1::hisGURA3hisG</italic> was the null allele used. <italic>prp17-1 bar::URA3</italic> strain <italic>MATa prp17-1 ade2-101 his3</italic>&#x00394;<italic>200 ura3-52 lys2 bar1::hisGURA3hisG</italic>. <italic>prp17-2 bar::URA3</italic> strain <italic>MATa prp17-2 his3</italic>&#x00394;<italic>200 ura3-52 trp bar1::hisGURA3hisG</italic>. <italic>prp17-3</italic> strain <italic>MATa ura3-52 his3</italic>&#x00394;<italic>200 trp1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>63 lys2-801 ade2-101 leu2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>1</italic>; <italic>slu7-1</italic> and <italic>psf1-1</italic> strains were obtained from C.

By fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, we note that there are only minimal changes in the DNA content of these cells even after 5 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f1">1</xref>A). At 37&#x000b0;C, the culture contained two populations of cells: &#x0223c;40&#x00025; with 1N DNA content and &#x0223c;60&#x00025; with 2N DNA content. This suggests that Prp17 plays a role at two stages of the division cycle.</p><p>To confirm these observations, and to aid in clearly defining the execution point(s) for <italic>PRP17,</italic> a number of <italic>prp17</italic> alleles were studied in various arrest&#x0002f;release protocols. The alleles chosen were: <italic>prp17-1</italic>, <italic>prp17-2</italic>, <italic>prp17-3</italic>, <italic>prp17-4</italic> and <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic>, the null allele. It is noteworthy that the <italic>prp17-1</italic> mutation, an allele analyzed in detail here, lies in the N&#x02010;terminal region of the protein that is functionally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c16">16</xref>). After G<sub>1</sub> synchronization, cells were allowed to re-enter the division cycle at either permissive or non-permissive temperatures. Cellular DNA content was monitored and the status of the mitotic spindle assessed during cell cycle progression. At the permissive temperature, <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> cells grow slowly, enter S phase and subsequently complete mitosis. However, at non-permissive temperatures, these cells arrest uniformly with 1N DNA content (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f1">1</xref>B). The <italic>prp17-4</italic> allele also confers a complete G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S arrest (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg333tb1">1</xref>). This implicates a requirement for Prp17 during transition to S phase. Interestingly, other alleles of <italic>PRP17</italic> behave differently. For instance, <italic>prp17-1</italic> cells after release from &#x003b1;-factor synchronization completely arrest with 2N DNA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg333tb1">1</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>prp17-2</italic> causes predominantly a 1N arrest with only a small proportion of cells progressing slowly through S phase (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg333tb1">1</xref>). In <italic>prp17-2</italic>, the mutation lies in the nuclear localization signal, which could retard nuclear trafficking of this protein and cause slow progression through S phase. We conclude, therefore, that at least one execution point for Prp17&#x0002f;Cdc40 is in the late G<sub>1</sub> phase. However, the behavior of the <italic>prp17-1</italic> mutant raises the possibility of a stringent requirement at G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M.</p></sec><sec><title>Prp17 is required in the pre-Start phase of the cell cycle</title><p>To define better the function of Prp17 during G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S, we analyzed the window in G<sub>1</sub> at which <italic>prp17</italic> cells are arrested. More specifically, we asked if in the absence of Prp17 the cells pass through Start and arrest at a post-Start phase. Traditionally, Start is defined as the point in G<sub>1</sub> beyond which cells are irreversibly committed to a new division cycle. The emergence of a bud, a burst of transcription of specific genes and initiation of DNA replication are some of the major indicators of this commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c25">25</xref>). We analyzed the Start-dependent expression of <italic>CLB5</italic>, an S-phase cyclin, in G<sub>1</sub>-synchronized <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> cells that resume growth at permissive or non-permissive temperatures. <italic>CLB5</italic> transcript levels were determined 30 min after release from synchronization. The analysis was repeated in culture aliquots withdrawn at subsequent hourly intervals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f2">2</xref>A). <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> cells at 23&#x000b0;C accumulate high levels of <italic>CLB5</italic> within 2 h of release from &#x003b1;-factor treatment and, by 4 h, the levels decline, indicating passage through G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S. At 37&#x000b0;C, <italic>CLB5</italic> RNA levels do not build up even 5 h after the release from synchronization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f2">2</xref>A). These data are consistent with the absence in this culture of cells with 2N DNA content. To establish the pre-Start arrest in the <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic>, a second marker for early S phase was employed. The expression of <italic>RNR1</italic>, encoding ribonucleotide reductase, is transcriptionally activated in a Start-dependent manner, since high levels of Rnr1 are necessary for S phase. <italic>RNR1</italic> transcript levels in the same experimental set-up as described above show no significant increase in <italic>prp17</italic> at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f2">2</xref>B). Additionally, we assessed the levels of the G<sub>1</sub> cyclin <italic>CLN1</italic>, transcriptional upregulation of which is a prerequisite for Start. While <italic>CLN1</italic> levels in <italic>prp17</italic> cells at 23&#x000b0;C reach a peak within 30 min of release from synchronization, this increase fails to occur at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f2">2</xref>C). Together, the data confirm the pre-Start arrest in <italic>prp17</italic> cells and suggest a role for Prp17 in the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S window lying between &#x003b1;-factor arrest and Start.</p></sec><sec><title>Ectopic induced transcription of <italic>CLN2</italic> does not relieve the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S block in <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> cells</title><p>The failure to accumulate high levels of G<sub>1</sub> cyclins could cause the pre-Start arrest in <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> cells. To understand if this is the sole defect in these cells and that there are no other regulatory controls, we have analyzed the consequences of ectopic induction of the functionally redundant <italic>CLN2</italic> gene in these arrested cells. A construct where a galactose-inducible transcription control of <italic>CLN2</italic> can be obtained was employed. This regulated <italic>CLN2</italic> construct was integrated at the <italic>URA3</italic> locus of <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> (Materials and Methods) and then used in cell cycle protocols. Such cells grown at 23&#x000b0;C with raffinose as the carbon source keep <italic>GAL1-CLN2</italic> repressed and were synchronized with &#x003b1;-factor. At 1.5 h before complete synchronization of cells was achieved, galactose was added to the culture to induce <italic>CLN2</italic> transcription, but cells were kept arrested due to the presence of &#x003b1;-factor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f3">3</xref>A). After complete synchronization, the cells were moved into &#x003b1;-factor-free medium containing either raffinose in the control sample or galactose in the experimental set-up. Both control and experimental cultures were grown at 23 and 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f3">3</xref>A). Cells maintained in a <italic>CLN2</italic>-repressed state (i.e. raffinose medium, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f3">3</xref>B, top left) at 23&#x000b0;C grow slowly yet pass through Start and complete DNA synthesis by 4 h. As expected, at 37&#x000b0;C these cells without <italic>CLN2</italic> overexpression remain arrested with 1N DNA content (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f3">3</xref>B, top right), reflecting the <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> phenotype. Notably, in cultures where <italic>CLN2</italic> is induced (galactose), the cells do not pass through Start and fail to complete DNA synthesis at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f3">3</xref>B, bottom right). Thus, we find that overexpression of <italic>CLN2</italic>, a G<sub>1</sub> cyclin whose levels are a determinant for passage through Start, cannot compensate for the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S arrest in <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> cells at non-permissive temperature. It is highly unlikely that the <italic>CLN2</italic> transcript is a direct target for Prp17 as it lacks introns. These data point to multiple targets for Prp17 and indicate that the pathway leading to G<sub>1</sub> cyclin expression is not the only limiting factor in <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec><title>G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M transition defines the second point of Prp17 requirement</title><p>Prompted by the complete G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M arrest of <italic>prp17-1</italic>, we next examined if the alleles causing a strict G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S arrest are also defective for the temporally later G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M transition. <italic>prp17</italic>:: <italic>LEU2</italic> cells were synchronized in early S phase by hydroxyurea (HU) treatment so that they were already past their G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S execution point. Subsequently, cell cycle progression was monitored at 23 and 37&#x000b0;C. In <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> cells released at permissive temperature, DNA was replicated by 2 h and mitosis completed by 4 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f1">1</xref>C). However, at the non-permissive temperature, these cells arrested with 2N DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f1">1</xref>C), a large bud and an undivided nucleus. Similar results were obtained with other missense alleles of <italic>prp17</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg333tb1">1</xref>). Thus, all alleles of <italic>prp17</italic> in this experimental regime arrest with 2N DNA and fail to undergo nuclear division. Further, to prove conclusively the requirement for Prp17 beyond S phase initiation, yet another set of experiments was done. Here, <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> cells were synchronized in G<sub>1</sub> by &#x003b1;-factor treatment and then allowed to resume growth at permissive conditions for 2 h, thereby allowing them to pass Start and initiate S phase. After this time interval, half of the culture was shifted to non-permissive temperature while the other half was maintained at the permissive temperature. In parallel, wild-type cells were subjected to identical experimental conditions. Consistent with results described in the previous sections, <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> cells shifted to non- permissive temperature arrest with 2N DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f1">1</xref>D). Collectively, these experiments clearly demonstrate that Prp17&#x0002f;Cdc40 is required for both the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S and G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M transitions.</p></sec><sec><title>Spindle maintenance defects in G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M-arrested <italic>prp17</italic> cells&#x02014;tubulin as a target for regulation by splicing</title><p>Earlier reports have implicated <italic>CDC40&#x0002f;PRP17</italic> in spindle assembly&#x0002f;maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c7">7</xref>). Since we find allele-specific phenotypes for onset of S phase, we examined the status of the mitotic spindle in various <italic>prp17</italic> mutants, with special attention paid to alleles that progress through S phase after Prp17 inactivation. The mitotic spindle in cells that were allowed to resume the division cycle after synchronization with &#x003b1;-factor or HU treatment was monitored by indirect immunoflorescence of &#x003b1;-tubulin. We find a spindle maintenance defect within 2 h of exposure to 37&#x000b0;C (data not shown), and by 3 h cells do not have any spindles or have very short spindles (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg333tb1">1</xref>). The <italic>prp17</italic> alleles differ only in the severity of spindle defects.</p><p>We have investigated possible reasons underlying microtubule instability by examining post-transcriptional regulation of tubulin. The spindle consists of microtubules that are polymers of the &#x003b1;&#x02013;&#x003b2; tubulin heterodimer. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has a single essential &#x003b2;-tubulin gene, <italic>TUB2</italic>, which does not contain any introns. There are two functional &#x003b1;-tubulin genes, <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic>, which share 90&#x00025; homology entirely within their coding sequences. In crude extracts from <italic>prp17-1</italic> cells passing through S and G<sub>2</sub>, there is a significant reduction (&#x0223c;80&#x00025;) in &#x003b1;-tubulin protein levels when this splicing factor is inactivated (data not shown). Similar effects are known in <italic>cef1-13</italic>, and in <italic>isy1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>syf2</italic>&#x00394; double mutants. These mutations in splicing factors also cause a G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c26">26</xref>).</p><p>Consequently, we investigated regulation of &#x003b1;-tubulin by mRNA splicing. Both <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> genes contain introns that have been speculated targets for regulation by splicing. While the <italic>TUB1</italic> intron has consensus <italic>cis</italic>-recognition elements, it is a small intron (115 nt). The <italic>TUB3</italic> intron (298 nt) is unusual in that the distance between the branch point and the 3&#x02032; splice site is 135 nt, as opposed to 36&#x02013;43 nt in most other yeast introns. We and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c27">27</xref>) have hypothesized that Prp17 is required for improving the efficiency of splicing for transcripts with non-canonical intron features. Therefore, the splicing efficiency of both <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> pre-mRNAs was examined. Since these genes share extensive nucleotide homology, we devised a semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR strategy to measure pre-mRNA and mRNA levels for each transcript. As a measure of splicing efficiency, we have determined the decrease in mRNA and also the change in precursor mRNA to mRNA ratio after inactivation of temperature-sensitive mutations in splicing factors. The effects caused by <italic>prp17</italic> and <italic>prp18</italic> were compared since both are non-essential auxiliary factors for the second step. We have also examined <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> splicing in other second-step factor mutants: <italic>prp16</italic>, <italic>slu7</italic> and <italic>prp22</italic>. Prp16 is an essential helicase required to bring about a critical conformational change at the 3&#x02032; splice site. It is suggested to act at or about the step of action of Prp17. The contribution of Slu7 and Prp22 to splicing of artificial substrates with varying distances between branch point and 3&#x02032; splice site has implicated them in the splicing of introns with increased distances between these specific intron elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c29">29</xref>). Furthermore, new alleles of <italic>prp22</italic> have been identified in a screen for mutants that arrest in mitosis with no microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c17">17</xref>). The <italic>psf1-1</italic> mutation in <italic>PRP8</italic> was also included in this study, since it identifies a Prp8 domain involved in 3&#x02032; splice site definition during the second step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c30">30</xref>).</p><p>The splicing of <italic>TUB1</italic> was compromised in <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic>, as revealed by the drastic decrease in mRNA; this contrasts with the lack of any significant change in <italic>TUB1</italic> mRNA levels in similarly treated wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f4">4</xref>A and B). This effect is also observed upon inactivation of the missense mutant <italic>prp17-1</italic>, confirming that the decreased <italic>TUB1</italic> mRNA levels are seen in the absence of active Prp17 at higher temperatures. None of the other mutations in second-step splicing factors <italic>prp18::HIS3</italic>, <italic>prp16-2</italic>, <italic>slu7-1</italic>, <italic>prp22-1</italic> and <italic>psf1-1</italic> greatly alter <italic>TUB1</italic> mRNA levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f4">4</xref>A and B). Despite the depleted mRNA levels in <italic>prp17</italic> mutants, an increase in <italic>TUB1</italic> pre-mRNA is not detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f4">4</xref>A and C). Failure to build up precursors or intermediates in <italic>prp17</italic> mutants has been reported for other intron-containing transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c32">32</xref>). We observe <italic>prp18</italic> mutations to behave similarly; there is no increase in <italic>TUB1</italic> pre-mRNA levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f4">4</xref>A and C). Notably there is no reduction in <italic>TUB1</italic> mRNA levels in the absence of Prp18 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f4">4</xref>B). In fact, an increase in mRNA levels is observed at 37&#x000b0;C. Strikingly, of the essential second-step factors, <italic>prp16</italic> and <italic>prp22</italic>, but not <italic>slu7-1</italic> and <italic>psf1-1</italic>, cause increased levels of <italic>TUB1</italic> pre-mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f4">4</xref>A and C). Thus, taking the combined effects of a decrease in mRNA levels and an increase in the pre-mRNA&#x0002f;mRNA ratio, we infer that <italic>TUB1</italic> intron splicing requires Prp17, Prp16 and Prp22.</p><p>The consequence of mutations in second-step splicing factors for <italic>TUB3</italic> intron splicing was also examined. The <italic>TUB3</italic> transcripts are poorly spliced in the absence of Prp17, as evidenced by an increase in the precursor&#x0002f;message ratio (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f5">5</xref>A&#x02013;C). The poor splicing of <italic>TUB3</italic> in <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> is replicated in the temperature-sensitive <italic>prp17-1</italic> strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f5">5</xref>A). Similar to the effects on <italic>TUB1</italic> splicing, <italic>TUB3</italic> splicing is inefficient in <italic>prp16</italic> and <italic>prp22</italic> mutants. The effects of <italic>prp18::HIS3</italic>, <italic>slu7-1</italic> and <italic>psf1-1</italic> are comparatively lower. Collectively, these data indicate a greater dependence of <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> introns on <italic>PRP17</italic>, <italic>PRP16</italic> and <italic>PRP22</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>A second-step defect for the splicing of the <italic>TUB3</italic> intron in cell-free extracts from <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic></title><p>The reduction in <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> spliced mRNA in <italic>prp17</italic> cells could arise as an indirect consequence of reduced transcription or altered decay kinetics for these mRNAs. To probe the direct relevance of the <italic>in vivo</italic> data, the splicing of the <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> transcripts was examined <italic>in vitro</italic>. Segments of the <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> genes were cloned as minigenes to generate splicing substrates through <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. As a control, <italic>ACT1</italic> pre-mRNA was also generated. The latter is spliced efficiently both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and is the prototype in nearly all such analyses. The <italic>TUB3</italic>, <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>ACT1</italic> substrates were examined <italic>in vitro</italic> particularly for the kinetics of the second splicing reaction. This was studied in two different cell-free extracts, one from a wild-type strain and the other from an isogenic strain bearing a null allele of <italic>PRP17</italic>. The <italic>ACT1</italic> intron is spliced efficiently in wild-type extracts; products of step 1 appear rapidly at 23&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f6">6</xref>A, lanes 2&#x02013;5) and the second step occurs without any delay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f6">6</xref>B). At any time point, the products from the second step are in larger amounts than those from the first step. In contrast, the splicing of the <italic>ACT1</italic> intron is inefficient for step 2 in extracts from <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic>; products from the second step are at significantly lower levels. This defect persists even at later time points (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f6">6</xref>A, lanes 6&#x02013;9, and B). These observations reinforce the general requirement for Prp17 for improving the rate of the second step for <italic>ACT1</italic> and concur with data obtained through immunodepletion of Prp17 from wild-type extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c12">12</xref>). The complete absence of Prp17 does not fully abolish the second step, since some mRNA is formed. Similar consequences are noted in <italic>in vitro</italic> reactions that lack active Prp18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c34">34</xref>). The splicing of the <italic>TUB3</italic> pre-mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> is marginally slow, as compared with <italic>ACT1</italic> (&#x0223c;10 min delay) for step 1 even in wild-type extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f6">6</xref>C and D). Even more striking is a delay in the kinetics of splicing step 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f6">6</xref>C and D). In <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic>, the products from the <italic>TUB3</italic> substrate are at low levels and a build up of the intermediates from reaction 1 occurs (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f6">6</xref>A, lanes 8 and 9 with C, lanes 9 and 10; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f6">6</xref>B and D). This inefficiency of <italic>TUB3</italic> splicing is reproducible even in different batches of extracts (data not shown). The <italic>TUB1</italic> intron was not spliced from <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts even in wild-type extracts, perhaps due to the small intron size and extremely poor splicing efficiency, and therefore could not be investigated further.</p><p>While the splicing reactions have not been modeled kinetically, we have estimated the likely rate of the second step in these reactions, adopting the approximations of Horowitz and Abelson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c34">34</xref>). Quantitative analyses of the time course of splicing shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f6">6</xref>A and B were done to estimate the rate of the second step. The rate of change in mRNA occurring within a 15 min time frame over the concentration of lariat intermediate was taken as an approximation of <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>, i.e. the rate of the second splicing reaction. <italic>ACT1</italic> is a somewhat better substrate than <italic>TUB3</italic> for the second step in wild-type extracts (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg333tb2">2</xref>). This small difference in the estimated rate of the second step is accentuated in the absence of Prp17 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg333tb2">2</xref>), indicating a direct role for this non-essential factor in splicing of <italic>TUB3</italic>, with its non-standard intron.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>TUB1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>i</italic> gene does not rescue the growth defects of <italic>prp17-1</italic>; multiple splicing targets for Prp17 in G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M</title><p>A precise deletion of the <italic>TUB1</italic> intron was created by a loopout PCR on a plasmid-borne <italic>TUB1</italic> gene (Materials and Methods).

The consequences of this intronless gene were examined in wild-type, cold-sensitive <italic>tub1-1</italic>, <italic>prp17-1</italic> and <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> strains. We resorted to the expression of <italic>TUB1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>i</italic> from the endogenous promoter at its chromosomal location since the expression levels and the stoichiometry of &#x003b1;-tubulin to &#x003b2;-tubulin are critical for efficient assembly and maintenance of mitotic spindles.

The <italic>TUB1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>i</italic> gene fully rescued the cold sensitivity of <italic>tub1-1</italic>, demonstrating the <italic>TUB1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>i</italic> construct to be functional (data not shown). The instability of mitotic spindles in <italic>prp17</italic> mutant strains makes them mildly sensitive to benomyl, a microtubule-depolymerizing drug. The <italic>TUB1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>i</italic> construct rescues this phenotype in both <italic>prp17-1</italic> and <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f7">7</xref>A). We have determined &#x003b1;-tubulin protein levels in <italic>prp17-1</italic> cells and compared them with the levels in <italic>prp17-1 TUB1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>i</italic>. These experiments were performed in synchronized cultures obtained through HU treatment. &#x003b1;-Tubulin in the parent <italic>prp17-1</italic> cells is observed only at permissive temperatures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f7">7</xref>B). The inability to generate &#x003b1;-tubulin at non-permissive temperatures is alleviated by the <italic>TUB1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>i</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f7">7</xref>B). Nevertheless, the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of <italic>prp17-1</italic> is not rescued (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg333f7">7</xref>C). Notably, <italic>prp17-1</italic> displays only a G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M arrest (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg333tb1">1</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that in <italic>prp17</italic> mutants, multiple limiting factors affect progression through G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Earlier experiments have shown Prp17 to be a second-step splicing factor, suggesting a role as a general spliceosome component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c12">12</xref>). However, since cells lacking Prp17 are viable at 23&#x000b0;C, it is thought to encode a function auxiliary to an essential, second-step splicing factor, possibly Prp8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c27">27</xref>). Interestingly, the behavior of a null allele of <italic>prp17</italic> implied a role for Prp17&#x0002f;Cdc40 in efficient progression through S phase and mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c8">8</xref>). It remained unclear if discrete transitions in the cell division cycle require Prp17. In this report, using a null mutant and a number of alleles with missense mutations in different regions of the protein, we demonstrate a requirement for Prp17 particularly during G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S and G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M cell cycle transitions. Several other lines of evidence gathered here strongly support this conclusion. Strikingly, even the weakest allele, <italic>prp17-1</italic> (with a G127A alteration), fails to complete mitosis; cells arrest with 2N DNA but without mitotic spindles (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg333tb1">1</xref>). No defect (kinetic or otherwise) for entry into and completion of S phase is detected in this mutant (data not shown). Our data from other <italic>prp17</italic> alleles confirm that Prp17 is required for entry into S phase (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg333tb1">1</xref>). These results strongly suggest a role for this factor at these two distinct cell cycle transitions. One possible reason underlying the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S arrest in <italic>prp17</italic> mutants may be the inefficient or lack of splicing of several intron-containing transcripts whose products encode factors needed for the metabolic state of G<sub>1</sub> cells. The hypothesis is supported by our finding that ectopic overexpression of a G<sub>1</sub> cyclin, whose levels are one of the critical elements for transition to S phase, cannot force an S-phase entry in these G<sub>1</sub>-arrested <italic>prp17</italic> cells. The alternative possibility for the G<sub>1</sub> arrest in <italic>prp17</italic> is a direct role for Prp17 in DNA replication. This is a plausible situation since <italic>PRP17</italic> exhibits genetic interactions with <italic>CLF1</italic> (<italic>SYF3</italic>), a splicing factor that recently was shown to interact with replication origin protein, Orc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c36">36</xref>). Prp17 thus joins a host of factors that influence specific early and late events in the regulated cascade of the cell division cycle. Mechanistically how this might be achieved has been speculated upon and tested to some extent here.</p><p><italic>PRP17</italic> is not the only second-step splicing factor that affects the cell division cycle. Prp8, Slu7, Prp16, Prp18 and Prp22 are other splicing factors whose functions are required for the second step of splicing. Amongst them, alleles of <italic>prp22</italic> and <italic>prp16</italic> have been uncovered recently in genetic screens for mitosis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c37">37</xref>), and alleles of <italic>prp8</italic> (<italic>dbf5</italic>) have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c1">1</xref>). The lack of mitotic spindles in the new alleles of <italic>prp16</italic> and <italic>prp22</italic> lead to the hypothesis that &#x003b1;-tubulin transcripts are targets for regulation by splicing. While the contributions of these factors to <italic>TUB1</italic> or <italic>TUB3</italic> splicing was not investigated, the hypothesis was supported by the rescue of spindle defects in these new strains by an intronless <italic>TUB1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c37">37</xref>). Our data from the analysis of <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> implicate these transcripts to be <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates dependent on Prp17. By examining the splicing of these transcripts in mutants for several second-step factors, we show that Prp17, Prp16 and Prp22 contribute to the efficient splicing of <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic>. Genetic interactions between <italic>PRP17</italic> and <italic>PRP16</italic> are known; high copy expression of <italic>PRP16</italic> partially rescues the growth defect of <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c12">12</xref>). Further, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies implicate that the second step of splicing can be divided into two events where Prp16 and Prp17 act at an early ATP-dependent step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c12">12</xref>). Therefore, the similar effects of Prp16 and Prp17 on <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> intron splicing that we observe are not surprising. Prp18 and Slu7 are predicted to act in concert in a step subsequent to Prp16 and Prp17. Inactivation of either protein has marginal consequences on <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> splicing efficiency, with Prp18, the non-essential factor, perhaps having a somewhat greater role. Slu7 is predicted to be required for splicing of introns where the distance between the branch point and the 3&#x02032; splice site is &#x0003e;7 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c28">28</xref>). We find here that despite <italic>TUB3</italic> having a 135 nt distance between these <italic>cis</italic> elements and <italic>TUB1</italic> having a 37 nt spacing feature, both of these precursors are spliced in the absence of active Slu7. The lack of dependence on Slu7 is consistent with the marginal role of Prp18, its partner in this step. Our results and predictions for the contribution of Prp18 to <italic>TUB3</italic> splicing agree with the data obtained from genome-wide analysis of yeast mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c31">31</xref>). Any minor role for Prp18 in <italic>TUB3</italic> splicing may arise from a recently described new domain in Prp18. The latter contributes to second-step splicing independent of Prp18&#x02013;Slu7 association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c38">38</xref>).</p><p>Through <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reactions, we validate the role of Prp17 in increasing the rate of the second splicing step without being absolutely required for the reaction. Previous analyses have deduced the same through immunodepletion of Prp17 from wild-type extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c12">12</xref>). It is as yet unknown if human Prp17 behaves similarly. Attempts to deplete hPrp17 from HeLa cell extracts were not successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c13">13</xref>). Nevertheless, hPrp17 associates with spliceosomes prior to the second step, in wild-type substrates and in artificial substrates with greater distances between the BP and 3&#x02032;ss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c13">13</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> data reported here performed with extracts from the <italic>prp17</italic> null strain irrevocably point to its auxilliary role in the second step of splicing. This is the case for at least two different transcripts, <italic>ACT1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic>. By studying <italic>TUB3</italic> intron splicing <italic>in vitro</italic>, we show that this substrate is more sensitive to the absence of Prp17. Our analysis of the <italic>TUB</italic>&#x00394;<italic>i</italic> gene in <italic>prp17-1</italic> and <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> cells suggests other critical limiting components in addition to &#x003b1;-tubulin for progression through mitosis.</p><p>We observe a partial reduction in the first step of splicing in <italic>prp17::LEU2</italic> extracts, particularly with the <italic>TUB3</italic> substrate. The genetic interaction between Prp17 and factors in the Prp19-associated complex may explain this observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c4">4</xref>). Prp19 and associated proteins act early during spliceosome assembly, at or around the time of loading U4&#x0002f;U6 onto the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c39">39</xref>). In the absence of Prp17, this step may be inefficient. Perhaps events leading from the association of Prp19 with the spliceosome to the second-step function of Prp22 are compromised in <italic>TUB1</italic> and <italic>TUB3</italic> in the absence of Prp17. In fact, depletion of <italic>CEF1</italic>, a component of Prp19-associated complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c41">41</xref>), blocked both splicing reactions <italic>in vitro</italic>, and its genetic depletion causes a G<sub>2</sub> arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg333c42">42</xref>). The precise role of <italic>CEF1</italic> or <italic>PRP17</italic> is not clear. Collectively, our results, together with the other recent studies discussed here, suggest that multiple interactions of Prp17 with other essential splicing factors such as Prp16 or Prp22 improve the second step of the splicing reaction. Our data provide clues to the nature of the involvement of the pre-mRNA splicing apparatus in cell cycle progression.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg333f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Prp17 is required for G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S and G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M transitions.
