The mutation also caused a looser association with the degradosome and an abnormal electrophoretic mobility in native gels. The latter feature suggests an altered structural conformation of PNPase, which may account for the properties of the mutant protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase, polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.8) is one of the main exoribonucleolytic activities involved in RNA turnover in bacteria and chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c2">2</xref>). Recently PNPase has also been localized in human mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c3">3</xref>) and PNPase homologues are found in metazoan sequenced genomes, but no hortologues have been so far identified in <italic>Archaea</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> the protein is a homotrimer of a 711 amino acid polypeptide encoded by <italic>pnp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c5">5</xref>). The three-dimensional crystallographic structure of the homologous protein from <italic>Streptomyces antibioticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c6">6</xref>) shows that each PNPase subunit is composed of a duplicated structural core, which contains the catalytic domain(s), an all-&#x003b1;-helical domain located at the bottom and two C-terminal RNA-binding domains, KH and S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c8">8</xref>), on the top. The three subunits associate via trimerization interfaces of the core domain, forming a central channel.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic>, PNPase catalyses the processive 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; phosphorolytic degradation of RNA, the reverse reaction (i.e. the polymerization of ribonucleoside diphosphates with release of phosphate) and the exchange reaction between free phosphate and the &#x003b2;-phosphate of ribonucleoside diphosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c12">12</xref>). PNPase can also bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c13">13</xref>), supposedly via its two RNA-binding domains. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the enzyme has been shown to be involved in both processive phosphorolytic degradation and polyadenylation of RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c15">15</xref>), and may be found as a component of a multiprotein machine, the RNA degradosome, together with the endonuclease RNase E, which provides the scaffold to the entire structure, the DEAD-box RNA helicase RhlB and enolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c17">17</xref>).</p><p>Genetic and molecular studies have implicated PNPase in several cell processes, which may account for the pleiotropic effects of <italic>pnp</italic> mutants. PNPase does not seem to be indispensable to <italic>E.coli</italic> at optimal temperature, unless either RNase II or RNase R, the other main exonucleolytic activities of the cell, are defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c19">19</xref>). However, PNPase defective mutants cannot grow at low temperatures (e.g. 16&#x000b0;C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c20">20</xref>). PNPase autogenously regulates its own expression by promoting the instability of its mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c23">23</xref>). The current model of PNPase autogenous regulation maintains that the leader region of the <italic>pnp</italic> primary transcript forms a long stabilizing hairpin that is rapidly processed by a staggered double strand cut by RNase III. This leaves at the 5&#x02032;-end of the processed <italic>pnp</italic> mRNA a short duplex with a 3&#x02032;-extension that stabilizes the transcript unless it is removed by the phosphorolytic activity of PNPase. Both phosphorolytic and RNA-binding activities of PNPase are thought to be essential for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c24">24</xref>). In agreement with the proposed regulatory model, both mutations that abolish PNPase enzymatic activity and those located in the RNA-binding domains impair autogenous regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c25">25</xref>). In the cold acclimation phase, autogenous regulation is temporarily alleviated and <italic>pnp</italic> mRNA becomes stabilized, although PNPase expression does not increase accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c28">28</xref>).</p><p>In a previous work we isolated an <italic>E.coli pnp</italic> mutant, originally named <italic>bfl-1</italic>, impaired in maturation of bacteriophage P4 CI RNA, a small stable RNA responsible for the prophage super-infection immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c30">30</xref>). In this mutant the primary transcript of the P4 immunity region became more stable and accumulated, while RNase P-mediated maturation of CI RNA was greatly delayed. Here we show that the mutation, a Gly454Asp substitution in the core region, does not affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme; rather, it appears to alter the overall conformation of the protein and to impair RNA binding, PNPase autogenous regulation and degradosome stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and plasmid</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains C-5601 (<italic>pnp-701</italic>&#x0223c;Tn<italic>5</italic>), C-5602 (<italic>pnp</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup>&#x0223c;Tn<italic>5</italic>) and C-5612 (<italic>pnp-7</italic>&#x0223c;Tn<italic>10</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c29">29</xref>) are isogenic derivative of the prototrophic <italic>E.coli</italic> C-1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c31">31</xref>) (the symbol &#x0223c; indicates P1 cotransducibility between the gene and the transposon).

The complementary 914 and 915 oligonucleotides carried a three base substitution (ACC&#x02192;GTT in 914, GGT&#x02192;AAC in 915) that changed the 454Gly codon of <italic>pnp</italic> into an Asn codon. The DNA fragments obtained from these PCRs, which were partially overlapping, were mixed, annealed, extended and amplified in a second PCR with the external 139 and 733 oligonucleotides.

To test whether the <italic>pnp-701</italic> mutation could affect the tertiary and/or quaternary structure of PNPase we analysed the purified PNPase by native gradient gel electrophoresis and visualized the protein by western blotting. The wild-type PNPase migrated as expected for a globular protein of &#x0223c;200 kDa, compatible with the PNPase homotrimeric structure, whereas the mutant migrated significantly more slowly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f2">2</xref>A). On the contrary, in denaturing SDS&#x02013;PAGE, both wild-type and mutant PNPase migrated as single bands of the same apparent molecular weight (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f2">2</xref>C, lower panel).</p><p>To test whether this was caused by an abnormal quaternary structure (either homo- or heteromultimerization) of the mutant PNPase, we cross-linked the purified PNPase with dimethyl suberimidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c41">41</xref>) and analysed the products by SDS&#x02013;PAGE.

Likewise, Pnp-701 polymerasic activity was not impaired by the mutation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f3">3</xref>). The mutant enzyme did not show the initial lag observed with the wild-type protein. Lag variability among different PNPase preparations has been reported and imputed to trace amounts of contaminating oligonucleotides that stimulate both elongation and <italic>de novo</italic> polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c11">11</xref>). In all our PNPase preparations, including those used for these assays, the level of nucleic acid contamination appeared to be rather constant, as assessed by OD<sub>280</sub>/OD<sub>260</sub> ratios (0.8 &#x000b1; 0.06). However, we did not investigate possible differences in length and composition of the contaminants, and thus cannot rule out that the lack of lag is due to differential contamination in enzyme preparations.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>pnp-701</italic> mutant is defective in autogenous regulation</title><p>In an initial characterization of the mutant we surprisingly found &#x0223c;3-fold higher phosphorolytic activity in crude extracts of the <italic>pnp-701</italic> strain C-5601 than in the wild-type C-5602.

To test whether the higher level of PNPase present in the <italic>pnp-701</italic> mutant could be related to a defect in control of <italic>pnp</italic> mRNA abundance we compared the <italic>pnp</italic> transcript profile of RNA extracted from exponential cultures of <italic>pnp-701</italic> and wild-type cells both at 37&#x000b0;C and at different times after temperature downshift to 16&#x000b0;C. The results of northern blot hybridization analysis using a riboprobe specific for a region at the 5&#x02032;-end of the <italic>pnp</italic> coding sequence are reported in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f4">4</xref>A. The wild-type mRNA profile has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c46">46</xref>). All transcripts start at the RNase III processing site and extend to different lengths downstream. The 2.25 kb RNA is a <italic>pnp</italic> monocistronic transcript terminating immediately downstream of the <italic>pnp</italic> coding region. This form appears to be produced in a PNPase-dependent manner by processing of the longer RNA species, as it is not detected in a PNPase nonsense mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c26">26</xref>). The 2.5 kb (monocistronic) and 3.3 kb (bicistronic) forms end, respectively, within the two genes <italic>nlpI</italic> and <italic>deaD</italic> immediately downstream, whereas the 5.4 kb transcript is a polycistronic <italic>pnp-nlpI-deaD</italic> message. The transcription profile of the <italic>pnp-701</italic> mutant differed in several respects from the wild type.</p><p>Overall, the monocistronic (2.25 and 2.5 kb) <italic>pnp</italic> mRNA signals at 37&#x000b0;C were much stronger in the mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f4">4</xref>A, lanes 0). A 10-fold longer exposure of the wild-type RNA blot was required to obtain a signal comparable to that of the mutant (data not shown).</p><p>The relative abundance of the 2.5 kb transcript was higher in the mutant, where the 2.5 and 2.25 kb forms exhibited comparable intensities.

A small increase could be observed in the mutant late after temperature downshift, when the wild-type <italic>pnp</italic> mRNA returned to a pre-cold shock level. These observations suggest that in the mutant autogenous control at 37&#x000b0;C is alleviated to the same extent as in the wild type during cold acclimation.</p><p>Induction of the 5.4 and 3.3 kb transcripts, which is thought to occur upon cold shock by transcription antitermination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c47">47</xref>), was observed in both the wild type and the mutant. However, these transcripts, in particular the 3.3 kb form, persisted longer in the mutant.</p><p>To confirm that the higher abundance of the mutant <italic>pnp</italic> transcripts at 37&#x000b0;C depended on increased mRNA stability, we compared the relative stability of wild-type and mutant <italic>pnp</italic> mRNAs by rifampicin&#x02013;chase analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f4">4</xref>B, the half-life of the mutant <italic>pnp</italic> mRNA was &#x0003e;4 min, whereas in the wild type it was significantly below 2 min, in agreement with previous estimates of &#x0223c;1.5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c48">48</xref>). Thus it appears that the increased level of PNPase and <italic>pnp</italic> mRNA in the mutant mainly, if not exclusively, depends on the loss of autogenous regulation at the level of mRNA stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Pnp-701 is defective in RNA binding</title><p>The above results and previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c29">29</xref>) suggest that the <italic>pnp-701</italic> mutation affects normal decay and/or maturation of specific messages without significantly impairing the phosphorolytic and polymerasic activities of the enzyme. It is conceivable that the mutation may affect PNPase&#x02013;RNA interaction, although the mutation is not located in the predicted KH and S1 RNA-binding domains of the protein. To test this idea we performed an RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay with purified wild-type or mutant PNPase and the untranslated <italic>pnp</italic> leader region as the RNA probe. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f5">5</xref>A, wild-type PNPase caused a complex pattern of RNA probe mobility shifts. At the lowest PNPase concentration (0.05 nM) several shifted bands appeared in the high-mobility range (indicated by bracket I). Supershifted bands in the low-mobility range (bracket II) were formed at 0.8&#x02013;5 nM, whereas at the highest concentrations (up to 30 nM) most radioactivity did not enter the gel or formed a smear. No unbound probe could be detected starting at 0.3 nM PNPase. On the contrary, RNA binding by Pnp-701 was severely impaired; unbound probe could be found up to 12 nM PNPase, and the supershifted bands in the low-mobility range (complex II) did not appear even at the highest concentration. In agreement with the electrophoretic mobility of PNPase in non-denaturing gels, the shifted bands in complex I were slightly more retarded with the mutant than with the wild-type protein. Similar results were obtained with other different RNA probes including poly(A) (data not shown). The RNA-binding defect of Pnp-701 was confirmed by filter binding assays as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f5">5</xref>B. The apparent dissociation constants <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> calculated from filter binding data for Pnp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Pnp-701 proteins were 0.3 nM and 1.2 nM, respectively. Although these values represent a rough assessment of PNPase&#x02013;RNA affinity in that occurrence of multiple binding events is disregarded, they nevertheless provide a quantitative estimate of the significant decrease in RNA affinity caused by the mutation. Moreover, it should be noted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f5">5</xref>B that Pnp-701 exhibited not only a higher apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, but also a lower capacity (&#x0223c;60&#x00025; of wild type) to bind the RNA probe at the highest protein concentration tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Pnp-701 is loosely associated with the RNA degradosome</title><p>We also characterized the consequences of the G454D mutation on PNPase assembly into the RNA degradosome. The complex was purified from wild and mutant <italic>E.coli</italic> strains C-5602 and C-5601 essentially as described by Carpousis <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c16">16</xref>) by ammonium sulphate precipitation and SP-Sepharose chromatography. PNPase and enolase activities measured at the different purification steps are reported in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh268tb2">2</xref>. It may be noted that PNPase activities from the mutant strain in both crude extracts and ammonium sulphate precipitate were &#x0223c;2.5-fold more abundant than in the wild-type preparations, in contrast with the almost equal enolase activities detected in the two strains under the same conditions. However, only PNPase from <italic>pnp</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> was entirely bound to the SP-Sepharose column, whereas more than 50&#x00025; of the mutant enzyme was found in the flowthrough, suggesting that a significant fraction of Pnp-701 was not associated with the RNA degradosome. As a result, the amounts of PNPase and enolase in the purified degradosome, which is eluted from the column with 1 M NaCl buffer, were very similar in the two strains, suggesting a similar composition of the complex bound to SP-Sepharose.</p><p>We then analysed the SP-Sepharose purified material by FPLC on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column so as to compare the aggregation states of the wild-type and mutant complexes. Fractions obtained from gel filtration were assayed for PNPase and enolase activities as well as for the presence of the degradosome components by western blotting with antibodies against PNPase, enolase, RhlB and RNase E. The results are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f6">6</xref>. PNPase and enolase from wild-type degradosome co-eluted in a major peak at an apparent molecular weight of 2170 kDa. Western blotting of these fractions showed, in addition, the presence of RNase E and RhlB helicase. A minor peak at &#x0223c;560 kDa contained essentially PNPase and enolase, whereas RNase E and RhlB could not be detected by western blotting. The tail fractions contained PNPase only, in a molecular weight region consistent with the elution of the PNPase homotrimer. These data suggest that the RNA degradosome purified according to the above procedure is mostly a high molecular weight aggregate, and that only a small fraction of PNPase may dissociate from the degradosome at any step after low-salt washes on SP-Sepharose. On the contrary, most PNPase and enolase from the mutant degradosome did not co-elute in gel filtration. The major peak of enolase was eluted at &#x0223c;1215 kDa together with RNase E and PNPase, whereas the major peak of PNPase was eluted at &#x02264;235 kDa and did not contain other degradosome components. An intermediate peak at 435 kDa contained both PNPase and enolase, with trace amounts of RNase E. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect RhlB by western blotting in the gel filtration fractions, although the protein was present in the SP-Sepharose purified material. This appears to be due to the low sensitivity and specificity of the available antibodies; probably RhlB was spread in several fractions in amounts below detectability. These data suggest that the RNA degradosome from <italic>E.coli pnp-701</italic> mutant bound to the SP-Sepharose column was prone to dissociate at some subsequent purification step, indicating that the mutant PNPase was more loosely associated to the degradosome than the wild type.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Structural defect of Pnp-701</title><p>Pnp-701 has an aspartate substitution at the evolutionarily conserved Gly454 residue. Assuming that the <italic>E.coli</italic> PNPase three-dimensional structure may be superimposed on that of its <italic>S.antibioticus</italic> homologue, the mutated Gly454 locates at the end of an &#x003b1;-helix thought to be important for proper orientation of the trimerization interface; in addition, this conserved residue may contribute to the correct placing of the linker III which positions the KH domain on the upper surface of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c44">44</xref>) (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f1">1</xref>). Moreover, from the partial modelling of this region, it appears that the S1 domain might make a contact with this residue.</p><p>We have shown that the substitution of Gly454 with any bulkier amino acid (Asp, Asn and Leu) leads to an altered electrophoretic mobility in non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, irrespective of the hydropathicity of its lateral chain. Therefore it appears that the delay in electrophoretic mobility is not directly caused by the charge of the substituting amino acid. We suggest that these mutations may change the conformation of the PNPase subunit, possibly by distorting the orientation of the trimerization interface (without impeding trimerization) and/or the positioning of the KH and S1 domains. The final geometry of the trimer could thus be altered (it could possibly be less compact), as indicated by the electrophoretic mobility of the mutant protein. It appears from our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments that such a structural change in <italic>pnp-701</italic>, the more extensively characterized of the mutants, does not significantly affect either phosphorolytic or polymerasic activities whereas it seems to affect RNA binding and stability of degradosome association.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA binding</title><p>PNPase seems to bind ssRNA without any apparent sequence specificity (13, this work). Pioneering work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c49">49</xref>) led to the proposal that PNPase has two groups of RNA-binding subsites: a first group, with a short residence time, at the catalytic site(s), and a second region with a long residence time. Supposedly, the former would bind at the 3&#x02032;-end whereas the latter would bind at the 5&#x02032;-end of and/or internally to the RNA molecule. This idea was further supported by electron micrographic observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c51">51</xref>) and by identification of the KH and S1 RNA-binding domains at the C-terminus of PNPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c52">52</xref>), which provided a rationale for the observation that a proteolytic fragment of PNPase still retained enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c53">53</xref>). It has since been commonly assumed that the KH and S1 domains are responsible for the internal RNA binding. In agreement with this idea, mutations affecting either or both KH and S1 may disrupt PNPase autogenous control, which is believed to require both phosphorolytic activity and PNPase&#x02013;RNA interactions, without substantially impairing the catalytic activities of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c25">25</xref>).</p><p>Pnp-701 is defective in RNA binding and exhibits a higher <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> and a decreased capacity for RNA. Interestingly, the mutation maps outside the putative RNA-binding domains KH and S1, suggesting that the mutation may indirectly affect the RNA-binding properties of KH and S1. Alternatively other PNPase domains affected by the mutation participate in RNA binding.</p><p>The complex pattern of wild-type PNPase&#x02013;RNA bands obtained in our electrophoretic mobility shift assays will deserve further investigations. The pattern is in part different from that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c13">13</xref>). This may be ascribed to both the different assay conditions and the different probe used. We believe that the increasingly slower bands in complex II appearing at high Pnp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations (supershifted bands) correlate with the increasing number of PNPase molecules bound to a single RNA probe. By assuming that only one PNPase molecule may be bound to the 3&#x02032;-end of an RNA molecule, it is implied that supershifted bands contain at least one PNPase molecule bound to RNA internally and/or at the 5&#x02032;-end. Binding of two PNPases bound at both ends of a single RNA molecule has been documented by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c51">51</xref>). On the other hand, the different bands observed at the lowest concentration (complex I) may represent different types of complexes between one molecule of PNPase (at any allowed position on the RNA molecule) and one molecule of RNA in different conformations (secondary structures). This idea is supported by the observation that using either poly(A) or short RNAs (i.e. non-structured RNAs) as probes, complex I appeared as a single band with both wild-type and Pnp-701 proteins (unpublished data). The fastest band in complex I remained at approximately constant intensity at all Pnp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations, suggesting that a fraction of RNA molecules are in a conformation that cannot bind more that one PNPase. It should be noted that in the conditions of the RNA-binding assay no degradation of the probe could be detected (data not shown), and it is thus implausible that the bands in complex I originate from different lengths of partially degraded RNA.</p><p>The lack of complex II supershifted bands with the mutant PNPase suggests that only one protein may be bound per RNA molecule. Since the catalytic abilities of the enzyme are not impaired by the <italic>pnp-701</italic> mutation and require interaction with RNA, it may be suggested that the residual RNA-binding activity of Pnp-701, visualized by complex I, represents the catalytic binding at the 3&#x02032;-end of the RNA molecule required for phosphorolysis or polymerization and that Pnp-701 may thus be defective in non-catalytic binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Pnp-701 association with RNA degradosome</title><p>The <italic>pnp-701</italic> mutation also seems to affect the stability of the purified RNA degradosome. Notably, both the composition and the yield of degradosomes from wt or <italic>pnp-701</italic> cells retained by the SP-Sepharose column were comparable. Gel filtration analysis, however, revealed differences in the stability of the two SP-Sepharose purified complexes. The wild-type degradosome eluted in a major peak of &#x0003e;2 MDa containing PNPase, RNase E, RhlB and enolase, and a minor 0.56 MDa peak containing PNPase and enolase. Only a small fraction of PNPase not associated with other degradosome components was eluted in the tail fractions. In contrast, the mutant degradosome recovered from SP-Sepharose seemed to dissociate in lower molecular weight subcomplexes: the largest one (&#x0223c;1.2 MDa) containing PNPase, RNase E and enolase; and a 0.4 MDa complex containing essentially PNPase and enolase. Moreover, most PNPase was no longer associated with other known degradosome components and was eluted in a lower molecular weight tail peak (RhlB was probably diluted out in many fractions and was below detection of the available antibodies). These data suggest that the Pnp-701-containing multienzyme complex is more prone to disaggregation and dissociates upon purification. The mutant degradosome may have dissociated at any step between elution from SP-Sepharose with 1 M salt and gel filtration. Although such instability might be revealed only under non-physiological conditions and might not impair <italic>in vivo</italic> degradosome assembly, it is nevertheless diagnostic of a looser association of Pnp-701 with the RNA degradosome, possibly as a consequence of a structural defect of PNPase.</p></sec><sec><title>Control of specific mRNAs stability and/or processing</title><p>Current models for PNPase autogenous regulation imply both catalytic activity and RNA binding by PNPase. Evidence supporting the latter claim have been indirect so far and are mainly based on the observation that mutations affecting either or both KH and S1 may disrupt PNPase autogenous control without substantially impairing its catalytic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c25">25</xref>). However, KH and S1 mutants defective in autogenous regulation have never been tested for RNA binding. Thus the data on Pnp-701 we have presented provide the first experimental evidence of a correlation between RNA binding and autogenous regulation defects.</p><p>Likewise, the requirement of phosphorolytic activity for autogenous control has been inferred from the analysis of PNPase mutants impaired in the catalytic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c24">24</xref>) on the assumption that RNA binding was not affected since such mutations were not located in the KH and S1 domains. However, RNA binding of these mutant PNPases was not measured; on the other hand, we have learned from Pnp-701 that mutations outside of KH and S1 may impair RNA binding. Therefore, whether phosphorolysis is required for PNPase autogenous control remains an open question.</p><p>Interestingly, Jarrige <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c24">24</xref>) obtained two PNPase mutants (Pnp-E81K and Pnp-H338G) harbouring mutations at residues not located in the RNA-binding domains that are impaired in autogenous regulation but not in catalytic activities, and might therefore be affected in RNA binding. Residue E81 is located in a flexible FFRR loop that connects the N-terminal trimerization interface and the first core domain, and could also be involved in entrapping the RNA adjacent to the KH domain; H338 is within the C-terminal trimerization interface, below linker III and close to G454. Thus mutations located in the core may alter the precise geometry of the trimeric protein and directly or indirectly affect RNA binding. It may be worth noting that, like Pnp-701, PNPase carrying the H338G mutation migrates more slowly than the wild-type enzyme in native gels, whereas the E81K mutant does not. However, in a screen for PNPase mutants we isolated the E81D and E81L mutations, which affect both autogenous regulation and native gel mobility (unpublished results). Overall, the slower electrophoretic mobility of these mutants suggests that such mutations may modify the geometry of either trimerization interface and/or the correct positioning of the RNA-binding domains, which may result in an abnormal conformation of the trimer. This in turn may interfere with RNA binding either directly or by altering the properties of the KH and S1 domains. It would be interesting to measure the RNA-binding affinity of these and other mutants such as Pnp-702 and Pnp-703 to determine quantitatively whether a correlation between defects in RNA binding and autogenous regulation may be established.</p><p>A prerequisite for autogenous control is RNase III processing of <italic>pnp</italic> mRNA untranslated leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c48">48</xref>). It could be possible that PNPase binding to the leader may control efficiency of RNase III processing, e.g. by affecting RNA secondary structure and/or RNase III access to the target. This idea, however, seems implausible since neither by northern blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh268f4">4</xref>) nor by primer extension (data not shown) could we detect RNase III unprocessed species. Therefore alleviation of autogenous regulation depends on the inability of Pnp-701 to destabilize the RNase III processed RNA, likely because of its defective RNA binding.</p><p>The most abundant form of <italic>pnp</italic> monocistronic mRNA present at 37&#x000b0;C in wild-type cells is the 2.25 kb transcript, which extends from the RNase III cut site to the transcription termination point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c46">46</xref>). Maturation of this mRNA, which appears to derive largely by PNPase-dependent 3&#x02032;-end degradation of the longer 2.5 kb species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c26">26</xref>), is partially affected in <italic>pnp-701</italic>. An intriguing possibility that should be addressed is whether <italic>pnp</italic> mRNA 3&#x02032;-end maturation, in addition to the proposed PNPase interactions with its 5&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c22">22</xref>), plays a role in autogenous control of PNPase. It should also be observed that the increment of <italic>pnp</italic> mRNA abundance in the mutant is higher than the increment in PNPase. This suggests that a translational control could be operating in addition to the control on <italic>pnp</italic> mRNA stability.</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli pnp-701</italic> was isolated as a mutant unable to efficiently support lysogenization by phage P4. In this mutant, the precursors of CI RNA, the P4 immunity factor, were more stable and less efficiently processed by RNase P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c30">30</xref>), which generates the 5&#x02032;-end of CI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c55">55</xref>). By comparison with the phenotype of PNPase-deficient mutants, it was proposed that <italic>pnp-701</italic> was a leaky PNPase mutant, and that PNPase is required to process the 3&#x02032;-end of the primary transcripts covering the P4 immunity region, thus generating a suitable substrate for RNase P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh268c56">56</xref>). The molecular characterization of Pnp-701 indicates that, like destabilization of <italic>pnp</italic> transcript, maturation of P4 CI RNA does not simply require the enzymatic activities of PNPase, but also specific RNA&#x02013;PNPase interactions that may destabilize the primary transcripts and allow further processing. Whether specific determinants are required on these RNA molecules for PNPase interaction is a matter of current investigation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh268f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structure of a PNPase monomer.
