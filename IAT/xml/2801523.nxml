We wished to explore the possibility that a carbocation intermediate is formed during the cleavage reaction of BCMO1, as is seen for many isoprenoid biosynthesis enzymes, and to determine which residues in the substrate binding cleft are necessary for catalytic and substrate binding activity. To test this hypothesis, we replaced substrate cleft aromatic and acidic residues by site-directed mutagenesis.

However, replacement of these same tyrosines with phenylalanine or tryptophan does not significantly impair activity, indicating that aromaticity at these residues is crucial. Mutations of two other aromatic residues in the binding cleft of BCMO1, F51 and W454, to either another aromatic residue or to leucine do not influence the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

Three mammalian family members with very different functions have been described: 1) &#x003b2;-carotene-15,15'-monooxygenase (BCMO1)<sup>1 </sup>is an enzyme which symmetrically cleaves &#x003b2;-carotene to produce two molecules of all-<italic>trans </italic>retinal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and is the initial step in biosynthesis of vitamin A in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; 2) &#x003b2;-carotene-9',10'-monooxygenase (BCMO2) is believed to cleave &#x003b2;-carotene asymmetrically to produce 10'-apocarotenal and &#x003b2;-ionone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; and 3) RPE65 is an isomer(ohydrol)ase in the visual cycle, converting all-<italic>trans </italic>retinyl palmitate to 11-<italic>cis </italic>retinol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In BCMO1 knockout mice, disruption in BCMO1 leads to hypercarotenemia on a provitamin A-rich, vitamin A-deficient diet and also to changes in lipid metabolism and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Pathological effects of mutations in BCMO1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] have also been described in humans. Therefore, the catalytic mechanism for this enzyme is of particular interest.</p><p>Based on the solved apocarotenoid-15,15'-oxygenase (ACO) crystal structure, all these iron (II)-dependent oxygenases are predicted to share a common seven bladed &#x003b2;-propeller structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In ACO, Fe(II) is coordinated in a near-perfect octahedral arrangement by four histidines. The fifth position in the crystal structure is occupied by a water molecule, and dioxygen is proposed to complete the coordination geometry at the sixth position. Presumably, all members of this family, including BCMO1, share this iron center arrangement. Recently, we validated the crystal structure predictions by showing that mutations of the invariant histidines H172A, H237A, H308A and H514A which are paralogs of the iron-coordinating histidines in ACO abolished BCMO1 activity. Although still controversial, the central cleavage of &#x003b2;-carotene by BCMO1 is currently believed to follow a monooxygenase mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On the other hand, it has unequivocally been shown that the plant family member CCD1 is a dioxygenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Experiments by Olson <italic>et al</italic>. with crude enzyme preparations led the authors to believe that BCMO1 is also a dioxygenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, the substituted bis(1-alkylimidazol-2-yl)propionate mononuclear iron complexes, which closely resemble ACO iron coordination, efficiently catalyze both olefin epoxidation (monoxygenation products) and <italic>cis</italic>-dihydroxylation (dioxygenation products) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], suggesting that both mechanisms are plausible for the various carotenoid oxygenases.</p><p>The process of monooxygenation is suggested to involve reductive oxygen activation at metal complexes followed by oxygen transfer to the substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the ACO crystal structure, all-<italic>trans </italic>carotenoid substrate was modeled in a 13,14-13',14'-di-<italic>cis </italic>conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The formation of cation intermediates in the process of <italic>trans</italic>- to <italic>cis</italic>-isomerization is well documented for electrochemical, ferric oxide and iodine oxidation of carotenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Also, cationic intermediates were predicted in an <italic>ab initio </italic>study of lycopene isomerization, providing a quantum mechanical explanation for the antioxidant properties of carotenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Recently it has been demonstrated that a carotenoid cation-radical is formed in the photosynthetic light harvesting system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, the analysis of the ACO oxidative cleavage mechanism by the quantum chemical density field theory method predicted formation of a substrate radical cation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A cation-radical is formed by one electron oxidation of &#x003b2;-carotene; a second one-electron oxidation leads to formation of a dication &#x003b2;-carotene. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electrochemical studies of carotenoid oxidation led to a proposed equilibrium between radical cation, dication and the original carotenoid. Moreover, careful analysis of the electrochemical behavior of &#x003b2;-carotene in methylene chloride demonstrated that two electrons are transferred in the first oxidation step, and thus formation of dications occurs at lower oxidation potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Simultaneous electrochemical/EPR experiments showed subsequent decay of the &#x003b2;-carotene dication to a monocation as a result of the proton transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. On the other hand, carbocation could be produced by protonating the &#x003b2;-carotene carbon-carbon double bond chain. Diamagnetic carbocations exhibit considerable stability at room temperature due to charge delocalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A large body of published work points to stabilization of carbocations by anionic and aromatic residues in active sites of polyene chain synthesizing enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently, an intramolecular proton-transfer mechanism has been implicated in a carbocationic mechanism of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase and aristolochene synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore we have investigated the question of involvement of carbocation intermediates during the enzymatic cleavage of &#x003b2;-carotene.</p><p>In the present report, we have analyzed the role of conserved catalytic site aromatic residues in the catalytic mechanism of BCMO1, using site-directed mutagenesis to create a set of mutant enzymes and characterizing these mutants using <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Modeling of mouse BCMO1 on the ACO template and identification of conserved aromatics in the substrate binding cleft</title><p>Preliminary ClustalW 1.74 alignment of BCMO1 and ACO was optimized for conserved histidines and acidic residues. This alignment was iteratively presented to the Swiss Model Repository with manual adjustment after each cycle for the final complete model. The alignment shows several conserved aromatic residues, particularly in regions near the Fe-coordinating histidines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Both these enzymes cleave carotenoids at the 15-15' position. Using this alignment to model the structure of BCMO1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) we found four aromatics within the substrate cleft paralogous to aromatics in ACO: F51 (ACO = F69) in the highly conserved FDG motif above the Fe, Y235 (ACO = F236) above E140 fixing the second coordinating histidine (H237), Y326 (ACO = Y322) above E405 fixing the third coordinating histidine (H308), and W454 (ACO = W423) near E457 fixing the fourth coordinating histidine (H514) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). F51, Y235 and Y326 are predicted to be less than 5 &#x000c5; from the polyene chain of the substrate, and W454 is similarly close to one of the &#x003b2;-ionone rings of the substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>ClustalW protein sequence alignment of murine polyene oxygenase family members with ACO</bold>.

Y326 was also exchanged to the paralogous glutamine, as in BCMO2. In previous work, we had determined the effect of mutating the conserved acidic residues to alanine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of aromatics in the substrate binding cleft <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Since mutation of the crucial residues in the enzyme leads to significant reduction in the activity of BCMO1, the sensitivity of <italic>in vitro </italic>enzymatic assay is not sufficient for analysis of these residues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, we made use of &#x003b2;-carotene-accumulating <italic>E.coli/</italic>pAC-BETA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] as an <italic>in vivo </italic>system for measurement of enzymatic activity.</p><p>Substrate for BCMO1 (&#x003b2;-carotene) is constitutively synthesized and accumulated in this specially designed <italic>E.coli </italic>strain. After we allowed sufficient time for &#x003b2;-carotene to be accumulated in the cells, we induced synthesis of BCMO1 and measured the amount of beta-carotene left in induced and uninduced cells. As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], uninduced pBAD/BCMO1 constructs are functionally equivalent to the irrelevant pBad/LacZ construct (in which there is no carotene cleavage) for use as negative controls of BCMO1 activity.</p><p>Mutation of either F51 or W454 to leucine had little effect on the activity of BCMO1 and mutation of F51 to tyrosine or W454 to phenylalanine had no effect in this assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). However, a more significant effect was seen with the two tyrosines, Y235 and Y326. In the case of Y235, practically no loss of activity was observed with the Y235W mutant, moderate loss of activity with the Y235F mutant, and greater loss with the Y235L mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Y235 is located adjacent to the E140 "fixing" glutamate in the substrate binding cleft (~3.8 A), for which the E140A mutation has been shown to reduce activity to about 50% relative to WT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, these two residues could play a role in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. Analysis of the double mutants for Y235F/E140A and Y235L/E140A revealed residual activity (bleaching) only for Y235F/E140A mutant 20 h post-induction (data not shown). These results support the idea that this pair is not involved in proton transfer for formation of carbocations but may point to compensating mechanisms in substrate stabilization. As we noted above, Y326 is located on our model less than 5 &#x000c5; from &#x003b2;-carotene and 2.73 &#x000c5; from E405. To address the function of Y326 in the BCMO1 catalytic mechanism, we constructed a set of mutants: Y326W (as in RPE65), Y326F, Y326L and Y326Q (as in BCMO2). Catalytic activity of Y326W (84.2 &#x000b1; 5.4) is comparable to that of the wild type BCMO1 (82.4 &#x000b1; 5.6) in the accumulative <italic>in vivo </italic>system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) and Y326F is also active. Mutation to the nonaromatic amino acid leucine, Y326L, resulted in a drop in catalytic activity (38.2 &#x000b1; 2.6). The most significant decrease in catalytic activity was observed by introduction of the partially positively charged amino acid glutamine in place of tyrosine: Y326Q (9.3 &#x000b1; 1.5). (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Our previous studies had demonstrated that, of the three "fixing" glutamates, only E405 is indispensable for enzyme activity as the E405A mutant has no activity, although the protein is expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, compensating mechanisms are unlikely for this pair of residues. These data collectively demonstrate that aromaticity of the residue is important for the enzyme activity in both the Y235 and Y326 positions but not in the F51 or W454 positions.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>B-carotene cleavage activity of mutants of aromatic residues located in binding cleft of BCMO1</bold>. <bold>A</bold>) Mutations of F51. <bold>B</bold>) Mutations of W454. <bold>C</bold>) Mutations of Y235. <bold>D</bold>) Mutations of Y326.

With respect to Y326 in BCMO1, Y was conserved in other BCMO1 orthologs, W was the paralogous residue in RPE65, but aromatic resides were not found in BCMO2 sequences at this position. It should be noted that BCMO1 and RPE65 both act at the 15 carbon position, whereas BCMO2 is thought to cleave carotenoids asymmetrically. The Swiss-PDB model of BCMO1 built on the ACO template predicts that F51, Y235, Y326 and W454 are aromatics located in the carotenoid binding cleft. The possibility that some or all of these residues participate in catalytically important functions was thus an important consideration. Tyrosines are known to play a key role in coupled proton-shuttling in a large number of metalloenzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and, additionally, can directly participate in electron transfer by forming tyrosyl radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. They may also play a structural role by participating in the architecture of the enzyme active site, or play a role in the correct positioning of the substrate and cofactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and are known to take part in interaction with substrate and/or cofactors and determine the substrate specificity in a variety of enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Finally, tyrosine and other aromatic amino acids are implicated in cation-&#x003c0; interactions stabilizing carbocation intermediates generated during enzymatic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Our results indicate that mutations of Y235 and Y326 to leucine significantly impair catalytic activity of BCMO1. We found that the aromaticity of amino acids Y235 and Y326 are important for enzymatic activity, whereas mutation of F51 or W454 to leucine had little effect. Mutation of either of these two tyrosines to other aromatic residues (phenylalanine or tryptophan) does not affect enzyme activity by more than 10-20% relative to wild type, but replacement to non-aromatic residues (leucine or glutamine) leads to significant loss of enzymatic activity. The studies presented here support a mechanism implicating cation-&#x003c0; stabilization of a putative carbocation intermediate. We can exclude the possibility of radical formation by these tyrosines in BCMO1 catalysis, as the tyrosine to leucine mutants, Y235L and Y326L, although reduced in activity (sometimes significantly), exhibited some level of residual activity. Additionally, EPR analyses of BCMO1 failed to detect tyrosyl radical formation (Poliakov and Krishna, unpublished results). However, this finding does not exclude the possibility of other functional roles for these residues. The Swiss-PDB model of BCMO1 built on the ACO template predicts close localization of Y235-E140 and Y326-E405 residues with possible hydrogen bonding for the latter pair (~2.73 &#x000c5;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). However, our mutagenesis data suggest that these hydrogen bonds cannot be crucial for the catalytic mechanism of BCMO1; moreover, simultaneous replacement of Y235F/E140A does not eliminate activity.</p><p>From our data it is reasonable to propose that aromaticity of the two tyrosines Y235 and Y326 plays an important role in the catalytic mechanism of BCMO1. To explore this possibility, we mounted an <italic>ab initio </italic>model of &#x003b2;-carotene onto the BCMO1 structural model by thermodynamic optimization. It was observed that tyrosines Y235 and Y326 fix the position of the substrate on two sides of the 15-15' double bond of the substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The predicted hydrophobic interactions with substrate are in accordance with our catalytic activity data for Y235F, Y235W and Y235L, and Y326W, Y326F and Y326L mutants. Consequently, we can speculate that in the case of a mechanism involving one-electron oxidation by dioxygen bound to the ferrous ion and the subsequent radical-cation formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], or two one-electron oxidation steps and dication formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the aromatic residues (Y235, Y326) and glutamates (E140, E405) stabilize a cationic intermediate with charge delocalization along the polyene chain. On the other hand, we could not rule out the possibility of protonation of a double bond and formation of a carbocation as in the case of isopentyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Distances between these tyrosines and &#x003b2;-carotene chain in our model are less that 5 &#x000c5; which is in good agreement with cation-&#x003c0; stabilization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The occurrence of such stabilization was previously observed in squalene-hopene cyclase and oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the polycyclization cascade of squalene and oxidosqualene, aspartates initiate the cyclization process by protonation of the terminal double bond and stabilize the first carbocation intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The &#x003c0;-electrons of several aromatic residues stabilize cationic intermediates in other enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The cation intermediate would explain the observation of transient substrate isomerization in the binding cleft of ACO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Transient carbocations are formed in many steps of sterol and carotenoid synthesis, and various positively charged amino derivatives could noncompetitively inhibit these enzymes. Of the three inhibitors tested here, diphenylamine, an oxidation inhibitor, was the only one to have a substantial inhibitory effect on BCMO1 activity. Diphenylamine is reported to inhibit electron transfer in photosynthetic membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and carotenogenesis by inhibiting carotenoid ketolase and phytoene desaturase. However, this is in line with the common mechanism of inhibition by diphenylamine of iron oxygenases and is not necessarily conclusive for carbocation formation.</p><p>As expected, replacement of Y326 by tryptophan, which has the highest &#x003c0;-binding energy of the aromatic series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], did not negatively effect activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. The altered biochemical parameters (especially the higher K<sub>m</sub>) for the Y326W mutant could be explained by steric hindrance. Also, it is important to note that the <italic>in vivo </italic>assay shows the cumulative effect of mutation and thus cannot estimate the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Replacement of tyrosine by glutamine (a partially positively charged residue)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] would be expected to destabilize a cation, and therefore, effectively inhibit catalytic activity of BCMO1. The results presented here correlate with these hypotheses. Productive replacement of Y326 by tryptophan, such as found at the paralogous residue W331 in RPE65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] suggests that BCMO1 and RPE65 may share a similar catalytic mechanism. In fact, the formation of a carbocation intermediate had been proposed in the catalytic mechanism of retinoid isomerization in the RPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] prior to the identification of RPE65 as the isomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We show that aromaticity of the substrate binding cleft aromatic residues Y235 and Y326 is important for the activity of recombinant mouse BCMO1. The enzymatic activity changes follows the trend Y235W&#x0003e;Y235F&#x0003e;Y235L and Y326W~Y326F&#x0003e;Y326L&#x0003e;Y326Q which agrees very well with the &#x003c0;-binding energies of these amino acids. Based on the mutational data and structure modeling we propose that cation-&#x003c0; interactions between Y235 and Y326 and &#x003b2;-carotene cation intermediate play an important role in the mechanism of BCMO1. We also show that replacing F51 and W454, two other substrate binding cleft aromatic residues, does not affect BCMO1 enzyme activity.
