The eukaryotic cells have developed multiple pathways designed to transport various types of macromolecules through specialized channels that are incorporated within the nuclear envelope. There are four major components involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, including cargos, receptors, nuclear pore complex (NPC), and Ran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Cargos are proteins, RNAs or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles that contain either nuclear localization signals destined for import into the nucleus from the cytoplasm or nuclear export signals destined for export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>NXF (<underline>n</underline>uclear e<underline>x</underline>port <underline>f</underline>actor) family members (NXF 1 to 6) play essential roles in RNA exporting out of the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] through NPC. The structure of the founding member, NXF1 (also called TAP), has modular organization consisting of four major domains: a noncanonical RNP-type RNA-binding domain (RBD), four leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an internal domain sharing significant sequence homology with the nuclear transport factor 2 (the NTF2-like domain) and a C-terminal ubiquitin associated (UBA)-like domain. The RBD domain and LRRs are responsible for recognition and binding of RNAs through RNP and CTE (<underline>c</underline>onstitutive <underline>t</underline>ransport <underline>e</underline>lement-a cis-acting RNA sequence). The UBA-like domain interacts with multiple nuleoporins of NPC. The NTF2-like domain heterodimerizes with another protein, NXT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>NXT1 was initially identified from human based on its sequence homology to NTF2 (~26%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and association with the RNA exporting factor NXF1/TAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Earlier studies suggested that NXT1 was necessary for Crm1-mediated nuclear export of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], in which NXT1 directly binds to export receptor Crm1 and RanGTP (a form of Ran binding GTP), and efficiently stimulates the release of cargos in the cytoplasm after translocation through NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, recent experiments demonstrated that NXT1 appears to exclusively participate, independently of Ran and Crm1, in TAP-mediated nuclear export of RNAs. This finding has been widely confirmed in yeasts, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans </italic>and vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It was shown that formation of a NXF1/NXT heterodimer via NTF2-like domain is required for the nuclear export of RNAs in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Recently, another member, NXT2 (also called p15-2), was identified to be able to substitute NXT1 in forming NXF1/NXT heterodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. NXT2 has two alternative splicing variants of transcripts encoding p15-2a and p15-2b proteins that differ in the first exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To date, the function of NXT2 variants has not been elucidated.</p><p>We previously generated cloned zebrafish from long-term cultured fibroblast cells infected with a retrovirus expressing GFP reporter gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We bred the GFP transgene to homozygosity and found that one of the cloned fish lines bore a recessive embryonic lethal mutation, suggesting that viral insertion is the cause of the cardiac defect. More interestingly, the mutant embryos have reduced circulation, cardiac edema and aberrant heart valve formation after three days of development. Sectioning of homozygous mutant embryos revealed that the ventricular wall is thinner and the space between the myocardium and endocardium is enlarged. Molecular analysis of these mutants revealed that <italic>NXT2 </italic>was disrupted by the viral insertion. Whole-mount RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization detected <italic>NXT2 </italic>expression in the heart as well as other tissues. RT-PCR analysis suggested that <italic>NXT2 </italic>has multiple alternative mRNA splicing forms and intriguingly, one of them is significantly reduced in mutant embryos. Morpholino knockdown of this specific splicing form reproduced the mutant phenotypes. Taken together, our data demonstrate that NXT2 has a critical role in the morphogenetic integrity of the embryonic heart in zebrafish, and provide the first functional study of NXT2 in a vertebrate animal species.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification and characterization of a cloned zebrafish exhibiting heart defects</title><p>Cloned zebrafish were obtained by nuclear transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] from long-term cultured cells that were infected with retrovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] containing a GFP reporter gene driven by the <italic>Xenopus ef1 alpha </italic>promoter. It has been shown that retroviral integration can cause mutations in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We therefore bred all of the cloned fish lines to homozygous for GFP to screen for abnormality. One of these lines exhibited specific heart defects. The mutant phenotype co-segregated with proviral GFP expression (n &#x0003e; 2000), suggesting that the heart defects were caused by disruption of a functional gene by retroviral insertion. The mutant embryos were first distinguishable from their wild-type siblings by slightly dilated heart, slow heart rate, circulation reduction and mild pericardial edema after 3 days of development (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). At this stage, cardiac function assays showed that the atrium and ventricle both contracted rhythmically in a normal atrio-venticular sequence. But, the heartbeat rates of mutants (134.3 &#x000b1; 11.1 per minute, n = 72) were statistically significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.01) slower than that of their wild-type siblings (154.7 &#x000b1; 8.7 per minute, n = 42) and the significant difference remained at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) (mutant 134 &#x000b1; 12.8 per minute, n = 37 <italic>vs </italic>wild type 169 &#x000b1; 4.7 per minute, n = 23; P &#x0003c; 0.01). Furthermore, while the wild-type embryos (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) develop a narrow heart with forward blood flow through the embryo, both cardiac chambers are dilated in the enlarged pericardial sac (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>) and blood cells regurgitated between ventricle and atrium, resulting in either pooling the blood cells in two heart chambers or peripheral veins of mutant embryos at 4&#x02013;5 dpf (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>). By 5 dpf, the mutant hearts are stretched to a long tubular structure (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Pericardial edema became prominent, circulation was completely terminated and severe edema appeared in the whole abdominal cavity, leading to necrosis in fin, muscle, skin and other tissues (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Characterization of NXT2 mutant phenotypes. At 3 dpf, NXT2 mutants show pericardial edema (compare B and G to wild-type embryos A and D). By 4 dpf, both atrium and ventricle of NXT2 mutants show significant dilation (compare H to wild-type embryo E) with pericardial sac enlargement (C and H). At 5 dpf, NXT2 mutant heart appears to be lacking atrioventricular boundary (F, arrow) and shows blood accumulation in both cardiac chambers in enlarged heart sac (F) and /or peripheral circulation (I, tail vessel) whereas the wild type heart with a normal atrioventricular boundary (arrow) resides in a narrowed cardiac sac (inset in F). Sections of wild-type (J) and NXT2 mutant (K) hearts at 4 dpf show that ventricular wall of NXT2 mutant embryos is thinner and a space separating myocardium and endocardium in atrium is visible. In addition, we often observed mutant embryos lacking valve structure (arrows).

To further investigate these possibilities, we analyzed histological sections of wild type and mutant embryos. Normally, by 2 dpf, the ventricular myocardial cells thicken and become the primary pumping force of the heart. We found that in 4 dpf mutant embryos, the ventricular wall remains thin and the space between myocardium and endocardium was diminished in the ventricle but enlarged in the atrium compared to that of wild type embryos (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>). In addition, we frequently observed mutant samples lacking cardiac valve structure. In 5 dpf mutant embryos, the ventricular wall remained thinner and cardiac chambers were severely dilated (data not shown). These data suggested that myocardial structures were disturbed in mutant embryos during early development.</p><p>Various heart chamber-specific gene expressions demarcate vertebrate heart compartments and play an important role in regulating critical steps of chamber formation. To understand whether the identified mutation affects formation of specific chambers and morphogenetic movements of dynamic cardiomyocycte, expression of chamber-specific genes including <italic>Vmhc, Amhc </italic>and <italic>Cmlc2 </italic>was examined. As shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L&#x02013;Q</xref>, no difference was detected in expressions of <italic>Amhc </italic>(L and O), <italic>Vmhc </italic>(M and P) and <italic>Cmlc2 </italic>(N and Q) between wild-type (L, M and N) and mutant (O, P and Q) embryos at 3 dpf (same results were obtained at 4 and 5 dpf, data not shown), suggesting that the mutated gene is not required for the initial chamber-specific differentiation of cardiomyocytes, in which <italic>Amhc, Cmlc2 </italic>and <italic>Vmhc </italic>play important roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in atrio-ventricular valve formation. In the zebrafish, this process begins at 33 hpf, when the myocardial cells at the atrio-ventricular boundary induce the adjacent endocardial cells to undergo EMT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. <italic>Bmp4 </italic>and <italic>versican (cspg2) </italic>are genes involved in cardiac valve formation. Coincidently, their cardiac expressions become restricted to the myocardial cells at the valve forming region at the same time as the formation of the prevalvular cushions, suggesting that they are thereby markers for the differentiation of the myocardial cells in the valve forming region and misexpression of these genes may indicate defects in valve formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> (R-W), expression of <italic>versican </italic>and <italic>bmp4 </italic>in mutant embryos (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1U, 1V</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1W</xref>) was broadly up-regulated and expanded throughout the two heart chambers at 3 dpf at which stage their expression should be restricted to the atrioventricular boundary as in wild-type embryos (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1R, S</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1T</xref>). Meanwhile, no difference of <italic>versican </italic>expression (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1S</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1V</xref>) was detected in the otoliths of developing ears in wild-type and mutant embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], suggesting that the abnormal <italic>versican </italic>expression pattern is due to heart defects observed in these mutant embryos other than general developmental delay.</p></sec><sec><title>NXT2 is responsible for heart defects</title><p>Of the 2000 analyzed mutated embryos, the heart defect always co-segregate with the proviral GFP expression, suggesting that the viral insertion causes the observed heart phenotypes. By analyzing the genomic DNA by Southern blot, we found that there is a single viral insertion in this fish line (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). A 1071 bp genomic sequence flanking the viral insertion was isolated by inverse PCR and used to search EST databases, leading to the identification of a candidate gene encoding a 143 amino acid protein that shares high homology with that of NXT1 and/or NXT2 from human, mouse, rat, <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. By comparing genomic structures of <italic>NXT1 </italic>and <italic>NXT2 </italic>genes from these species, we noticed that <italic>NXT1 </italic>was encoded by a single exon whereas <italic>NXT2 </italic>gene contains multiple exons, which is similar to our candidate gene (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Based on similarities in protein sequences (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) and genomic organizations, we concluded that our candidate gene represents a homolog of <italic>NXT2 </italic>rather than <italic>NXT1</italic>and named it <italic>zNXT2</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Identification of <italic>NXT2 </italic>as a candidate gene responsible for the heart defect. Southern blot analysis shows that a 4.3 kb (digested by Hpa I; A, lane 2) and a 3.8 kb (digested by Dra I; A, lane 3) are detectable using a specific viral DNA probe (B). Lanes 1 and 4 (A) are positive and negative control, respectively. DNA fragments corresponding to 3.8 kb / Dra I and 4.3 kb / Hpa I restriction were gel-purified and used for inverse PCR to isolate junction genomic sequences with primers described in (B) and Methods. This resulted in identification of NXT2 gene, which consists of five exons (C) and encodes 143 putative amino acids (D). The provirus is inserted within the first intron (red arrow) upstream of the putative initiation codon ATG in exon 2 (C). Alignments of protein sequences from various organisms revealed that zebrafish NXT2 shares 73.9%, 72.5%, 71.6%, 70.2%, 70.9%, 68.8%, 43.6% and 34.6% amino acid homology with that of rat NXT2, human NXT2, human NXT1, rat NXT1, mouse NXT1, <italic>Xenopus </italic>NXT1, <italic>Drosophila </italic>NXT1 and <italic>C. elegans </italic>NXT1, respectively (D).

Analysis of more than 500 embryos from multiple injected clutches showed that approximately 80% of injected embryos developed the same heart defects as that in the virus-induced mutant embryos (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;H</xref>), including pericardial edema, slightly dilated heart, slow heart rate and reduced circulation.

First, cardiac myosin light chain 2 (CMLC2) promoter driving GFP transgenic zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] embryos were used to determine development of two heart chambers. As shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, heart chambers of morpholino injected embryos at 3 dpf exhibited pericardial edema and dilated heart compared with that of wild-type embryos (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). In 4&#x02013;5 dpf morpholino injected embryos, cardiac chambers became abnormally stretched and relative positions of two chambers were abnormal (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>) whereas wild-type embryos had heart chambers in a narrowed pericardial sac (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). This finding is consistent with the previous results described based on viral insertional mutated embryos (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>We further examined endocardial morphology at the atrioventricular valve region using receptor tyrosine kinase <italic>flk-1 </italic>promoter driving RFP transgenic zebrafish embryos. Previously, tie-2 GFP transgenic zebrafish has been used to address this issue. Similar to <italic>tie-2</italic>, <italic>flk-1 </italic>also plays a crucial and unique role in endothelial cell differentiation and vascular morphogenesis, including vessels and heart endocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In uninjected wild-type embryos, endocardial cells cluster at the atrioventrivular boundary and form a ring shape structure at the valve forming region (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). However, more than 70% of the <italic>zNXT2a </italic>morpholino injected <italic>flk-1</italic>-RFP transgenic embryos (n = 129) failed to form this cluster (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4J</xref>), suggesting that <italic>zNXT2 </italic>is required for this early endocardial morphogenetic event. Together with RNA whole mount in situ data of <italic>bmp4 </italic>and <italic>versican</italic>, these results indicate that cardiomyocyte differentiation and thickening of the endocardium at the atrioventricular boundary in the mutant embryos were significantly impaired, resulting in abnormal valve formation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Ventricular myocardial thickening and atrioventricular valve are impaired by disruption of zNXT2a</title><p>In zebrafish, between 24 and 48 hpf, the linear heart tube gradually bends at the boundary of two chambers to create an S-shaped loop. Meanwhile, clustering of endocardial cells as a ring structure at the atrioventrocular boundary by 33&#x02013;37 hpf initiates the first step of the formation of cardiac valve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. While the heart is pumping, differentiation and morphogenesis continue, which includes remodeling of the cardiac valve to completion, finally building on a linear heart tube to produce an adult heart.</p><p>Sectioning of <italic>zNXT2a </italic>homozygous mutant embryos revealed that the ventricular wall is thinner as early as 3 dpf (data not shown, but see Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for 4 dpf data). Decreased cell proliferation and/or increased apoptosis may cause such a defect. Since the thinner myocardial wall appears very early during development we prefer a model that the under-developed ventricular wall is due to a deficiency in myocardial cell proliferation. Alternatively, this could result from abnormally tight intercalation of ventricular cells with the same numbers of cells in the mutant embryos as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In regard to the atrioventricular valve defect, it has been reported that endothelial shear stress (blood flow) plays a critical role in endocardial cushion by using special surgical experiments in zebrafish embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In contrast, other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] argued that reduction in myocardial function is primarily responsible for the defect in atrioventricular cushion development, which was observed in <italic>sih </italic>(no early heartbeat) and <italic>cfk </italic>(cardiac dilation and no early blood flow) mutant embryos. In <italic>zNXT2 </italic>mutant embryos, the earliest observable defects are reduced heart rate, dilated cardiac chambers and a thin ventricular myocardial wall. Heart morphology and chamber specification ascertained by expression of <italic>Amhc, Vmhc </italic>and <italic>Cmlc2 </italic>are all normal at this stage in mutant embryos (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, data not shown by 2 dpf). Later on from 3&#x02013;4 dpf, the atrioventricular valve was aberrant and the relative position of atrium and ventricle was perturbed, as revealed by sectioning analysis, expression of <italic>versican </italic>and <italic>bmp4 </italic>(Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and morpholino knockdown in CMLC2-GFP and flk-GFP transgenic embryos (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), respectively. Additionally, injection of a higher dose (approximately 10 ng per embryo) of <italic>zNXT2a </italic>morpholino into embryos causes defective endocardial cushion formation as early as 2 dpf, as illustrated by a failure of endocardial clustering at atrioventricular boundary (data not shown). This indicates that valve malformation resulted by interruption of <italic>zNXT2a </italic>might be either a primary defect or a defect due to disturbed function of chambers at later stage. In addition, our data implies that the mutant cardiac valve malformation is either an independent event or caused by lacking of myocardial cell proliferation or differentiation. The later situation will be consistent with the observation by Bartman et al (2004). Nonetheless, our findings establish that zNXT2 has a critical role in driving cardiac valve formation to final completion.</p></sec><sec><title>zNXT2a is the mRNA transcript variant responsible for heart defects</title><p>As in humans, <italic>zNXT2 </italic>has multiple alternative splicing mRNA transcripts with two distinct start sites (ATG and GTG) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). It is possible that different <italic>zNXT2 </italic>splicing variants are differentially expressed in different tissues. Moreover, <italic>zNXT2b </italic>starting from GTG may represent a major transcript because of its higher copy numbers in the amplified cDNA pools (11 out of 19 sequenced samples) whereas <italic>zNXT2a </italic>starting from ATG might be enriched in heart. The biological significance of such a variation in <italic>NXT2 </italic>transcription has not been addressed. Our studies demonstrated that the alternatively spliced transcripts might have specific functions in different tissues during embryonic development and organogenesis. Specifically, <italic>zNXT2a </italic>appears to be required for heart development in zebrafish. Viral insertion in the intron immediately upstream of the exon containing ATG caused specific knockdown of <italic>zNXT2a </italic>transcription in mutant embryos whereas other transcripts such as <italic>zNXT2b </italic>appear normal. Injection of a morpholino against <italic>zNXT2a </italic>can phenocopy heart defects, confirming that zNXT2a protein is the main factor required for zebrafish heart development. Furthermore, when the morpholino dose was increased, more injected embryos developed pericardial edema one day earlier than the insertional mutants of <italic>zNXT2 </italic>(data not shown). This suggests that our <italic>zNXT2a </italic>insertional mutant may be a hypomorphic allele due to insertion of the viral vector into a non-coding region of the locus. With morpholino data it is clear that <italic>zNXT2a </italic>is directly implicated in heart development that requires its sufficient expression activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear transport factors are implicated in tissue-specific biological functions</title><p>Nuclear protein or RNA transporting has previously been regarded as a general house keeping function for all biological systems. However, increasing evidence suggest that this can be a highly regulated process for specific biological functions with specific RNA targets. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, studies demonstrated that homolog of NTF2 (DNTF2) is required for nuclear translocation of the Rel proteins Dorsal, Dif and Relish into the nucleus. These three Rel proteins are activated in response to immune challenges and imported into the nucleus upon microbial challenges, which further induce and regulate transcriptions of anti-microbial peptides attacin, cecropin, defensin, metchnikowin, diptericin and drosomycin. Disruption of DNTF2 leads to impairment of nuclear import of the Rel proteins and thus immune response is impaired in NTF mutants compared with wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. NXF5, a member of the nuclear export factor NXF family, binds to RNAs as well as to NXT members for RNA nuclear export. In a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation, a nonfunctional NXF5 was identified, which is split by the breakpoint situated in the 5' UTR between exons 1 and 2 of <italic>NXF5</italic>. This suggests that interruption of the gene NXF5 might result in the disease phenotypes associated with syndromic mental retardation including short stature, general muscle wasting, and facial dysmorphism by deranging the export or transport of specific mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Formation of an NXT1 (or NXT2) and TAP (NXF1) heterodimer is critically required for mRNA export from the nucleus via TAP/NXT1 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Earlier experiments demonstrated that NXT1 is essential in Crm1-mediated nuclear export of proteins, in which NXT1 directly binds to export receptor Crm1 and RanGTP, and improves the release of cargos into the cytoplasm after translocation through the NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Very recently, it has been reported that CRM1 is involved in export of specific subsets of cellular RNAs, which include <italic>tra-2 </italic>mRNA participating in sex cell fate determination in <italic>C. elegans </italic>and <italic>IFN-a1 </italic>mRNA generated upon viral infection to human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, little is known about how their cofactor NXT1 (or NXT2) plays a role in a biological pathway. Our finding provides the first evidence that an alternative splicing form of nuclear transport factor NXT2 is specifically implicated in heart development of zebrafish. For future studies, identification of specific RNA targets and elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying NXT2-mediated exporting of these targets, either mRNA or micro RNA, in heart should be the focus. In addition, this study might provide the basis for some inheritable cardiac valve diseases in human. It should be a reasonable step to determine genetic linkage relationship between a NXT2 locus and defined cardiac diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrated that disruption of <italic>NXT2 </italic>gene, a member of NXT (nuclear export factor) family, is responsible for heart-specific defects in a mutant zebrafish generated by a retroviral insertion introduced into the genome by animal cloning technology. Our study suggests that NXT2 has critical roles required for myocardial cell differentiation and formation of cardiac valve at the atrioventricular boundary. Since NXT2 is highly conserved between fish and man it is conceivable that it may also play a role in mammalian heart development and might be involved in cardiac diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mutant identification and characterization</title><p>We initially obtained 14 cloned zebrafish lines by nuclear transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

For the first inverse PCR, genomic DNA from heterozygous mutant fish was restricted with Dra I. This generated an approximately 3.8 kb proviral-genome-containing genomic DNA fragment as revealed by Southern blot hybridization with a specific viral probe (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Using Geneclean III kit (Bio 101, Vista, California), a pool of genomic DNA containing this fragment was purified from the gel, then ligated into circular form and finally used as inverse PCR templates. Two sets of primers specific to viral -sequences were designed as follows:</p><p>HT1:5'-AATCCCGGACGAGCCCCCAAATGAAAGA-3' and HT3: 5'-ATAGAGTACGAGCCATAGTTAAAATAAA-3' (outer primers);</p><p>HP2: 5'-TTTCTTTGTTCCTGACCTTGATC-3' and 1 HP: 5'-AACCCCTCACTCGGCGCGCCAG-3' (inner primers). Templates were amplified for two rounds. The final PCR products were subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) for sequencing. The obtained sequence was used for designing new primers for additional inverse PCR. Similarly, heterozygous genomic DNA was also digested with Hpa I, which generated a 4.3 kb fragment containing retroviral genome and a flanking sequence for PCR amplifications. Again, two rounds of amplification were carried out for the second inverse PCR, in which a set of primers (HP2: 5'-TTTCTTTGTTCCTGACCTTGATC-3'; 2 HP: 5'- TCGTGGTCTCGCTGTTCCTTGG-3') against the retroviral LTR region was used to enrich for DNA templates. Then the second round of PCR amplification was performed from the enriched templates with another set of primers HP2 and F2 (5'-GTGCATGGATAAGAAAAGACGGGTAACG-3', which is against the zebrafish genomic sequence flanking the proviral insertional locus) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).
