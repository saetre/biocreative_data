Previous progress has been made towards delineating the VPF/VEGF survival signaling downstream of the activation of VEGFR-2. Here, we seek to define the function of NRP-1 in VPF/VEGF-induced survival signaling in EC and to elucidate the concomitant molecular signaling events that are pivotal for our understanding of the signaling of VPF/VEGF. Utilizing two different <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture systems and an <italic>in vivo</italic> zebrafish model, we demonstrate that NRP-1 mediates VPF/VEGF-induced EC survival independent of VEGFR-2. Furthermore, we show here a novel mechanism for NRP-1-specific control of the anti-apoptotic pathway in EC through involvement of the NRP-1-interacting protein (NIP/GIPC) in the activation of PI-3K/Akt and subsequent inactivation of p53 pathways and FoxOs, as well as activation of p21.

These observations suggest the possibility that NRP-1 may either interact with other signaling receptors or independently promote cell signaling.

From these data, we concluded that NRP-1/EGNP-1 mediates ligand-induced EC survival independent of VEGFR-2, and that its C-terminal three amino acids (SEA-COOH) are essential for this function.</p><p>We employed a reverse genetic strategy to explore the function of NRP-1 in EC survival in a zebrafish model. Previously, we cloned zebrafish NRP-1 genes (zNRP-1a/1b) and analyzed their expression patterns by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In the current study, to examine functions of NRP&#x02013;1 in zebrafish EC apoptosis, morpholinos are injected into a Fli-GFP transgenic fish line (TG(fli1:egfp)y1), where all of the ECs are labeled with GFP. Because of the transparency of zebrafish embryos, ECs can be observed in living embryos in fluorescent green. After that, the embryos were subjected to the TUNEL assay to detect apoptosis. The identity of the apoptotic cells is confirmed by using the red channel where EC should be labeled by Fli-GFP signal. The evaluation of apoptotic EC should consider the overlay of red signal and Fli-GFP green signal, and only red signal in EC location. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g001">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001161.s001">Figure S1</xref>, c, d, following knockdown of zebrafish NRP-1 by co-injecting NRP-1a/-1b splicing donor morpholinos (MO) into single-cell staged embryos, we found elevated levels of EC apoptosis compared with non MO injected or nucleotide exchange MO injection embryos. TUNEL-positive cells showed orange masses and were either rounded or shrunken (pycnotic). Furthermore, the specific EC apoptotic phenotype was suppressed by coinjection of human NRP-1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g001">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001161.s001">Figure S1</xref>, c, d). The ectopic expression of human NRP-1 in zebrafish efficiently blocked zebrafish NRP-1 knockdown-induced EC apoptosis, and the zebrafish showed normal vessels with established blood circulation (data not shown), and a normal EC phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g001">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001161.s001">Figure S1</xref>, c, d). In contrast, the human NRP&#x02013;1 mRNA lacking its three C-terminal amino acids (SEA-COOH) failed to block zebrafish NRP-1 knockdown-induced vessel defects, nor did it abrogate EC apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g001">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001161.s001">Figure S1</xref>, c, d).

Because our previous data showed that the C terminus of the RGS-GAIP (regulators of G-protein signaling-G&#x003b1; interacting protein)-interacting protein, GIPC (also called NRP-1 interacting protein, NIP) can function as an adaptor protein to interact with the C-terminal three amino acids of NRP-1 (SEA-COOH) through its PDZ domain, and can then convey the NRP-1 signal to regulate EC migration and zebrafish angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, we first sought to address the role of GIPC in NRP-1-mediated EC survival. For this purpose, we knocked down GIPC in HUVEC using RNA interference-mediated silencing. After identifying that GIPC siRNA specifically and effectively silenced the expression of GIPC, but not that of NRP-1 or VEGFR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g002">Figure 2a</xref>), we then carried out apoptosis assays in HUVEC transduced with EGNP-1. We found that silencing of GIPC resulted in an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in HUVEC and also had marked morphological effects on the EC, including cytoplasmic shrinkage and cell retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g002">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001161.s002">Figure S2a</xref>). To examine this result in more detail, we analyzed the percentage of apoptotic cells with flow cytometry. Indeed, we observed a notable difference in apoptosis between GIPC knock-down HUVECs and without GIPC knock-down HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). Necrotic/late-apoptotic and early apoptotic cells were significantly increased by increasing the amount of GIPC siRNA. These results were subsequently confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> in our zebrafish model. Zebrafish GIPC morpholinos (1.5ng and 4.5ng) were injected into TG(fli1:egfp) embryos at the 1-4-cell stage. This not only disturbed the formation of the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel (DLAV) and subintestinal vein (SIV) as described in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, but also resulted in a significant increase in EC apoptosis, as revealed by TUNEL staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001161.s002">Figure S2</xref>, b, c; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g002">Figure 2d</xref>). Additionally, circulation in the DLAV and SIV was diminished or blocked (data not shown). The body size was reduced as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g002">Figure 2d</xref>). These phenotypes resemble those from zNRP-1a/1b knockdown, which suggests that zGIPC is involved in the survival signaling pathway of NRP-1. Furthermore, we found that the GIPC-mediated EC apoptotic phenotype could be rescued with human GIPC mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001161.s002">Figure S2</xref>, b, c; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g002">Figure 2d</xref>), whereas coinjection of hGIPC&#x00394;PDZ mRNA with the zGIPC morpholino did not rescue the zebrafish GIPC knockdown-induced EC apoptotic phenotype. In summary, these results suggest that GIPC is involved in NRP-1-mediated EC apoptosis, and that the PDZ domain of GIPC plays an important role in this function, probably by interacting with the C-terminal domain of NRP-1 (SEA-COOH).</p><fig id="pone-0001161-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001161.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>GIPC is involved in NRP-1-mediated EC survival.</title><p>a.

Ekker (Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis) has shown that the off-target effects of MOs are mediated through p53-induced apoptosis. In this study, we found that knockdown of NRP-1a/-1b in zebrafish resulted in neural death phenotype and vessel defects, including EC apoptosis, suggesting that NRP-1 MOs may result in p53 activation. Alternatively, this may also suggest p53 is involved in NRP-1-mediated antiapoptotic effects. The latter seems more convincing in this study because we also observed that the morphant phenotypes from NRP-1 knockdown were rescued by human NRP-1 mRNA. It is quite likely that NRP-1 is specifically involved in cell death. For this purpose, Mdm2 MO and p53 MO co-injection embryos were used as controls. As we have shown previously, NRP-1 MOs induced vessel defects and EC apoptosis. In addition, we also observed tail and body axis, and neuron apoptosis (data not shown), that are very similar to the neural death phenotype induced by off-target effects of MOs. Interestingly, after co-injecting p53 MO with NRP-1a/-1b MOs, we found that knockdown of p53 mostly alleviated off-target neural death compared to the positive control, while the vessel defects by knockdown NRP-1 were also mostly rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g004">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001161.s004">Figure S4</xref>, a, b).

For these reasons, we sought to determine whether NRP-1's anti-apoptosis is associated with inactivation of caspases.

Western blot analysis showed the full length caspase-9 (47 kDa) and a cleaved fragment (37 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g004">Figure 4d</xref>). Following 30 minutes to 24 hours of stimulation with EGF in these cells, we found that the levels of cleaved caspase-9 decreased, as indicated by the concomitant increase of the pro-caspase band and the decreased formation of the p35 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g004">Figure 4d</xref>). Activated or cleaved caspase-3 (17 and 19 kDa) is crucial for the induction of apoptosis. After 24 hours serum starvation, pro-caspase-3 is proteolytically cleaved to generate a p19 signature fragment in EGNP-1-transduced HUVEC, but the cleavage level decreased following EGF stimulation (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g004">Figure 4d</xref>). In this study, cleavage of caspase-8 was not detected (data not shown). These results indicate that sustained activation of NRP-1 inhibits caspase-9, and consequently directly suppresses the cleavage of its preferred substrate, caspase-3, therefore may reduced EC apoptosis. Taken together, the above results confirm that the NRP-1-mediated EC anti-apoptotic affects occur through the axis inactivation of p53 and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Induction of p21 is involved in NRP-1-mediated EC survival</title><p>p53 is a transcription factor, and its loss results in changes in the expression of downstream target genes.

We used PAEC transfected with NRP-1 cDNA to examine the specific function of NRP-1. PAEC/NRP-1 was a generous gift of by Dr. Shay Soker (Molecular and Cell Biology, Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative medicine). Previously, Soker <italic>et al.</italic> established stable cell lines synthesizing neuropilin-1 (PAEC/NRP-1) and characterized VEGF165 binding to NRP-1 in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Soker3">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. PAEC were chosen for this study due to their lack of expression of any VPF/VEGF receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Downward1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. To explore the possibility that NRP-1 might transduce VPF/VEGF signaling alone, NRP-1 must be selectively activated, since VPF/VEGF receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are also expressed in EC. To do so, we used the chimeric receptor EGNP-1 by replacing the extracellular domains of NRP-1 with the N-terminal domain of EGFR. At &#x02264;80&#x00025; confluence, early passage HUVEC doesn't express EGFR, and therefore, the fusion receptor can be used to distinguish the signaling pathway that is mediated by NRP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Wang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This might seem to be scant evidence because NRP-1 might form a complex with VEGFR-2 through its intracellular domain. However, previously using EGNP-1, together with co-transducing HUVEC with EGDR mutants or blocking VEGFR-2 with an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody, we demonstrated that NRP-1 mediates HUVEC migration independent of VEGFR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Wang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that NRP-1 can indeed function independently of VEGFR-2 in VPF/VEGF signaling and supports our findings in this study. The current understanding of NRP-1 function is primarily based upon studies of its extracellular domain. However, the chimeric receptor EGNP-1, though it lacks the extracellular domain of NRP-1, has been shown to be involved in EC survival. This hints there may be a distinguishing pathway whereby NRP-1 mediates EC survival through its intracellular domain and is independent of VEGFR-2 signaling. Indeed, our published data have shown that the C-terminal three amino acids of NRP-1 (SEA-COOH) can interact with GIPC and are involved with NRP-1-mediated EC migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas we failed to identify VEGFR-2 in the complex of NRP-1 and GIPC (data not shown). These facts, together with the observation in the present study that the C-terminal three amino acids and GIPC are essential for NRP-1-mediated EC survival, support the existence of an independent signaling pathway for NRP-1-mediated VPF/VEGF function. Overall, these results indicate that NRP-1 can mediate VPF/VEGF-dependent EC survival as an independent receptor.</p><p>Our previous study demonstrated that GIPC functions as a key adaptor protein that is involved in NRP-1-mediated EC migration and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Wang2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, we found that knockdown of GIPC in this study suppresses NRP-1-mediated anti-apoptotic effects in HUVEC and increases EC apoptosis in the zebrafish model, suggesting that GIPC addresses the same signaling pathway as NRP-1 in NRP-1-mediated EC survival. Consequently, how GIPC conveys NRP-1 survival signaling in EC is obviously an important issue that should be targeted.</p><p>In this study, we found that the PI3K inhibitors Ly294002 and p85(DN), a dominant negative mutant of the p85 subunit, reduced levels of NRP-1/EGNP-1-dependent survival. These observations indicate that PI3K is involved in NRP-1-mediated EC survival signaling, which is consistent with the findings by Bachelder <italic>et al.</italic> that NRP-1 supported VPF/VEGF autocrine function and promoted breast carcinoma cell survival by stimulating the PI3K pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Bachelder1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Activation of PI3K phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate positively regulates Akt by binding to the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Kennedy1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In our experiments we found that Akt phosphorylation levels increased after EGF stimulation of EGNP-1-transduced HUVEC, and that such activation could be inhibited by the PI3K-specific inhibitor Ly294002 but not influenced by inhibiting VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. This confirms that NRP-1 survival signaling induces PI3K-dependent Akt phosphorylation. The ability of activated Akt to promote survival has been found in fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Parrizas1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> and heochromocytoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Kohn1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> and neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Dudek1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In accordance with these findings, we found that the kinase-inactive Akt mutant (Akt(DN)), that has been suggested to act in a dominant-negative manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Klippel1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, blocks NRP-1-mediated survival activity on EC. This finding constitutes the further demonstration of a role played by the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway in mediating a NRP-1 survival activity. Despite the additional information provided by the above results, how PI3K is activated in NRP-1 survival signaling still remains unknown. p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, contains two SH2 domains and a SH3 domain. The SH2 domain of p85 is responsible for interaction with phosphorylated tyrosine in the context of motif YXXM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Guo1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Raj1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. However, unlike VEGFR-2, the intracellular domain of NRP-1 lacks the YXXM motif. Since GIPC is a central adapter protein for NRP-1 signaling, it is tempting to speculate that GIPC may function as an adaptor molecule, mediating the activation of p85 by NRP-1, which is currently under investigation.</p><p>Given that a transformed approach might alter signaling pathways (Dr. Stephen C. Ekker, Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis), especially those that regulate cell survival, the involvement of p53 in regulating the apoptotic pathway suppressed by survival signals from NRP-1 was addressed more comprehensively by both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in this work. In the zebrafish model, EC apoptosis and vessel defects resulting from the loss of NRP-1 are recovered when p53 expression is downregulated. This suggests that p53 acts upon downstream components of a NRP-1 activation-induced survival cascade. The p53 pathway is composed of hundreds of genes and their products that respond to a wide variety of stress signals, including apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The former involves caspase cascade while the latter is mediated by p21. Decreased levels of p53 might suppress caspase cleavage and therefore downregulate apoptosis. Indeed, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data found that activating NRP-1 decreases the expression of p53, caspase-9 and caspase-3, which confirms our <italic>in vivo</italic> observations. Our findings that NRP-1-induced cell survival more directly affects caspase-9, then caspase-3, but not caspase-8 cleavage, also supports the concept that phospholipases may be primarily involved in the intrinsic (mitochondria-dependent) arm of the bifurcate pathways of apoptosis mediated by death receptors. In addition, the data shown here that p53 is the downstream signaling molecule of PI3K/Akt hints that Mdm2 may be another considerable signaling component in NRP-1 survival signaling in EC, thereby connecting connects PI3K to p53.</p><p>p21 was originally isolated as a p53-inducible protein and identified as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and thus thought to function as a critical regulator of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Gu1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Xiong1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a number of previous studies suggested that p21 levels were alternatively regulated by p53-independent mechanisms. Serum and other growth factors might be involved with the up-regulation of p21 levels in various cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Michieli1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Zeng1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. The activator of the PI3K pathway, EGF, increased p21 levels by increasing the half-lives of both transcript as well as protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Johannessen1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, the PI3K pathway was involved with the modulation of p21 levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Fukuchi1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Mitsuuchi1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Inhibitors of the PI3K pathway reduced the level of p21 in both cases. Moreover, recent investigations have clearly demonstrated that p21 also plays a role in allowing cell cycle transit as well as preventing apoptosis. Many late stage, rapidly proliferating tumors show a profound elevation in the levels of p21, which is counterintuitive in light of the proposed inhibition of cell cycle progression mediated by p21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Zhang1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Weiss1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. The pro-survival activity of p21 in cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents such as taxol also argues for a role for this protein in the protection of tumors <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Barboule1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Gorospe1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. The similar pro-survival effect is also observed in terminally differentiated cells such as myoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Lawlor1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>, hematopoietic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Cheng1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>, and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Asada1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. An exciting finding shown by Li <italic>et al.</italic>, indicated that Akt phosphorylation of p21 at sites <sup>145</sup> and Ser<sup>146</sup> resulted in increased p21 stability as well as enhanced glioblastoma cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Li1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, the results from our current study are consistent with these observations, confirming a crucial role for p21 as an anti-apoptotic protein, and also providing evidence that p21 levels can be regulated directly by PI3K/Akt. In addition, the elevated levels of p21 may also partly result from activated PI3K/Akt-induced caspase-3 inactivation, which reduces caspase-3-mediated p21 cleavage. This is consistent with a previous study that caspase-3-mediated cleavage of p21 during the apoptotic process sends growth-arrested cells to apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Zhang2">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>. While this novel role of p21 is evolving, a recent study revealed that p21 blocks irradiation-induced apoptosis downstream of mitochondria by inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated caspase-9 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Sohn1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the mechanisms by which p21 interferes with the death machinery are still largely unknown, however, this remains our current focus.</p><p>FoxO transcription factors are key regulators of cell fate. The mammalian FoxO family of transcription factors FoxO1, FoxO3a, and FoXO4 are major substrates of the protein kinases PKB (Akt). Activation of the PI3K pathway blocks the function of all 3 FoxO members by Akt-dependent phosphorylation of three conserved residues, which relay PI3K signals to target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-You1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Potente2">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this study, we found that NRP-1 induced the rapid phosphorylation of FoxO1 and FoxO3a and was mediated by activated PI3K/Akt. These data suggest a requirement for FoxO1 and FoxO3a inactivation during NRP-1-induced EC survival and are consistent with previous studies into the roles of FoxO1 and FoxO3 in the induction of cell apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Nakae1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001161-Sunters1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>.

Based upon these findings, we proposed the working model in detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001161-g007">Figure 7</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0001161-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001161.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>The working model of NRP-1-mediated EC survival.</title><p>NRP-1 mediates VPF/VEGF-induced EC survival effects in EC by connecting NRP-1 and GIPC to activation of PI3k/Akt and subsequent inactivation of p53 pathways and FoxOs, as well as activation of p21.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001161.g007"/></fig><p>What is emerging from this study, also in the light of reports from our previous studies and others, is that NRP-1 can function alone to mediate VPF/VEGF signaling. The consistency of our results supports the two current hypotheses for NRP-1 function in VPF/VEGF signaling in EC: either that NRP-1 is involved in VPF/VEGF-induced EC function by acting as a VEGFR-2 co-receptor, or alternatively, as a functional receptor alone. Not only this, recognizing the mechanistic aspects of coreceptor-based or single receptor&#x02013;based signaling ligand guidance cues may have implications for other ligand guidance and complicated receptor-mediated events which form the basis of key biological functions. In addition, the multiple pathways involved in NRP-1-mediated VEGF survival signaling indicate a degree of complexity that is paralleled by the emerging complexity of interaction between VEGF ligands and their receptors, and the downstream signaling pathways they mediate.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, both the VEGFR-2 signal alone, as well as NRP-1 acting in concert with VEGFR-2, are involved in VPF/VEGF-induced EC survival <italic>in vivo</italic>. As a consequence, NRP-1 signaling alone only partly determines EC fate. This implies that an understanding of the role of NRP-1 only provides part of the picture of VPF/VEGF survival signaling.
