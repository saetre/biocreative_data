It is known that IRF7 and the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are highly expressed in EBV type III latency cells, and LMP1 induces mRNA expression of IRF7. In this study, the expression pattern of endogenous IRF7 was observed in several B cell lines with or without EBV infection by immunofluorescence staining. IRF7 was localized in the cytoplasm of EBV-negative B cells and EBV type I latency B cell lines. However, IRF7 was located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of EBV type III latency cell lines. In the Jijoye cell (type III latency cell), IRF7 was colocalized with LMP1 in the cytoplasm in a capping configuration, and their interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of LMP1 and IRF7. This colocalization was confirmed by co-transfection of IRF7 and LMP1 plasmids in EBV-negative B cells. These results suggest that the IRF7 and LMP1 interact with each other, and this may relate to the mechanism whereby LMP1 exerts functional effects in B-lymphocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Interferon Regulatory Factor-7</kwd><kwd>Epstein-Barr Virus</kwd><kwd>Herpesvirus 4, Human</kwd><kwd>Latent Membrane Protein 1</kwd><kwd>EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immortalizes human B-lymphocytes in vitro; and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of the EBV is essential for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). LMP1 is a membrane protein composed of a short cytoplasmic amino-terminus linked to a transmembrane domain, with six membrane-spanning segments connected with short turns, and a long cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The six transmembrane domains of LMP1 play an important role for the aggregation of LMP1 and in forming a patch, which is essential for the activation of the signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). LMP1 associates with vimentin and other cellular proteins, forming a patch in the lymphocyte plasma membrane. LMP1 also colocalizes with the LMP2A protein of EBV, which recruits cellular protein tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Biological effects of LMP1, such as induction of several cellular genes, are mediated by the activation of several signaling pathway, such as NF-&#x003ba;B, p38/MAPK, Jak/STAT, JNK/AP-1, PI3K/Akt etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are a growing family of transcriptional factors that share homology within the amino-terminal DNA binding domain (115 amino acids) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). They are implicated in several biological processes, such as antiviral defense, cytokine signaling, cell growth, differentiation, oncogenesis and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Two members of IRF family, IRF3 and IRF7, are considered to be important factors for the expression of type I interferon (IFN) genes following viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). IRF3 is constitutively expressed in a variety of cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), but IRF7 is expressed predominantly in lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). IRF7 locates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus after virus infection, via phosphorylation by IKK&#x003b5;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Recently, it was found that IRF7 and LMP1 induce each other within a regulatory circuit and IRF5 brakes the IRF7/LMP1 circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). IRF7 can induce expression of LMP1 by binding to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) of the LMP1 promoter, but the mechanism of induction and phosphorylation of IRF7 by LMP1 was unknown yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). LMP1 protein is a membranes protein and LMP1 cannot bind to the IRF7 promoter directly. Therefore, the interaction between LMP1 and IRF7 or other mediators might need for the regulation of IRF7 expression by LMP1.</p><p>Thus, this study was designed to determine the localization of endogenous IRF7 and the physical interaction of IRF7 with LMP1 in B lymphoblastoid cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>All the cell lines used in this experiment were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Gibco-BRL, CA, U.S.A.).

It is predominantly expressed in cells of lymphoid origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). IRF7 was first identified as a repressor of the <italic>Bam</italic> HI Q promoter (Qp) of EBV, which is used for the transcription of the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) mRNA in type I latency cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). It is known that IRF7 and IRF3 are important for the induction of type I IFN gene expression following viral infection, and that IRF7 gene expression is induced by both type I IFN and by viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). As with IRF3, it is considered that the un-phosphorylated IRF7 (inactive form) locates in the cell cytoplasm and the phosphorylated IRF7 (active form) translocates to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, another report suggests that un-phosphorylated IRF7 is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In all of these previous experiments, the over-expression systems of IRF7 fusion proteins were used for the localization of IRF7. As mentioned in a recent paper concerning the half-life of IRF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), there is a possibility that over-expressed IRF7 fusion proteins might differ from endogenous IRF7.</p><p>To confirm the localization of endogenous IRF7, we applied immunofluorescent staining to several B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. There are two visual patterns of endogenous IRF7, one of tiny spots within a large granule located in the cytoplasm near the nuclear indentation, and the other of scattered granules in the nucleus with clumps in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The former pattern was found in EBV-negative and type I latency B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and is considered to represent an inactive state of IRF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). The latter pattern was found in type III cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, F</xref>) and considered to represent an active state of IRF7.</p><p>The expression of IRF7 protein was very low in EBV-negative and type I latency B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref>), but it was high in the Sav III cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These results are in agreement with a previous Western blot results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In Jijoye a type III latency cell line, both of these patterns were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E, F</xref>), and Raji (a type III latency lymphoblastoid cell line) also showed two patterns of IRF7 similar to those found in Jijoye cells (data not shown). There was evidence that LMP1 and IRF7 have a strong relationship in EBV-positive B cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In type I latency, LMP1 is not expressed and IRF7 expression is very low, but the expression of both LMP1 and IRF7 are high in type III latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). It is interesting that even though LMP1 protein is highly expressed in Sav III and Jijoye cell lines in Western blot, there are two patterns of IRF7 expression in Jijoye cells when detected by immunofluorescence staining. Liebowitz et al. reported that about 2% of the Jijoye cells showed evidence of early or late viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Therefore, some of Jijoye cells are not actually type III latency cells and they do not express LMP1. Not only Jijoye, we found that some of Sav III and Raji cells also did not express LMP1 in immunofluorescence staining (data not shown). Cell proliferation also influenced to the EBV replication and interferons also regulate the expression of interferon regulatory factor 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Those viral or cellular factors may be involved in the induction and/or activation of IRF7 protein. Further experiments will be necessary to confirm which additional factors are involved in the regulation of IRF7.</p><p>In double immunofluorescence staining, colocalization of LMP1 and IRF7 was detected in the cytoplasm of Jijoye cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and interaction was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The functional diversity of such a transcriptional factor is dependent on its modification, such as by phosphorylation and/or interactions with other transcriptional factors that are co-expressed and/or activated in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). LMP2A also colocalizes in the LMP1 patch, and LMP2A recruits several cellular kinases, which are involved in the B cell signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). LMP1 and IRF7 over-expression in EBV negative DG75 cells showed that they interacted physically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The reason why the LMP1 detected in the second lane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> upper panel) is may be that over-expressed LMP1 interacts with endogenous IRF7.</p><p>These results suggest that interaction between LMP1 and IRF7 may be necessary for the signal transduction pathway of LMP1 and/or IRF7. Further experiments will be needed in order to provide additional details about the relationship between LMP1 and IRF7 in the signaling pathway of Epstein-Barr virus infected B-lymphocytes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by Dr. Joseph S.
