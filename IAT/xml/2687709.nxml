In addition to being important in antimicrobial defense, it induces chemotaxis, stimulates angiogenesis and promotes tissue repair. We previously showed that human breast cancer cells express high amounts of hCAP18, and hypothesised that hCAP18/LL-37 may be involved in tumour progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><italic>hCAP18 </italic>mRNA was quantified in 109 primary breast cancers and compared with clinical findings and <italic>ERBB2 </italic>mRNA expression. Effects of exogenous LL-37 and transgenic overexpression of hCAP18 on ErbB2 signalling were investigated by immunoblotting using extracts from breast cancer cell lines ZR75-1 and derivatives of MCF7.

Treatment with LL-37 peptide significantly stimulated the migration of breast cancer cells and their colonies acquired a dispersed morphology indicative of increased metastatic potential. A truncated version of LL-37 competitively inhibited LL-37 induced MAPK phosphorylation and significantly reduced the number of altered cancer cell colonies induced by LL-37 as well as suppressed their migration. Transgenic overexpression of hCAP18 in a low malignant breast cancer cell line promoted the development of metastases in SCID mice, and analysis of hCAP18 transgenic tumours showed enhanced activation of MAPK signalling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results provide evidence that hCAP18/LL-37 contributes to breast cancer metastasis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The human cathelicidin antimicrobial protein hCAP18 is the single human member of the mammalian cathelicidin family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The holoprotein consists of a conserved prodomain, cathelin and the non-conserved C-terminal peptide LL-37, which is enzymatically cleaved after secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with a role in the first line of defense, hCAP18/LL-37 is widely expressed in leucocytes and in epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although initially identified purely as an antimicrobial protein, hCAP18/LL-37 is multifunctional with diverse and significant effects on eukaryotic cells. Thus, LL-37 transactivates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inducing cytokine release and cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and stimulates chemotaxis and angiogenesis through the G-protein coupled receptor, the formyl peptide receptor like-1 (FPRL-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In line with these findings, current research indicates that hCAP18/LL-37 is actively involved in tissue repair and wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] processes that share fundamental biological features with tumour growth and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Antimicrobial proteins, including hCAP18/LL-37, have primarily been proposed as potential anti-tumour agents based on their cytotoxic effects at high concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, in a previous study comprising 28 breast cancer samples, we reported that hCAP18/LL-37 was upregulated in breast cancer cells with a correlation between hCAP18 protein levels and tumour grade, whereas in normal mammary tissue it was produced at a low level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We also found that treatment with LL-37 peptide stimulated the proliferation of epithelial cells suggesting that LL-37 may act as a growth factor. Recent findings in lung and ovarian cancer show that overexpression of hCAP18/LL-37 also occurs in other cancer forms and may promote tumour growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Based on our previous study, we were prompted to further explore the role of hCAP18/LL-37 in breast cancer. Here we report the coexpression of <italic>hCAP18 </italic>and <italic>ERBB2 </italic>in breast tumours and their functional cooperation <italic>in vitro </italic>and in a mouse model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and samples</title><p>Breast cancer samples were collected consecutively from patients treated at Danderyd's Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden between 1994 and 1998 (n = 145). Thirty-six samples were excluded due to lack of information about oestrogen receptor (ER) status, lymph node status and/or RNA. The remaining 109 tumours were scored following established guidelines, and ER status was assessed on routinely processed paraffin sections. Healthy breast tissue was obtained from patients undergoing reconstructive surgery (n = 4). The study was approved by the regional committees of ethics and informed consent was obtained from patients and controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression analysis of tumour RNA</title><p>RNA from human breast cancers was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and from mouse tumours with a column-based extraction kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Random primed reverse transcription and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis for <italic>hCAP18 </italic>were performed as previously described, using 18S RNA for normalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>ERBB2 </italic>transcription was quantified using an Assay-on-Demand mixture (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Levels of <italic>hCAP18 </italic>were compared with respect to lymph node and ER status by means of analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between <italic>hCAP18 </italic>and <italic>ERBB2</italic>. All analyses were performed on logarithmically transformed data using the Statistical Analysis System package, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). For quantitative evaluation of cell colonies grown in agar, experiments using eight plates for each condition were arranged in a factorial design and the resulting data analysed by ANOVA with the significance level set to &#x003b1; = 0.05. For statistical evaluation of cell migration and mouse tumours and the occurrence of metastases, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>ZR75-1 and MCF7 were obtained from ATCC (via LGC Promochem, Boras, Sweden). The cell line MJ1105 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], derived from MCF7 cells, was kindly provided by Mikala Egeblad, UCLA, San Francisco, USA. Cells were stably transfected with a vector for bicystronic expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and hCAP18 (cell line named MJ1105-hCAP) or with the empty eGFP-control (cell line named MJ1105-eGFP), selected by growing in OptiMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and G418 (400 &#x003bc;g/ml), enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) selection for eGFP expression and maintained as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Synthetic peptides</title><p>LL-37, LL-25 and scrambled peptide were synthesised and purified by HPLC to a purity of 98% (Polypeptide Laboratories Hiller&#x000f6;d, Denmark, and GeneCust, Dudelange, Luxembourg). The biological activity of LL-37 was confirmed in an antibacterial assay (not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Mitogen-activated protein kinase activation assay</title><p>All experiments were performed on at least two independent occasions. ZR75-1 cells or MJ1105 derivatives were plated in 12-well plates at 100,000 cells per well, and starved for 48 hours in DMEM without FCS. Cells were stimulated with LL-37 and/or Heregulin &#x003b2;3 (HRG) recombinant protein (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY, USA). HRG was used at 2 ng/ml to optimise detection of synergism between HRG and LL-37. The inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I, PD153035, GM6001, H89, PP2 (all Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), N-acetylcystein, Tiron and pertussis toxin (all Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), and WRW4 (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA, USA) were applied at the indicated concentrations 30 minutes before stimulation with LL-37 and/or HRG. Cells were washed 20 minutes after stimulation with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM sodium fluoride, 100 &#x003bc;M sodium orthovanadate and 2 mM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, and immediately lysed with sodium dodecylsulfate lysis buffer containing the respective inhibitor plus 50 mM dithiothreitol.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein detection</title><p>Western blot analysis was essentially performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], using antibodies against phosphorylated and total protein mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, LA, USA), phosphorylated and total protein ERBB2 (Upstate, Lake Placid. NY, USA), and hCAP18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], all at 1/2000 dilution. Enhanced chemiluminescence signals (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were captured by a charge-coupled device camera (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) using Image Gauge (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) for evaluation. Linearity of the signal within the range of our experiments was confirmed using a serial dilution. For normalisation, the Ponceau staining of the blot was scanned and the digitised picture evaluated with the same software. The linear portion of the signal was determined to occur between 5 and 100 &#x003bc;g of total protein extract, therefore about 20 &#x003bc;g was routinely applied.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry on cryostat sections from snap-frozen tumours was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] with affinity purified rabbit anti-LL-37 antibodies at 1/6000 dilution. The presence of breast cancer cells in all tumours and metastases was verified by immunohistochemistry with anti-human leucocyte antigen (HLA) A/C antibodies (Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA) at 1/40,000 dilution.</p></sec><sec><title>Colony formation assay</title><p>One thousand cells (MJ 1105 or ZR75-1) were suspended in 2 ml of 0.35% melted agar in OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA. USA) with 5% FCS plus LL-37/HRG, and plated in 50 mm gridded dishes containing a solidified layer of 0.7% agar in the same medium. After 12 days, the top layer of the culture was stained with 0.2% p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Colonies within a grid of 10 &#x000d7; 10 that were larger than 100 &#x003bc;M in diameter (about 200 colonies/plate) were counted and their morphology categorised. All evaluations were performed in a blinded manner. The experiments were independently performed three times.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell migration assays</title><p>The Boyden chamber migration assays were carried out in the presence or absence of LL-37 and/or LL-25. Briefly, cells were serum starved for four hours in 0.2% BSA containing &#x003b1;-MEM medium. Cells were then trypsinised, harvested and resuspended in serum-free &#x003b1;-MEM medium. Chemotactic activity was determined in a Boyden chamber system (Neuroprobe Inc, Gaithersburg, MD., USA) with a 8 &#x003bc;m pore size polycarbonate membrane (Neuroprobe Inc, Gaithersburg, MD., USA) separating the two chambers. Serum-free &#x003b1;-MEM alone or with LL-37 and/or LL-25 was added to the lower chamber with final concentrations of 2 &#x003bc;M and 1 &#x003bc;M, respectively. Cells were loaded to the upper chamber at a concentration of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells in 500 &#x003bc;l of serum-free &#x003b1;-MEM. Chambers were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for five hours in a 95% air, 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. The upper medium was then removed, the chamber was disassembled and membranes were fixed in 96% methanol for two minutes. The membranes were rinsed in distilled water and subsequently stained in Giemsa for two minutes, followed by two washing steps. Then, the cells on the upper side of the filters were cleaned off. Cells in the filter were counted under a microscope at a magnification of 20. To allow for comparison between multiple assays, the data were normalised and expressed as migration rate of the cells compared with the control chamber.</p></sec><sec><title>Tumorigenicity studies in SCID mice</title><p>The study was approved by the Animal Assurance Agency R5002-01 (ethical permits N421/04 and N235/05). MJ1105-hCAP18 and MJ1105-eGFP cells were trypsinised and suspended in PBS/1 mM magnesium chloride at 50 million/ml. Ten million cells (200 &#x003bc;l) were injected subcutaneously into the mouse. These cells require oestrogen for tumour formation, so slow-release 17-&#x003b2; oestradiol pellets (1.7 mg total dose; Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) were implanted the day before tumour cell injection. The test group injected with the hCAP18 transgenic cell line and the group injected with the control cell line each consisted of five mice. Mice were observed daily and palpated for tumour formation twice a week. Mice were sacrificed when the tumour reached about 1 cm<sup>3 </sup>in size. Tumours were excised and snap frozen, and used for immunohistochemistry, protein and RNA extraction as described. For detection of metastasising cells, spleen and liver were disaggregated to single cell suspensions, and after lysis of erythrocytes with 0.17% ammonium chloride and removal of debris by centrifugation, analysed for the presence of eGFP expressing cells by FACS analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>hCAP18 expression correlates with the expression of ERBB2 and is associated with lymph node metastasis in estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer</title><p>Previously we have shown that <italic>hCAP18 </italic>mRNA and protein are overexpressed in human breast cancer samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To explore its possible association with tumour development, we investigated <italic>hCAP18 </italic>mRNA levels in an extended panel of human breast cancer samples (n = 109). Results of quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that the average level of <italic>hCAP18 </italic>mRNA expression was at least one order of magnitude higher in breast cancer tissues in comparison with normal breast tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a,b</xref>). Of note, only eight out of the 109 tumours expressed <italic>hCAP18 </italic>within the low range of control samples and none of these tumours had lymph node metastases at the time of surgery [see additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Stratifying the patient material based on ER expression, and the presence of lymph node metastasis we found that <italic>hCAP18 </italic>expression was significantly higher (p &#x0003c; 0.001) in ER-positive tumours (n = 38) with lymph node metastases than in tumours without lymph node metastasis (n = 42) associating the expression of <italic>hCAP18 </italic>with metastasis formation in breast cancer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Although the expression of <italic>hCAP18 </italic>was significantly greater in ER-negative tumours compared with control tissues, there was no clear association with lymph node metastasis at the time of primary surgery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>).

The low expression of ERBB2 remained unchanged [see additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>], so we further investigated whether LL-37 had a functional influence on ERBB2. And because LL-37 is reported to induce phosphorylation of MAPK via the EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we assessed its effect on signaling through ErbB2 using recombinant HRG as positive control. The experiments were carried out in MJ1105 and in the ER-positive breast cancer line ZR75-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Both LL-37 and HRG induced phosphorylation of ERBB2 and MAPK in both cell lines (shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> for ZR75-1). When LL-37 and HRG were added together, a synergistic increase in MAPK phosphorylation was observed.

For LL-37, a micromolar concentration was required to achieve significant synergistic activity (data not shown).

The activation of MAPK induced by LL-37 on its own was maintained, but the synergistic effect seen with both substrates was lost in the presence of PD153035 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). At 20 nM, a concentration sufficient to completely block the EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], PD153035 only caused a slight inhibition.

The activation of EGFR by LL-37 was previously demonstrated to involve the release of heparin-bound EGF by metalloproteases that were blocked with the inhibitor GM6001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Neither of these alternatives, however, seemed responsible for our findings, since the effect of LL-37 both in absence and presence of HRG was unaffected by pertussis toxin or GM6001 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). We also used the WRW4, an antagonist of LL-37 at the G-protein coupled receptor FPRL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and inhibitors against PKA, PKC and c-src, which can perform a crosstalk between ERBB2 and a G-protein coupled receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In addition we tested inhibitors against reactive oxygen species, which can influence tumourigenicity by activating EGFR-related pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The synergistic effect between LL-37 and HRG on the level of activated MAPK was unaffected by these treatments [see additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>].</p><p>LL-25, a synthetic derivative of LL-37, lacking the 12 C-terminal amino acids, had a minimally stimulatory effect on the phosphorylation of MAPK on its own (not shown), but strongly inhibited the effects induced by LL-37 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). The inhibition was dependent on the LL-37/LL-25 molar ratio, and not on the absolute concentration of LL-25, suggesting that LL-25 serves as a competitive inhibitor of LL-37. A scrambled version of LL-37 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] was without activity (not shown), confirming the specificity of LL-37 in our experiments.</p><p>MJ1105 cells showed a similar behaviour in this assay. However, the response to HRG was strongly elevated when hCAP18 was overexpressed from a transgene, indicating that transgenic expression partially replaced the exogenous addition from LL-37 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>LL-37 alters anchorage independent growth morphology of breast cancer cells</title><p>To investigate whether LL-37 influences tumour cell behaviour, we studied the effect of LL-37 on colony formation of MJ1105, with or without transgenic <italic>hCAP18 </italic>expression, and ZR75-1 in soft agar. LL-37 in the presence or absence of HRG did not significantly affect the number of colonies, but profoundly affected their morphology irrespective of the cell line. In the presence of LL-37, colonies became less compact and were surrounded by satellites (shown for MJ1105 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This observation shows that LL-37 impacts the growth pattern of breast cancer cells and suggests that LL-37 promotes a migratory cell phenotype. The addition of 1 &#x003bc;M LL-25, which was sufficient to substantially inhibit the LL-37-induced MAPK phosphorylation, significantly reduced the number of dispersed colonies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The three cell lines behaved similarly [see additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>].

In the mouse, however, we observed a significant difference between transgenic and control cells in metastasis formation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.) Four out of five mice injected with the hCAP18-overexpressing breast cancer cells developed metastases, three of them in multiple forms and/or loci (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Metastases were detected in lymph nodes, abdominal tumours, ascites fluid and EGFP-expressing MJ1105-hCAP18 cells in spleen and liver (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In contrast, only one lymph node metastasis was detected in one of the mice injected with the control cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), and this was located on the same side as the primary tumour. The presence of human breast cancer cells in all tumours and metastases was verified by detecting the expression of eGFP fluorescent marker in the ascites fluid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>), and by immunohistochemistry with anti-HLA-ABC antibodies (not shown) on the solid tumours.</p><p>High expression of <italic>hCAP18 </italic>in all primary and secondary tumours of test mice injected with MJ1105 hCAP was verified by RT-PCR and confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref> and additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Some tumour regions stained weakly, even with HLA staining (not shown), indicating infiltration by mouse cells. Interestingly, in primary tumours from the control cell line, RT-PCR analysis of <italic>hCAP18 </italic>mRNA showed a two-fold elevation compared with the expression in cell culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Immunohistochemistry revealed that hCAP18 was produced in small foci within all primary control tumours, thus confirming that spontaneous, local upregulation of hCAP18 occurred in these tumours <italic>in vivo </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). No alteration of the <italic>ERBB2 </italic>transcription level, compared with the parental cell lines, was detected in control or test samples [see additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>].</p><p>Western blot analysis revealed significant differences between primary tumours in test and control mice.

In the transgenic tumours, a decrease of phosphorylated p185 ERBB2 was found (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>) whereas a band of 65 kDa was increased in intensity, indicative of ERBB2 degradation. An additional blot using antibodies against total ERBB2 showed the same image and thus confirmed that the bands indeed were derived from ERBB2 (not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Expanding from our previous findings, we demonstrate that <italic>hCAP18 </italic>is highly expressed in breast cancer. Only few tumours expressed <italic>hCAP18 </italic>mRNA within the range of control samples, and none of these showed evidence of metastases. Stratifying the material we found that in the ER-positive tumours, but not in ER-negative tumours, the level of hCAP18 expression was significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastasis. ER positivity is reported to be associated with more benign disease, so our findings may seem contradictory. However, breast cancer biology and heterogeneity remain insufficiently understood and still today, no single marker has been identified that will consistently predict prognosis. In fact, microarray studies have demonstrated that ER-positive tumours are a highly heterogeneous group, and that the overall favourable prognosis attributed to ER-positive status proved valid for a subgroup of tumours, whereas another group of ER-positive tumours was associated with poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Of particular interest in this context is the recent identification of a 'wound response signature' that from established biomarkers such as tumour grade, lymph node status and ER-status, was shown to independently predict prognosis in breast cancer with significantly higher accuracy than established risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Specifically, it was shown that the expression of such a wound signature in breast tumours significantly affected metastasis potential and reduced survival. Considering that LL-37 is emerging as an integral part of the innate reaction to wounding, being rapidly and strongly upregulated in response to injury and also involved in the healing process, it can be hypothesised that similar cellular programs are at play in cancer progression.</p><p>Gene amplification and protein overexpression of the tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB2 is considered a hallmark of metastatic development and poor outcome in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Our data demonstrate a significant correlation between the transcription levels of <italic>hCAP18 </italic>and <italic>ERBB2 </italic>genes in ER-positive as well as in ER-negative tumours. Despite this, there was no correlation for <italic>hCAP18 </italic>or <italic>ERBB2 </italic>expression and survival at five-year follow-up in any of the groups, again underscoring the limitations using single transcription markers in predicting disease outcome.</p><p>The control breast cancer cells used for the mouse study have only marginal expression of hCAP18 when grown <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, after forming primary tumours at the site of cell injection, we detected a focal upregulation of hCAP18 mRNA and protein in all mouse control tumours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). This phenomenon supports the notion that upregulation of hCAP18 is a common event during breast cancer development, in agreement with our findings in the clinical samples. Recently LL-37 was shown to stabilise the Hypoxia-Inducible factor alpha, and consequently upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor, in human keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], thus linking LL-37 to hypoxia similar to its porcine counterpart PR39 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, one can hypothesise that hypoxia may be the biological basis for the upregulation of hCAP18/LL-37 that we observed in the mouse tumours.</p><p>Although our studies show that hCAP18/LL-37 synergistically enhances ERBB kinase signalling, the mechanism remains unknown. By the use of specific inhibitors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), we excluded the previously reported mechanisms of LL-37, that is the release of EGF-like factors through activation of metalloproteases and/or pertussis toxin sensitive activation of G proteins. Based on similar studies on lung cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and in line with structural studies on LL-37 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], it was suggested that LL-37 causes its effects by electrostatic interactions with the cell membrane rather than with a receptor. In our study, we have identified a truncated N-terminal peptide, LL-25, that acts as a potent inhibitor of both LL-37 signalling and of LL-37-induced migration and alteration of cancer cell colony morphology. We find it difficult to understand how a fragment of LL-37 would inhibit membrane interactions, and favour the hypothesis that LL-37 interacts with ERBB kinases via a yet unidentified receptor. Still, a direct effect of LL-37 on the ERBB receptors cannot be excluded. Whatever the mechanism, the fact that the effects of LL-37 can be inhibited opens up the possibility of therapeutic targeting.</p><p>The results from the colony formation and migration assays confirm that LL-37 expression contributes to metastases, as hypothesised on the basis of our findings in the clinical samples. The soft agar growth pattern is indicative of cellular behaviour and the profound phenotypic changes induced by LL-37 peptide treatment, most likely reflect an enhanced migratory and invasive capacity in these cells. The colony morphology induced by LL-37 was strikingly similar to the growth pattern reported for a melanoma cell line exposed to EGF-like peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and for mammary epithelial cells overexpressing ERBB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], which was hypothesised to mirror an increased metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The 2 &#x003bc;M concentration of LL-37 used in this experiment is well below cytotoxic levels and was previously shown to stimulate cell proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast, to what was recently reported for lung cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], we did not detect significant differences in the number of colonies after treatment with LL-37 which may be due to underlying biological differences between the cancer cell types utilised in these experiments. It should be highlighted that our analysis on breast tumour samples is presently the only one to show a correlation of <italic>hCAP18 </italic>expression with a particular tumour cell phenotype, still pending study in other tumour types.</p><p>In accordance with the findings in the clinical studies and in the <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments, we found a significant increase in metastases in the SCID mice injected with the <italic>hCAP18 </italic>transgenic cell line. Not only did we detect lymph node metastases but also distant metastases indicative of lymphatic as well as haematic spread of tumour cells. The control breast cancer cells used for the mouse study have only marginal expression of hCAP18 when grown <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, after forming primary tumours at the site of cell injection, we detected a focal upregulation of hCAP18 mRNA and protein in all mouse control tumours indicating that local upregulation of hCAP18 occurred when these tumours formed <italic>in vivo </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). This phenomenon supports the notion that upregulation of hCAP18 is a common event during breast cancer development, in agreement with our findings in the clinical samples.</p><p>Western blot analysis of the mouse tumours confirmed that the MAPK activation by hCAP18/LL-37 that we observed <italic>in vitro </italic>reflects events of <italic>in vivo </italic>tumourigenesis. The partial degradation of ERBB2 in overexpressing tumours is worthy of note. A reduced amount of intact protein, at a constant transcription rate, is characteristic of receptor degradation after activation and internalisation, as reported for ERBB2 following long-term ligand activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Truncated versions of ERBB2 have been shown to actively participate in signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and to be resistant to trastuzumab treatment in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>We did not detect the presence of truncated ERBB2 in our <italic>MAPK </italic>activation assays, which may reflect that the activation time might have been too short to induce degradation. However, the cellular environment should also be considered: in the mouse the extracellular proteins or domains on the tumour cell surface are exposed to proteases from the surrounding stroma, which might contribute to their degradation, or in the case of hCAP18, its activation. This would also explain why transgenic <italic>hCAP18 </italic>did not appear to alter the properties in the colony formation assay, but still induced metastasis formation in the mouse. In correlation with this hypothesis, recent studies show that the expression of metalloprotease MMP9 from the tumour surrounding stroma, unlike its expression in tumour cell cytoplasm, correlates with unfavourable prognosis in ERBB2 positive breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The correlation between hCAP18 and ERBB2 expression that was observed in the human tumours did not occur <italic>in vitro </italic>or in the mouse model. We favour the hypothesis that the upregulation of both occurs independently, but due to their functional collaboration is selected for during the evolution of human breast cancer.</p><p>The role for hCAP18/LL-37 as a proinflammatory molecule in innate immunity is well established. In this context, LL-37 alerts the immune system in case of injury and microbial invasion. It is conceivable that broad defense strategies involving hCAP18/LL-37 evolved to provide sustained protection and prompt repair, aiming to fully restore tissue integrity. This would be consistent with our recent understanding of hCAP18/LL-37 as a stimulant of cell migration and proliferation and as a promoter of wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, in view of the emerging link between chronic inflammation and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], hCAP18/LL-37 may contribute to cancer as a novel and versatile player, not only through its proinflammatory actions but also through its growth-factor like properties.</p><p>The data presented herein and recent observations in lung and ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], point to a role for hCAP18/LL-37 in cancer progression and spread. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain to be clarified. hCAP18/LL-37 is emerging as a multifunctional molecule progressively implicated in multiple highly significant processes in cancer development. hCAP18/LL-37 may constitute a putative therapeutic target to prevent progression to metastatic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we show that hCAP18/LL-37 is highly upregulated in breast cancer correlating with the expression of <italic>ERBB2. In vitro</italic>, we also show that they are functionally connected, in that hCAP18/LL-37 amplifies MAPK signalling through ErbB2 and that treatment with LL-37 peptide alters the growth phenotype and stimulates the migration of breast cancer cells. Finally, overexpressing hCAP18 in a low malignant breast cancer cell line promotes metastatic disease in a SCID mouse model. Taken together, our data expand on recent findings in lung and ovarian cancers and demonstrate a novel role for the single human cathelicidin protein hCAP18/LL-37 in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA: analysis of variance; BSA: bovine serum albumin; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified eagle's media; eGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; ER: oestrogen receptor; FACS: fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FCS: fetal calf serum; FPRL-1: formyl peptide receptor like-1; hCAP: human cathelicidin antimicrobial protein; HLA: human leucocyte antigen; HPLC: high-performance liquid chromatography; HRG: heregulin &#x003b2;3; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; RT-PCR: reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; SCID: severe combined immunodeficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>MS is a founder of Lipopeptide AB, a company that develops pharmaceuticals based on LL-37 for wound healing.
