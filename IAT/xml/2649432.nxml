We further determined elevated levels of MMP activity as well as gene expression of MMP-1, TIMP, and RECK in stimulated immune-competent hemocytes. This is in agreement with recent observations that activated human immune cells express high levels of MMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Madri1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and that immune-competent hemocytes from the mollusk <italic>Crassostrea virginica</italic> exhibit increased levels of MMP activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Munoz1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> as well as induced gene expression of TIMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Montagnani1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, in response to immune-challenge. In insect hemocytes, MMPs may be required for tissue transmigration to reach the site of infection or to activate cytokines or antimicrobial peptides, similar to what has been recently shown for mammalian lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Nagase1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Brinckerhoff1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas TIMP and RECK may have regulatory functions. It is also noteworthy, that we have recently described the ability of the insect innate immune system to sense collagen IV fragments that represent endogenous danger signals during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Altincicek3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Altincicek4">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Accruing collagen IV fragments by increasing hemocyte-derived MMP activity, therefore, may serve as a potentiating factor of innate immune responses against pathogens according to the proposed danger model by Matzinger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Matzinger1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Since insect MMP-1s are most closely related to mammalian MMP-19 and MMP-28, we postulate that some functions may have been conserved between insects and mammals. Indeed, it has recently been shown that MMP-28 expression is induced during dermal wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Lohi1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> and that MMP-19 has indispensable functions in cutaneous homeostasis by modulating epidermal proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Sadowski1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Sadowski2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, cutaneous immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Beck1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> as well as skin tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Pendas1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Jost1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, human MMP-19 associates with the surface of human monocytes and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Mauch1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> and impacts the maturation and response of mammalian T-cells that are involved in both innate and adaptive immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004751-Beck1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.
