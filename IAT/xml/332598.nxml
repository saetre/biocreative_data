The most striking case is that of protein D, heretofore generally observed as a single broad band; in high-TEMED gels, this splits into three clearly-separated bands, identified as three distinct proteins. We have denoted these proteins D1 (16 kDa), D2 (16.5 kDa) and D3 (18 kDa). Chemical and immunological studies have shown that D1 is identical with the common snRNP protein D, whose structure was recently resolved by cDNA cloning (Rokeach et al. (1988), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85, 4832-4836) and that D2 and D3 are clearly distinct from D1 and very probably from each other. In addition to D1, proteins D2 and D3 are present in purified U1, U2, U4/U6 and U5 snRNPs isolated from HeLa cells, so these also belong to the group of common snRNP proteins. They are also found in snRNPs isolated from mouse cells, indicating that the role of these proteins in the structure and/or function of UsnRNPs has been conserved in evolution. Interestingly, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus produce populations of anti-Sm autoantibodies that react differentially with the D proteins; some recognise all of them and others only a subset. The high-TEMED gels allow improved resolution not only of the D proteins, but also of some of the U5-specific proteins contained in 20S U5 snRNPs, in particular the 15-kDa protein. In addition, under these conditions, the common G protein, previously observed as a single band, appears as a doublet. Whether the additional band represents a distinct common snRNP protein or a post-translationally modified version of G is not yet known.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0016-a" xlink:role="6478"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0016-b" xlink:role="6478"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0016-c" xlink:role="6478"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0017-a" xlink:role="6479"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0017-b" xlink:role="6479"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0018-a" xlink:role="6480"/></fig><fig id="F7"><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0018-b" xlink:role="6480"/></fig><fig id="F8"><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0019-a" xlink:role="6481"/></fig><fig id="F9"><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0020-a" xlink:role="6482"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6475"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6476"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6477"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6478"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6479"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0018.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6480"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6481"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6482"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6483"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00206-0022.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6484"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
