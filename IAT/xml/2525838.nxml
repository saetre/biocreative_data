Mammalian MUS81 has been implicated in maintenance of genomic stability in somatic cells; however, little is known about its role during meiosis. <italic>Mus81</italic>-deficient mice were originally reported as being viable and fertile, with normal meiotic progression; however, a more detailed examination of meiotic progression in <italic>Mus81</italic>-null animals and WT controls reveals significant meiotic defects in the mutants. These include smaller testis size, a depletion of mature epididymal sperm, significantly upregulated accumulation of MLH1 on chromosomes from pachytene meiocytes in an interference-independent fashion, and a subset of meiotic DSBs that fail to be repaired. Interestingly, chiasmata numbers in spermatocytes from <italic>Mus81<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals are normal, suggesting additional integrated mechanisms controlling the two distinct crossover pathways. This study is the first in-depth analysis of meiotic progression in <italic>Mus81</italic>-nullizygous mice, and our results implicate the MUS81 pathway as a regulator of crossover frequency and placement in mammals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Failure to undergo faithful meiotic chromosome segregation during mammalian meiosis can result in aneuploidy in the offspring and is a major cause of pregnancy loss and birth defects in humans. One essential component of meiotic prophase I is the exchange of genetic information between maternal and paternal chromosomes, known as recombination or crossing over, and is mediated, at least in part, by the mismatch repair proteins MSH4&#x02013;MSH5 and MLH1&#x02013;MLH3. A distinct subset of crossovers in lower organisms is generated by an alternate pathway involving Mus81 endonuclease. Previous studies into the impact of <italic>Mus81</italic> mutations in mice revealed no adverse effect on the fertility of these animals. In this study, we report subtle, yet significant, defects in meiotic progression in male and female <italic>Mus81</italic> mice, coupled with intriguing results showing that MUS81 protein is essential for crossover control in mammals. MUS81 appears to be required for correct localization of MLH1&#x02013;MLH3 complexes to paired homologous chromosomes, however, not for the maintenance of physical crossovers, visualized as chiasmata. These results show a complex interplay between the MUS81 and MLH1&#x02013;MLH3 pathways for generation of crossovers and, as such, are critical to the further understanding of the intricacies of crossover control with a view to reducing meiotic error rate in humans.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis is a tightly regulated and essential process that results in the generation of gametes containing the correct haploid chromosome complement. The defining events of meiosis occur during prophase I, including the pairing of and physical association between, homologous chromosomes (synapsis), accompanied by exchange of genetic information (recombination) between these chromosome pairs. These meiotic regulatory processes are highly conserved from yeast through to humans. Recombination is initiated by the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), an event that is catalyzed in most eukaryotic species by the meiosis-specific endonuclease Spo11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-Keeney1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, and then processed via the DSB repair pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-Paques1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

COs are physically manifested as chiasmata, which tether homologous chromosomes together to ensure correct segregation at the first meiotic division.</p><p>In many organisms, the majority of COs are subject to regulation by a phenomenon known as interference, a process by which the presence of a CO on a chromosome greatly decreases the chances of a second CO occurring nearby on the same chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-Jones1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, COs susceptible to interference remain widely spaced, and are less likely to cause problems during segregation. In mammals, interference is generally measured between MLH1 foci at pachynema, so that the interference measurement in this regard is between MLH1 events, rather than between COs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-Baker1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-Froenicke1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, at least two CO pathways have been described, one dependent on the MutL homologs, Mlh1 and Mlh3, and the other on the structure specific endonuclease, Mus81 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-delosSantos1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Taken together, these models all suggest a mechanism by which Mus81 functions upstream (and independently of) Rad51, presumably through cleavage of 3&#x02032; flaps, to effect DNA repair but, in addition, can act downstream of Rad51 to mediate repair involving Holliday junction intermediates (but again through its action on 3&#x02032; flaps).</p><p>Our data on MUS81 function in mice is congruent with both possibilities presented above. An early role for MUS81 in prophase I in mice is indicated by the loss of meiotic cells from leptonema onwards, and by the observation of increased RAD51 staining associated with regions of asynapsis and synaptic disruption in zygonema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000186-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), although it must be noted that homolog association and synapsis are unaffected in <italic>S. cerevisiae mms4</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-delosSantos1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the fact that RAD51 focus numbers are largely unaffected in <italic>Mus81</italic> nullizygous mice, together with the observation that MSH4 focus frequency is normal in these animals, would argue that the early stages of DSB repair are unaffected by the absence of MUS81. It is possible that the subset of DSB events that are destined to become substrates for RAD51 is unaffected by the loss of MUS81 and that only those MUS81-dependent DSBs are then left unrepaired, perhaps becoming the substrate for DNA mismatch repair processes. However, this is inconsistent with our observation that the increase in MLH1/MLH3 focus numbers does not occur until mid-to-late pachynema, much later than the appearance of these aberrant DNA structures. Moreover, that the additional foci of MLH1 are equally represented by additional foci of MLH3 implies that these extraneous MutL heterodimers are of the MLH1/MLH3 variety (involved in recombination events) and not of the MLH1/PMS2 variety (involved in canonical mismatch repair), although analysis of PMS2 localization is prevented by the absence of a functional antibody. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possible involvement of a non-canonical mismatch repair complex in these events, nor can we dismiss the possible importance of other repair pathways in these processes. Alternatively, such aberrant structures, which fail to be processed by MUS81 in early leptonema, could proceed through prophase I to pachynema, whereupon they become substrates for MLH1/MLH3 accumulation (giving rise to the increased focus numbers for these MutL homologs). The lack of an appreciable increase in MSH4 foci would argue against this possibility, although the predicted increased may be too small to be evident above the normal level of MSH4 accumulation.</p><p>Previous studies from other organisms have shown Mus81 to be important in the processing of interference-independent COs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-delosSantos1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-Copenhaver1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> We believe non-interfering COs might be generated in the same way in mice, as <italic>Mus81<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> males show irregularities in processing of late recombination intermediates, characterized by a significant increase in interference-independent MLH1 foci. Intriguingly, this increase in MLH1 does not correspond to an increase in chiasmata in the <italic>Mus81<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, when compared with WT (discussed below). Thus, <italic>Mus81</italic> deletion represents the first single null mutant in which an increase in MLH1 foci is <italic>not</italic> correlated with increased SC length and, more importantly, in which the increase in MLH1 focus numbers does <italic>not</italic> result in an increase in the final tally of chiasmata. That these increased MLH1 foci are associated with similar increases in MLH3 suggests that the MLH1 function at these sites is one of recombination rather than of DNA mismatch repair (which would utilize PMS2). Unfortunately, the lack of a MUS81 antibody that detects the protein on chromosome spreads precludes detailed analysis of MUS81 localization in spermatocytes (Holloway and Cohen, unpublished data). These observations point to alterations in crossover control at the level of at least two distinct, but converging, recombination repair pathways and not to regulation of crossover frequency by the SC <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p>Given the late prophase I increase in MLH1&#x02013;MLH3 foci in <italic>Mus81</italic> nullizygous animals, it is possible that MUS81 may play both an early and a late role in recombination events in the mouse, the two possibly being delineated by RAD51-independence versus RAD51-dependency as suggested by Li and Brill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-Ii1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. For the later, RAD51-dependent function, there are two possible models for the interplay between MSH4&#x02013;MSH5, MUS81 and MLH1&#x02013;MLH3 in generating COs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000186-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

In the absence of MUS81, MSH4&#x02013;MSH5 directs all COs to be processed by MLH1&#x02013;MLH3.

From our data, it is difficult to say whether this is the case. The persistent BLM and RAD51 foci seen in the mutant spermatocytes indicate repair defects, rather than crossover anomalies yet, at the same time, since we see increased MLH3 foci in addition to the increase in MLH1 foci, it is equally likely that these structures represent nascent COs rather than unrepaired breaks.</p><p>In <italic>Mus81<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, the number of chiasmata was not different from that of WT mice, despite the increase in MLH1 foci at pachynema.

Cells with MLH1&#x02013;MLH3 foci too close together may be subject to additional processing by downstream factors limiting the crossover number, such as EXO1 or BLM (Sgs1 in yeast) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-Wei1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-Oh1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> which, we suggest, would normally overlook interference-independent MUS81 foci. Unfortunately, analysis of the localization of EXO1 is precluded by the absence of an antibody that is functional on chromosome spreads. However BLM appears to persist into late pachynema in <italic>Mus81</italic> spermatocytes and may account for this additional surveillance mechanism. Oh <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-Oh1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> have proposed that Sgs1 in yeast functions to suppress closely spaced COs by preventing the formation of complex recombination intermediates involving multiple chromatids. In this model, Mlh1&#x02013;Mlh3 complexes act to promote inter-homolog strand invasion, in part by antagonizing Sgs1. At the same time, Sgs1 acts to disassemble complex recombination intermediates that might include those resulting from closely spaced DSB processing events. Given these suggestions, the current data indicate that the absence of MUS81 in mice results in closely spaced interference-independent MLH1&#x02013;MLH3 events that then become the target for directed BLM action. We suggest, therefore, that CO control in the mouse involves complex integration between MUS81 and MLH1&#x02013;MLH3, perhaps mediated by BLM.</p><p>The current study provides strong evidence that COs in mammals are controlled by at least two pathways, and that MUS81 is responsible for processing a distinct subset of these events. Whether this control is mediated early in prophase I, at the level of RAD51 acquisition, or later, upon accumulation of MLH1/MH3, remains to be seen. Clearly, however, the function of MUS81 in meiosis differs between eukaryotic species and also possibly betweeen its function in the context of replication and meiosis. Continued cross-species analysis of MUS81 action will help to elucidate the nature of its activity in these diverses processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse Breeding</title><p><italic>Mus81</italic> knockout mice were generated as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000186-Dendouga1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.
