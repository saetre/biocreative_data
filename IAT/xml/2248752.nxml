Here, the core region of the human <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter was characterized. Surprisingly, two Sp1/Sp3-binding sites, rather than tissue-specific transcription factors, were found to be required for the promoter activity. Although the ubiquitously expressed Sp1 and Sp3 were crucial, they alone could not adequately regulate the specific expression of <italic>CIDE-A</italic>. We found that the expression of <italic>CIDE-A</italic> was further regulated by CpG methylation of the promoter region. By performing bisulfite sequencing, we observed dense CpG methylation of the promoter region in tissues and cells with low or no expression of <italic>CIDE-A</italic> but not in tissues with high level of <italic>CIDE-A</italic> expression. <italic>In vitro</italic> methylation of this region showed significantly reduced transcriptional activity. Treatment of <italic>CIDE-A</italic>-negative cells with 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine demethylated the CpG sites; this opened the closed chromatin conformation and markedly enhanced the binding affinity of Sp1/Sp3 to the promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, thereby restoring <italic>CIDE-A</italic> expression. These data indicated that CpG methylation plays a crucial role in establishing and maintaining tissue- and cell-specific transcription of the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene through the regulation of Sp1/Sp3 binding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="pdb"><title>GenBank Accession Number</title><kwd>EF672106</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Apoptosis, a morphologically distinct form of programmed cell death, is an evolutionary highly conserved phenomenon that plays an important role in the regulation of cellular activities in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Recently, a novel family of cell-death-inducing DFF45 (DNA fragmentation factor-45)-like effector (CIDE) proteins has been identified. The CIDE family includes three members (CIDE-A, CIDE-B and CIDE-C) in humans, and their mice homologues have also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). CIDE-A was initially identified by virtue of its sequence similarity to the N-terminal region of the apoptotic DNA fragmentation factors DFF40/CAD and DFF45/ICAD. The overexpression of CIDE-A in various cell lines induces caspase-independent cell death associated with the fragmentation of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In addition to cell-death induction, recent studies have indicated a correlation between CIDE-A and obesity. <italic>CIDE-A</italic>-null mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and diabetes and display higher metabolic rate and lipolysis in the brown adipose tissue than their wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In obese women undergoing weight reduction through a low-calorie diet, the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene is the highest upregulated gene in the subcutaneous adipose tissue among 8000 investigated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Furthermore, CIDE-A is considered to play a human-specific role in lipolysis regulation and metabolic complications of obesity, which is at least partly mediated by cross-talk between CIDE-A and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Thus, <italic>CIDE-A</italic> is also considered as a strong candidate gene for obesity and could serve as a novel target for therapeutic intervention of obesity and Type II diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>).</p><p>According to the previous reports, the expression of <italic>CIDEs</italic> is strongly tissue and cell specific. In addition to high levels of expression in the adipose tissue, <italic>CIDE-A</italic> transcripts of various lengths are present in different human tissues such as the heart, muscle and thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The mice <italic>CIDE-A</italic> is expressed abundantly in the brown adipose tissue and could be transcriptionally activated by proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b1; (PPAR&#x003b1;) and PPAR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Other <italic>CIDE</italic> genes also have multiple transcripts with different levels of tissue- and cell-specific expression. For example, the human <italic>CIDE-B</italic> gene is significantly expressed in the liver and spleen tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), while the expression of the human <italic>CIDE-C</italic> gene was detected in the small intestine, heart, colon and stomach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Studies on the human <italic>CIDE-B</italic> gene showed that the cell-specific expression of two transcripts of <italic>CIDE-B</italic> was driven by two different promoters through epigenetic and genetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The expression of the adipocyte-specific gene <italic>FSP27</italic>, a member of the mice CIDE family, was regulated by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and other C/EBP-like transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Thus, the transcription of the <italic>CIDE</italic> genes appears to be regulated in a strictly tissue- and cell-specific manner. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the tissue- and cell-specific transcription of the human <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene have not been elucidated.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the human <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene in human tissues and several cancer cells and found that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 were crucial for <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter activity. In addition, we found that DNA methylation of the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter played an important role in regulating tissue- and cell-specific expression of this gene by interfering with Sp1/Sp3 binding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Samples of human tissues and cell lines</title><p>Human adipose and liver tissue samples were obtained from Zhongshan Hospital (Shanghai, China).

The expression pattern and functions of CIDE-A are well established; however, little is known about its transcriptional regulation. Since <italic>CIDE-A</italic> is considered as a novel target for therapeutic intervention of obesity and Type II diabetes, a better understanding of the mechanism responsible for the expression of this gene may provide new opportunities for therapy.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to characterize the mechanism that regulated the tissue- and cell-specific expression of the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene. By using 5&#x02032; flanking region-luciferase fusion plasmids, we identified the core <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter as a 125-bp region located between the base pairs &#x02212;137 to &#x02212;13 that contained two Sp1/Sp3-binding sites. The activity of the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter was greatly reduced when site-directed mutations were introduced in each of these binding sites; this finding demonstrated a crucial role of the Sp1/Sp3-binding sites in <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter activity. In addition, EMSAs also confirmed that Sp1 and Sp3 could specifically bind to the putative binding sites identified in the minimal region. In view of this finding, the fact that the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene was expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific manner was rather confusing because Sp1 and Sp3 are two ubiquitously expressed mammalian transcription factors that bind to DNA with similar specificity and affinity and participate in the regulation of the expression of genes involved in almost all cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Thus, it appears that Sp1 and Sp3 alone might not determine tissue- and cell-specific expression of the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene. Interestingly, the basal promoter activity of the core region was observed even in cells that did not endogenously express <italic>CIDE-A</italic>. Similar phenomenon was also observed in previous studies on <italic>CIDE-B, NF1</italic> (neurofibromatosis type 1) and <italic>APC</italic> (adenomatous polyposis of the colon) promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Since the transiently transfected constructs were unlikely to adopt the native chromatin structure, this observation prompted us to investigate whether DNA methylation was involved in the mechanisms underlying the silencing of the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene in non-expressing cells and tissues.</p><p>We investigated the DNA methylation profiles of a portion of the CpG island covering the Sp1/Sp3-binding sites. Sodium bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed that the CpG sites in the minimal promoter region were hypomethylated in <italic>CIDE-A</italic> expressed tissues (heart and adipose), but they were hypermethylated in <italic>CIDE-A</italic> absent or low expressed tissues (liver, spleen and stomach) and cell lines (Hela, BEL-7404 and HEK-293T cells). The involvement of methylation in the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene silencing was further supported by the finding that cells transfected by constructs densely methylated by SssI methylase <italic>in vitro</italic> showed a significant decrease in luciferase activities. Moreover, we found that after treatment with the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-dC, the gene expression was restored in all the CIDE-A non-expressing cells. In addition, the nuclease accessibility assay demonstrated that the chromatin conformation around the Sp1/Sp3-binding sites in the CIDE-A non-expressing cells changed from &#x02018;closed&#x02019; to &#x02018;open&#x02019; after 5-aza-dC treatment. We further used ChIP to determine the levels of two critical histone H3 modifications (Ac-H3K9 and di-methyl H3K9) at <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene core promoter. Consistent with the studies of other genes, we find that increased levels of di-methyl H3K9 at <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter correlates with a lack of gene expression, whereas an increased abundance of Ac-H3K9 correlates with increased gene expression. However, no significant changes were observed in CIDE-A expression levels, methylation status or chromatin conformation after the cells were treated with TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. This observation is consistent with the previous reports on the regulation of hypermethylated genes such as <italic>hMLH1, CDKN2B</italic> (<italic>p15INK4B</italic>) and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> (<italic>p16INK4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In these studies, 5-aza-dC treatment induced the expression of these hypermethylated genes and reversed histone modification, whereas TSA treatment did not induce these changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Taken together, all these findings satisfy two well-known criteria for defining the role of DNA methylation in tissue- and cell-specific gene repression: (i) <italic>CIDE-A</italic> was densely methylated in non-expressing tissue and cells and (ii) induced demethylation resulted in the activation of <italic>CIDE-A</italic>.</p><p>The methylation of genomic DNA at CpG dinucleotides is a major epigenetic modification of the mammalian genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), and it functions in several aspects of gene expression such as X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, immobilization of transposons and suppression of transcriptional noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28">26&#x02013;28</xref>). Methylation of CpG sites in the promoter region is also believed to ensure the silencing of tissue-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Several mechanisms have been proposed for methylation-induced gene repression. Among these mechanisms, the direct blocking of the binding of transcription factors to their CpG-containing binding sites is an important mechanism that contributes to transcriptional repression. In the case of <italic>c-Myb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), <italic>c-Myc/Myn</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), <italic>E2F</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), <italic>CREB</italic> (cAMP-response element-binding protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), <italic>AP2</italic> (activator protein 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) and <italic>NF-&#x003ba;B</italic> (nuclear factor <italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), methylated CpGs in their recognition site preclude the binding of the transcription factor and thereby directly inhibit gene expression.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the Sp1-binding affinity to its responding element is not consequentially affected by DNA methylation, which appears to be promoter dependent. The Sp1-binding affinity to the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) or <italic>CLDN4</italic> promoter was not affected by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). In contrast, in the case of <italic>p21<sup>Cip1</sup></italic>, 11 &#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, <italic>GSTP1</italic> (glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase p1) or <italic>IGFBP-3</italic> (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3), the Sp1-binding affinity to the respective promoter region was found to be abolished by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39 B40 B41">38&#x02013;41</xref>). Because of the vital roles of Sp1/Sp3 in maintaining <italic>CIDE-A</italic> basal promoter activity, we further investigated whether DNA methylation could impair the binding of Sp1/Sp3 to the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter in non-expressing cells. In our study, the ChIP assay clearly showed that the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter could be diminished by methylation of the Sp1/Sp3 motif, similar to that observed for <italic>p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, GSTP1</italic> and <italic>IGFBP-3</italic> promoters; furthermore, treatment of Hela cells with 1 &#x003bc;M 5-aza-dC for 3 days markedly enhanced the binding affinity of Sp1/Sp3 along with restoration of the expression of <italic>CIDE-A</italic>. We further confirmed the roles of Sp1 and Sp3 in regulation of <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter activity by using RNA interference. Consistent with our reporter assays demonstrating a crucial role for Sp1/Sp3 sites in <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter activity, Sp1 and Sp3 knockdown significantly reduced transcription levels controlled by the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter. Taken together, our results clearly indicate that the methylation status of the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter correlated well with <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene expression in a subset of cell lines and tissues, and that DNA methylation was the key mechanism of regulating tissue- and cell-specific expression of <italic>CIDE-A</italic> through blocking of the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter. Our findings also suggest that the switch between transcriptional silencing and expression of the tissue-specific gene could depend on varying epigenetic modification, which is driven by basal transcription factors such as Sp1/Sp3 and activation of the conserved promoter sites. It would be interesting to investigate the change in the methylation status of the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter during adipose differentiation and to determine whether the regulation of higher-order chromatin structures by methyl-CpG-binding proteins such as MeCP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) and MBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) is involved in <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene silencing in non-expressing cells and tissues. Such information would provide further insights into the role of CpG methylation in the regulation of tissue-specific expression of the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> gene.</p><p>In conclusion, our data revealed that DNA methylation of CpG sites in the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter was the primary mechanism through which the transcription of <italic>CIDE-A</italic> was silenced or repressed in non-expressing cells and tissues. In addition, we showed that the Sp1/Sp3 consensus sequence&#x02014;the critical regulatory elements&#x02014;were methylated, and methylation of this motif prohibited the access of Sp1 and Sp3 transcriptional factors, resulting in the downregulation of the activity of the <italic>CIDE-A</italic> promoter.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to other members of our group for technical assistance and helpful discussion.
