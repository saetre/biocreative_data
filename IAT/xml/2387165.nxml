We have recently shown that decreased methylation of the toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) promoter leads to an apparent CF-related up-regulation of TLR2. This up-regulation could be responsible, in part, for the CF-associated enhanced proinflammatory responses to various bacterial products in epithelial cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA hypomethylation-dependent enhancement of TLR2 expression in CF cells remain unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The present study indicates that there is a specific CpG region (CpG#18-20), adjacent to the SP1 binding site that is significantly hypomethylated in several CF epithelial cell lines. These CpGs encompass a minimal promoter region required for basal TLR2 expression, and suggests that CpG#18-20 methylation regulates TLR2 expression in epithelial cells. Furthermore, reporter gene analysis indicated that the SP1 binding site is involved in the methylation-dependent regulation of the TLR2 promoter. Inhibition of SP1 with mithramycin A decreased TLR2 expression in both CF and 5-azacytidine-treated non-CF epithelial cells. Moreover, even though SP1 binding was not affected by CpG methylation, SP1-dependent transcription was abolished by CpG methylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This report implicates SP1 as a critical component of DNA demethylation-dependent up-regulation of TLR2 expression in CF epithelial cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The innate immune system recognizes conserved microbial products, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), that are invariant among diverse groups of microorganisms. PAMPs are recognized by a set of germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including toll-like receptors (TLRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. After the recognition of microbial PAMPs by innate immune systems, TLRs activate signaling pathways that induce inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides to eliminate invading pathogens. Eleven members of the mammalian TLR family have been identified and cloned thus far. TLR2 and TLR4 have been studied in the greatest depth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and TLR4 appears to be primarily involved in the recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast, TLR2 responds to a variety of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial products, including peptidoglycan, lipoprotein, lipoteichoic acid, and lipoarabinomannan. This suggests that TLR2 plays a critical role in the host defence system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>TLR2 is primarily expressed in monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes. There is also a growing body of evidence indicating that TLR2 is inducibly expressed in epithelial tissues. Previous studies have shown that TLR2 is expressed at a low level in human epithelial cells under physiological conditions. However, TLR2 expression is greatly increased during bacterial infections through an NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Inducible expression of human TLR2 by the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF&#x003b1;, was also indicated in lung Type II-like A549 epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These findings indicate that increased TLR2 expression during bacterial infection may contribute in accelerating the immune response to invading pathogens.</p><p>Although optimal TLR2 signaling is required to activate epithelial cells against microorganisms, excessive or inappropriate TLR2 expression and signaling could contribute to hyperresponsiveness against bacterial ligands, and enhance the inflammatory responses frequently detrimental to the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Our previous studies indicate that expression of TLR2 is higher in the airway mucosae of chronic otitis media patients than in normal subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and is also associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These reports implicate hyperresponsiveness to bacterial infection as a cause of the enhanced susceptibility to chronic inflammation. Thus, regulation of TLR2 expression is likely an important immune-regulatory mechanism, commonly involved in host defence against bacterial infections.</p><p>The clinical course of cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal inherited disorder in Caucasians, is characterized by two major respiratory symptoms, recurrent pulmonary infection and chronic inflammation that ultimately lead to death from respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Two previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] showed a modest up-regulation of TLR2 in CF airway epithelial cells that is consistent with an increased proinflammatory response to TLR2-activating bacterial ligands found in CF airways. In accordance with these findings, an increase in the expression of TLR2 gene in CF epithelial cells due to the hypomethylation of the TLR2 promoter has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this hypomethylation-dependent activation of TLR2 transcription in human CF epithelial cells remain unknown.</p><p>The present study shows that a specific CpG region, adjacent to an SP1 binding site, are hypomethylated in CF epithelial cells. The minimal region required for maintenance of basal TLR2 promoter activity was comprised of the CpG site adjacent to an SP1 binding site. Furthermore, SP1-dependent transcriptional activity, but not SP1 binding, was shown to be elevated in the hypomethylation-dependent enhancement of TLR2 gene expression in CF epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of CF-specific methylation patterns within the human TLR2 promoter</title><p>We recently showed that decreased methylation of human TLR2 (hTLR2) promoter is responsible for enhanced TLR2 expression in CF epithelial cells, and suggested that this increased TLR2 expression is responsible for augmenting the proinflammatory response to various bacterial products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To identify specific promoter regions among the 20 potentially hypomethylated CpG sites in CF epithelial cells, the methylation profiles of these sites were characterized by bisulfite sequence analysis. The 20 CpG sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) were first bundled together into eight groups based on the relative proximity of each CpG (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The methylation status of these eight CpG groupings was then analyzed in non-CF (16HBE14o-, HeLa, A549) and CF (CFBE41o-, CFTE29o-, CFPAC-1) epithelial cells. The proportion of methylated to unmethylated sites was assessed. Statistical analysis using Fischer's exact test compared non-CF/CF cells in the context of methylated/unmethylated CpGs in each site (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This analysis identified CpG groupings #1&#x02013;3 and #18&#x02013;20 as significantly hypomethylated (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) and CpG groupings #6&#x02013;8, #13&#x02013;15 and #16&#x02013;17 as moderately hypomethylated (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Statistical analysis showed that the methylation of CpG groupings #4&#x02013;5, #9&#x02013;10 and #11&#x02013;12 were not significantly different (p &#x0003e; 0.05) between non-CF and CF epithelial cells. These findings suggest that there are CF-specific methylation patterns (CFSMPs) within the TLR2 promoter that may play a role in CF pathology.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of the human TLR2 promoter</bold>.

A series of reporter plasmids containing various lengths of the promoter region were constructed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). These constructs were transfected into non-CF (16HBE14o-, HeLa, A549) and CF (CFBE41o-, CFTE29o-, CFPAC-1) epithelial cells. The CF cells express high levels of TLR2, while the non-CF cells express low levels of TLR2 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, RT-PCR). Luciferase activity in all cell lines decreased as a function of promoter length (i.e., transfection with plasmids pGL3-T2P (-120) through pGL3-T2P (-12)) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), indicating that there are primary promoter regulatory elements between -120- to -12-bp upstream of the TLR2 gene coding sequences. We noted that the pattern of luciferase activity for the different constructs in the non-CF cells seemed to be similar to the pattern of activity measured in the CF epithelial cells even though the non-CF epithelial cells show very low levels of endogenous TLR2 mRNA expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

It is therefore reasonable to predict that aberrant methylation of CpG regions within a promoter could manifest in a pathology associated with some chronic diseases. Recent studies have shown that TLR2 promoter hypomethylation is associated with increased expression of TLR2 in CF bronchial epithelial cells. This is consistent with CF airway pathology that typically shows increased proinflammatory responses to TLR2 bacterial ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The present study shows that a specific CpG region of the TLR2 promoter, adjacent to an SP1 binding site, is significantly demethylated, and that this promoter region is both necessary and sufficient to maintain basal TLR2 promoter activity in human epithelial cells. These data suggest that there are CFSMPs (CF-specific methylation patterns) within TLR2 promoter, that might be used as markers to facilitate the discovery of anti-inflammatory CF drugs, as has been the case with anti-tumor drug discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The studies presented here also sought to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying demethylation-dependent enhancement of TLR2 gene expression in CF epithelial cells. SP1, but not SP3, appears to play a critical role in maintaining basal TLR2 promoter activation in human epithelial cells. Furthermore, SP1 appears to be involved in regulating DNA demethylation-dependent TLR2 transcriptional activity and expression. It is important to note that the introduction of tri-methylation into the promoter region adjacent to SP1 binding site did not abrogate SP1 binding, and suggests that SP1 binding is not rate limiting in regulating TLR2 mRNA expression. Binding of some additional unknown "X" factors to the tri-methylated probe, regardless of the source of nuclear extract, was indicated in the EMSA assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A, B</xref>, lanes 10 and 12, denoted by a <italic>sharp</italic>). This "X" factor band was not observed in the non- or mono-methylated probes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A, B</xref>, lanes 2, 4, 6 and 8), suggesting that the increased methylation of CpG#18-20 in non-CF epithelial cells enhances recruitment of factors that recognize tri-methylated CpGs and suppress SP1-dependent transcription without affecting the SP1 binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, left panel). On the other hand, the decreased methylation of CpG#18-20, often observed in CF epithelial cells, might abolish the recruitment and activity of these "X" factors, and allowed SP1-dependent transcription of TLR2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, right panel).</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>A potential model representing the mechanisms underlying hypomethylation-dependent TLR2 promoter activation in human epithelial cells</bold>. Enhanced methylation of the CpG#18-20 site within TLR2 promoter observed in non-CF epithelial cells is followed by the enhanced recruitment of unknown factors "X" that could recognize methylated CpGs and could suppress SP1-dependent transcriptional activation without affecting the binding of SP1 to those CpGs (left panel). 5-azacytidine (5-AC) treatment of non-CF cells leads to the demethylation of CpG#18-20. On the other hand, CF epithelial cells express high level of TLR2 gene through decreased methylation of CpG#18-20, which might abolish the recruitment and activity of factors "X" in these cells (right panel).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-9-39-9"/></fig><p>The modulation of SP1 binding to its target sequences by DNA methylation is controversial. In the promoters of p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, and GSTP1 (glutathione S-transferase p1), SP1 binding was found to be diminished by DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In contrast, SP1 binding to the claudin-4 (CLDN4) promoter was not influenced by DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It was found that the methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) was recruited to CpG sites and silenced the CLDN4 gene in ovarian cancer cell lines without interfering with SP1 binding. The present study clearly indicates that SP1 binding to a TLR2 promoter region was not inhibited by DNA methylation. This is similar to what was observed for the CLDN4 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Recruitment of methyl binding proteins to the SP1 binding site in the TLR2 promoter needs to be verified. MBD2 and/or the methyl-CpG-binding protein 1 (MeCP1) complex, a large protein complex that includes MBD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], could be candidate "X" factors that interact with the methylated TLR2 promoter.</p><p>It is still unclear how the methylation patterns of the TLR2 promoter are determined in non-CF and CF epithelial cell lines. Whether it is recruitment of factors required for transcriptional activation or the recruitment of factors required for silencing requires further study. The A549 and HeLa, cell lines used as non-CF epithelial cells in this study, are not thought to express CFTR mRNA, yet their TLR2 expression was comparable to that of the 16HBE14o- cells. Therefore, it appears that wt CFTR expression may not be the only factor that would determine the TLR2 gene expression in epithelial cells. However, the processing of &#x00394;F508CFTR might affect the transcription of the TLR2 gene through a mechanism that involves the methylation of DNA and the expression of specific transcriptional regulatory factors. Preliminary studies comparing CF and non-CF cells showed no difference in the expressions of DNA methyl transferase genes, DNmt1, DNmt3a, and DNmt3b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], or in the DNA demethylases, MBD2 and Gadd45a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], (unpublished data). One possible mechanism could involve the recruitment of factors that releases the methylation-induced transcription block by activating demethylation of the promoter in the nucleus. Clearly, further investigation is required to elucidate these mechnaisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There appear to be CF-associated methylation patterns within the human TLR2 (hTLR2) promoter, that lead to increased expression of the TLR2 gene in CF epithelial cells. Moreover, SP1-dependent transcription apppears to be an important component of the molecular mechanisms underlying CFSMPs-related aberrant regulation of TLR2 expression in CF epithelial cells. Increased responsiveness to TLR2 ligands as well as an increase in TLR2 expression in CF epithelial cells have been proposed as a contributing factor in CF-associated chronic inflammation. Therefore, CF-specific methylation patterns within the TLR2 promoter may have important implications for the development of therapies directed at sites regulating TLR2 expression. Furthermore, the studies presented here indicate that CF-specific hypomethylation of the hTLR2 promoter may influence regulation of other inflammation-associated genes that are aberrantly regulated in CF epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].
