Correspondingly, serotonin (5-HT) has been demonstrated to be an important local regulator of lactational homeostasis and involution in mouse and human mammary cells. We determined the mRNA expression of bovine 5-HT receptor (HTR) subtypes in bovine mammary tissue (BMT) and used pharmacological agents to evaluate functional activities of 5-HT receptors. The mRNAs for five receptor isoforms (<italic>HTR1B</italic>, <italic>2A</italic>, <italic>2B</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, and <italic>7</italic>) were identified by conventional real-time (RT)-PCR, RT quantitative PCR, and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization in BMT. In addition to luminal mammary epithelial cell expression, <italic>HTR4</italic> was expressed in myoepithelium, and <italic>HTR1B</italic>, <italic>2A</italic>, and <italic>2B</italic> were expressed in small mammary blood vessels. Serotonin suppressed milk protein mRNA expression (&#x003b1;-lactalbumin and &#x003b2;-casein mRNA) in lactogen-treated primary bovine mammary epithelial cell (BMEC) cultures. To probe the functional activities of individual receptors, caspase-3 activity and expression of &#x003b1;-lactalbumin and &#x003b2;-casein were measured. Both SB22489 (1B antagonist) and ritanserin (2A antagonist) increased caspase-3 activity. Expression of &#x003b1;-lactalbumin and &#x003b2;-casein mRNA levels in BMEC were stimulated by low concentrations of SB224289, ritanserin, or pimozide. These results demonstrate that there are multiple 5-HT receptor isoforms in the bovine mammary gland, and point to profound differences between serotonergic systems of the bovine mammary gland and the human and mouse mammary glands. Whereas human and mouse mammary epithelial cells express predominately the protein for the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor, cow mammary epithelium expresses multiple receptors that have overlapping, but not identical, functional activities.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS1">NRI Competitive</funding-source><award-id rid="CS1">2007-35206-17898</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Milk secretion is regulated by both systemic and local feedback mechanisms. Suckling-induced prolactin (PRL) surges comprise the major positive feedback that drives elevated milk secretion in response to increased nursing demand in most species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wilde <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>). Local negative feedback processes are initiated by poorly understood mechanisms that monitor the state of filling within each gland. These mechanisms regulate alveolar distension, milk synthesis and secretion, and epithelial cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peaker 1995</xref>). Acting in concert, systemic and local hormonal factors adjust mammary gland physiology not only to meet the demands of the offspring, but also to compensate for circumstances such as local mastitis, nutrient supply, and metabolic demand.</p><p>Even in the face of continued endocrine stimulation, mammary glands that are unsuckled will halt milk synthesis and undergo partial involution, resulting in loss of epithelial cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peaker 1995</xref>). In many species, including rodents and humans, involution is characterized by massive apoptosis. In other species, including dairy cattle, the glands become quiescent during involution, but do not undergo apoptosis and remodeling on a large scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Capuco &#x00026; Akers 1999</xref>). Consequences of milk stasis have been known for many years, but mechanisms responsible for stasis-induced involution have remained obscure. One line of research that explored this issue proposed the presence of a &#x02018;feedback inhibitor of lactation&#x02019; compound in milk whose identity and physiological activity have not been confirmed. This factor was proposed to decrease milk yield, milk protein synthesis, and milk protein mRNA expression, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a variety of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wilde <italic>et al</italic>. 1988</xref>).</p><p>Serotonin (5-HT) has been proposed to be an autocrine/paracrine regulator of lactation in the mouse, human, and more recently in the bovine, and the enzymatic machinery necessary for 5-HT biosynthesis has been detected in the mammary epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stull <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hernandez 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hernandez <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pai &#x00026; Horseman 2008</xref>). Expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) in mammary epithelial cells, the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT biosynthesis, was induced by PRL in mouse mammosphere cultures, and by milk stasis in nursing dams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). Serotonin content was measured in the mammary gland of virgin, lactating, and 5-hydroxtryptophan-treated mice. Serotonin content of the mammary gland was increased in lactating mice compared with virgin and, when treated with 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-HT levels in the mammary gland were further increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stull <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). In cultures of primary mouse mammary epithelial cells, expression of &#x003b2;-casein mRNA was attenuated by increasing concentrations of 5-HT. Furthermore, when methysergide (METH), a non-selective 5-HT antagonist, was added to cultures, expression of &#x003b2;-casein mRNA was increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). Non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) were demonstrated to express mRNA for the human 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor (<italic>HTR7</italic>) on basolateral membranes, and 5-HT reuptake transporter (SERT) on the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stull <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). Additionally, it was determined that 5-HT was involved in the regulation of tight junction (TJ) status in the MCF10A cells. Addition of METH or metergoline, both broad-spectrum 5-HT receptor antagonists, resulted in increases in transepithelial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stull <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). The TJ scaffolding proteins, ZO-1 and ZO-2, were also decreased in 5-HT-treated MCF10A cells.</p><p>Studies in three-dimensional collagen cultures of bovine mammary epithelial cell (BMEC) have shown TPH1 to be expressed in a PRL-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stiening 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hernandez <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). Furthermore, BMEC treated with 5-HT had decreased milk protein gene expression, and treatment with METH or parachlorophenylalanine (TPH1 enzyme inhibitor) increased milk protein gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hernandez <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). To date, no information is present on the identity of 5-HT receptors in bovine mammary tissue (BMT). Therefore, the objectives of these studies were to determine 1) which 5-HT receptor(s) are present in the bovine mammary gland and BMEC, 2) which selective antagonists for 5-HT receptors affect &#x003b2;-casein and &#x003b1;-lactalbumin mRNA expression in BMEC, and 3) determine whether 5-HT and selective 5-HT receptor antagonists affect caspase-3 activity in cultures of BMEC. The results of these studies point to profound functional activities of 5-HT in the bovine mammary epithelium and substantial complexity in the bovine 5-HT system, which has not yet been reported in the human or mouse 5-HT systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Expression of HTR subtypes in bovine brain, mammary tissue, and mammary epithelial cells</title><p>The characterization of expression for serotonergic components was initially performed on a pool of isolated bovine mammary cells representing four multiparous, non-lactating, pregnant cows.

Serotonin has also been reported to increase apoptosis in mouse mammary explant cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>).

Although contrary to the extensive apoptosis seen in mice upon treatment with 5-HT, there may be a solid biological basis for this difference. Dairy cows do not undergo extensive remodeling of BMT to a virgin-like state during their involution/dry period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akers 2002</xref>). No evidence of a net loss of mammary epithelial cells is apparent in lactating versus non-lactating cows. Furthermore, dairy cows undergo more extensive cell turnover during lactation than mice or humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Capuco <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2006</xref>). Therefore, the lack of extensive apoptosis in BMEC treated with 5-HT is not entirely surprising.</p><p>We determined that <italic>HTR1B</italic> mRNA was enriched in BMEC and in BMT, suggesting that it is predominately found in BMEC, although it appears to be also expressed in the vasculature of the mammary gland. We demonstrated that SB224289 (1B antagonist) up-regulated &#x003b1;-lactalbumin and &#x003b2;-casein mRNA expression in BMEC exposed to a lactogenic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>A). Increasing cyclic AMP enhances secretion in mammary epithelial cells, and potentially 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> could be blocking this pathway because it is negatively coupled to cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boisgard <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). In these studies, we demonstrated that treatment of BMEC with SB224289 increased apoptosis compared with lactogenic controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). In the bovine, a considerable amount of cell renewal occurs, such that by the end of lactation, the majority of cells present has been produced during the lactation cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capuco <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2003</xref>) Apoptosis is crucial to turnover of cells in BMT during lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capuco <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hadsell <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>).

Glucose uptake by BMT is a required step in producing lactose, the primary carbohydrate and major osmolyte in milk. The major GLUT in the mammary gland is GLUT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akers 2002</xref>). PRL stimulates the Jak/Stat pathway (Jak2/Stat5) in the mammary gland, which is responsible for the induction of milk protein expression in BMEC as well as other mammary epithelial cells due to the presence of Stat5-binding sites on the epithelial cells, and this could be a potential regulatory pathway by which 5-HT acts through 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horseman 1999</xref>). Our studies indicate that the mRNA for the <italic>HTR2A</italic> is present in BMT and potentially in cells of the vascular system of BMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Expression of mRNA for this receptor was 3&#x000b7;77-fold in BMT and 1&#x000b7;64 in BMEC relative to BB.

We did not detect any effects on milk protein gene expression or milk protein levels when treating lactogenic cultures of BMEC with SB204741 (2B antagonist).

In addition to tissue-autonomous mechanisms explored to date, some mechanisms of 5-HT action may involve extra-epithelial actions.

In this process, we have discovered profound differences between the bovine system and that of mice and humans. Whereas human and mouse mammary epithelial cells express predominantly the 5-HT-7, which signals through the <italic>G</italic><sub>s</sub>-coupled pathway, the bovine mammary epithelium expresses 5-HT-7, along with four additional isoforms of 5-HT receptors (1B, 2A, 2B, and 4). These additional receptors may signal through the <italic>G</italic><sub>i</sub> and <italic>G</italic><sub>q/11</sub> pathways, raising the likelihood that cows have evolved mechanisms that have served to alter the molecular tuning of intramammary serotonergic feedback. We have further demonstrated that 5-HT-1B, 2A, and 7 appear to be directly involved in milk protein gene expression in the bovine. Other potential mechanisms of serotonergic regulation of mammary gland function include cell turnover, the milk ejection reflex, and mammary blood flow.
