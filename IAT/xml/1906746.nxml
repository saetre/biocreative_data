During latency, most viral genes are silenced, although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this are unclear. We hypothesized that neuronal factors repress HSV-1 gene expression during latency. A search of the HSV-1 DNA sequence for potential regulatory elements identified a Repressor Element-1/Neuronal Restrictive Silencer Element (RE-1/NRSE) located between HSV-1 genes ICP22 and ICP4. We predicted that the Repressor Element Silencing Transcription Factor/Neuronal Restrictive Silencer Factor (REST/NRSF) regulates expression of ICP22 and ICP4.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Transient cotransfection indicated that REST/NRSF inhibited the activity of both promoters. In contrast, cotransfection of a mutant form of REST/NRSF encoding only the DNA-binding domain of the protein resulted in less inhibition. Stably transformed cell lines containing episomal reporter plasmids with a chromatin structure showed that REST/NRSF specifically inhibited the ICP4 promoter, but not the ICP22 promoter. REST/NRSF inhibition of the ICP4 promoter was reversed by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA). Additionally, chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that the corepressor CoREST was recruited to the proximity of ICP4 promoter and that acetylation of histone H4 was reduced in the presence of REST/NRSF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Since the ICP4 protein is a key transactivator of HSV-1 lytic cycle genes, these results suggest that REST/NRSF may have an important role in the establishment and/or maintenance of HSV-1 gene silencing during latency by targeting ICP4 expression.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Lytic infection by Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 (HSV-1) typically occurs in epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. During these infections, HSV-1 expresses more than eighty genes in a sequential regulatory cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Immediate-early (IE or &#x003b1;) gene products are the first group to be transcribed followed by early (E or &#x003b2;) and late (L or &#x003b3;) gene expressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Expression of E and L genes depends on the availability of IE proteins, thus demonstrating their importance in the lytic cycle. During lytic infection, viral DNA is not associated with nucleosomes. HSV-1, like other alphaviruses, also establishes latent infections in sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast to lytic infection, latency is distinguished by the absence of viral polypeptides and a highly restricted pattern of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Studies of HSV-1 latency in animal models have indicated that the majority of viral DNA is maintained in a circular form and associated with nucleosomes in a regularly spaced chromatin pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, detailed studies of latent viral chromatin have been difficult to conduct and the role of chromatin in viral latency remains to be defined.</p><p>We hypothesize that a repressive chromatin structure and specific neuronal transcription factors contribute to transcription inhibition during latency. We identified a Restrictive Element-1/Neuronal Restrictive Silencer Element (RE-1/NRSE) located between the promoters for the Immediate-Early ICP4 and ICP22 genes. RE-1/NRSE is the binding site of RE1-Silencing Transcription factor/Neuronal Restrictive Silencer Factor (REST/NRSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. REST/NRSF is a zinc finger transcription factor originally defined as a silencer protein for the neuron-specific gene SCG10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recent studies revealed that REST/NRSF exhibits ubiquitous presence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and plays roles in neurogenesis, neural plasticity, tumor suppression, and cancer progression through transcription regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. REST/NRSF and its corepressor complex CoREST have not been linked to HSV-1 biology until recent studies showing that the HSV-1 IE protein ICP0 dissociates HDAC 1 and 2 from the REST/CoREST complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the putative role of REST/NRSF on HSV-1 transcription has not been elucidated.</p><p>We investigated the effect of REST/NRSF on HSV-1 IE transcription using an episomally replicating plasmid that associates with nucleosomes in a standard chromatin configuration in stably transfected cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Plasmids containing the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene driven by either ICP4 or ICP22 promoter were characterized in transient transfections and in stably transformed cells. In transient transfections, REST/NRSF repressed the activity of both the ICP22 and ICP4 promoters. However, in stably transfected cells, REST/NRSF exhibited significant inhibition of the ICP4 promoter but only moderate reduction on ICP22 activity in chromatin context. The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A was sufficient to reverse the inhibition of ICP4 in stable cells, indicating the role of histone deacetylation in REST/NRSF mediated regulation in this system. ChIP assays revealed that CoREST was recruited to the proximity of HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE and that histone H4 acetylation was reduced in the presence of REST/NRSF. These results demonstrate the roles of REST/NRSF in the regulation of HSV-1 IE transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>A putative RE-1/NRSE was found within the promoter of HSV-1 ICP22</title><p>We identified a putative HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE having 76% identity to the published consensus sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] in the intergenic region between the ICP4 and ICP22 coding sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The location of various <italic>cis-</italic>acting elements was shown according to literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The HSV-1 RE-1 core sequence exhibited 100% identity to the consensus RE-1/NRSE. This HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE is located immediately downstream of the TATA box of the ICP22 promoter and 660 bp upstream of the ICP4 transcription initiation site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>HSV-1 genome and HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE sequence</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

We performed cotransfection of pICP22 (containing the SEAP reporter gene under the control of the ICP22 promoter) and pFLAG-REST into 293HEK cells at the molar ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 (pICP22: pFLAG-REST). SEAP assays were performed three days post-transfection according to the manufacturer's protocols. The results indicated that the REST/NRSF repressed the ICP22 promoter activity to 23% and 9% of control levels at the ratio of 1:1 and 1:2, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Similar co-transfections were done with pCMVp73, which expresses a truncated form of REST/NRSF containing only the protein's DNA binding domain. The ICP22 promoter retained 70&#x02013;80% of its activity in the presence of REST/NRSF mutant p73 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

Cotransfection of pICP4 and pFLAG-REST at the molar ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 (pICP4: pFLAG-REST) revealed that REST/NRSF inhibited the ICP4 promoter activity to 2.5% and 1.2%, respectively, (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The mutant vector pCMVp73 exerted only a weak repressive effect on the promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

It is noted that both pSG28 and pH4-2 contain the complete open reading frame of ICP4, LAT, and ICP0. The RT-PCR results indicated that REST/NRSF and mutant p73 exhibited no major effect on the ICP4 promoter of pSG28, which does not have HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). However, the ICP4 promoter of pH4-2 (containing HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE) was significantly repressed by REST/NRSF but not p73, which showed no inhibition at all (Lane 4, 5, and 6, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The quantification analysis revealed that 62% of ICP4 promoter activity in pH4-2 was repressed by REST/NRSF, compared to 28% in pSG28 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>; black bar, lane 4 and 5). In addition, REST/NRSF exhibited no repression on LAT and ICP0 transcription in both plasmids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, white and gray bars).

The stable cells containing pICP22 or pICP4 were established after 10 days of selection. To examine the chromatin structure of the episomal plasmids, nuclei from parental and stable cells were again subjected to different concentrations of MNase digestion followed by Southern blot hybridization. Ethidium bromide staining of the agarose gel revealed the nucleosome protected ladder characteristic of genomic DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, Lane 1&#x02013;3), indicating that the protocol of MNase digestion was effective. Southern hybridization showed a plasmid-specific nucleosome protected ladder resembling the genomic ladder (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, Lane 4 to 6). The nucleosomal ladder of Southern hybridization is not an artifact since the samples from parental cells exhibited no signal at all (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the plasmids are associated with nucleosomes in the stably transfected cells. To test for integration of plasmids in cells, total DNA purified from stable cells and plasmid DNA was digested with NcoI, which cuts the plasmid once, followed by Southern blot hybridization using vector probe. The results detected a single band with the size of 11.2 kb, equivalent to the size of the original plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

The mutant oligo showed no band shifting, indicating that core sequence of HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE is critical for the interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, lane 3). The competition analysis using unlabeled wild-type oligo abolished the shifted bands, indicating that the interaction is specific (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, lane 5 and 6).</p><p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo </italic>binding of REST/NRSF to the HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE, we performed ChIP using anti-FLAG<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>M2 Affinity Gel.

The interaction of mutant p73 was not detected due to the lack of FLAG-tag. In addition, only a very weak signal was detected using primers against hygromycin B resistance gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, HGB control), indicating that the binding of REST/NRSF was specific to the promoter region and the shearing of minichromosome was sufficient. These results indicated that REST/NRSF and mutant p73 bound to the HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE.</p></sec><sec><title>REST/NRSF reduced the acetylation of histone H4 and CoREST was recruited to the proximity of the ICP4 promoter</title><p>To analyze the participation of corepressor to HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE, we performed ChIP using the anti-CoREST antibody. The results showed a much stronger signal from the FLAG-REST transfected samples, indicating that CoREST is recruited to HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE through REST/NRSF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, anti-CoREST ChIP). We further investigated the histone acetylation status by the same method using antibody against acetylated histone H4. The results revealed that acetylation was reduced in the presence of REST/NRSF compared to the control and p73 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). These results indicated that CoREST is recruited to the HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE via the interaction of REST/NRSF in a chromatin context and this interaction reduced the histone acetylation of histone H4 in the proximity of HSV-1 IE promoters.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identified a RE-1/NRSE site in the HSV-1 genome between the ICP4 and ICP22 Immediate Early promoters and showed that REST/NRSF exerted a chromatin state-dependant repressive effect on the activity of these promoters. In stably transformed cells, the plasmids pICP4 and pICP22, respectively containing the HSV-1 ICP4 and ICP22 promoters and the SEAP reporter gene, associated with nucleosomes in a regular chromatin array. Thus the chromatin structure of these promoters should resemble their structure in latently infected cells more closely than in any other available model system. Transfection of pFLAG-REST into these cells resulted in a substantial decrease in ICP4 promoter activity. This effect required the effector domain of REST/NRSF since pCMVp73, which contains only the DNA-binding domain, had little effect on the ICP4 promoter. Repression of the ICP4 promoter by REST/NRSF was reversed by Trichostatin A, suggesting that it was mediated, at least in part, by histone deacetylation. This was confirmed by ChIP analysis, which showed a significant reduction in the amount of acetylated histone H4 associated with the ICP4 promoter in pFLAG-REST transfected cells. Consistent with this, ChIP analysis also showed that CoREST, which is able to recruit histone deacetylases, was also associated with the ICP4 promoter in pFLAG-REST transfected cells. This was further supported by the p73 data, which indicated that the REST/NRSF mutant lacking effector region does not recruit CoREST to the promoter and failed to deacetylate histone H4 at the promoter. In contrast to the ICP4 promoter, the ICP22 promoter was relatively insensitive to repression by REST/NRSF. Since the RE-1/NRSE is located approximately 660 bp upstream of the ICP4 promoter but is adjacent to the ICP22 TATA box, this may be due to directional or distance-dependent effects, or it may indicate that REST/NRSF is able to exert promoter-specific effects in a chromatin context.</p><p>In transiently transfected cells, the transfected plasmids do not associate with nucleosomes in a regular chromatin pattern and thus resemble viral DNA in lytically infected cells. REST/NRSF repressed both the ICP4 and ICP22 promoter in these cells. In these conditions, repression of transcription from the ICP22 promoter might be due to steric hindrance of the TATA box and/or the transcription initiation site. However, repression of the ICP4 promoter must be due to other repressive effects of REST/NRSF.</p><p>ICP22 and ICP4 have fundamentally different roles in HSV-1 replication. ICP4 is essential for expression of E and L genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. ICP22 is not essential, but is required for efficient replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and transcription of HSV in certain cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It is needed for maximal expression of the &#x003b3;1 and &#x003b3;2 genes, probably due to the fact that ICP22 induces phosphorylation on the large subunit of cellular RNA polymerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The role of ICP22 in HSV-1 latency is not fully understood. No direct role for ICP22 in establishment or maintenance of latent infection has been demonstrated. However, given the transactivating effect of ICP4, it may be more important for the virus to effectively repress this promoter during these phases of latency, and this may be mediated by REST/NRSF.</p><p>This study complements a recent report showing that CoREST, a component of corepressor complex REST/CoREST/HDACs, exhibits a sequence similarity at the amino terminus to HSV-1 IE protein ICP0, and that the HDACs may be dissociated from the corepressor complex by ICP0 in cells infected by wild-type viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, the authors predicted that the REST/CoREST/HDACs complex could cause HSV-1 gene silencing at low multiplicities of infection (MOI). Our results revealed that CoREST is recruited to HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE in the presence of REST/NRSF, supporting the hypothesis that REST/CoREST complexes participated in the regulatory effect on HSV-1 IE genes. We predict this mechanism applies to HSV-1 latent infection since REST/NRSF is present in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This is supported by studies showing that HSV mutants lacking functional ICP0 exhibit poor reactivation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, at low MOI, nonneuronal cells infected with ICP0 deletion mutants produce about 100-fold less virus compared to cells infected with wild-type virus. In these experiments, the lack of ICP0 may have resulted in the failure to disrupt the inhibitory effect of the REST/CoREST/HDACs complex on IE genes. Our results showed that REST/NRSF inhibited ICP4 promoter activity in a chromatin context, suggesting REST/NRSF and repressive chromatin could maintain gene silencing during the establishment of a transcriptionally silent state and could provide a possible mechanism for long-term persistence through histone modification. Histone modification is suggested to regulate transcription through a mechanism of "histone code"[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our ChIP analysis indicated that at least one type of histone modification (acetylation of histone H4) participated in the gene regulation. It is not clear why REST/NRSF failed to repress the ICP22 promoter activity in a chromatin context. However, other nearby <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements may modulate the effects of REST/NRSF. Sequence analysis indicates that the OriS, located between the ICP4 and ICP22 promoters, may fold into a stable hairpin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A recent study suggested that the OriS stem-loop structure encodes a microRNA that may regulate HSV and host gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Our hypothesis is that a chromatin insulator-like element participated in the regulation of ICP22. Another recent study identified a cluster of CTCF motifs, designated CTRS3, in the intron of the ICP22 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. CTCF elements can function as insulators shielding genes in one region of a chromosome from the regulatory effects of another region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Two classes of insulators have been reported, enhancer-blocking and boundary/barrier elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The former impedes the enhancer function and the latter prevents the spreading of repressive heterochromatin into the transcriptionally active area. Based on our results, we predict that CTRS3 and/or OriS act as a boundary/barrier element to prevent the repressive chromatin from spreading to the ICP22 promoter and thus aborted the inhibitory effect of REST/NRSF on ICP22 in the presence of nucleosomes. Further studies using neuronal models and promoter deletion are required to elucidate the complex regulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have provided the first direct evidence indicating that REST/NRSF can regulate HSV-1 IE gene expression. We propose that during the establishment and maintenance of latent infection, REST/NRSF binds to the HSV-1 RE-1/NRSE in a chromatin context and recruits CoREST/HDAC complexes. As a result, the repressor complexes inhibit the ICP4 transcription and produce long-term repression via histone deacetylation, and possibly chromatin methylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). More experiments are underway to investigate the role of REST/NRSF on HSV-1 gene regulation using neuronal cells and animal models.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed model of HSV-1 ICP4 and ICP22 regulation by REST/NRSF</bold>.
