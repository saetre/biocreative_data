They are an important energy source, form an essential part of the phospholipid bilayer of membranes, and function as precursors to several signaling molecules, such as the eicosanoids. A huge body of literature collected in the past few decades provides compelling evidence that changes in the dietary fatty acid composition can profoundly influence health and disease. For example, it is well established that replacing dietary saturated fatty acids with n-6 mono- and polyunsaturated leads to a decrease in plasma concentration of low density lipoprotein, which is a well-known risk factor for atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Katan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, increased consumption of n-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid present in fish oil, is associated with decreased plasma triglyceride concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Harris1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, may prevent against cardiac arrhythmias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Leaf1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, and improves visual acuity in preterm infants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Cheatham1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Numerous molecular mechanisms may underlie the effects of dietary fatty acids on parameters of health. While historically the main focus was on changes in plasma membrane fluidity as a result of changes in phospholipid composition, the discovery of nuclear receptors has progressively shifted the emphasis to regulation of gene expression.</p><p>The superfamily of nuclear receptors encompasses a related but diverse set of transcription factors that share a number of structural and functional features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Gronemeyer1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. They consist of a central DNA-binding domain that directs the receptor to specific DNA sequences within a gene promoter, and a ligand-binding domain, which can accommodate a variety of different compounds. Roughly, nuclear receptors can be divided into three main groups: the endocrine receptors that bind steroid hormones, the adopted orphan receptors that bind dietary lipids, and the orphan receptors, for which no ligand exists or still has to be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Chawla1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The adopted orphan receptors share a common mode of action that involves heterodimerization with the nuclear Retinoid X Receptor (RXR). Binding of ligands to the receptor leads to recruitment of co-activators and dissociation of co-repressors, resulting in chromatin remodeling followed by initiation of DNA transcription. Adopted orphan receptors mainly function as lipid sensors by altering the rate of transcription of specific genes in response to changes in lipid concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Chawla1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These lipids include oxysterols, bile acids, and fat soluble vitamins. In addition, many adopted orphan receptors have been shown to bind fatty acids and alter transcription in response to changes in fatty acid concentration and/or composition, including RXR, Peroxisome-Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPAR&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;/&#x003b4; and &#x003b3;), Hepatic Nuclear Factor 4&#x003b1; (HNF-4&#x003b1;), Liver X Receptor (LXR) &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, and Farnesoid X Receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Sampath1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Pgorier1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Other receptors that mediate the effects of dietary fatty acids on gene expression include the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1, and the Nuclear factor kappaB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Sampath1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the relative contribution of all these receptors to fatty acid-dependent gene regulation in vivo remains completely unclear.</p><p>Here, we take advantage of a unique experimental design using synthetic triglycerides composed of one single fatty acid in combination with gene expression profiling to examine the effects of individual dietary fatty acids on hepatic gene expression in mice. By conducting these experiments in wild-type and PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, we were able to explore the specific contribution of PPAR&#x003b1;. We conclude that the effects of dietary unsaturated fatty acids on hepatic gene expression are almost exclusively mediated by PPAR&#x003b1; and mimic those of synthetic PPAR&#x003b1; agonists in terms of target genes regulation and molecular mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Mice that were fasted for 4 hours were given a single oral dose (400 &#x000b5;l) of synthetic triglycerides (TGs) consisting of one single fatty acid, followed by collection of tissues 6 hours thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001681-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A parallel treatment in mice lacking PPAR&#x003b1; was performed to enable estimation of the importance of PPAR&#x003b1; in gene regulation by dietary fatty acids. The fatty acids studied were oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), linolenic acid (C18:3), eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5), and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6). No saturated fatty acids were included because triglycerides composed of common dietary saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and could not be administered orally. The 6-hour time point was chosen because in an independent oral fat load experiment, plasma triglyceride (TG) levels peaked 2 hours after the fat load and almost returned back to baseline after 6 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001681.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), indicating that at that point most of the fat bolus has been cleared from the blood and taken up by the tissues. Indeed, we observed that 6 hours after oral dosing plasma TG levels had almost returned to baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001681.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), and were similar in WT and PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, suggesting no major differences in plasma TG kinetics between the various fatty acids and between WT and PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212;. Also, no major differences in the rate of intestinal TG absorption were observed between WT and PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001681.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Finally, while as expected liver TG levels were higher in the PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice compared to WT mice, in the WT mice liver TG levels were similar between the various fatty acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001681.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). These data argue against major differences in metabolic processing of dietary fat between WT and PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice and between different dietary fatty acids.</p><fig id="pone-0001681-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001681.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of dietary intervention.</title><p>Wild-type and PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice fasted for 4 hours were given a single oral dose of different synthetic triglycerides composed of one single unsaturated fatty acid (400 &#x000b5;l), or one of the PPAR&#x003b1; agonists WY14643 or fenofibrate (4 mg).

Use of Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays (whole mouse genome array), which contain more than 45000 probesets corresponding to over 34000 genes, allows for a genome-wide analysis of the number of significantly changed genes in the various treatment groups. After inter-quartile range (IQR) filtering, 11463 probesets (equivalent to 7231 genes) were left for analysis. A regularized t-test was performed to analyze changes in gene expression between the control and oral triglyceride group. The regularized t-test statistic has the same interpretation as an ordinary t-test statistic, except that the standard errors have been moderated across genes, i.e. shrunk to a common value, using a Bayesian model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Smyth1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

As expected, gene regulation by WY14643 and fenofibrate in WT mice was almost completely abolished in PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. Surprisingly, a similar though slightly less extreme picture was observed for dietary unsaturated fatty acids. Indeed, the far majority of genes regulated by dietary unsaturated fatty acids in WT mice did not show regulation in PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, indicating PPAR&#x003b1;-dependent regulation. This was highest for C20:5 (94.6&#x00025;), followed by C22:6 (93.1&#x00025;), C18:1 (88.6&#x00025;), C18:2 (87.1&#x00025;) and C18:3 (84.0&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001681-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001681.s004">table S1</xref>).

Remarkably, C22:6 showed a huge overlap in gene regulation with WY14643 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001681-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Quantitatively, 84&#x00025; of genes upregulated and 76&#x00025; of genes downregulated by C22:6 (P&#x0003c;0.01) were also regulated by WY14643 (average 80.5&#x00025;), suggesting that C22:6 impacts mainly PPAR&#x003b1; target genes. Much less overlap was observed between C18:1 and WY14643 (average 32.4&#x00025;), suggesting that gene regulation by C18:1 may be less dependent on PPAR&#x003b1;, or alternatively the existence of PPAR&#x003b1; target genes specifically regulated by C18:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001681-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). An intermediate degree of overlap was observed between WY14643 and the other fatty acids studied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001681.s005">Table S2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001681-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001681.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Similarities between two dietary unsaturated fatty acids and the synthetic PPAR&#x003b1; agonist WY14643.</title><p>(A) Venn diagrams showing the overlap in up- (left panel) and downregulated (right panel) genes after treatment with WY14643, C22:6 and C18:1.

In constructing the scatter plots, all probesets left after IQR-filtering were used. (C) Overlap in overrepresented Gene Ontology classes between C22:6, C18:1, and WY14643, based on a functional class score (FCS) method. The GO class unique to C22:6 and C18:1 is GO:0016070 (RNA metabolism), whereas the GO classes unique to C18:1 are GO:0007409 (axonogenesis) and GO:0016072 (rRNA metabolism).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001681.g003"/></fig><p>To further compare the effects of WY14643 and C22:6 on gene expression, for all probesets left after IQR-filtering the fold-changes in expression in response to WY14643 and C22:6 were plotted against each other, with each probeset represented by a single dot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001681-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The vast majority of probesets ended up in the lower left or upper right compartments, indicating that genes up- or downregulated by WY14643 were also up- or downregulated by C22:6, respectively, thus confirming the overlap in gene regulation between C22:6 and WY14643. Additionally, the positioning of the dots around a straight line with slope &#x0003c;1 shows that the relative magnitude of gene induction by C22:6 related to WY14643 was remarkably constant across all probesets. Thus, compared to WY14643, C22:6 behaves as an almost equally specific, yet less potent PPAR&#x003b1; agonist. Nevertheless, several genes could be identified that were upregulated disproportionally strongly by WY14643 including <italic>Cd36</italic>, <italic>Fabp4</italic> (<italic>aP2</italic>), and <italic>Cpt1b</italic>, or by C22:6 including <italic>Prlr</italic> and <italic>Txnip</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001681-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). A much more scattered picture was observed for the comparison between WY14643 and C18:1, indicating that these compounds have much less in common in terms of gene regulation. Again, the other fatty acids gave an intermediate picture (data not shown).</p><p>An alternative approach to study similarities in gene regulation is via determining the overlap in Gene Ontology (GO) classes overrepresented in the respective treatment groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001681.s006">Table S3</xref>). P-values derived from t-test for all &#x0223c;45000 probesets on the microarray were used for the GO-based functional clustering. The comparisons were made between the control group and each treatment group in wild-type mice. Out of a total of 19 GO classes overrepresented after C22:6 treatment, only one class (GO:0016070, RNA metabolism) was not shared between C22:6 and WY14643 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001681-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, this GO class was shared between C22:6 and C18:1 suggesting it may be specifically regulated by dietary unsaturated fatty acids and not WY14643. The remainder of fatty acids studied, except for perhaps C18:1, similarly showed a high degree of overlap with WY14643 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001681.s007">Table S4</xref>), thereby corroborating the very large resemblance in gene regulation between WY14643 and the dietary fatty acids studied. Overall, these data support the dominant role of PPAR&#x003b1; in gene regulation by dietary unsaturated fat.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Hierarchy between dietary unsaturated fatty acids</title><p>Of all fatty acids studied, the number of significantly changed genes was highest for C22:6, followed by C18:3. The number was about equal for C20:5 and C18:2, while much fewer genes were changed after C18:1 treatment. Since the dietary fatty acids regulated gene expression principally via PPAR&#x003b1;, the data are indicative of a hierarchy in <italic>in vivo</italic> PPAR&#x003b1;-activating potency between dietary unsaturated fatty acids. Direct evidence for this notion came from comparison of fold-changes in expression of PPAR&#x003b1; target genes between the various fatty acid treatments. Genes involved in two major PPAR&#x003b1;-regulated pathways were examined: mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001681-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

RXR forms a permissive heterodimer with PPAR&#x003b1; and accordingly it may be theorized that transcriptional activation of PPAR target genes by fatty acids may occur via their binding to either the PPAR&#x003b1; and/or RXR moiety. The loss of fatty acid-dependent gene regulation in PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, the very large overlap in gene regulation between unsaturated fatty acids and WY14643, and the less potent binding of fatty acids to RXR relative to PPAR&#x003b1; strongly suggest a dominant role for PPAR&#x003b1; in gene regulation by unsaturated fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-deUrquiza1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Goldstein1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Stafslien1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-VandenHeuvel1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

It remains to be investigated to what extent the dominant role of PPAR&#x003b1; in gene regulation by unsaturated fatty acids extends to tissues other than liver. Likely, the relative role of other transcription factors is related to their relative expression in a particular tissue.</p><p>Although it is clear that gene regulation by unsaturated fatty acids is highly dependent on PPAR&#x003b1;, genes that are regulated in a PPAR&#x003b1;-dependent manner do not necessarily represent direct PPAR&#x003b1; targets. Some regulation is also expected to occur indirectly via activation of other transcription factors that are under direct control of PPAR&#x003b1;. Analysis of the microarray data showed very little changes in the expression of other nuclear receptors in response to the intervention with the exception of CAR, which was upregulated, and RXR&#x003b1; and AhR, which were downregulated, although not necessarily in all treatments.

Secondary gene regulation was likely kept to a minimum by harvesting the livers only six hours after the oral gavage. It should also be noted that none of the putative fatty acid responsive transcription factors were significantly decreased in PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, suggesting that their transcriptional regulatory function is not intrinsically suppressed in PPAR&#x003b1; &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.</p><p>Our study shows a clear hierarchy between unsaturated dietary fatty acids in terms of number of significantly changed genes and fold-induction of genes, with especially C22:6 behaving as a highly potent inducer of PPAR&#x003b1;-dependent gene expression. The difference in <italic>in vivo</italic> PPAR&#x003b1;-activating potency between the dietary fatty acids was reproduced <italic>in vitro</italic> and thus suggest an intrinsic difference in PPAR&#x003b1;-activating potency between dietary unsaturated fatty acids, which is supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> receptor binding and transactivation studies and thus likely reflects differences in binding affinity for PPAR&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Xu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Hertz1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Fan1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Even though C18:2 was not the most potent inducer of gene expression, one could speculate that it likely represents the quantitatively most important dietary activator of PPAR&#x003b1;, as the average intake of C18:2 is much higher than that of C18:3, C20:5 and C22:6.</p><p>In recent years, the concept of Selective PPAR Modulators (SPPARM) has emerged by analogy to Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERM). According to this concept, different PPAR agonists would induce differential gene expression based on selective receptor-coregulator interactions. While recent evidence supports the concept of selective PPAR&#x003b3; modulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Berger1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Feige1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, only limited data are available on PPAR&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Duez1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. The design of our study allowed us to explore the concept of SPPARM in the comparison between unsaturated fatty acids and synthetic agonists. We hypothesized that fatty acids and synthetic PPAR&#x003b1; agonists, while both activating PPAR&#x003b1;, may induce differential gene expression patterns possibly via selective receptor-coregulator interactions.</p><p>In our analysis we found that almost every gene significantly up- or downregulated by C22:6 was also significantly up- or downregulated by WY14643, respectively. Clearly, the reverse was not true, illustrating that WY14643 is a more potent PPAR&#x003b1; agonist than C22:6. Importantly, the scatter plot indicated that across all probesets the relative induction of gene expression by C22:6 when related to WY14643 was remarkably constant, suggesting that C22:6 behaves as a less potent, yet almost equally specific PPAR&#x003b1; agonist. Nevertheless, several genes could be identified that were upregulated disproportionally strongly by WY14643 including <italic>Cd36</italic>, <italic>Fabp4</italic> (<italic>aP2</italic>), and <italic>Cpt1b</italic>, or by C22:6 including <italic>Prlr</italic> and <italic>Txnip</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001681-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, differences in gene regulation between C22:6 and WY14643 could not entirely be accounted for by the lesser potency of C22:6. Interestingly, using the Nuclear Receptor PamChip&#x000ae; assay, at least 4 interactions, representing the coregulator proteins TRIP3, TRIP8, RIP140, and the nuclear receptor SHP1, seemed to be stimulated specifically by WY14643. However, no PPAR&#x003b1;-coregulator interactions could be identified that were stimulated specifically by C22:6 and not WY14643.</p><p>Overall, similar observations were made for the other fatty acids studied, although compared to C22:6 they were less potent and/or less specific activators of PPAR&#x003b1;, especially C18:1. The data indicate that in general dietary PUFAs mimic the effect of WY14643 on hepatic gene expression in terms of regulation of target genes and molecular mechanism, including coregulator interactions. In addition to being a more potent PPAR&#x003b1; agonist in comparison with unsaturated fatty acids, WY14643 dysproportionally induces expression of specific genes, which may be mediated via interactions with specific coactivator proteins including RIP140. Thus, our data underscore the concept of selective PPAR&#x003b1; modulation when comparing WY14643 with endogenous PPAR&#x003b1; agonists, e.g. PUFAs.</p><p>Currently, one major drawback when performing microarray analyses on data derived from dietary intervention studies is the lack of proper statistical tools. The statistical methods developed to cope with the huge amount of data derived from microarray analyses work sufficiently well for stronger interventions, such as drug studies. When dealing with nutrition, however, changes in gene expression are often weak although no less important. Multiple testing methods normally used in microarray analyses to correct for false positives include FDR (false discovery rate) and Q-value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Hochberg1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001681-Storey1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. These methods are usually too restrictive for nutritional intervention, however, and will result in a loss of important results, as became apparent in the present study. Use of Q-value instead of P-value resulted in loss of a considerable amount of important information (data not shown). Numerous quantitative real-time PCR reactions have been carried out on the livers from this study supporting the use of the P-value.</p><p>In conclusion, dietary unsaturated fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid and other PUFAs, acutely influence gene expression in mouse liver which, despite the presence of numerous other putative fatty acid-dependent transcription factors, is almost entirely mediated by PPAR&#x003b1;. Consequently, dietary PUFAs largely mimic the effect of synthetic PPAR&#x003b1; agonists on hepatic gene expression, both in terms of regulation of specific target genes and molecular mechanism including coregulator interactions, although compared to WY14643 and fenofibrate they are clearly less potent PPAR&#x003b1; agonists. Our analysis underscores the power of a (nutri)genomics approach to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of specific dietary components on (biomarkers of) health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>WY14643 was purchased from ChemSyn Laboratories (Lenexa, KS, USA).
