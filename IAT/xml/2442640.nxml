Early after intranasal infection, tracheal CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs migrated to the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs), acquiring co-stimulatory molecules in the process. This emigration from the lung was followed by an accumulation of CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs in the trachea and lung interstitium. In the MLNs, the CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs contained abundant viral nucleoprotein (NP), but these cells failed to present antigen to CD4 or CD8 T cells, whereas resident CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs presented to CD8 cells, and migratory CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs presented to CD4 and CD8 T cells. When lung CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs and macrophages or langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs were depleted using either CD11c&#x02013;diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) or langerin-DTR mice, the development of virus-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells was severely delayed, which correlated with increased clinical severity and a delayed viral clearance. 120G8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD11c<sup>int</sup> pDCs also accumulated in the lung and LNs carrying viral NP, but in their absence, there was no effect on viral clearance or clinical severity. Rather, in pDC-depleted mice, there was a reduction in antiviral antibody production after lung clearance of the virus. This suggests that multiple DCs are endowed with different tasks in mediating protection against influenza virus.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; cDC, conventional DC; dpi, days postinfection; DTR, diphtheria toxin receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; HI, HA inhibition; i.n., intranasal; i.t., intratracheal; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; MLN, mediastinal lymph node; mPDCA-1, mouse pDC antigen 1; NP, nucleoprotein; pDC, plasmacytoid DC; Tg, transgenic.</p></fn><fn><p>G.F.

The way in which the innate and adaptive immune systems initially recognize and deal with replicating virus could be decisive in determining the outcome of infection, as this might heavily influence the kinetics of viral clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Little is known about the initial recognition event of influenza virus by the lung immune system in vivo<italic>.</italic></p><p>In immediate response to viral infection, innate defense mechanisms consist of high level production of type I IFNs by infected epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and natural IFN-producing cells (also known as preplasmacytoid DCs [pre-pDCs]), as well as the recruitment of conventional DCs (cDCs), neutrophils, and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). By expressing a wide array of microbial pattern recognition receptors shared with cells of the innate immune response, and at the same time displaying the potential to process and present antigen to naive T cells, DCs bridge innate and adaptive immunity. After recognizing foreign antigen in the periphery of the body, DCs migrate via afferent lymphatics into the draining LNs, where they can induce antigen-specific protective CD8 CTL responses, as well as CD4 T helper cells that enforce cellular and humoral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>In the lung, DCs are situated in immediate proximity to the respiratory epithelial cells, where they form an elaborate network that rapidly reacts to all kinds of foreign antigens and inflammatory stimuli, including respiratory viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Different DC subsets can be found in the lung, each with a functional specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In the mouse, all DC subsets express the integrin CD11c, and subsets are further defined based on the expression of the marker CD11b, as well as anatomical location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). The trachea and large conducting airways have a well-developed network of intraepithelial DCs, even in steady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). These cells have been shown to express langerin and CD103 while lacking expression of CD11b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In the submucosa of the conducting airways, CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cDCs can be found, particularly under conditions of inflammation, and these cells might be particularly suited for priming and restimulating effector CD4 cells in the lung in response to protein antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). The lung interstitium that is accessible by enzymatic digestion also contains CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs that access the alveolar lumen and migrate to the mediastinal LNs (MLNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In the nearby alveolar lumen, CD11c<sup>hi</sup> alveolar macrophages control the function of these interstitial DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). pDCs are CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11c<sup>int</sup> cells expressing SiglecH and bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (recognized by the mAbs mouse pDC antigen 1 [mPDCA-1] or 120G8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). In the lungs, pDCs are predominantly found in the lung interstitium and produce large amounts of IFN-&#x003b1; in response to triggering by CpG motifs or viral infection ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Under particular conditions, lung pDCs can prevent immunopathology in response to inhalation of harmless antigens or in response to respiratory syncitial virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).</p><p>Several investigators have studied the involvement of APCs such as DCs, macrophages, and B cells in mediating protective immunity to influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). It was previously shown that a mouse-adapted strain of influenza virus induced the in vivo maturation of CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) and their migration to the MLNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). DCs isolated ex vivo from the MLNs of influenza-infected mice presented viral nucleoprotein (NP)-derived peptides to virus-specific CD8 T cells in vitro for at least 10 d, a peak occurring &#x0223c;72 h after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). In humans, both monocyte-derived DCs and pDCs were shown to be capable of activating already primed influenza-specific T cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) and upon adoptive transfer in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>).</p><p>Although these studies certainly suggest the strong involvement of DCs in mediating protective immunity to influenza A virus, direct description of the functional in vivo involvement of the now well-described DC subsets in the different compartments of the lung during early infection is lacking. In this paper, using eight-color flow cytometry, we have carefully studied the kinetics of the reaction of different DC subsets and alveolar macrophages in various lung compartments to intranasal (i.n.) infection with influenza virus X-31 (H3N2), focusing particularly on CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subsets, as well as on pDCs, describing which subsets carry viral NP to the nodes, and carefully dissecting which subsets present antigen to specific CD8 and CD4 T cells. Using genetic cell-specific targeting techniques, CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs and macrophages or langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs could be depleted in CD11c&#x02013;diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) or langerin-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), and pDCs could be depleted using mAbs. Collectively, our results demonstrate that different DC subsets perform specialized tasks during the primary encounter with influenza virus in the lung.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Lung DC subtypes and alveolar macrophages respond to influenza virus infection differentially</title><p>As expected after i.n. inoculation with 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> tissue culture ID<sub>50</sub> influenza A virus X-31 (H3N2), there was induction of vigorous innate and adaptive immune responses in the lung. The innate cellular immune response was already present 1 day postinfection (dpi) and peaked at 4 dpi, exemplified by a strong increase in neutrophils. B lymphocytes (CD19<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) were present in the lung by day 4 and peaked around day 10. Total CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the lung peaked around day 10 (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071365/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071365/DC1</ext-link>). To investigate the number of DC subsets and macrophages after influenza virus infection, enzymatically digested lungs (from which the large conducting airways were dissected) were analyzed at different time points after infection by eight-color flow cytometry. Digested lung cells were first gated for live leukocytes and expression of the panleukocyte marker CD45. cDCs were characterized as low fluorescent cells, with a CD45<sup>hi</sup>, MHCII<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>hi</sup> phenotype (Fig. S2 A), and further subdivided into CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). As previously described, pDCs were small, low autofluorescent cells expressing a CD45<sup>hi</sup>, CD11b<sup>lo</sup>, MHC<sup>int</sup> CD11c<sup>int</sup> mPDCA-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> phenotype (Fig. S2 B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Alveolar macrophages were identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid as highly fluorescent cells with a CD11c<sup>hi</sup>, CD11b<sup>lo</sup>, MHCII<sup>lo</sup>, F4/80<sup>hi</sup> phenotype (Fig. S2 C). The use of CD11c and CD11b expression in combination with the autofluorescence typically seen in alveolar macrophages adequately discriminated alveolar DCs from macrophages, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>In the mock situation, 65% of CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs were CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and 35% were CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. After infection with influenza virus X-31, a significant increase in both CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) lung DCs was seen from 2 dpi, and these DC subsets remained increased up to at least 10 dpi. The DCs expressed high levels of MHCII and up-regulated maturation markers such as CD86 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>), CD40, CD80, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (not depicted). The increase in the expression level of these markers peaked shortly after inoculation (2 d) and gradually returned back to the levels seen in mock-infected mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>, bar graphs). In contrast, the number of pDCs peaked shortly after infection (2 dpi) and then returned to baseline conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). This increased recruitment of pDCs was accompanied by a distinct but very transient up-regulation of maturation markers (CD86 is shown). Alveolar macrophages were studied in the BAL fluid accessible by BAL. This compartment contains a large amount of resident alveolar macrophages in mock situation. After influenza virus infection, there was a nonsignificant trend of increase in the alveolar macrophage number at 4 dpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), accompanied by a temporary increase in CD86 and a more continual increase in MHCII expression (mean fluorescence intensity [MFI] of 820 in mock and 2,769 at 10 dpi).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Number and surface phenotype of mouse lung CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD11b</bold><sup>&#x02212;</sup><bold>DCs, pDCs, and alveolar macrophages after influenza infection.</bold> Populations were gated as shown in Fig. S2 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071365/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071365/DC1</ext-link>) and as indicated by the gates in the left column of each panel.

After infection, there was an increase in MHCII<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells at 2 dpi, and cells had a more rounded appearance, making it difficult to quantify DC density. At 4 dpi, there was a strong decrease in the density of cells staining for MHCII, followed by a restoration to baseline density and morphology by 10 dpi. To better quantify these changes, eight-color flow cytometry was performed on tracheal digestions, demonstrating considerable heterogeneity in DCs at various time points after infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In the mock situation, all CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MHCII<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells expressed CD11c, identifying them as DCs. The majority of these cells (&#x0223c;75%) were CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and expressed the mucosal &#x003b1;<sub>E</sub> integrin marker CD103 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). At 2 dpi, this subset was depleted from the tracheal digest and a majority of cells now expressed CD11b but lacked CD103, which was most consistent with the phenotype of a freshly recruited monocyte-derived DC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>).

To study the immune response against influenza virus infection with and without CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs, CD11c-DTR mice were treated with DT intratracheally (i.t.) 1 d before infection with influenza virus X-31. By this localized treatment, lung CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs (both CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and alveolar macrophages were efficiently depleted from the lungs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In the trachea, the localized treatment with DT led to a reduction of CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, but not to depletion of CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071365/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071365/DC1</ext-link>) or pDCs (not depicted). In the MLNs, all DC subsets were partially depleted after DT treatment, with the biggest depletion occurring in the resident CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs (Fig. S3 B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>).

At different time points after infection, the clinical immune response and viral replication were analyzed. First, clinical severity of infection was determined by measuring body weight. In general, mice show a maximal 10% weight loss after a mild X-31 infection and rapidly regain weight once the virus has been cleared from the lungs. When CD11c-DTR Tg mice were treated with DT before infection, the clinical severity of infection dramatically increased and mice lost up to 20% of their weight, representing a sublethal infection. This weight loss could not be attributed to DT treatment, as the control group, which was treated with DT before mock infection, did not lose weight (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). As weight loss might be related to the initial severity of infection or failure of the immune system to clear infectious particles from the lung, we next studied the generation of an efficient immune response in CD11c<sup>hi</sup>&#x02013;depleted mice. For efficient lung clearance of a primary influenza virus infection, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CTLs play an important role. We therefore measured the number of NP<sub>366-374</sub> peptide/H-2D<sup>b</sup>&#x02013;specific CTL cells using tetramer reagents and correlated their numbers to viral clearance. In DT-treated and -infected animals, the number of virus-specific CTLs was significantly reduced in the lung, spleen (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), and MLN (not depicted). In addition to the measurement of CTL, CD3-stimulated IFN-&#x003b3; production by CD4 and CD8 T cells from MLNs was determined and dramatically suppressed in the absence of DCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Infection parameters after conditional depletion of CD11c<sup>hi</sup> cells in a CD11c-DTR Tg mouse model.</bold> CD11c-DTR Tg mice received an i.t. injection of DT on day &#x02212;1, followed by X-31 i.n. infection.

However, these authors have not described in detail where exactly in the lung these CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> migratory DCs originated from and whether any of the DCs would also present to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and they have also not studied in detail the precise contribution of inflammatory CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs or pDCs that are recruited to inflamed lungs.</p><p>Our studies on the various anatomical lung compartments suggest that a predominant source of CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs arriving in the MLNs are from the network of highly dendritic-shaped CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> intraepithelial DCs that lines the large conducting airways (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). There was a marked decrease in this subset of highly dendriform tracheal CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs at 2 dpi, at a time that the langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs started to accumulate in the MLNs. The disappearance of CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tracheal DCs was accompanied by a new influx of CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs into the trachea (present as more rounded cells at day 2 after infection on whole mounts) and into the lung interstitium. These cells most likely differentiate from recruited Ly6C<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes that give rise to inflammatory-type DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), or that arose from local proliferation and differentiation of a myeloid precursor population that also generates alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). An identical subset of CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs was found to be increased in the MLNs from days 2 to 4 onwards, again suggesting migration from the lungs to the MLN.</p><p>It was striking that there were several subsets of DCs found to be recruited and/or activated in the MLNs after influenza infection, strongly suggesting the division of labor between various APCs. Recently, several papers have shown that the cross presentation of exogenous harmless or viral antigen to CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes or presentation of exogenous antigen to CD4 T cells is a mutually exclusive function of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC subsets, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). We therefore performed a head-to-head comparison of the potential to present viral antigen to naive CD4 or CD8 T cells, taking advantage of influenza virus encoding either the MHCI or MHCII immunodominant OVA epitope.</p><p>As previously described by Belz et al., CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> resident DCs presented viral antigen to naive CD8 cells, supported by the fact that these cells had up-regulated co-stimulatory molecules. Strikingly, the population of airway-derived CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs also up-regulated co-stimulatory molecules and presented not only to CD8 T cells but also to CD4 T cells. This suggests that processing for and presentation on both MHCI and MHCII molecules can occur in a single cell population in vivo in the lung, contrary to what was shown for the spleen or lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Vermaelen et al. also previously demonstrated that antigen presentation of harmless antigen to naive CD4 T cells in the MLNs was an exclusive function of a migratory DC population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Despite the fact that both CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs presented antigen to naive T cells, the strength of viral NP staining was not abundant. This could be explained by the fact that viral NP was digested in these subsets as part of an antigen-processing step, leading to a loss of immunoreactivity toward the NP-specific antibody. Alternatively, Belz et al. previously suggested that resident CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells acquired the antigen from other migratory APCs, proposed as the CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> lung-derived DCs, but this was never directly demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Our data on viral NP staining suggest that the CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs as well as the pDCs were abundantly positive for viral antigen in the MLNs and, therefore, could be the most important source for providing viral antigens to resident CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs.</p><p>Another striking observation was the fact that the CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subset found to be increased in the trachea, lung, and MLNs after influenza infection hardly presented any viral antigen to CD4 or CD8 T cells. Clearly, the CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs had seen viral antigens (either directly or through phagocytosis of virally infected apoptotic epithelial cells) as they carried an abundant amount of viral NP in their cytoplasm. The absence of APC function by this subset is in striking contrast to the situation when harmless noninflammatory antigen is inhaled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). What could be the purpose of recruitment of a different DC subset, in addition to CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs, if these cells do not present antigen to naive T cells? First, as these cells have been shown to massively produce inflammatory chemokines, CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs might be crucial in attracting effector CD4 and CD8 cells that have been generated in the LNs back to the lung and trachea, where they would mediate effector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Second, CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs might have direct innate antiviral activity by producing TNF-&#x003b1; and inducible NO synthase&#x02013;dependent NO, analogous to the situation seen with <italic>Listera monocytogenes</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Third, recruited CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs might also stimulate the innate antiviral activity of NK cells. The important function of inflammatory DCs in initiating the innate response is supported by the fact that influenza produces the nonstructural protein 1, with a specific aim to subvert the innate immune function of the CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Future studies in our laboratory will have to address the direct or indirect innate and adaptive functions of inflammatory CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in influenza infection.</p><p>Another way to study the function of lung DC subsets is to deplete them using various cell-specific genetic targeting strategies using expression of the DTR under control of a specific promoter and administration of the DT via the airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). In CD11c-DTR mice, there is a predominant depletion of lung CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs, of tracheal CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs, and of resident MLN CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs. Because CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup> migratory tracheal DCs are not depleted in these mice, we consequently observed no decrease in MLN CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs. In CD11c-DTR mice given DT, we noticed that generation of virus-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CTLs and production of effector cytokines (IFN-&#x003b3;) by MLN cells was severely diminished. Based on our antigen presentation studies and the previous work of Belz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), we propose that this is caused by depletion of the resident CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs or to the depletion of chemokine-producing lung CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs. CD11c<sup>hi</sup> alveolar macrophages are also depleted in CD11c-DTR mice, although it is unlikely that this contributed to a decrease in antiviral immunity, as adoptive transfer of wild-type DCs but not macrophages restored immunity.</p><p>To address the specific role of migratory tracheal CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs, we performed experiments in langerin-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Langerin was found to be particularly present on mucosal CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), a population of cells that strictly relies on CCR7 to migrate to the MLNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In accordance, we also found increased numbers of langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in the MLNs after influenza infection. After i.t. administration of DT, there was a selective depletion of CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> migratory DCs in the trachea and MLNs, while the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> resident LN population or alveolar macrophages were unaffected. In the absence of the migratory langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC population, influenza ran a particularly severe course. Strikingly, these data also suggest that the langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs of the lung are much more immunogenic than their langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Langerhans cell counterparts in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we also addressed the in vivo function of lung pDCs, previously known as natural IFN-&#x003b1;&#x02013;producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). In humans, these cells produce copious amounts of IFN-&#x003b1; when exposed to influenza virus in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>) and have been shown to stimulate already-primed influenza-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). It has therefore been suggested that upon proper stimulation, pDCs develop into bona fide APCs that primarily stimulate antiviral immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). To address the antigen-presenting function of pDCs, we sorted pDCs from the MLNs of infected mice and found no evidence for presentation to either CD4 or CD8 T cells ex vivo, despite the fact that the cells contained copious amounts of intracellular viral NP. Previous studies with other respiratory viruses have suggested that pDCs have a more immunoregulatory role, which is crucial for preventing excessive immune activation and immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Although pDCs were attracted to the lungs and tracheal wall during influenza infection, their confirmed depletion using 120G8 antibody did not affect viral titers, generation of virus-specific T cells, or the severity of infection, arguing against a predominant role for pDCs as APCs, immunoregulatory cells, or innate immune cells in this mild infection model. It was similarly striking to see that there was no effect on IFN-&#x003b1; production when pDCs were effectively depleted. Infections in epithelial surfaces that bathe in IFN-&#x003b1; (produced by epithelial cells) might be less dependent on IFN-&#x003b1; production by pDCs. Kumagai et al. recently demonstrated that during lung infection with RNA viruses, alveolar macrophages are a predominant source of type I IFN, and that pDCs only start producing IFN-&#x003b1; when macrophages are depleted from the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). The only effect of treatment with the 120G8 antibody was a significant reduction of the titer of virus-specific HI antibodies at 8 and 28 dpi, signifying a possible role for pDCs in stimulating humoral antiviral immunity, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). Although we found no evidence for 120G8 staining on lung B cells after influenza infection, treatment with 120G8 antibody could also deplete plasma cells directly and in this way reduce HI antibody titers. Therefore, we are awaiting more specific (e.g., genetic) pDC targeting strategies to address this point further. In conclusion, our paper demonstrates a division of labor between different DC subsets during pulmonary influenza infection, knowledge that might be used for the design of better influenza vaccines and could increase our understanding of why particular strains of influenza are more pathogenic than others.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>6&#x02013;8-wk-old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan.
