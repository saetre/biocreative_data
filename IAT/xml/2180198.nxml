They may have different etiologies and are often associated with structural hypothalamic-pituitary (H-P) defects detectable by neuroimaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Dattani1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Mullis1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Both IGHD and MPHD may have a genetic origin, as shown by identification of mutations in genes encoding critical components of the H-P axis. Two genes, the <italic>GH1</italic> encoding the GH and the <italic>GHRHR</italic>, expressed along the somatotropic axis and six genes encoding transcription factors involved in anterior pituitary gland development (<italic>POU1F1, PROP1, HESX1, LHX3, LHX4</italic> and <italic>SOX3</italic>), have been identified in patients with GH deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Dattani1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Mullis1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is likely that other genes may be involved in the etiology of GH-dependent short stature, as the majority of patients did not present mutations in any of the known genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Rainbow1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Kelberman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As it was the case for many other heterogeneous disorders, chromosomal variations may also be involved in determining the short stature phenotype. It is well established that relatively common chromosomal rearrangements associated with short stature are 18q deletions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Hale1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The cytogenetic and molecular localization of the deletions in a large number of patients demonstrated a common deleted region of about 2 Mb, defined as the critical region for short stature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Cody1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The same region was recently confirmed and precisely defined by array CGH analysis. In the same study, two additional commonly deleted regions, localized more proximally along 18q, were identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Feenstra1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In the few cases when it was tested, the GH deficiency resulted to depend from a defect in hypothalamic or neurosecretory functions that control pituitary GH synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Hale1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Cody2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In only one case a pituitary malformation was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-BekiesinskaFigatowska1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the deletion of the critical region was not always sufficient to cause short stature as a number of patients presented with stature in the normal range. Moreover, 18q partial monosomy resulted in variable severity of the phenotype that did not correlate with the size of the deletions. Altogether the data may indicate that haploinsufficiency for one gene in 18q23 may cause GH deficiency and short stature, but that it likely represents a risk factor rather than a cause for the disorder.</p><p>Among the four genes in the critical region (two ZNF proteins encoding genes, <italic>ZNF516</italic> and <italic>ZNF236,</italic> the <italic>MBP</italic> and <italic>GALR1</italic> genes) <italic>GALR1</italic> was considered the best candidate. <italic>GALR1</italic> is one of the receptors of Galanin, a 29 aminoacid neuropeptide playing a critical role in many diverse central and peripheral nerve functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Walton1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The biological effects of galanin are mediated by three G protein coupled receptors, GalR1, GalR2 and GalR3, that show a widespread distribution throughout the central and peripheral nervous system and may participate in different aspects of the galanin function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Lundstrom1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Their specific role has not yet been determined. From the study of a <italic>Galr1</italic> KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Mazarati1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> it seems that it is mainly involved in the neuroprotective action of galanin and in its anticonvulsant effect, while it does not seem to be involved in other galanin functions such as nociception. The KO mice did not appear to have any hypothalamic or pituitary related defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Mazarati1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In conclusion the role of <italic>GALR1</italic> in GH deficiency is far from being clarified but from the phenotype of the KO mice it is not unlikely that other genes in the region should be considered as candidates for short stature.</p><p>One female patient presenting with GHD and ectopic posterior pituitary at Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was described. She carried an X;18 balanced translocation with breakpoints in Xq22.3 and 18q23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Larizza1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The patient had primary amenorrhea, that had been ascribed to interruption of the Xq Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) critical region, while the short stature was related to the 18q rearrangement.</p><p>Here we present the fine mapping of both Xq and 18q breakpoints in the patient and we report that in 18q it was localized outside and distally from the short stature critical region. It was mapped 80 Kb upstream from a gene, <italic>SALL3</italic>, a developmentally regulated transcription factor that seems to act as downstream targets of hedgehog. It had been previously considered as a candidate for different phenotypes associated to the 18q- syndrome, but not for short stature, as it was not deleted in one patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Hale1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Feenstra1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The analysis of the 18q breakpoint highlighted a gene free region enriched in HCNEs and indicated that translocation of the HCNEs itself may be responsible for the patient phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fine mapping of the X/18 breakpoints</title><p>The 18q breakpoint in the patient 263/96 was mapped by FISH to a 140 Kb region defined by BAC RP11-496G14, that hybridized to chromosome 18 and to der18 and by BAC RP11-850021 that hybridized to chromosome 18 and to derX (not shown): genome sequence analysis mapped the breakpoint distal from the <italic>GALR1</italic> gene and proximal to the <italic>SALL3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001460-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>).

Analysis of chromatin modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Berger1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that, in mouse embryo chromatin at E11.5, some of the HCNEs presented active chromatin modifications that were absent in adult animals. One, HCNE3, had an active only chromatin state, and may thus carry an open chromatin conformation in most cells at the E11.5. The other, HCNE7, showed a bivalent domain of modifications with enrichment for both 2MK4H3 and 3MK27H3. This may results from chromatin in a poised state for transcription as suggested previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> or from different chromatin organization in the different cells of the E11.5 embryo. In any case, we can conclude that the HCNEs in the region are developmentally regulated enhancers/silencers, that may up or down regulate expression of flanking genes in a cell and stage specific way, as shown in vivo for similar genomic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Pennacchio1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>Among the genes in the region, <italic>SALL3</italic> was highly expressed in brain and it was previously suggested that it may be involved in determining some of the neurological phenotypes of the 18q deletion syndrome such as mental retardation, hearing loss, ophthalmic abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Feenstra1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with the finding that haploinsufficiency for <italic>SALL3</italic> does not seem to be involved with short stature, we show here that <italic>Sall3</italic> did not appear expressed in the developing nor in adult pituitary. We therefore propose that the balanced translocation will cause ectopic expression of <italic>SALL3,</italic> and possibly of distally flanking genes, in the pituitary through elimination of a silencing effect of the HCNEs. A similar mutation was demonstrated for the <italic>Shh</italic> gene whose ectopic expression in the anterior limb of the mouse was due to insertions about 1Mb upstream from <italic>Shh</italic>. The region contains a conserved non-coding element that can function as enhancer as well as a repressor and drives Shh expression in the limb. Its rearrangement was responsible for the phenotype of mouse mutants presenting with limb defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Kleinjan1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The 18q23 HCNEs may be the first example of such effect in a human disorder.</p><p>The phenotype of the patient could be due also to a more complex effect of the HCNEs, as a second interesting gene, was involved in the rearrangement, <italic>CHRDL1</italic>. The <italic>CHRDL1</italic> gene on the X chromosome encodes for an inhibitor of BMP signaling through its cysteine-rich repeats. Its expression pattern coincides with that of some members of the BMP signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Coffinier2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, a large subgroup of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, that serve key roles in stem cell fate commitment.

In the mouse, the <italic>Chrdl1</italic> gene was expressed at low level in the pituitary at late stages of development and in the adult. Once translocated downstream to 18q23, this low level of expression in the pituitary could be either inhibited or enhanced by the upstream HCNEs. Deregulation of expression of <italic>CHRDL1</italic> and <italic>SALL3</italic> could therefore be factors in determining the phenotype of the patient. Moreover, it could explain the pituitary ectopia which is not a common feature of the GH deficiency and short stature, as it was described only once in the 18q- syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-BekiesinskaFigatowska1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The X;18 patient had hypergonadotropic primary amenorrhea and ovarian dysgenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001460-Larizza1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

However also in the 18q23 breakpoint region no genes highly expressed in the ovarian follicle could be found (not shown). It is therefore not unlikely that the 18q23 HCNEs could have a role also on the POF phenotype through ectopic expression of some of the genes involved in the breakpoint in the ovary and particularly in the ovarian follicle. The changes in chromatin modifications observed at the <italic>SALL3</italic> and <italic>ATP9B</italic> genes in patients lymphoblastoid cells may due to lack of the HCNE region upstream and of its controlling elements and support the hypothesis that chromatin alterations may be associated to the involvement of the HCNEs in the rearrangement.</p><p>In conclusion, the analysis reported indicated that the phenotype of the patient 263/96 could be the consequence of the involvement of HCNEs in the chromosomal rearrangement.
