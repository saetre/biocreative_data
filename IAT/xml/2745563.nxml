Over many generations, mutations can lead to genetic diversity in a population. However, microbes have strategies to generate such diversity quickly. For example, if multiple genes switch ON and OFF slowly, randomly, and independently of each other, then a large combination of gene expression states, and hence phenotypes, are possible. The different gene expression states do not involve changes in DNA sequence and are therefore epigenetically inherited. We show that the two copies of the <italic>FLO11</italic> gene in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> can switch ON and OFF slowly and independently. In addition, we reveal a simple regulatory strategy by which cells can control the proportion of cells in different gene expression states. Because <italic>FLO11</italic> encodes a cell-wall protein responsible for mediating cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;surface interactions, this control might literally allow natural populations to have a controllable fraction of cells &#x0201c;stick around&#x0201d; while the other fraction is easily washed away.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microbial cell populations employ a number of strategies to rapidly generate phenotypic diversity on relatively short time scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Rando1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Avery1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In some microbes, genes known as contingency loci contain tandem repeats of DNA whose recombination results in turning expression ON or OFF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Barry1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Other genetic strategies include the directed recombination of silent alleles into a particular active locus, as is the case for mating type switching in yeasts and surface antigen expression in T. <italic>brucei</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Pays1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. Another widely used strategy that generates phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal microbial cell populations is epigenetic gene regulation. In contrast to genetic strategies, this refers to the heritable change in a gene's expression that is not caused by changes in the underlying gene sequence. For example, the parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (malaria) and the model organisms <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> use epigenetic mechanisms to variably express antigenic cell-surface proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Avery1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and possibly escape immune surveillance and/or survive in an unpredictably changing environment.</p><p>Many epigenetically regulated genes can be considered switches as they have two heritable expression states, &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;OFF.&#x0201d; A stable epigenetic marker maintains each state and can be encoded in <italic>cis</italic> or in <italic>trans</italic>. The molecular basis of local, <italic>cis</italic> markers involve covalent modifications of DNA or DNA-associated proteins. These include DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Low1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and histone modifications that define silenced heterochromatin or active euchromatin in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Wu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Global, <italic>trans</italic> markers are often transcription factor activity; the mechanism for stable, slow switching of these levels is positive or double negative feedback loops that generate heritable bistable gene expression states associated with high or low levels of transcription factor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Kaufmann1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Xiong1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Switches using either scheme respond to environmental factors, but heterogeneity is observed even with constant environmental conditions, suggesting that the switch can rarely and randomly be toggled due to fluctuations in the intracellular environment. The two schemes can be also combined. For example, in uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> the expression of pyelonephritis-associated pili is regulated by an epigenetic switch that maintains its state through both DNA methylation and a positive feedback loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Hernday1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The control of phenotypic heterogeneity is arguably as important as its rapid generation. Heterogeneity, or noise, in conventionally regulated gene expression has been well-studied in recent years. Single cell and single molecule studies have revealed that gene activation occurs in random, intermittent transcriptional bursts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Golding1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Yu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> due to fast promoter fluctuations (&#x0003e;once per cell cycle) between an inactive (but competent) and active promoter state. Mechanistically, this is an oversimplification as the promoter likely adopts a series of different states involving binding of various gene-specific and general transcriptional machinery that lead to productive transcription. Here, the active promoter state can be thought of as one where rapid initiation and reinitiation is possible. For example, for regulable RNA Pol II&#x02013;dependent promoters, transcriptional initiation is often rate-limiting and hence the active promoter state corresponds to pre-initiation complex formation. Expression heterogeneity caused by even these fast fluctuations can have consequences on phenotype and population-level fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Blake1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Noise in gene expression can be partitioned depending on whether its source is intrinsic or extrinsic to the process of gene expression. Intrinsic noise is due to the random nature of chemical transformations, including transcription and translation events. However, the random bursts of transcription thought to be associated with fast promoter fluctuations occurring in <italic>cis</italic> appear to be the dominant source of intrinsic noise in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Kaern1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Maheshri1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Extrinsic noise is due to cell-to-cell variation in <italic>trans</italic> factors affecting gene expression: for example, general and gene-specific transcriptional machinery, ribosome number and tRNA availability, or even cell morphology. The two sources can be experimentally distinguished using a dual-reporter assay, where two copies of the same promoter are used to drive distinguishable fluorescent protein variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Elowitz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Extrinsic noise is variation in protein levels between different cells; intrinsic noise is variation in protein levels within the same cell.</p><p>How regulators control the kinetics of intrinsic promoter fluctuations dictates the resulting expression heterogeneity. Stochastic models can be used to directly quantify this relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-BarEven1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Most transcriptional regulators appear to function by modulating the frequency of these bursts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-BarEven1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Newman1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, probably in large part by increasing the rate of transcriptional initiation. Therefore, regulators do not control expression heterogeneity independently of expression level. In fact, heterogeneity is under genetic control as noisy promoters tend to have particular characteristics: strong TATA boxes, highly regulable, and dependent on chromatin remodeling activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-BarEven1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Raser1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While conventional gene regulation involves fast fluctuations between inactive (competent) and active promoter states, epigenetic silencing of gene expression involves slow fluctuations (&#x0003c;once per cell cycle) between a silenced and competent state. The kinetics of these fluctuations in <italic>trans</italic>-encoded switches involving feedback loops and associated with bistable gene expression have been studied in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Kaufmann1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Mettetal1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Ingolia1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, much less is known of the precise role of regulators in modulating fluctuations of <italic>cis</italic>-encoded switches which must involve changes in the local promoter state. For example, activators could increase population-averaged expression by either stabilizing the competent state or destabilizing the silenced state. The resulting heterogeneity in expression is dictated by the specific kinetic role of the activator.</p><p>In a diploid organism, an epigenetically regulated gene might exhibit four different expression states if each copy switches independently. With global encoding, both copies respond to the same global factor and must switch in a correlated manner. However, with local encoding, each copy may respond independently if the fluctuation that trips the switch is a molecular event that occurs locally at one copy. In fact, a recent study demonstrated the random and independent switching of two copies of a reporter gene inserted within the canonically silenced mating type loci, <italic>HMR</italic> and <italic>HML</italic>, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

Within a diploid yeast, each locus switches in a slow, random, and independent manner, with switching rates dependent on environmental conditions. Using a stochastic kinetic model, we infer the kinetic role that different regulators have on the slow promoter fluctuations associated with epigenetic transitions between a silenced and competent promoter state and the fast promoter fluctuations associated with conventional gene activation. We find three classes of <italic>FLO11</italic> regulators: those that affect the stability of the competent state, affecting slow promoter fluctuations; those that regulate the burst frequency of transcription due to fast promoter fluctuations; and those that have both functions. Moreover, a single synthetic activator can mimic each of these three classes based on the location of its DNA binding site. Because the kinetic role of each regulator defines its impact on expression heterogeneity, this can be controlled by the choice of regulator class.

Therefore, after determining that transition rates were accurately described as first order, we devised a way to infer these rates directly from static snapshots, accounting for the long lifetimes of the fluorescent reporters. Two-state models have been widely employed to model faster promoter fluctuations associated with conventional gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Kaern1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Raser1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Raj1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In such models, the promoter can transition between an inactive but competent state and an active state that leads to transcription. Many eukaryotic genes appear to reside in the competent state, with rare transitions to the short-lived active state that result in a &#x0201c;burst&#x0201d; of transcription.</p><p>The observed variation in the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter can be divided into an intrinsic and extrinsic component. The <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter is subject to both fast intrinsic fluctuations and a slow epigenetic transition, as depicted by the augmented three-state model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000673-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. Extrinsic noise also contributes to cell-to-cell variation in <italic>FLO11</italic> expression levels when the promoter is not silenced. However, when the promoter is (partially) silenced, the predominant source of variation in <italic>FLO11</italic> or reporter expression arises from the slow epigenetic transition between silenced to competent states because of (1) the smaller magnitude of the fast intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations and the fact that (2) the faster fluctuations (&#x0003c;1 cell generation) are more completely time-averaged by the long-lived reporter compared to the slow transition (&#x0003e;1 cell generation). Therefore, we can lump the fast transition rates (<italic>&#x003bb;</italic>&#x02032;, <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>&#x02032;, <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>&#x02032;) into an overall transcription rate <italic>&#x003bc;</italic> and ignore extrinsic fluctuations. Gene expression can now be described using the commonly employed two-state model:<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000673.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>x</italic> i<italic>s</italic> the amount of reporter protein, <italic>&#x003bc;</italic> is the (lumped) protein production rate, <italic>&#x003b4;</italic> is a protein degradation rate (here the cell growth rate), and <italic>f(t)</italic> is a &#x0201c;random telegraph process&#x0201d; that takes values of 0 or 1 corresponding to a silenced or active promoter state, with exponentially distributed times between switching events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000673-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

Second, this model allows proper estimation of the fraction of cells that appear ON in static distributions that are actually OFF because of the long lifetime of the fluorescent reporter (details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000673.s012">Text S1</xref>). We applied this correction to static snapshots of cells grown in different conditions. Although the fraction of cells in each expression state varied, the overall statistics were always consistent with independent switching at each promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000673-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

For unimodal ON distributions, epigenetic silencing no longer occurs.

A two-state model accurately describes intrinsic (but not extrinsic) fluctuations caused by transitions between the competent and active promoter states. For example, a conventionally regulated (but repressed) gene can be OFF and lie in the lower right quadrant. Activation leads to an increased burst frequency (<italic>&#x003bb;&#x02032;</italic> increases) and the graded, unimodal distribution of the upper right quadrant. Importantly, it is impossible to distinguish between conventional repression and epigenetic silencing in any population in the lower right quadrant where expression is completely OFF. Furthermore, fitting fluorescence expression distributions generated from a single <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter driven reporter that is conventionally regulated does not yield the fast promoter transition rates <italic>&#x003bb;&#x02032;</italic> and <italic>&#x003b3;&#x02032;</italic> because here extrinsic fluctuations are significant. The extrinsic noise is due to cell-to-cell variation in factors like morphology, ribosome number, and/or upstream components in the <italic>FLO11</italic> regulatory pathway and affects both promoters within the same cell in a correlated fashion.

Addition of three Class I activators, Tec1p, Ste12p, and Phd1p, appears to weakly stabilize the competent state, but expression remains extremely low. The Class II activators, Msn1p and Mss11p, stabilized the competent state by decreasing <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and entering the heterogeneous region where slow promoter fluctuations dominate. At some critical <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> value, the silenced state is rapidly destabilized and the entire population turns ON. Flo8p constitutes a special class and was titrated in ethanol conditions where presumably some fraction of Flo8p is now phosphorylated and active. The population response is intermediate between Class I and Class II activators, but closer to Class II. Sfl1p has the exact opposite effect under the same ethanol conditions, consistent with the antagonistic role Sfl1p and Flo8p have through their overlapping binding sites and as being negatively and positively regulated by PKA, respectively.</p><p>To determine if activator class was correlated to binding site position or accessibility, we applied both an <italic>in silico</italic> nucleosomal occupancy model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and performed micrococcal nuclease mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000673-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000673.s008">Figure S8</xref>) of the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter.

This establishes that Sfl1p is capable of repressing expression in an Hda1p-independent manner. The graded response suggests Sfl1p is working as a conventional repressor rather than affecting the slower fluctuations between the epigenetically silenced and competent promoter states.

In both the <italic>hda1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>sfl1&#x00394;</italic> backgrounds, the promoter was hyperacetylated, a chromatin state associated with lack of silencing. Together, this demonstrates that Sfl1p silences the promoter in an Hda1p-dependent manner and the silenced state at <italic>FLO11</italic> is correlated with hypoacetylation in at least one region (&#x0223c;&#x02212;1600 bp) of the promoter.</p><p>If silencing is eliminated in an <italic>hda1&#x00394;</italic> background, titration of activators in the presence of high levels of Sfl1p will result in a graded response, since Sfl1p is now functioning as a conventional repressor.

The graded response suggested a lack of silencing possibly due to increased Flo8p activity. This led to the hypothesis that at low levels of ethanol (&#x0003c;1&#x00025;), Flo8p activity eliminates Sfl1p-mediated silencing, but has little effect on expression. Therefore, although <italic>FLO11</italic> expression is OFF (lower right quadrant), the promoter is actually in the competent state.

Regulators can affect either the slow transition rates associated with epigenetic silencing or the fast transition rates associated with conventional gene activation. While a good deal is known about how regulators affect the fast transition rates, less is known about how regulators affect the slow transition rates, and whether effects on slow and fast transition rates are coupled. Our work demonstrates that slow transitions at the two copies of the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter in diploid yeast occur randomly and independently.

Relative activities of Flo8p and Sfl1p determine the chromatin state of the promoter. The underlying promoter state of an OFF population can be revealed by addition of Class I and II activators (bottom), as Class I activators cannot effectively activate transcription at a silenced promoter, whereas Class II activators can activate expression by sufficiently stabilizing the competent state. At very high levels, Class II activators disrupt silencing; at this point, all cells are also expressing highly. In contrast, an intermediate level of Flo8p activity can &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; the promoter converting the silenced state to a stable competent state, while expression remains low. This opening might be related to chromatin modifications. The combination of Flo8p activation and Class I activators allows the decoupling of chromatin state and expression level, whereas activation by Class II activators alone would not.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000673.g007"/></fig><p>Our demonstration that two copies of the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter switch slowly and independently builds on previous work demonstrating (1) the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter is epigenetically regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Halme1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and (2) two copies of a partially silenced <italic>URA3</italic> promoter inserted at the mating type loci in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> switch independently in a <italic>sir1</italic> background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Xu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Class I regulates fast promoter fluctuations exclusively. Intrinsic noise measurements confirmed these regulators destabilize the competent state and increase the burst frequency, a common theme for regulators in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-BarEven1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Newman1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, we find that the Class II and Flo8p regulate slow promoter fluctuations primarily by stabilizing the competent state. The previous study at the mating type loci found an activator, Ppr1p, could challenge the silenced state and affected both slow transition rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Xu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, but this was only measured at one level of Ppr1p. It is only by titrating regulators that we were able to clearly discern their functional roles. Whether activators generally affect one or both of the transition rates of silenced genes remains an open question, but likely depends on the mechanism of silencing.</p><p>While the regulator titrations indicate that ethanol desilences the promoter via Flo8p, the pathway(s) by which ethanol activates Flo8p is unknown. The simplest mechanism is that long term growth in ethanol activates PKA (specifically Tpk2p), which then activates Flo8p and deactivates Sfl1p. In fact, glucose is not required as the promoter response when Flo8p was titrated in synthetic media with ethanol or glycerol as the sole carbon source was similar to that in SD 1&#x00025; ethanol (data not shown). However, activation of the PKA pathway via ethanol has not been reported. It is also possible that Flo8p is activated by ethanol via another pathway independent of PKA, although to our knowledge, it is not known to be the target of any other kinase. A third possibility is that ethanol may enable synergistic interactions between Flo8p and other regulators that leads to desilencing, although there is no evidence of Flo8p interacting with any Class I activators. These possibilities could be distinguished by monitoring cyclic AMP levels and the phosphorylation status of Flo8p and Sfl1p in ethanol.</p><p>Our results lend support to the idea that binding site position within the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter can largely determine the kinetic role of the transcriptional regulator. However, the mechanistic description of how binding to particular sites affects slow epigenetic regulation and fast conventional regulation and the molecular nature of the silenced and competent promoter states is still unclear. A mechanistic explanation for the dual roles of Sfl1p is likely the clearest. Binding in the &#x02212;1200 nucleosome-free region governs epigenetic silencing, possibly by recruiting Hda1p via Tup1p/Ssn6p corepressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Conlan1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Conventional regulation most likely occurs via Sfl1p binding to the &#x02212;200 region which contains a putative Sfl1p binding site and has been shown to bind Sfl1p <italic>in vitro</italic>. Indeed, preliminary ChIP experiments suggest Sfl1p is bound to this region <italic>in vivo</italic> (Octavio and Maheshri, unpublished results).</p><p>Among the activators, the role of Flo8p and its synthetic analog is perhaps the clearest. Flo8p binding and Sfl1p binding at the &#x02212;1200 region are likely mutually exclusive because of overlapping binding sites, and so Flo8p can prevent the Sfl1p-mediated establishment of silencing but probably not directly affect conventional Sfl1p repression. This would explain the ability of Flo8p and its corresponding synthetic analog to affect the slow epigenetic transition independently of the conventional activation. In fact, binding of tetR, which lacks the VP16 activation domain of rtTA, to the &#x02212;1160 tetO site is sufficient to abrograte silencing (data not shown), implying steric hindrance is the major mode of action. Furthermore, any weak activation via Flo8p might be through its known role in binding to the promoters of other Class I activators (including the ones tested here) and presumably upregulating their expression. In this manner, Flo8p activation can put the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter in a competent, &#x0201c;poised&#x0201d; state whose expression can be controlled by Class I &#x02013;like regulators. There is evidence, though, that Flo8p can bind to other regions of the promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Borneman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several possibilities exist for the inability of the Class I activators to challenge the silenced state, yet still regulate the burst frequency of the competent <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter. For example, binding site proximity to the transcriptional start site could play a dominant role. Canonical yeast promoters are typically 150&#x02013;400 bp with transcription factor binding sites are clustered 100&#x02013;200 bp from the transcriptional start site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Pelechano1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>; this proximity allows direct interaction with general transcriptional machinery. Therefore, it may be that Class I activators bind in the core region of the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter, a region that may be inaccessible to transcription factors and/or transcriptional machinery in the silenced state. However, while the Class I synthetic analog binding site is at &#x02212;350 in a nucleosome occluded region, not all Class I activators have binding sites in this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Borneman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A second possibility not mutually exclusive with the first is that Class I activators need not bind in the downstream region but can influence transcription rates via long range (but fast) mechanisms including DNA looping, cryptic transcription, or long range chromatin remodeling. This would provide an explanation for the presence of Class I activator binding sites in these regions that are known to be bound <italic>in vivo</italic> in activating conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Borneman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it might explain why even at high levels of expression in the absence of silencing the intrinsic noise at the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter is 10 times higher than that of a similarly highly expressed <italic>PHO84</italic> promoter (data not shown). However, with either explanation, the inability of Class I activators to challenge the silenced state is not clear. Altered chromatin structure or reduced binding site accessibility could be invoked as Class I activator sites tend to be under nucleosomes. However, other than some nucleosome depletion in the core promoter and the &#x02212;1300 region, no gross nucleosomal rearrangements seem to occur upon silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000673.s009">Figure S9</xref>) although higher resolution mapping may reveal finer differences.</p><p>While we do not know the biochemical intermediates during the slow promoter transitions, the pseudo-first order rates suggest a single slow step, rather than a distributed control mechanism. This is similar to both the partially silenced mating type loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Xu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and the epigenetically regulated <italic>agn43</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Lim1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Possibilities for the slow epigenetic step governing ON to OFF might include Sfl1p binding or Sfl1p-mediated recruitment of silencing factors, among others. Both Class II activators Msn1p and Mss11p are capable of stabilizing the active state, but their localization and activity with respect to the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-vanDyk1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000673-Lorenz1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability of the Class II synthetic analog to have a similar stabilizing effect on the ON state by binding to the &#x02212;1470 region as well as the differential acetylation state of that region strongly suggests chromatin remodeling in the upstream region affects accessibility of Class I activators and the transition to the competent state.
