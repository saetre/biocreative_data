Sustained osmotic challenge induced marked exponential ECRE activity adaptation that was three times faster in mdx compared to wt and MinD fibers. Rising external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations amplified osmotic ECRE responses.

After sacrifice of the animals by exposure to a 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>-atmosphere, interossei muscles were quickly dissected. Killing of the animals and tissue preparation were according to guidelines of the local Animal Care Committee. Single fibers were obtained by mild enzymatical treatment in isotonic Ringer's solution that contained (mM): NaCl 140, KCl 5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, Hepes 10, pH 7.4. Hypertonic 50 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> containing solution was composed as given by Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and contained (mM): NaCl 140, KCl 4, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 50, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, Hepes 10, pH 7.4.

Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-free solutions were made without addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and additionally contained 1 mM EGTA. To keep free Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration roughly constant, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was increased to 2 mM in these solutions. Streptomycine and Gd<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) and GsMTx-4 (Peptide Institute Inc, Osaka, Japan) were added from stocks to the desired concentrations. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Experimental procedure and image acquisition</title><p>Single fibers were stained with the fast high-affinity Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dye Fluo-4-AM (10 &#x000b5;M) in isotonic Ringer's solution for 20 min. Single fibers were transferred to the experimental chamber and mounted on the stage of a laser-scanning confocal microscope (FluoView 300, Olympus) equipped with a 20 mW Ar<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Kr<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion laser (Omnichrome, Melles Griot). Excess external dye ester was washed out by exchanging the solution three times using a fast custom-built perfusion system that allowed complete solution exchange within 3 s. Intracellular, de-esterified Fluo-4 was excited at 488 nm and emission collected using a &#x0003e;515 nm low-pass filter. PMT voltage was between 630 V and 680 V between experiments. XYT image series were acquired at a sampling rate of 0.9 Hz with a 512&#x000d7;512 pixels resolution using a &#x000d7;40 water immersion objective (NA 1.2, Olympus, Japan). XYT stacks contained up to 200 consecutive images (&#x0223c;220 s total duration). XT line-scans were recorded at random line positions within the fibers. Repetitive acquisition time was 2 ms/line at a 512&#x000d7;1024 resolution, thus obtaining a full line-scan within two seconds. Different zoom factors between &#x000d7;3 and &#x000d7;7 were used and the adjacent voxel sizes used for calculation of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> spark dimensions.</p><p>The following experimental procedures were carried out. First, elementary Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release events in the intact single fibers were recorded in isotonic Ringer's solution. Subsequently, XYT series and several XT line-scans were recorded (control). Then, fibers were either subjected to hypo- or hyperosmolar stress by quickly exchanging the isotonic Ringer solution to the appropriate solution of given osmolarity (see above). The solution exchange was performed while recording an XYT series to follow the time course of osmolarity effect on ECRE frequency. After a steady-state was reached, the solution was changed back to isotonic Ringer's solution to test for reversibility of the observed osmolarity induced changes. During solution exchange, movement artefacts of the single fibers were frequently observed. As the solution exchange was complete within 3 s, this corresponded to two subsequent images in the recording sequence only. Therefore, in the corresponding recordings, the images containing movement artefacts were discarded from ECRE analysis, as they gave abrupt changes in ECRE frequency resulting from false positive events during the fiber movement. In a subset of experiments evaluating the contribution from extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> to the ECRE frequency during osmotic stress, ECRE were first recorded in isotonic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> containing Ringer's solution, then solution exchanged to hypo-/hyperosmolar Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> free solution while recording and, finally, back to isotonic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> containing Ringer's solution. To test the involvement of mechanosensitive channels to the osmotic stress induced changes in ECRE, different blockers of mechanosensitive channels (MsC) were used: streptomycine (200 &#x000b5;M), an unspecific blocker of MsC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-FrancoObregon1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, Gd<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> (20 &#x000b5;M) a blocker of more Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitive MsC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-FrancoObregon1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Franco1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Carlson1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and the recently synthesized specific inhibitor of cation-selective MsC GsMTx-4 (5 &#x000b5;M) derived from tarantula spider toxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Suchyna2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. To differentiate between the possibilities that drugs either potentially block or prevent increased spark activity in mdx fibers following osmotic stress, two different settings were designed and tested in mdx fibers: (i) from isotonic Ringer's solution, osmotic stress was induced by solution exchange to hypo-/hypertonic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> containing solution and either drug applied after spark frequency increased in response to the osmotic stimulus. This was suitable to assess the blocking potency of the drugs on osmotic stress-induced ECRE frequencies. (ii) ECRE were recorded in Ringer's solution that was then pre-incubated with either streptomycine or Gd<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> and solution was then exchanged to hypo-/hyperosmolar Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> containing external solution also containing the drug. This was suitable to test whether both drugs prevented uncontrolled spark activity in mdx fibers by osmotic stress. Both experimental approaches were carried out in 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> containing solutions. In some experiments, (i) was performed in mdx fibers applying GsMTx-4 after osmotic challenge under Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-free external conditions throughout.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Image and data analysis</title><p>XYT and XT images were background normalized and denoised using the &#x000e1; trous implementation of the two-dimensional undecimated discrete wavelet transform (DWT) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-vWegner1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-vWegner2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, an estimate of background fluorescence was obtained from the mean of all images within a series. Randomly appearing ECREs are reliably attenuated in this mean image whereas still structures, e.g. sarcomere patterns, are conserved. Each image within the series was then divided by the mean image to remove t-tubular patterns and a cut-off criteria was applied setting all pixel values to zero that exceeded a 1.5 &#x003c3; threshold above the mean (i.e. F/F<sub>0</sub>&#x0002b;1.5 &#x003c3;). A second run for background estimate was then performed on this set of images with probable ECRE removed and all raw images were finally divided by this improved mean image, yielding normalized F/F<sub>0</sub> images of a series. The &#x000e1; trous implementation contains the cubic B-spline as scaling function and a discrete low-pass filter (5-tab binomial filter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Wang2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>).

ECRE events were counted in each image and normalized with respect to time (&#x02018;<italic>spark frequency SF</italic>&#x02019;, ECRE/s). Additionally, ECRE frequency was normalized with respect to fiber cross-sectional area (<italic>&#x02018;spatial spark frequency SSF&#x02019;</italic>, ECRE/s/100 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>) using the voxel size at a given zoom factor. For osmotic challenge, up to &#x0223c;380 individual fibers were scanned and analysed for each strain and condition. The imaging algorithm yielded the overall average SF or SSF for a given XYT series. To quantify the time course and kinetics of ECRE frequency changes upon solution exchange, the SF or SSF were analysed on a frame by frame basis. The apparent SF and SSF values are obviously larger than those obtained for the whole time series, simply due to averaging. ECRE kinetics were analysed in 15 randomly selected fibers from each strain under conditions of solution exchange to either hypertonic or hypotonic 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> containing external medium (experiments without blockers). The time-to-peak (TTP) from the exchange of solution to the maximum of SSF induced by hypertonic or hypotonic medium and the mean apparent peak SSF values (SSF<sub>max</sub>) were analysed. Under maintained osmotic challenge, apparent SSF following osmotic shock showed adaptation with spontaneous decay of SSF. This decay was fitted by a single exponential with a time constant &#x003c4;<sub>dec</sub> for the decay kinetics. In experiments testing different MsC blockers, XYT series from all fibers were analysed on a frame-by-frame basis extracting the apparent SSF<sub>max</sub> values and aligned so that blocker applications were at the same time point for all fibres tested per blocker and condition.</p><p>In line scan images (XT), the ECRE morphology was determined as given by v Wegner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-vWegner1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. ECRE amplitudes, full-duration at half-maximum (FDHM), full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and rise-time (RT) were computed.

Sharp microelectrodes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries using a horizontal puller (P87, Sutter Instruments) and filled with 3 M KCl. Microelectrodes were mounted on a pipette holder and connected to the headstage of the amplifier. The headstage was held by a manual micromanipulator to allow fine movements of the pipette tip. Tip resistances were between 5 M&#x003a9; and 10 M&#x003a9;. The approach using exposed muscles ensured recordings to be made as close as possible to the physiological condition without further unspecific damage during dissection and subsequent enzymatic treatment. The latter may otherwise result in a larger proportion of depolarised fibres, thus skewing the real membrane potential distributions especially in the more fragile mdx muscle. After offsetting the potential readings (0 mV), the muscle was slowly impaled with the tip of the microelectrode until a negative potential deflection was noticed. The most negative value during this deflection was taken as the resting membrane potential of an individually impaled single fiber. The pipette was then pulled back and impalement was repeatedly performed after random repositioning of the electrode over the muscle flap. Impalements with a potential drift &#x0003e;5 mV after withdrawal of the electrodes were discarded. In experiments assessing the contribution of mechanosensitive channels to the resting membrane potentials, the specific MsC blocker GsMTx-4, a peptide contained in the venom of the Chilean Rose Tarantula, <italic>Grammostola spatulata</italic>, was used. The peptide was added at a concentration of 5 &#x000b5;M to the isotonic or hypertonic recording solution before the challenge of the contralateral muscle from the animal of which the corresponding recordings were done in the absence of GsMTx-4 that day.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks in resting intact single wt, mdx and MinD muscle fibers under isotonic conditions</title><p>ECRE recordings under physiological isotonic conditions (2 mM external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) in intact single wt, mdx and MinD fibers, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, suggest a larger ECRE frequency in resting mdx fibers.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. We repeated such recordings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003644-t001">table 1</xref>), but also kept external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations at physiological levels (i.e. 2 mM). Under such conditions, there was a clear increase in ECRE activity following osmotic challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). The time course of ECRE response is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> by the apparent SF values in successive images. The SF increase following osmotic challenge had a larger phase lag for hypotonic compared to hypertonic solution (time-to-peak for the fibers shown: 40 s hypertonic, 59 s hypotonic). Even before washout, SF slowly returned to initial values suggesting an inactivation of the increased ECRE activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003644-t001">table 1</xref> summarize mean averaged SSF values from several hundred wt, mdx and MinD single fibers. For both hypertonic and hypotonic challenge, SSF was significantly increased in each strain compared to resting isotonic condition. The differences in ECRE kinetics following either hypertonic or hypotonic challenge were statistically verified in a random selection of 15 fibers for each strain and condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g003">Fig. 3B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003644-t002">table 2</xref>).

Interestingly, in contrast to the conditions presented by Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, fibers in the present study never showed unterminated (&#x02018;uncontrolled&#x02019;) ECRE activity but an exponential decline during ongoing osmotic challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) with a time constant &#x003c4;<sub>dec</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003644-t002">table 2</xref>). &#x003c4;<sub>dec</sub> was always similar in wt and MinD fibers.

To obtain recordings that as closely as possible reflect the physiological condition of the muscle fibers, recordings were made in whole muscles exposed from the paw bathed in the appropriate solution.

This is a very robust finding from several hundred single fibers and contrasts with the finding from Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> of &#x02018;not any spontaneous Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> spark activity&#x02019; under resting isotonic conditions in an ungiven number of fibers.

In fact, our resting ECRE frequencies for wt fibers are very well in the range of the values given by Chun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Chun1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> under similar isotonic conditions (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, &#x0223c;0.09&#x0002a;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>, as compared to &#x0223c;0.15&#x0002a;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> in the present study, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003644-t001">table 1</xref>, wt). Resting ECRE activity was lower in wt compared to mdx fibers and low frequency could be restored by transgenic expression of a mini-dystrophin. The increase in ECRE frequency was much larger in mdx fibers than in wt or MinD fibers upon hypertonic challenge in physiological Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> containing medium (2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>). It was less prominent under hypotonic challenge in wt and MinD fibers, but similar to hypertonic challenge in mdx fibers. The absolute increase showed a clear dependence on external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, e.g. 1.5-fold smaller SSF in mdx fibers in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-free hypertonic solution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003644-t001">table 1</xref>). Interestingly, at 50 mM external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, the relative increase in ECRE frequency became smaller in mdx compared to wt fibers suggesting an upper limit for the already markedly increased ECRE activity in mdx fibers. However, ECRE activity, although somewhat modulated by external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, does not completely rely on it. Therefore, the suppression of spontaneous ECRE in resting intact fibers is supposed to be altered by both osmolarity and external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. In contrast to the findings from Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, ECRE frequency changes always showed a distinct time course for activation and inactivation. In particular, the onset for increase in ECRE frequency was consistently shorter in hypertonic medium compared to hypotonic medium for all strains investigated. This is probably due to a larger tubular membrane tension due to large fiber volume changes in hypertonic solutions but minimal associated change in t-system volume, as found from studies using living cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Blinks1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Launikonis1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it may be partly explained by an increased spontaneous Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release by hypertonicity &#x02018;per se&#x02019; that is expected to increase the SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration, as judged from studies on toad skeletal muscle skinned fibers after addition of 400 mM sucrose or more to the bathing solution as long as intracellular Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations would not rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Lamb1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>; see also argument below).

This parallels nicely with our results that increased ECRE activity after osmotic shock in mdx fibers is completely abolished by MsCa blockers. Our study is the first one to link the loss of ECRE suppression in intact osmotically stressed mdx fibers to an increased activity of MsCa, at least to some extent. Besides that, the specific blocker of cation-sensitive stretch-activated channels, GsMTx-4, also potently inhibited osmotic-induced ECRE frequency increases. It has to be pointed out that from our present results it seems that both cation-specific MsC as well as more Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> selective MsCa are involved in the control of ECRE inhibition in healthy muscle. So far, there are some speculations about the molecular nature of the channels involved (see below). However, detailed identification and their pharmacological and physiological properties regarding ion sensitivity and drug response in skeletal muscle are still elusive.</p><p>Another striking difference to the only previous recording of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks in a very limited set of single mdx fibers (up to 17, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>) is the inactivation of increased ECRE activity during prolonged osmotic challenge, both hypertonic and hypotonic, in all three genotypes. Most interestingly, we did not see an &#x02018;uncontrolled&#x02019; spark activity that would not come down within 15 min of recording time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, but instead, inactivation occurred.

At the same time, the peak spark frequency values under our osmotic conditions in mdx fibres (SSF &#x0223c;0.1 ECRE per 100 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>) are very similar to the values given by Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> with about 5&#x02013;7 sparks per frame (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) in both 2 mM and 50 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> containing solution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003644-t002">table 2</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) in mdx fibres. Therefore, we can convincingly rule out a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependent process during maximum ECRE frequency on the inactivation kinetics of ECRE activity. The exact reason why Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> spark activity was reported to remain uncontrollably high remains unclear.

Alternatively, an increased Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> influx through MsC could also be responsible for a direct voltage-induced activation of the RYR1, as a greater rise in intracellular &#x0005b;Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;<sub>i</sub> was found in mdx muscle fibers in response to stretch compared with wt fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Yeung2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. This MsC-induced depolarisation would eventually trigger voltage-mediated ec-coupling apart from an action potential being present. Apart from a putative depolarisation by promiscuous MsC, a local increase in subsarcolemmal Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration was found in young (12&#x02013;16 week old) mdx <italic>flexor digitorum brevis</italic> muscle fibers, as a result of altered gating properties of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Hirn1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> that could activate the RYR1 and increase ECRE frequency through depolarisation in the resting state &#x02018;per se&#x02019;. However, the authors did not address the contribution of unspecific cation influx through MsC to the increased subsarcolemmal Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Also, the resting membrane potentials given by Hirn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Hirn1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> with similar values around &#x02212;50 mV in both wt and mdx single fibers are much more depolarised than in our preparation. A possible explanation might be the enzymatic treatment used to isolate single fibers, as resting membrane potentials are known to be more depolarised following collagenase treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Friedrich3">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, the fragility of mdx fibres might induce some unspecific leakage with depolarisation during the mechanical isolation procedure, thus possibly contributing to increased cytoplasmic Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels secondary to the experimental protocol and not primary to the absence of dystrophin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Yeung2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Our current approach using exposed whole muscle reflects a &#x02018;closest to the physiological state possible&#x02019; condition to record E<sub>m</sub> values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Fraser1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Under these conditions, E<sub>m</sub> was already about 10 mV more depolarised in isotonic resting mdx fibres. However, even this substantial difference might not fully explain the already twofold increased spark frequencies that we saw in the isotonic mdx fibers. In intact muscle, SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release via the ryanodine channel is initiated by the conformational coupling between the DHPR and the RyR1 upon depolarisation that is reflected by DHPR charge movements. However, in a study on intact single fibers, no difference in the sigmoidal voltage distribution of charge movements was observed between wt and mdx muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Collet1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, in the voltage range of E<sub>m</sub> values observed here, the membrane potential &#x02013; charge movement curve should still be at the lower knee of the activation curve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Collet1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Further evidence comes from single toe muscle fibers under voltage clamp conditions that showed almost no SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release transients for potentials up to around &#x02212;55 mV in wt and mdx fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Woods2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that our E<sub>m</sub> values in mdx fibres under isotonic conditions were still subthreshold for RyR1 opening. Nevertheless, even if there was some activation of RyR1 openings in mdx fibers under isotonic resting conditions, depolarisation clearly cannot account for the marked ECRE frequency increase in mdx fibers subjected to osmotic shock. Similar to a previous study in amphibian muscle, E<sub>m</sub> values became more negative when increasing the external osmolarity twofold, in accordance with the Nernst-equation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Fraser1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, hypersomolar fiber shrinking at &#x0223c;650 mosM is expected to increase cytoplasmic ionic strength and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration resulting in hindered SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Lamb1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. These two arguments effectively rule out an explanation for the depolarisation induced increase in ECRE frequencies in mdx fibers. Clearly, MsC were involved because SSF increase was terminated/prevented by Gd<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> and streptomycine in osmotically challenged mdx fibers under 2 mM external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). However, specifically blocking MsC with the spider toxin GsMTx-4 only resulted in a minor contribution of cationic flux through MsC to the E<sub>m</sub> values during osmotic challenge reflected by &#x0223c;4 mV more repolarised values. A similarly small repolarisation has been previously documented with Gd<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> in mdx fibers under isotonic resting conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Carlson1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

The tubular forces acting on MsC during lengthening contractions may well exceed those one that appear under osmotic challenge, thus explaining these differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>ECRE are modulated by mechanosensitive channels in dystrophic muscle: possible Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependent and independent pathways</title><p>So, if osmotic challenge now resulted in activation of MsC as demonstrated above, and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> influx under osmotic challenge is probably minor, what else could contribute to increased spontaneous RyR1 openings in mdx fibres? From the considerations in the literature regarding CICR not to be present in mammalian muscle but putatively being unravelled in diseased conditions, we directly ruled out this mechanism, for the first time, in dystrophic muscle by osmotically challenging mdx fibers in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> free external solutions. Under these conditions, ECRE frequencies also substantially increased in osmotically challenged mdx fibers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003644-t001">table 1</xref>) although no Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx through MsC could have occurred ruling out CICR.

Apart from the involved putative mechanisms at the membrane level, it should be noted that a recent study showed a substantial contribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the initiation of spontaneous ECRE following osmotic shock in intact wt muscle fibers that could be traced to the activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Martins1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>). These effects may be even downstream to the MsCa induced Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx suggested in the present study, as the authors showed that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was needed for substantial NOX activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Martins1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. This is also suggested by their much larger time interval needed to produce cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> responses in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> free solutions (&#x0223c;min), as compared to the faster TTP values in our study (10&#x02013;30 s, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003644-t002">table 2</xref>). Thus, such a mechanism would well explain our observation of a positive correlation of peak ECRE frequencies with external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations, as additional Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx through MsCa during osmotic challenge in mdx fibers would activate the NOX pathway in addition to the proposed direct MsC-DHPR-RyR1 interaction (see below). Possible candidates for this MsCa channel may be related to the TRP family, as the Gd<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> sensitive growth-factor related channel (GRC) is translocated to the sarcolemma by mechanical stress in mdx muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Iwata1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, thus, representing a source for increased Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx.

Out of the TRP channel family, five were detected in skeletal muscle from wt and mdx mice (TRPC1, 2, 3 and 6) by RT-PCR and anti-sense repression of TRPC led to a decrease in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> leak channels in dystrophic fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Vandebrouck1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>.

Despite this constraint, the mdx mouse is still a very useful model in terms of not only studying the disease mechanisms but also to develop gene therapy concepts, like AAV transfer of smaller dystrophin constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Chamberlain1">&#x0005b;82&#x0005d;</xref> or exon skipping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Denti1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, that would otherwise not be available for human trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-VanDeutekom1">&#x0005b;83&#x0005d;</xref>. Single cell gene therapy in human muscle has so far been only successfully applied &#x02018;ex situ&#x02019; in cultured human myotubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-AartsmaRus1">&#x0005b;84&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One clinically relevant interpretation of our study would also be that blockers of mechanosensitive channels might prove beneficial on the phenotype in dystrophic muscle if more muscle-selective compounds could be found. The MsC blockers used in our and other studies are mainly used as tools to study cellular reactions on altered channel availability in acute single cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Yeung1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Yeung2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> or chronic myotube culture experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Imbert2">&#x0005b;85&#x0005d;</xref>. In such studies, MsC channel blockers were able to correct for stretch-induced short-term damage, like cytoplasmic Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> overload, and partly restored related reductions in force development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Yeung2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been suggested that MsC blockers might even protect against muscle damage in the intact mdx mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Yeung1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, although this has never been directly tested. It would, therefore, be most interesting to know whether a chronic application of MsC blockers to mdx animals could improve the apparent phenotype. However, with the blockers currently available, this seems not possible. Gd<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> that is also used in some contrast-agents, has the potential to induce nephrogenic systemic fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Sieber1">&#x0005b;86&#x0005d;</xref>, streptomycine is an aminoglycoside antibiotics with ototoxic potency and GsMTx-4 is a potent spider toxin. Furthermore, aminoglycosides are known to interfere with ribosomes to recognize stop codons and allow a re-translation of a suppressed mutation in a gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Bogdanovich2">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>. In mdx mice, gentamicin was able to increase dystrophin expression and to improve muscle performance and functionality, however, most probably due to the re-shifts in the dystrophin gene reading frame rather than any blocking effect to MsC (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Bogdanovich2">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref> for review). However, short-term treatment of mdx mice with streptomycine, where side-effects are of less concern, already has proven to protect dystrophic muscle from eccentric contraction induced muscle membrane damage in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Whitehead1">&#x0005b;87&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our study closes the gap from altered MsC activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Suchyna1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> to impaired Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> transients in mdx fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003644-Woods1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, including now the link to the control of spontaneous ECRE in intact mammalian muscle. Mini-dystrophin expression effectively restores ec-coupling and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> handling and supports the ongoing research for suitable gene transfer strategies in DMD. Another implication of our study is that suitable mechanosensitive channel blockers might be useful in a potential drug therapy setting in DMD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003644.s001"><label>Movie S1</label><caption><p>Movie of the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> wave activity in the mdx fibre shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003644-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>.
