The link between nitrite formation and activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is still unclear. To test the hypothesis that the ALDH2 reaction is sufficient for GTN bioactivation, we measured GTN-induced formation of cGMP by purified sGC in the presence of purified ALDH2 and used a Clark-type electrode to probe for nitric oxide (NO) formation. In addition, we studied whether GTN bioactivation is a specific feature of ALDH2 or is also catalyzed by the cytosolic isoform (ALDH1). Purified ALDH1 and ALDH2 metabolized GTN to 1,2- and 1,3-GDN with predominant formation of the 1,2-isomer that was inhibited by chloral hydrate (ALDH1 and ALDH2) and daidzin (ALDH2). GTN had no effect on sGC activity in the presence of bovine serum albumin but caused pronounced cGMP accumulation in the presence of ALDH1 or ALDH2. The effects of the ALDH isoforms were dependent on the amount of added protein and, like 1,2-GDN formation, were sensitive to ALDH inhibitors. GTN caused biphasic sGC activation with apparent EC<sub>50</sub> values of 42 &#x000b1; 2.9 and 3.1 &#x000b1; 0.4 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> in the presence of ALDH1 and ALDH2, respectively. Incubation of ALDH1 or ALDH2 with GTN resulted in sustained, chloral hydrate-sensitive formation of NO. These data may explain the coupling of ALDH2-catalyzed GTN metabolism to sGC activation in vascular smooth muscle.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by Grants <grant-num>W901 DK</grant-num><grant-sponsor>Molecular Enzymology</grant-sponsor>, <grant-num>P16690</grant-num>, and <grant-num>P20669</grant-num> from the <grant-sponsor>Fonds zur F&#x000f6;derung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung in Austria</grant-sponsor> (to B.

In virtually all cells and tissues, the slow reaction of GTN with thiols, in particular GSH, yields 1,2- and 1,3-GDN together with stoichiometric amounts of inorganic nitrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>), but thiol-triggered GTN metabolism is not associated with GTN bioactivation except the still poorly understood reaction of GTN with <sc>l</sc>-cysteine that leads to formation of a bioactive species with NO-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Recently we have identified ascorbate as another endogenous reductant that causes non-enzymatic GTN bioactivation, but the reaction is slow and may not contribute significantly to the hemodynamic effects of GTN under normal physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>).</p><p>Besides these non-enzymatic reactions, a number of enzymatic pathways catalyzing GTN bioactivation have been described, but it has remained unclear whether there is a distinct enzyme that mediates the vascular effects of GTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). Several years ago, ALDH2 (mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, EC 1.2.1.3), the main mitochondrial isoform of the ALDH superfamily, was proposed as a new candidate to fulfill this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). The characteristics of ALDH2-catalyzed GTN metabolism, including relatively high GTN affinity (low micromolar) and selective formation of 1,2-GDN, rendered this pathway very promising, and several laboratories reported that pharmacological inhibition or gene deletion of ALDH2 led to significantly impaired GTN-induced vasorelaxation and vascular cGMP accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). In addition, treatment of volunteers with an ALDH inhibitor attenuated the increase in forearm blood flow caused by GTN infusion to a similar degree as observed in East Asian subjects expressing a low activity mutant of ALDH2, indicating that this pathway contributes to the hemodynamic effects of GTN in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>).</p><p>There are three early reports on inhibition of ALDH by organic nitrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), but the pharmacological implication of these observations had not been considered before the discovery of ALDH2-catalyzed GTN bioactivation by the Stamler laboratory in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Mukerjee and Pietruszko (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) showed that the cytosolic and mitochondrial ALDH isoforms are inactivated by isosorbide dinitrate in a mechanism-based manner, whereby the reversibility of enzyme inactivation by 2-mercaptoethanol suggested the involvement of sulfhydryl oxidation. Later studies confirmed and extended these observations, showing that the presence of a reductant is essential for sustained ALDH2-catalyzed GTN metabolism and bioactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Intriguingly, the most abundant cellular reductant, GSH, is ineffective, raising the question for the identity of the physiological reductant. A promising candidate is dihydrolipoic acid, which was shown to restore ALDH2 activity in GTN-exposed blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). However, enzyme reactivation required relatively high concentrations of the reductant, and evidence for a role of endogenous dihydrolipoic acid in GTN bioactivation is still missing. This issue is of considerable pharmacological interest because vascular depletion of the endogenous ALDH2 reductant may at least partially explain the phenomenon of nitrate tolerance, <italic>i.e.</italic> the loss of vascular sensitivity to GTN upon continuous application because of impaired GTN bioactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>).</p><p>Notwithstanding the large body of evidence for a significant contribution of ALDH2 to vascular GTN bioactivation, it is still unclear how the ALDH2 reaction, yielding inorganic nitrite as final product, is linked to sGC activation. One possibility would be that nitrite formation is coupled to a nitrite reductase pathway associated with the mitochondrial respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, isolated mitochondria were found to reduce nitrite to NO in the presence of respiratory substrates at low oxygen tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>), presumably via activation of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). In a recent study we confirmed these observations but found no correlation between mitochondrial respiratory rate and GTN-triggered sGC activation,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref> indicating that mitochondrial nitrite reduction is not essential for GTN bioactivation to occur. In search of alternative pathways, we have suggested that ALDH2 itself may catalyze formation of NO from GTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). However, this proposal was based on preliminary data and has not been seriously considered by others so far. Therefore, we carried out a detailed study to see whether GTN metabolism catalyzed by purified ALDH2 does indeed result in NO formation and activation of sGC. In addition, we wished to clarify whether the ability to catalyze GTN bioactivation is a specific feature of ALDH2. Interestingly, we found that both ALDH1 (cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase, ALDH1A1, EC 1.2.1.36) and ALDH2 are able to convert GTN to NO, although low GTN affinity of ALDH1 may limit the contribution of this isoform to GTN bioactivation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Materials</italic>&#x02014;Bovine lung sGC was purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>).

As expected, chloral hydrate inhibited GTN metabolism by both isoforms, whereas daidzin showed marked selectivity for ALDH2.

Therefore, we attempted to measure GTN-derived NO with a Clark-type electrode. In preliminary experiments, we observed relatively small, transient NO signals that were markedly enhanced and prolonged in the presence of superoxide dismutase (data not shown). To effectively prevent this apparent superoxide-mediated NO decay, all NO assays were performed in the presence of 1,000 units/ml of superoxide dismutase.

Considering that enzymatic nitrite reduction by the respiratory chain does not appear to contribute significantly to mitochondrial GTN bioactivation,<sup>3</sup> these results may provide a simple and conclusive explanation for previous reports showing that ALDH2-catalyzed GTN metabolism triggers accumulation of cGMP in blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>).

However, the transient time course of the NO signals that we observed even in the presence of 1,000 units/ml of superoxide dismutase indicates that the true rates might have been underestimated because of additional, unknown NO consumption pathways. This is even more relevant for the degree of sGC activation, which had to be measured in the absence of superoxide dismutase and NAD<sup>+</sup> to avoid interference of these agents with the enzyme assay. Thus, specific NO-forming activity and, in particular, sGC activation measured under our experimental conditions most likely reflect the lower limit of the true efficiency of ALDH-catalyzed GTN bioactivation.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Formation of GTN-derived NO in the presence of ALDH isoforms.</bold> Purified ALDH1 (0.5 mg; <italic>A</italic>) or ALDH2 (0.25 mg; <italic>B</italic>) was incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C with GTN (1 m<sc>m</sc> and 0.1 m<sc>m</sc>, respectively) in the absence and presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH (2 m<sc>m</sc> each) or chloral hydrate (<italic>CH</italic>; 10 m<sc>m</sc>).

An unavoidable superoxide source may be GTN itself, which was shown to trigger superoxide formation in blood vessels, thereby limiting vascular NO bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). In addition, we found that DTT, which was present to minimize mechanism-based oxidative ALDH inactivation, caused rapid consumption of authentic (DEA/NO-derived) NO that was prevented by superoxide dismutase.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref> This apparent superoxide generation may be due to DTT autoxidation described in detail recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Generation of superoxide is certainly one important factor limiting the degree of sGC activation by GTN in our experiments and may partly explain the sharply biphasic GTN concentration-response curves shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. In addition, as studied in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), oxidation of sGC-bound heme by high concentrations of GTN may counteract NO-mediated sGC activation. However, neither of these mechanisms appears to sufficiently explain limited sGC activation by a fixed concentration of GTN in the presence of increasing amounts of ALDH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Because the time course of NO release from DEA/NO was not affected by addition of the proteins (data not shown), ALDH-catalyzed GTN bioactivation may have been compromised under our experimental conditions by a mechanism-based pathway that remains to be identified.</p><p>Two lines of evidence suggest that GTN bioactivation involves the catalytic site of ALDH. First, GTN-triggered sGC activation and NO formation were blocked by established substrate-competitive ALDH inhibitors. In line with the known selectivity profile of the compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), chloral hydrate attenuated GTN bioactivation by both ALDH1 and ALDH2, whereas daidzin selectively interfered with the ALDH2-catalyzed reaction. Second, GTN concentration-response curves revealed an &#x0223c;10-fold higher potency of the nitrate to activate sGC in the presence of ALDH2 than with ALDH1. This difference in the apparent GTN binding affinities is in line with the differences in the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values of the two isoforms for aldehyde and ester substrates (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>SCHEME 1.</label><caption><p>Hypothetical pathways of ALDH-catalyzed NO formation from GTN.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc029084218s001"></graphic></fig></p><p>Our data with ALDH1 unequivocally demonstrate that the catalytic conversion of GTN into 1,2- and 1,3-GDN is not a specific feature of ALDH2, suggesting a basic reaction mechanism common to both ALDH isoforms. Despite similar characteristics of ALDH1- and ALDH2-catalyzed GTN metabolism with respect to stimulation by NAD<sup>+</sup> and preferential formation of 1,2-GDN at low GTN concentrations, there were also clear differences apparent. Besides the &#x0223c;10-fold higher GTN concentrations required for half-maximal activity of ALDH1, product distribution differed significantly between the two isoforms. In contrast to ALDH2, ALDH1 preferentially produced 1,3-GDN at saturating GTN concentrations, and the rate of 1,2-GDN formation was reduced by &#x0223c;50% at the highest GTN concentration tested. Together with preliminary findings indicating that ALDH1-catalyzed GTN metabolism is less dependent on the presence of thiols than the ALDH2-catalyzed reaction,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">5</xref> these results point to subtle differences in the catalytic properties of the two isoforms. Future studies on the structure and function of wild-type and mutated ALDH isoforms should clarify the molecular basis of these differences.</p><p>The observation that catalysis of GTN bioactivation is not a specific feature of ALDH2 is certainly interesting with respect to ALDH enzymology, but the pharmacological relevance of this finding is unclear. The low apparent GTN affinity of ALDH1 is expected to limit the contribution of this isoform to GTN bioactivation in patients treated with therapeutically relevant low doses of the nitrate. Nevertheless, ALDH1 or other isoforms capable of catalyzing this reaction could contribute to the so-called &#x0201c;high <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic>&#x0201d; pathway of GTN action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) that persists upon ALDH2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) or gene deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Interestingly, we found that GTN bioactivation catalyzed by rat liver microsomes was sensitive to chloral hydrate but not to daidzin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Collectively, the currently available data suggest that ALDH1 and possibly other isoforms of the enzyme could contribute to the low affinity component of GTN action in blood vessels.</p><p>At present we can only speculate about the mechanism underlying the observed formation of free NO radical in the course of ALDH-catalyzed GTN metabolism. The significantly enhanced activation of sGC by inorganic nitrite in the presence of the purified ALDH isoforms shows that the enzymes are capable of converting nitrite to NO that activates sGC. Inhibition of nitrite bioactivation by chloral hydrate excludes nonspecific effects of the proteins and suggests that NO formation takes place within the catalytic sites of the enzymes. However, ALDH-mediated activation of sGC by nitrite was only partial and required extremely high nitrite concentrations, seriously questioning the relevance of this reaction for formation of GTN-derived NO. Nevertheless, because the sGC assays were performed under suboptimal conditions, <italic>i.e.</italic> in the absence of NAD<sup>+</sup> and superoxide dismutase because of interference of these agents with the assay, the true efficiency of the reaction may be considerably higher. We are currently establishing a cGMP reporter assay with rat lung fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>) to circumvent those limitations of the sGC assay. The high nitrite concentration that was required for ALDH-mediated sGC activation may reflect low affinity of exogenous nitrite to the catalytic site but does not exclude that GTN-derived nitrite becomes efficiently converted to NO <italic>in situ</italic> in the course of the enzymatic reaction. Thus, the available data are not sufficient to definitively rule out nitrite as an intermediate. If NO were indeed formed from GTN-derived nitrite, this could occur either via intrinsic nitrite reductase activity of ALDH or disproportionation of nitrite after protonation in the catalytic site.</p><p>Preliminary data obtained with mutated ALDH2 indicate that the reactive cysteine residue in the active site (Cys<sup>302</sup>) is essential for NO formation and sGC activation.<sup>5</sup> Therefore, the initial step of NO formation may be a nucleophilic attack of GTN at Cys<sup>302</sup>, yielding a thionitrate intermediate. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Scheme 1</xref>, this intermediate could be converted to NO through two hypothetical pathways. (i) Rearrangement to a sulfenyl nitrite intermediate leads to homolysis to yield NO and sulfenyl radical. However, this pathway would result in irreversible inactivation of the enzyme after one turnover because of expected dimerization of sulfenyl radicals, and it does not explain why GTN bioactivation is triggered by free cysteine but not by cysteine-containing peptides (<italic>e.g.</italic> GSH) or proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic> BSA). (ii) Metal-catalyzed reaction of the thionitrate intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>) with an adjacent cysteine residue would result in formation of NO and a disulfide. This pathway accommodates reversible inactivation of ALDH2 by GTN as well as the inactivity of proteins not containing vicinal cysteine residues in appropriate conformation, but the lack of effect of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid argues against the involvement of a redox-active trace metal. However, further work with various metal chelators is required to definitively settle this issue.</p><p>It has been shown that vascular GTN metabolism results in production of hydroxylamine, suggesting that HNO may be formed as an intermediate of GTN bioactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). The NO-like properties of HNO donors such as Angeli's salt may be explained by 1-electron oxidation of nitroxyl to NO by superoxide dismutase or transition metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). Although the trace metal chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid had no significant effect on GTN-triggered sGC activation, and the purified ALDH proteins did not contain significant amounts of bound trace metals, we cannot rule out HNO as an intermediate of GTN bioactivation.</p><p>Taken together, the present results demonstrate that ALDH1 and ALDH2 convert GTN into significant amounts of NO. It is hard to judge whether this direct formation of NO explains GTN-induced cGMP formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Of note, we found that &#x0003c;5% of maximal (NO-stimulated) cGMP accumulation in blood vessels is sufficient for maximal vascular relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Therefore, suboptimal activation of sGC by GTN as observed here in the presence of purified ALDH isoforms may fully account for the ALDH-dependent vascular effects of the nitrate <italic>in vivo</italic>. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the existence of additional pathways linking ALDH-catalyzed GTN metabolism to sGC activation in vascular smooth muscle cells. Further studies are warranted to clarify the biological relevance of our findings and the molecular mechanism underlying ALDH-catalyzed NO formation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Fung, H.
