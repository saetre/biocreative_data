The major neuropathological hallmarks of AD are the formation of senile plaques (SPs) following neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which cause neuronal degeneration and synaptic loss. SPs are extracellular deposits of fibrillar and amorphous aggregates of amyloid beta-peptide (A&#x003b2;) whereas NFTs are intracellular fibrillar aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau that exhibit hyperphosphorylation. The formation of SPs and NFTs in brain regions such as the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, basal forebrain and amygdala impaired learning and memory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. AD brains also exhibit a number of pathological abnormalities, including a profound loss of synapses, reactive gliosis, and inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The brain has an endogenous immune system that is coordinated by immunocompetent cells such as microglia. The brain is also vulnerable to constitutive defense responses, such as inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The inflammation associated with the brain, neuro-inflammation, differs from that found in the periphery. Although edema and neutrophil invasion, typical features of inflammation, is not seen in the AD brain, tissue levels of inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, oxygen free radicals and reactive nitrogen species, are altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Numerous reports have indicated that neuro-inflammatory process contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. Study performed in transgenic animals suggest that neuro-inflammation plays an important role in the process of cerebral amyloid deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has been shown that inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;gTNF-&#x003b1;) or Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) can augment APP expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and A&#x003b2; formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It was also reported that cytokines are able to transcriptionally upregulate &#x003b2;-secretase mRNA, protein and enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. &#x003b2;-secretase is a key rate-limiting enzyme that initiates A&#x003b2; formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Without &#x003b2;-secretase, A&#x003b2; synthesis is either abolished or considerably reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, McGeer and Rogers proposed possible therapeutic effects of anti-inflammatory agents on the patients with AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Inflammatory mediators present in AD lesions are thought to stimulate underlying key events of the pathological cascade that result in increased A&#x003b2; production with recruitment and activation of microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Many persons with AD die with systemic inflammation such as a lung or bladder infection. The systemic inflammation will lead to the generation of circulating cytokines, which will have in turn an impact on the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, it was also reported that intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces cognitive impairment in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, underlying mechanisms involved in LPS induced cognitive impairment are not known. To investigate the impact of systemic inflammation on memory impairment and its role in cortical amyloid formation and deposition, mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS to generate systemic inflammation, and then investigated for the possible mechanisms of LPS-induced memory impairment and amyloidogenesis <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male ICR mice (Damool Science, Korea) weighing 25&#x02013;30 g and Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200&#x02013;300 g, were used in all experiments. Animals were maintained in accordance with the National Institute of Toxicological Research, Korea Food and Drug Administration guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Animals were housed in two cages (five per cage) and in a 22 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C and 45~65% relative humidity environment under a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle (8:00 a.m. ~8:00 p.m.). All animals had free access to food (Samyang Foods, Seoul, Korea) and water. The anti-inflammatory sulindac sulfide (3.75 or 7.5 mg/kg) was given orally for 3 weeks prior to the injection of LPS in <italic>in vivo </italic>study.</p><p>The mice were randomly divided within each cage and injected intraperitoneally with either 250 &#x003bc;g/kg of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or sterile saline (0.9% NaCl). For all experiments, LPS (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, serotype 055:B5, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used to induce an inflammatory response and was injected once on day 1 of behavioral testing. All injections were administered 4 hrs prior to testing. This allows enough time for the development of neuro-inflammation expressing central IL-1&#x003b2; gene (most notably in circumventricular organs, meningeal tissue, and choroid plexus) at this dose and similar doses of intraperitoneal LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Behavioral test</title><sec><title>1. Passive avoidance test (Step-through test)</title><p>The passive avoidance test is a widely accepted simple and rapid means of memory testing. Passive avoidance response was determined using a "step-through" apparatus (Med Associated Inc., St. Albans, VT, USA), which consisted of an illuminated and dark compartment (each 20.3 &#x000d7; 15.9 &#x000d7; 21.3 cm) adjoining each other through a guillotine door. Floors were constructed of 3.175 mm stainless steel rods set 8 mm apart. The test was conducted for 2 consecutive days at the same time each day. On the first day (learning trial) each mouse was placed in the illuminated compartment facing away from the dark compartment. Once the mouse enters completely into the dark compartment, it receives an electric shock (1 mA, 3 s) through the stainless steel grid floor. The amount of time it took for the mouse to enter into the dark compartment was recorded automatically, and described as step-through latency. On the second day (testing trial), the same test procedure was followed. When the mouse did not enter the dark compartment within 300s, the test was terminated and a latency of 300s was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Water maze test</title><p>The water maze test was performed as described by Morris et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] using the SMART-CS (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) program and equipment. A circular pool (height: 35 cm, diameter: 100 cm) was filled with water, dyed black by dissolving food colorings and maintained at 22~25&#x000b0;C. An escape platform (height: 14.5 cm, diameter: 4.5 cm) was then submerged 0.5~1 cm below the surface of the water in the northeastern quadrant of the pool. On training trials, the mice were placed in the pool of water and allowed to remain on the platform for 10 s and were then returned to their cage during the second-trial interval. The mice that did not find the platform within 120 s were placed on the platform for 10 s at the end of trial. 24 hrs after 6 trials (two times per day for 3 days), mice were given LPS. Four hrs after the treatment of LPS (designated as day 1), they were allowed to swim until they sought the escape platform. Escape latency, escape distance, swimming speed and swimming pattern of each mouse was monitored for 3 days (1 time/day) by a camera above the center of the pool connected to a SMART-LD program (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>After the behavioral tests, animals were perfused with PBS under inhaled diethyl ether anesthesia. Brains were immediately collected, stored at -20&#x000b0;C, and separated into cortical and hippocampal regions. The brain regions (hippocampus and cerebralcortex) were immediately stored at -80&#x000b0;C before an assay of secretase activities, A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>level as well as western blotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Astrocyte culture</title><p>As described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], 2-day-old rat pups were ice-anesthetized and decapitated. After the skin was opened and the skull was cut, the brain was released from the skull cavity. After washing with PBS, the cerebrum was separated from the cerebellum and brain stem, and the cerebral hemispheres were separated from each other by gently teasing along the midline fissure with the sharp edge of forceps. The meninges were gently peeled from the individual cortical lobes and the cortices were dissociated by mechanical digestion [using the cell strainer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA)] with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing F12 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting cells were centrifuged (1,500 rpm, 5 mins), resuspended in serum-supplemented culture media, and plated into 100 mm dishes. Serum-supplemented culture media was composed of DMEM supplemented with F12, FBS (5%), NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>(40 mM), penicillin (100 units/ml), and steptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml). The cells were incubated in the culture medium in a humidified incubator at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>for 9 days. At confluence (9 days), the flask was subjected to shaking for 16&#x02013;18 hrs at 37&#x000b0;C. The cultures were treated for 48 hrs with cytosine arabinoside and the medium was replaced with DMEM/F12HAM containing 10% FBS. The monolayer was treated with 1.25% trypsin-EDTA for a short duration after which the cells were dissociated and plated into uncoated glass coverslips. The astrocyte cultures formed a layer of process-bearing, GFAP-positive cells. The purity of astrocyte cultures was assessed by GFAP-immunostaining. Under these conditions, we can assume that over 95% of the cells were astrocytes. The cultured cells were treated with LPS or TNF-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3; for 24 hrs, and cells were harvested for the assay of A&#x003b2; and western blotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Embryonic neuronal cell culture</title><p>The Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the embryos were removed on the 18<sup>th </sup>day of gestation. The embryonic brain tissues were mechanically dissociated into individual cells in NEUROBASAL medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The resulting cells were centrifuged (1,500 rpm, 5 min), resuspended in NEUROBASAL medium containing B-27 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), L-glutamine (0.5 mM), penicillin (100 units/ml), steptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) and plated into 60 mm dishes. The culture media was changed every 2 days. Greater than 90% of the cells in these cultures were neurons as assessed by cell morphology and immunostaining with mouse monoclonal antibodies against neurofilaments (1: 5,000). 7 day cultured cells were treated with LPS or TNF-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3;gor 24 hrs, the cells were harvested for the assay of A&#x003b2; and western blotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Brain tissues and cells were homogenized with protein extraction solution (PRO-PREP&#x02122;, Intron Biotechnology, Korea), and lysed by 60 min incubation on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. Equal amount of proteins (40 &#x003bc;g) were separated on a SDS/10% or 15%-polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (GE Water &#x00026; Process technologies, Trevose, PA, USA). Blots were blocked for 2 hrs at room temperature with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk in Tris-Buffered Saline Tween-20 [TBST: 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl solution containing 0.05% tween-20]. After a short wash in TBST, the membrane was incubated at room temperature with specific antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against iNOS and COX-2 (1: 1,000 dilution, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), APP (1:500 dilution, ABR, Golden, CO, USA), BACE1 (1:500 dilution, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), C99 (1:500 dilution, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and mouse monoclonal antibody against phospho-ERK (1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz Biothechnology Inc. Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were used in the study. The blot was then incubated with the corresponding conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000 dilutions, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with the BM Chemiluminescence blotting substrate (Roche applied science, Mannheim, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence</title><p>Mice were euthanized with diethyl ether and perfused with 0.1 M PBS then with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were collected from mice following perfusion and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hrs. The brains were transferred successively to 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose solutions. Subsequently, brains were frozen on a cold stage and sectioned in a cryostate (40 &#x003bc;m-thick). Sections were treated with endogenous peroxidase (3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in PBS), and then with 0.01 M PBS blocking buffer containing 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 40 min. Then the sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>(1:2,000 dilution, Covance, Berkeley, CA, USA), and iNOS and COX-2 (1: 1,000 dilution, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), overnight. After the incubation, sections were washed in PBS and incubated with the biotinylated secondary antibodies (ABC kit, Vector Laboaratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min. The sections were washed with PBS, incubated with the avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min, and visualized by chromogen DAB (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) reaction. The sections were dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, and mounted with permaunt (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH). For the detection of cellular location of A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42</sub>, we did an immunofluorescence immunostaining. Sections were rinsed in 0.01 M PBS buffer. After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with 10% bovine serum albumin diluted in PBS. The sections were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with Rabbit Polyclonal A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>antibody (1:2000 dilution, Covance, Berkeley, CA, USA). After washing in PBS, the sections were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluro 568 conjugated Rabbit Polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution, Molecular Probe, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 2 hrs at room temperature. Next, the sections were incubated with DAPI for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Finally, the sections were rinsed, mounted on slides, and coverslipped for fluorescence microscopy and photography using ApoTome microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA). For detection of apoptotic cell death in tumor tissue, the paraffin embedded sections were then incubated in the mixture of labeling solution (450 &#x003bc;l) and enzyme solution (50 &#x003bc;l) for 1 hr at 37&#x000b0;C and washed 3 times in 0.1 M PBS for 5 min each according to manufacturer's instructions. Next, the sections were incubated with DAPI for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Finally, the sections were rinsed, mounted on slides, and coverslipped for fluorescence microscopy (DAS microscope). Positive TUNEL stains were recorded by counting the number of positively stained DAPI in the definite area.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretase activity assays</title><p>The total activities of &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretase present in cortical and hippocampal regions were determined using a commercially available &#x003b1;-secretase activity kit (R&#x00026;D systems, Wiesbaden, Germany), &#x003b2;-secretase fluorescence resonance energy transfer (BACE 1 FRET) assay kit (PANVERA, Madison, USA) and &#x003b3;-secretase activity kit, (R&#x00026;D systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, respectively.

However, in the testing trial (day 1), the mice which received a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (250 &#x003bc;g/kg) showed a significantly reduced step-through latency compared to those injected with vehicle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In the water maze test, the mice exhibited progressively decreased escape latency by the training (3 days after training; 2 times/day, total of 6 times training), and the escape latency at the end of training (7<sup>th </sup>escape latency) to the platform was about 403 &#x000b1; 44 cm and 19 &#x000b1; 1 s (data not shown). LPS was then administered into the mice. Similar to the result in the step through test, LPS-treated mice showed longer escape latency (the time required to find the platform) and escape distance (the distance swam to find the platform) than the control group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

However, the exact relationship and mechanisms are not clear. Therefore, we tried to establish a convincing theoretical link between neuro-inflammatory reaction and amyloidogenesis.

In <italic>in invo and in vitro </italic>studies, expression of the genes involved in inflammation and in amyloidogenesis was also concomitantly increased by the LPS treatment. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory drug sulindac sulfide inhibited the LPS-induced memory impairment and amyloidogenesis. These results indicate that systemic inflammation induced by LPS could cause memory impairment through enhancement of amyloidogenesis.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that LPS influences A&#x003b2; deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and anti-inflammatory agents prevent A&#x003b2; deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Ibuprofen, a commonly used nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug, decreased cytokine-stimulated A&#x003b2; production in human neuronal cells and astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It also reduced A&#x003b2; levels and brain inflammation in Tg2576 AD mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Indometacin given to Tg2576 mice also reduced insoluble A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Our previous data also showed a co-elevated expression of A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>and COX-2 as well as IL-1 in presenlinin 2 mutant AD transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our present study demonstrated that co-expression of inflammatory proteins COX-2 and iNOS, and amyloidogenic proteins BACE and C99 was higher in the LPS-treated mice brains, and LPS alone or LPS with IFN-&#x003b3; or TNF-&#x003b1; treated cultured astrocytes and neuronal cells. However, the anti-inflammatory drug sulindac sulfide decreased the LPS-induced expressions of BACE and C99 as well as COX-2 and iNOS. These data indicate that expression of inflammatory proteins could be linked with expression of the proteins related with amyloidogenesis. We also found that LPS treated brains showed higher levels of A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>but lower levels of A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40</sub>. It may be interesting to note that several other investigators demonstrated that A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40 </sub>could be cytoprotective. Kuperstein et al. reported that A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40 </sub>protects fetal rat brain from intrauterine ischemic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Zou et al. also demonstrated that A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40 </sub>protects neurons from damage induced by A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>in culture and in rat brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] via serving as an antioxidant molecule against metal-induced oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This increase of A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>with concomitant decrease of A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40</sub>could be related with the elevation of the expression of amyloidogenic proteins in LPS-treated mice brains, and could also be involved in neuronal damages causing memory dysfunction. Very similar to our findings, Hauss-Wegrzyniak and Wenk showed that LPS induced extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid fibrils into the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, our results suggest that there is a close connection between amyloidogenesis and neuro-inflammation induced by systemic injection of LPS, and thus neuro-inflammation enhances A&#x003b2; generation which impairs memory function.</p><p>The way LPS induces amyloidogenesis is not clear. However, it could be related with the change in secretase activities. APP is first cleaved by &#x003b2;-secretase at its &#x003b2;-cleavage site generating a membrane bound C99 whose subsequent proteolysis by a second enzyme, &#x003b3;-secretase produces A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42</sub>. Thus, we determined secretase activities. Consistent with the increasing effect on A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>generation and expression of APP, BACE and C99, LPS treatment increased &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretase activities. It has been shown that inflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; augmented APP expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and A&#x003b2; formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and these processes may be related with the activation of transcriptional upregulation of &#x003b2;-secretase mRNA, protein and enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has also been observed that TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3; stimulate &#x003b3;-secretase so as to control A&#x003b2; generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Sheng et al. also reported that the systemic injection of LPS increases APP expression and processing with accumulation of A&#x003b2; in APPswe transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. LPS-induced increase of APP level in the present study is in agreement with the observation by Rogers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] who demonstrated that the primary inflammatory cytokine enhanced APP gene expression at the translational level through the well characterized IL-1 responsive element of APP mRNA. Taken together, these data indicated that LPS-enhanced inflammatory reactions could influence APP processing through the enhancement of &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;-secretase activities, thereby affecting amyloidogenesis. Bandyopadhyay et al. showed that cytokine interleukin-1&#x003b1; stimulates non-amyloidogenic pathway by the alpha-secretase (ADAM-10 and ADAM-17) cleavage of APP in human astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It was observed that IL-1&#x003b2; induced sAPP&#x003b1; release via &#x003b1;-secretase cleavage in neuroglioma U251 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We also found that LPS decreased &#x003b1;-secretase. These findings suggest that one of other mechanism increasing of &#x003b2;-amyloid by LPS may be in part due to the inhibition of &#x003b1;-secretase activity.</p><p>The signals in LPS treatment induced amyloidogenesis could be involved with the activation of AP-1 since APP gene promoter contains potential activator protein-1 (AP-1) recognition site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and LPS could activate AP-1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Activation of the MAP kinase pathway may relay the amyliodogenesis signal as demonstrated in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] in which MAP kinase plays a role in neuro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathology of relevance to AD. In the present study, it was also found that phosphorylation of ERK, a type of MAP kinase, was elevated in the LPS treated group, and sulindac sulfide decreased the activation of ERK and A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>secretion in neuronal cells (data not shown). These data indicate that ERK/AP-1 signal pathway may be important in the LPS-induced amyloidogenesis.</p><p>The consequence of elevated A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>by LPS could cause neuronal cell death, and this may be associated with memory impairment. In fact, we found that LPS-treated mice brains showed increased number of cell death <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, treatment of sulindac sulfide inhibited LPS-induced neuronal cell death, suggesting that induction of neuronal apoptotic cell death by LPS may directly result from the induction of amyloidogenesis by neuro-inflammation. Noble et al. reported that acute systemic inflammation induces central mitochondrial damage and amnesic deficit in adult Swiss mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Sparkman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and Milatovic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and Szczepanik and Ringheim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] reported that intraperitoneal injections of LPS cause AD-like neuronal degeneration. We have also found that mutant presenilin 2 (a genetic AD model) mice brains showed increased inflammation and accumulation of A&#x003b2;g accompanied by an increase of apoptotic neuronal cell death. LPS induced neuro-inflammatory signal activation (Cox-2 and ERK activation) could be involved in the LPS-induced neuronal cell death. Jang and Surh showed that beta-amyloid-induced apoptosis is associated with cyclooxygenase-2 up-regulation through activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, which is mediated by upstream kinases including ERK and p38 MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. We also previously demonstrated that Bcl-2 overexpression protects neuronal cells against A&#x003b2;-induced cell death in differentiated PC12, and its protective effect was related to the reduction of A&#x003b2;-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Even though the exact signal pathways in the LPS-induced neuronal cell death and amyloidogenesis are not clear, the increase of apoptotic neuronal cell death via the elevation of A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>could be an important mechanism in LPS-induced memory impairment. The activation of astrocytes by treatment with LPS may induce several cytotoxic cytokines which could also hurt neighboring neuronal cells via directly killing mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] or via elevation of A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In conclusion, systemic inflammation by treatment with LPS causes elevation of amyloidogenesis and neuronal cell death which finally result in memory impairment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our current study showed that systemic inflammatory stimuli elevated amyloidogenesis through activation of &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretases accompanied with inhibition of &#x003b1;-secretase leading to elevated A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>levels <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>. This co-elevated inflammation and amyloidogenesis resulted in neuronal cell death, and thus memory impairment. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory drug sulindac sulfide inhibited both amylodogenesis and neuro-inflammation which led to recovery effects on the LPS-induced memory impairment. Therefore, the present data suggest that systemic inflammation could be involved in the development and/or progression of AD, and anti-inflammatory drugs might be useful for the prevention of AD.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JWL performed behavioral tests and some of ELISA assay, and performed western blotting, performed some of the statistical analyses, and prepared and wrote the manuscript.
