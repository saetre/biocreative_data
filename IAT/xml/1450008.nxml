The transcription factor SHORT-ROOT (SHR) is a critical component in a developmental pathway regulating both the specification of the root stem cell niche and the differentiation potential of a subset of stem cells in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root. To obtain a comprehensive view of the SHR pathway, we used a statistical method called meta-analysis to combine the results of several microarray experiments measuring the changes in global expression profiles after modulating SHR activity. Meta-analysis was first used to identify the direct targets of SHR by combining results from an inducible form of SHR driven by its endogenous promoter, ectopic expression, followed by cell sorting and comparisons of mutant to wild-type roots. Eight putative direct targets of SHR were identified, all with expression patterns encompassing subsets of the native SHR expression domain. Further evidence for direct regulation by SHR came from binding of SHR in vivo to the promoter regions of four of the eight putative targets. A new role for SHR in the vascular cylinder was predicted from the expression pattern of several direct targets and confirmed with independent markers. The meta-analysis approach was then used to perform a global survey of the SHR indirect targets. Our analysis suggests that the SHR pathway regulates root development not only through a large transcription regulatory network but also through hormonal pathways and signaling pathways using receptor-like kinases. Taken together, our results not only identify the first nodes in the SHR pathway and a new function for SHR in the development of the vascular tissue but also reveal the global architecture of this developmental pathway. </p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Meta-analysis to combine the results of several microarray experiments reveals a new function for the transcription factor SHORT-ROOT in the development of vascular tissue.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>How stem cell populations are maintained and how their differentiation potential is regulated are key issues in developmental biology. In higher plants, stem cells are located in specialized structures called meristems &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. In the root meristem of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the stem cells or initials surround a group of slowly dividing cells named the quiescent center (QC), which acts as a signaling center that positions and maintains the stem cell niche ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Stereotyped divisions of the initial cells generate the radial symmetry of the root, where concentric layers of epidermis, cortex, endodermis, and pericycle surround a central vascular cylinder, with the latter two tissues forming the stele. For example, cortex and endodermis (collectively named ground tissue) originate from the asymmetric division of a single initial cell in the meristem: the cortex/endodermis initial (CEI) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g001">1</xref>B) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. This initial is first cleaved transversely, generating a new initial cell and a daughter cell. The CEI daughter cell then divides longitudinally, generating the first cells of the endodermal and cortical cell lineages. </p><p>SHORT-ROOT (SHR) is a putative transcription factor of the GRAS family and is a key component in a developmental pathway regulating the specification of the root stem cell niche as well as the radial patterning of the root in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b006">6</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. In <italic>shr</italic> mutants, a progressive disorganization of the QC is observed together with a loss of stem cell activity and a cessation of root growth. Mutation of the <italic>SHR</italic> gene also affects the development of the ground tissue and perturbs the radial pattern of the root. <italic>shr</italic> mutants do not undergo the longitudinal cell division of the CEI daughter cell, resulting in a single layer with only cortex attributes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g001">1</xref>E) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. SHR is thus implicated in specification of the root stem cell niche, asymmetric division of the CEI, and endodermis fate specification. <italic>SHR</italic> mRNA is exclusively found in the stele but the SHR protein was shown to be present in all of the cells adjacent to the stele ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that movement from the stele could allow SHR to act as a positional signal in stem cell specification and radial patterning. </p><p>Identification of the genes regulated by the SHR pathway is essential to fully understand SHR function in root development. However, our knowledge of this pathway is still limited and <italic>SCARECROW (SCR)</italic> is the only gene that has been demonstrated to be downstream of SHR &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>SCR</italic> encodes another member of the GRAS family and is expressed in all of the cells adjacent to the stele ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. In <italic>scr</italic> mutants, the asymmetric division of the CEI daughter also does not occur ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g001">1</xref>F) and <italic>SCR</italic> was shown to be cell-autonomously required for QC specification and for the longitudinal cell division of the CEI daughter &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b009">9</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. The expression of <italic>SCR</italic> is strongly reduced in the <italic>shr</italic> mutant background, suggesting that SHR activity is necessary for full <italic>SCR</italic> expression &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together, these observations show that <italic>SCR</italic> functions downstream of <italic>SHR</italic> in root stem cell niche specification and asymmetric cell division. However, expression of <italic>SCR</italic> in the QC of <italic>shr</italic> mutants cannot rescue QC function and only partially rescues stem cell maintenance &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, indicating that SHR function in stem cell specification is not limited to its requirement for activating <italic>SCR</italic>. Moreover, <italic>SCR</italic> is not involved in endodermis specification since the mutant ground tissue layer in <italic>scr</italic> plants has a mixed cortex/endodermis identity. A number of unidentified genes are thus expected to act downstream of <italic>SHR</italic> in parallel with <italic>SCR</italic>. </p><p>Genome-wide transcriptional analyses after modulation of transcription factor activity provide a powerful way to identify downstream genes. Although this allows for the screening of most of the genes in the genome, the large datasets require considerable effort to detect a signal among the noise &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. This is particularly true in multicellular organisms where genes can be expressed in small subsets of cells in an organ and transcriptional profiles are usually acquired from mixed tissue types &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b014">14</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. A common solution to find transcription factor targets in higher organisms is to generate several complementary datasets from tissues overexpressing the transcription factor of interest and from loss-of-function mutants or by doing time series experiments using inducible overexpression of the transcription factor &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b017">17</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Analysis of consistency across experiments, using notably Venn diagrams, can then be used to minimize the rate of false-positives. The classical statistical method, called meta-analysis, combines the statistical information from several independent experiments and offers a way to maximize the use of the information available from each experiment. Meta-analysis was recently used to identify cancer signatures from tumor profiling experiments and was shown to decrease the false-positive rate by diminishing the artifacts associated with a single experiment &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b023">23</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, meta-analysis was also shown to increase the statistical power of detecting small changes in gene expression using microarrays &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>In this report, we used meta-analysis to study the SHR developmental pathway and implemented a new approach for the combination of multiple independent experiments to analyze developmental pathways in a multicellular organism. By borrowing strength from two other independent experiments, we were able to use an inducible form of SHR driven by the native <italic>SHR</italic> promoter to identify the direct targets of SHR. By doing so, we identified eight direct targets of SHR, one of which is the <italic>SCR</italic> gene. Binding of SHR to four of the eight promoter regions was confirmed in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression patterns of the direct targets, determined using either &#x0201c;digital in situ&#x0201d; &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; or RNA in situ hybridization, show that the SHR protein regulates transcription in its entire domain, including the stele. This suggests that the SHR protein regulates the development of all of the tissues where it is present and was confirmed through further analysis of stele development in the <italic>shr</italic> mutant. To initiate the construction of a meaningful genetic network, we then used the meta-analysis approach to perform a global survey of the indirect targets regulated by SHR. Our analysis shows that SHR regulates not only a large transcription factor network but also hormonal pathways as well as signaling pathways using receptor-like kinases (RLKs). Taken together, our results thus not only identify the first nodes in the SHR pathway and a new function for SHR in the stele but also reveal the global architecture of this developmental pathway. </p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression of an Inducible Form of SHR in Its Endogenous Domain Rescues Root Growth and Radial Patterning Defects in the <italic>shr</italic> Mutant </title><p>To produce the first reagent for the identification of SHR direct targets using meta-analysis, we generated a glucocorticoid inducible form of SHR ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Inducible versions of transcription factors have been widely used in plants for the identification of downstream targets &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b027">27</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. However, while previous studies have relied on the use of a constitutive promoter, we sought to use a native promoter to minimize spurious effects linked to ectopic expression. The SHR protein was fused to the ligand-binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and expressed under the control of the 2.5-kilobase (kb) 5&#x02032; upstream region of SHR ( <italic>pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> construct: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The translational enhancer element (TE) from tobacco etch virus was also included to compensate for possible functional attenuation due to the protein fusion. The GR domain is expected to prevent a protein fused to it from entering the nucleus. This block can be released by treating with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex), thereby allowing the translocation of the fusion protein into the nucleus (reviewed in &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>The <italic>pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> construct was introduced into the <italic>shr-2</italic> mutant background, which is a presumed null allele ( <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> plants) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. As expected, <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> plants looked identical to <italic>shr-2</italic> in the absence of Dex, in terms of root length and radial pattern ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">2</xref>D). Upon germination of <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> plants on a medium containing 10 &#x003bc;M Dex, we observed a complete rescue of root length, indicating a restoration of stem cell activity, and radial pattern ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">2</xref>E and unpublished data). Transverse sections of plants grown in the presence of Dex were also used for immunostaining with the JIM13 antibody. The JIM13 antibody has been shown to specifically bind an arabinogalactan epitope found in endodermal and stele cells &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. The immunostaining showed a Dex-dependent restoration of endodermal attributes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">Figure 2</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">2</xref>G). </p><p>To determine the time-frame for Dex treatment, we crossed the <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> plants with a transgenic line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the 2-kb 5&#x02032; upstream region of the <italic>SCR</italic> gene ( <italic>pSCR::GFP</italic> plants). As previously mentioned, <italic>SCR</italic> has been shown to be downstream of SHR &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; and is expressed specifically in the endodermis, the CEI and daughter, and the QC ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">Figure 2</xref>H) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. In the absence of Dex, no GFP expression was detected in 5-d-old <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR pSCR::GFP</italic> plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">Figure 2</xref>I), confirming previous results showing a decrease in <italic>SCR</italic> expression in <italic>shr</italic> mutants &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. When these plants were transferred to a medium containing 10 &#x003bc;M Dex, we observed a strong accumulation of GFP after 6 h as well as a few asymmetric cell divisions (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">Figure 2</xref>J). Using quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR), we found <italic>SCR</italic> mRNA levels to be similarly induced 6 and 24 h after Dex treatment in <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> plants ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). This suggests that SCR is already induced at its higher level 6 h after treatment. These observations indicate that at least some of the downstream targets of SHR are induced after 6 h of Dex treatment. They also confirm the results obtained with the JIM13 antibody and show that endodermal characteristics can be rapidly restored after treatment with Dex. </p><p>Fusion of GR to transcription factors that control floral organ development has been used to identify their direct targets through the concurrent short-term application of Dex with the translational inhibitor cycloheximide (Cyc) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. This allows for the transcription of immediate targets but presumably blocks those genes that are further downstream in the pathway by preventing the translation of intermediary factors. To demonstrate that such an approach could be efficiently used to identify SHR direct targets, we studied the effect of a short-term Dex and Cyc treatment on the translation of GFP in the <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR pSCR::GFP</italic> plants. The induction of GFP fluorescence normally observed after 6 h of Dex treatment was entirely inhibited by concurrent treatment with 10 &#x003bc;M Cyc ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">Figure 2</xref>J and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g002">2</xref>K). This indicates that translation was effectively inhibited by the Cyc treatment. Using QRT-PCR, we also observed that <italic>SCR</italic> mRNA is induced in <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> plants after 6 h of Dex treatment even in the presence of Cyc ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). This is a first demonstration that SCR is a direct target of SHR and suggests that Cyc effectively inhibits translation without affecting transcription of direct target genes. </p><p>Taken together, these results suggests that the SHR:GR fusion protein fully complements the <italic>shr-2</italic> mutant when expressed under the <italic>SHR</italic> endogenous promoter and that the <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> plants can be used to identify the direct targets of SHR. </p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>A Microarray-Based Meta-Analysis Identifies Direct Endogenous SHR Targets</title><p>We next developed a whole-genome meta-analysis approach in order to identify the direct targets of SHR using the inducible SHR protein driven from the SHR native promoter (i.e., the <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> plants). We first performed three independent genome-wide transcriptional analyses after modulation of SHR activity. We obtained transcriptional profiles from root tips of 5-d-old <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> plants treated with Dex and Cyc or with Cyc alone for 6 h using the Affymetrix ATH1 arrays (&#x0201c;direct induction experiment&#x0201d;). As described above, genes differentially expressed between these two treatments are expected to be the direct targets of SHR. </p><p>The two other experiments were then chosen in order to minimize the impact of secondary effects and thus the occurrence of false positives. The second experiment, the &#x0201c;loss-of-function&#x0201d; experiment, was designed to identify genes differentially expressed between the <italic>shr</italic> mutant and the wild-type. Since the gross morphological effects of the <italic>shr</italic> mutation become readily apparent only after 5 d, we profiled RNA from the root tips of 5-d-old <italic>shr-2</italic> mutants and wild-type plants. By doing so, we limited the secondary effects of the <italic>shr</italic> mutation on the root transcriptome. </p><p>For the third experiment, we used plants expressing a functional SHR:GFP fusion under the control of the regulatory sequences from the <italic>WEREWOLF (WER)</italic> gene (&#x0201c;ectopic expression experiment&#x0201d;). <italic>WER</italic> is transcribed in the epidermis, the lateral root cap (LRC), and epidermal/LRC initials ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, which together span a domain that lacks native SHR protein and RNA. Expression of the SHR:GFP fusion has been shown to be sufficient to induce markers of endodermal fate in these cells and to activate asymmetric cell division in the initials &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. To specifically identify the genes activated by SHR in this domain, we used the approach developed by Birnbaum et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The roots of plants expressing either SHR:GFP ( <italic>pWER::SHR:GFP</italic> plants) or GFP ( <italic>pWER::GFP</italic> plants) in the <italic>WER</italic> domain were dissociated into single cells by enzymatic digestion of their cell walls. The GFP-expressing cells were then sorted with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, and the RNA population of these cells was analyzed on microarrays. By this approach, we could thus focus specifically on the transcriptome of a single tissue where SHR ectopic expression was proved to activate SHR physiological responses. </p><p>The three microarray datasets were then analyzed for differential expression using a mixed-model ANOVA, and the resulting <italic>p</italic>-values were combined in the classical meta-analytic technique of Fisher's inverse &#x003c7; <sup>2</sup> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. In this process, we selected genes for which at least two experiments showed that SHR regulated their expression level (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). One of these two experiments had to be the direct induction experiment, since it is the only one that allowed for the inference of direct targets. Importantly, we also verified that the identified genes were not induced by Dex in the absence of the <italic>pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> construct by analyzing on ATH1 microarrays the RNA profiles of roots of 5-d-old wild-type plants treated with Dex or a mock treatment for 6 h (unpublished data). </p><p>Using this procedure, we identified with high statistical confidence eight candidate direct targets that are positively regulated by SHR ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Four candidate genes encode putative transcription factors. They are <italic>SCR, SCARECROW-like 3 (SCL-3),</italic> which is another GRAS family member shown to be expressed in the endodermis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, and two closely related C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors that we named <italic>MAGPIE (MGP)</italic> and <italic>NUTCRACKER (NUC).</italic> It is noteworthy that <italic>SCR</italic> was identified as a candidate direct target, given that we already had strong evidence that it was downstream of SHR. The AT5G67280 candidate gene encodes an RLK that belongs to the LRRIII subfamily of RLKs &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; and will be referred to as <italic>RLK</italic> in this report. Two candidates encode metabolic enzymes: a tropinone reductase <italic>(TRI),</italic> which may regulate tropane alkaloid synthesis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, and the BR6ox2/Cyp85A2 cytochrome P450 <italic>(BR6ox2),</italic> which is potentially involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

We conducted ChIP with a polyclonal antibody to the GFP protein followed by quantitative real-time PCR (ChIP-QRT-PCR) to test for quantitative enrichment of the eight candidate gene promoters ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Primers to the 5&#x02032; upstream sequences of the putative target genes were used for PCR amplification from the immunoprecipitated DNA from wild-type plants compared to immunoprecipitated DNA from transgenic plants expressing the SHR:GFP fusion under control of the native 2.5-kb SHR promoter &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Using this method, we detected an enrichment of the signal in four of the eight cases ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), with very strong enrichment (227-fold and 43-fold) for two of the targets <italic>(SCR</italic> and <italic>MGP).</italic> For <italic>SCR,</italic> the target with the highest enrichment in the ChIP-QRT-PCR assay, we scanned the promoter with primers and found two peaks of strongest enrichment. One peak was between 209 and 528 bp from the start site of translation and the other was at approximately 1 kb ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). This result indicates that SHR binds to the promoters of four of the direct target candidate genes tested <italic>(SCR</italic>, <italic>MGP, TRI,</italic> and <italic>NUC)</italic> and suggests that there may be more than one binding site for SHR on the <italic>SCR</italic> promoter. The absence of enrichment for the other four candidates is not evidence for a lack of functional binding as it could be related to dilution due to restricted expression domains, lower binding constants, or some combination of these factors. Together with the ability of SHR to activate gene expression in the absence of protein synthesis, this demonstrates that SHR has transcription factor activity and, most important, confirms that at least four of the eight direct targets identified by the meta-analysis are directly bound by SHR in vivo. </p><p>As an alternative approach to confirming our results and a means of gaining insight into the possible function of the putative direct targets of SHR, we asked if their expression patterns were compatible with direct regulation by SHR. We first analyzed their expression patterns in the root using the digital in situ approach &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, which measures gene expression among cell and tissue types (radial zones) and along the developmental gradient (longitudinal zones) in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root. To determine specificity of the spatial expression pattern of the putative direct targets, we obtained statistical significance levels for differential expression between the seven previously published radial zone microarray datasets (atrichoblast, columella, LRC, stele, QC/initials, ground tissue, and endodermis: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d; as well as one that we generated from a pericycle-specific enhancer trap line (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We performed a similar statistical analysis of differential expression in the longitudinal zone datasets (meristematic, elongation, and early differentiation zones: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. The results from this data analysis match precisely the known expression pattern for <italic>SCR</italic> and <italic>SCL-3</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. It shows that six of the eight putative direct targets of SHR are significantly enriched in a radial cell-type in which SHR protein is present versus all cell-types in which SHR is absent ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The two exceptions are <italic>SNE</italic> and <italic>RLK,</italic> which both appear to be enriched at low levels in the QC/initials compared to two, but not all three, non-SHR cell-types ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Only <italic>SNE</italic> was significantly enriched in a longitudinal zone, and it is in the meristem ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Thus, all of the putative direct targets of SHR are either significantly enriched or have some component of their expression in an SHR cell-type, as expected from genes directly regulated by SHR. </p><p>The two novel transcription factors <italic>MGP</italic> and <italic>NUC</italic> have not been described previously, and we decided to use RNA in situ hybridization to further analyze their expression pattern in wild-type plants during embryogenesis and in the postembryonic root ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">Figure 4</xref>C&#x02013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">4</xref>J). <italic>MGP</italic> was first detected in the lower tier of the mid-globular stage embryos in the procambium and the basal cells of the ground meristem ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">Figure 4</xref>C; embryo stages after &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;). This expression was maintained throughout embryogenesis and was progressively restricted to the tip of the embryonic root ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and unpublished data). After the heart stage, <italic>MGP</italic> was most strongly expressed in the vascular stem cells and the basal cells of the ground tissue including the initials. Lower expression levels could also be detected higher in the stele and in the ground tissue. The same expression pattern was seen in the postembryonic root ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). The expression pattern of <italic>NUC</italic> is essentially identical ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">Figure 4</xref>G&#x02013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">4</xref>I), confirming that <italic>MGP</italic> and <italic>NUC</italic> are expressed in a portion of the SHR expression domain. Moreover, expression of both <italic>MGP</italic> and <italic>NUC</italic> is completely lost in the embryonic and postembryonic root of <italic>shr-2</italic> mutants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">Figure 4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">4</xref>J). SHR is thus necessary to activate and maintain the expression of both genes throughout development, in agreement with a direct regulation of <italic>MGP</italic> and <italic>NUC</italic> by SHR. </p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the promoters of four of the eight putative direct targets we identified were bound in vivo by SHR and that the RNA of the eight putative targets is found in tissues with SHR protein. We have also confirmed by in situ hybridization that SHR is necessary to activate and maintain the expression of two previously uncharacterized transcription factors, <italic>MGP</italic> and <italic>NUC,</italic> with the promoter of these two genes being bound by SHR. These results provide very strong evidence for direct regulation by SHR of four of the eight candidate genes <italic>(SCR, MGP, NUC,</italic> and <italic>TRI).</italic> The expression patterns of the other four targets <italic>(SCL3, SNE, RLK,</italic> and <italic>Br6Ox2)</italic> are consistent with direct regulation by SHR but further analysis will be necessary to confirm direct binding of SHR to their regulatory regions. </p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>A Role for <italic>SHR</italic> in the Development of the Stele Is Identified </title><p>Several putative direct targets of SHR were found to be expressed in stele tissues <italic>(MGP, NUC,</italic> and <italic>Br6ox2)</italic> which suggested a role for SHR in the stele and prompted us to investigate stele development in <italic>shr</italic> mutants. Previous phenotypic characterization had focused on the dramatic effects on root length and radial patterning &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b006">6</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. We first detected a significant reduction in the number of stele initials in 4-d-old <italic>shr-2</italic> seedlings compared to wild-type plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). The <italic>shr-2</italic> mutation also reduces the width of the stele measured at 100 &#x003bc;m above the QC (where the early differentiation of the phloem and the xylem starts in wild-type) and reduces the number of stele cell files visible on median optical sections in the same region ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). The same analysis was performed on the <italic>scr-4</italic> mutant. A significant but much smaller reduction of the number of cell files was observed but no differences were found in the number of stele initials or in the width of the stele 100 &#x003bc;m above the QC. The limited impact of the <italic>scr-4</italic> mutation on stele development suggests that the perturbations observed in <italic>shr-2</italic> mutants are not indirectly caused by the effects of the <italic>shr</italic> mutation on QC activity or ground tissue development. These observations thus suggest that <italic>SHR</italic> plays a direct role in regulating the cell divisions that generate the initials, which in turn determine the number of cell files in the stele. </p><p>To determine if <italic>SHR</italic> also plays a role in cell specification in the stele, we analyzed the effect of <italic>SHR</italic> mutation on the expression of two stele-specific markers (Q0990 and J2094). The Q0990 GFP marker is expressed in all the stele initials, with the exception of the pericycle initials ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g005">5</xref>C). In 19 of 23 <italic>shr-2</italic> plants, Q0990 was only detected in a subset of stele initials or completely absent ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g005">Figure 5</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g005">5</xref>E and unpublished data). Q0990 expression was also generally restricted to the region of the stele above the QC and not observed in the more mature tissues (unpublished data). Moreover, Q0990 was often detected in some pericycle initials in <italic>shr-2</italic> mutants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g005">Figure 5</xref>E and unpublished data). The J2094 marker is specifically expressed in the protophloem in wild-type root tips ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g005">Figure 5</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g005">5</xref>G). In 13 of 23 <italic>shr-2</italic> plants, an expansion of the expression domain of J2094 was observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g005">Figure 5</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g005">5</xref>I). These results indicate that the <italic>shr-2</italic> mutation strongly perturbs the specification of the stele initials as well as the patterning of the stele tissues, and notably the phloem and procambium tissues. </p><p>Taken together, our data indicate that <italic>SHR</italic> plays a role both in regulating division of the precursors to the stele initials, which probably involves asymmetric cell division as well as a role in regulating the specification of the progeny of these initials. These effects are more subtle than those observed for the ground tissue, and our genomic approach to characterizing the SHR pathway led to their discovery. </p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Global Analysis of the SHR Pathway Identifies Transcription Factors and Proteins Involved in Signaling Pathways as Essential Components of the SHR Subnetwork</title><p>To further dissect the developmental pathway regulated by SHR, we then conducted a global analysis of the genes regulated by this pathway. Here again, we used a meta-analysis approach to identify the genes indirectly regulated by SHR in several independent experiments. Meta-analysis allowed us to focus on genes primarily affected by the SHR pathway and to minimize experiment-specific secondary effects.</p><p>We first generated a new dataset of transcription profiles from the roots of <italic>shr-2 pSHR::SHR:GR</italic> plants treated with Dex or a mock treatment for 6 h (&#x0201c;induction experiment&#x0201d;) without any translational inhibitor. The genes differentially expressed between these two treatments are expected to be those rapidly activated or repressed by the SHR developmental pathway. We then used the meta-analysis approach to combine information from this experiment and from the loss-of-function and the ectopic experiments discussed above. A gene was selected as an indirect target of SHR only if at least two of the experiments indicated that the SHR pathway affected its expression level (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Using this approach, we identified 106 genes positively regulated and 389 genes negatively regulated by the SHR developmental pathway ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). Clustering of the indirect targets using the digital in situ data ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d; indicates that in contrast to the direct targets, the SHR indirect targets are expressed across the entire root and not specifically in the SHR domain. </p><p>To understand the functional output of the SHR pathway, we used the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org">http://www.geneontology.org</ext-link>) of the SHR indirect targets to search for statistically significant overrepresentation of biological processes and molecular functions in the two sets of indirectly regulated genes ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040143-t001">Tables 1</xref> and S2). Of particular interest for understanding how SHR information is relayed along its pathway, this analysis showed a significant overrepresentation in the repressed indirect targets of genes encoding proteins involved in the regulation of transcription (molecular function &#x0201c;transcription factor activity&#x0201d;) and in phosphorylation processes (biological process &#x0201c;protein amino acid phosphorylation&#x0201d; and molecular function &#x0201c;kinase activity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;serine/threonine kinase activity&#x0201d;). This observation prompted us to look in more detail at SHR indirect targets with predicted transcription factor and kinase activity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). </p><p>We identified 46 genes (11.8&#x00025;) encoding putative transcription factors that are repressed and 10 (9&#x00025;) that are activated by the SHR pathway ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st003">Table S3</xref>), while only 6.3&#x00025; of the genes expressed in the root are predicted to encode transcription factors (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Confirming the results of the GO analysis, this overrepresentation is highly significant for the repressed transcription factors ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) but not significant for the activated ones. The digital in situ data show that these transcription factors are expressed throughout the root both radially and longitudinally ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st003">Table S3</xref> and unpublished data). Several transcription factors with known function in development are negatively regulated by the SHR pathway <italic>(PHV, PHB, TNY, ANT,</italic> and <italic>BEL1).</italic> Of particular interest were also several transcription factors encoding regulators of gibberellin and auxin signaling (see below). The SHR pathway thus regulates a large network of transcriptional factors that are broadly expressed in the root. </p><p>Of the 389 indirect targets repressed by SHR, we found 37 genes (9.5&#x00025;) that encode proteins annotated as kinases ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">Table S4</xref>). Most of these genes (29: 7.45&#x00025; of the repressed indirect targets) belong to the RLK family &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. The RLKs represent 2.17&#x00025; of the genes expressed in the root, and the enrichment in the repressed SHR targets is highly significant ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Six of the 106 indirect targets activated by SHR encode proteins annotated as kinases, and three (2.8&#x00025;) of those encode RLKs. These observations suggest that the SHR pathway also affects different signaling networks using RLKs during root development. </p><p>Finally, we focused our attention on genes regulated by SHR and involved in responses to different hormones ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st005">Table S5</xref>). We have already described evidence indicating that SHR might directly regulate <italic>SNE</italic> and <italic>BR6ox2,</italic> which suggests a link to gibberellin and BR signaling, respectively. Several genes encoding components of the gibberellin and BR pathway were found downstream of SHR ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st005">Table S5</xref>). These observations further support the idea that the SHR pathway interacts with gibberellin and BR signaling. Since auxin has been shown to be an essential player in the root meristem &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b046">46</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, we next searched for genes involved in auxin responses. We found 12 genes implicated in auxin-related processes that are repressed by SHR and none among the indirect targets activated by SHR ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st005">Table S5</xref>). Most of the repressed genes (seven of 12) are potentially involved in auxin signaling, and the other ones have been implicated in auxin polar transport <italic>(PIN3</italic> and <italic>PIN7)</italic> and auxin homeostasis <italic>(SPS, SUR2,</italic> and <italic>Cyp79B2).</italic> Thus, the SHR pathway appears to also influence auxin signaling, auxin transport, and auxin biosynthesis during root development, but primarily in a negative fashion. </p><p>In conclusion, these results show that the SHR pathway regulates the expression of a large number of transcription factors. It also affects the expression of genes involved in signaling such as those encoding RLKs and genes involved in hormonal responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>SHR is a putative transcription factor of the plant-specific GRAS family of proteins and plays a key role in root development. In this report we have used a microarray-based strategy to identify the effectors of SHR function in root development and provide evidence that SHR directly regulates transcription in planta. Through a meta-analysis approach, we combined statistical information from several independent experiments in which we analyzed transcriptional profiles after modulation of SHR activity. We predicted eight direct targets of SHR. One of the direct targets is <italic>SCR,</italic> which was previously shown to be downstream of SHR. The other seven genes had not been previously implicated in the SHR pathway. We demonstrate that the expression patterns of all of these genes are consistent with direct regulation by SHR, and our data confirm that SHR binds in vivo to the promoter regions of at least four of the putative direct targets. Taken together, our results strongly support a direct regulation of <italic>SCR, MGP, NUC,</italic> and <italic>TRI</italic> by SHR during root development, while further analysis will be necessary to confirm binding of SHR to the regulatory regions of the other four putative direct targets. We also used the meta-analysis approach to perform a global survey of the SHR pathway. Our data reveal the existence of a complex network of transcriptional and signaling events downstream of SHR. </p><sec id="s3a"><title>Meta-Analysis of Microarray Data Provides a Reliable Tool for the Analysis of Developmental Pathways</title><p>Consistency of changes in gene expression across several microarray experiments has been widely used to identify genes of potential biological interest, because it has the potential to greatly increase the confidence in the identified genes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. The meta-analysis approach formalizes the analysis of consistency through the combination of statistical information from multiple studies.

To our knowledge, this approach has not been previously used to map a developmental pathway in a multicellular organism. </p><p>We applied meta-analytic techniques to the identification of the targets of the SHR transcription factor to identify the nodes in the SHR subnetwork. The meta-analysis allowed us to identify the direct targets of SHR using an inducible SHR protein driven from its native promoter <italic>(pSHR::SHR:GR),</italic> while previous studies relied on overexpression under a strong constitutive promoter &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. The statistical tests for significance across these experiments also allowed us to reliably detect targets with low expression in only a few cell types of the root, such as seen for <italic>MGP</italic> and <italic>NUC</italic> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Our results are thus consistent with the idea that meta-analysis can be used both to ascertain consistency across experiments and to increase the sensitivity of detecting differential expression using microarrays &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>In an effort to identify the binding site for SHR, we used various motif-finding programs, including Motif-Finder, Meme, and Gibbs sampler &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d; on the four confirmed targets as well as on all eight putative targets (unpublished data). No statistically significant putative binding site with high information content was identified. This may indicate that the training set is too small to predict binding sites with confidence or that the binding site has relatively high degeneracy. It is also possible that heterodimerization of SHR with factors specific to expression subdomains results in binding sites with different position weight matrices. By tiling across the SCR promoter, we found two regions of enriched SHR binding.

The fact that several direct targets of SHR show very different expression patterns indicates that other genes probably act as coregulators with SHR in order to provide this spatial specificity. We thus propose a model where the interaction of SHR with various coregulators allows for the activation of specific direct targets. This defines functional subdomains ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) allowing SHR to function in QC specification, CEI asymmetric cell division, and early and late endodermal specification but also early and late stele specification.

Other studies of transcription factor targets have generally found equivalent numbers of indirectly activated and repressed genes in their assays or higher numbers of upregulated genes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Our data also begin to reveal the global architecture of the SHR subnetwork. We identified a large number of transcription factors downstream of SHR, with a significant enrichment of transcription factors among the repressed genes ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040143-t001">Tables 1</xref>, S2, and S3). This suggests that SHR function in root development is mediated notably through a large network of transcription factors. However, signaling events mediated by posttranscriptional modifications and small molecules such as hormones may also contribute significantly to SHR downstream function. We show that kinases are overrepresented in the set of genes repressed by the SHR pathway and that their number is higher than the genome average in the pool of activated genes as well ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040143-t001">Tables 1</xref>, S2, and S4). Seventy-five percent of these genes encode RLKs, and we show that an RLK of unknown function is directly regulated by SHR. This is strong evidence that signaling pathways involving RLKs may play a key role in mediating the SHR response. In addition to the modulation of BR signaling discussed above, the SHR pathway affects the expression of genes involved in both signaling and biosynthesis of two other hormones, gibberellin and auxin ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st005">Table S5</xref>). This global effect of the SHR pathway is likely to result in the tuning of hormonal responses and is particularly relevant for stem cell specification in the case of auxin. Auxin has been shown to be essential for positioning the QC &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, and the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in auxin responses by the SHR pathway could help to coordinate the action of the two pathways in the specification of the stem cell niche. </p><p>Taken together, our results suggest a global model of the SHR pathway where SHR controls root development through the regulation of three interconnected modules: a transcription regulator module, a hormonal module, and a signaling module ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040143-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). In this model, the interactions between these three modules determine the developmental output of the pathway on stem cell niche specification, radial patterning, and stele development. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant lines and growth conditions.</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> lines in the Columbia (Col-0), C24, and Wassilewskaya (Ws) ecotypes were used.

For the transcription factors we also used several lists of transcription factors obtained from the AGRIS ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu">http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu</ext-link>) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d; and DATF ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://datf.cbi.pku.edu.cn">http://datf.cbi.pku.edu.cn</ext-link>) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d; databases and from the Sheen lab Web site ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/sheenweb">http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/sheenweb</ext-link>). To identify the RLK in the SHR targets, we used the list established by &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. The lists of genes obtained were then manually curated. Statistical significance of enrichment over the total number of transcription factors and RLKs expressed in the root was tested using the hypergeometric distribution. To identify genes expressed in the root, we used the expression values from the mixed-model analysis and proceeded as described in &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. The threshold was set at 1 for the mixed-model analysis values, which is equivalent to the threshold of 75 used by &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. </p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by gene-specific quantitative real-time PCR (ChIP-QRT-PCR).</title><p>ChIP was conducted as in Leibfried et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b074">74</xref>&#x0005d; on roots of 5-d-old wild-type seedlings and 5-d-old seedlings expressing the <italic>SHR:GFP</italic> transgene expressed under the control of the SHR 2.5-kb promoter &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040143-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

The interactions between these three modules determine the developmental output of the pathway on stem cell niche specification, radial patterning, and stele development.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040143.g006"/></fig><table-wrap id="pbio-0040143-t001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Functional Characterization of SHR Indirect Targets</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040143.t001"/></table-wrap></sec><fn-group><fn id="n1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> MPL, TV, JUL, BS, and PNB conceived and designed the experiments.
