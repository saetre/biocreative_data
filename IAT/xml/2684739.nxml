Thus far, 3 unique untranslated first exons associated with distinct promoters in the mouse Cyp19a1 gene have been described (brain, ovary, and testis-specific). It remains unknown whether aromatase is expressed in other mouse tissues via novel and tissue-specific promoters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Real-time PCR was used to examine the aromatase expression levels in various C57BL/6 mouse tissues. 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) was used to determine the transcriptional start sites of Cyp19a1 transcripts. Promoter activity was measured using serial deletion mutants of DNA fused to the luciferase reporter gene. Primary mouse adipose fibroblasts were isolated and cultured from 16-week-old mouse gonadal fat pads.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We systematically analyzed Cyp19a1 expression in a large number of mouse tissues, and demonstrated for the first time that aromatase was expressed in the male but not female gonadal fat pad. Subcutaneous and brown adipose tissue did not contain detectable Cyp19a1 mRNA. We used 5'-RACE to clone a novel gonadal fat-specific untranslated first exon, which is spliced onto a common junction 15 bp upstream of the translation start site. This adipose-specific first exon was mapped to approximately 75 kb upstream of the translation start site. Transfection of luciferase reporter gene plasmids containing the promoter region upstream of the adipose-specific first exon into murine 3T3-L1 adipose fibroblasts demonstrated significant basal promoter activity conferred primarily by the sequence located at -343/-1 bp. Dexamethasone significantly induced activity of this adipose-specific promoter region.

These results expand the known 5'-regulatory region of the murine Cyp19a1 gene to 75 kb upstream of the translation start site. Cyp19a1 expression in mouse adipose tissue may play an important role in reproductive biology and lipid metabolism.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Aromatase cytochrome P450 is the key enzyme for estrogen biosynthesis that converts androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and 17&#x003b2;-estradiol, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The biologically active estrogen, 17&#x003b2;-estradiol, functions primarily via binding to its receptors, estrogen receptor-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and estrogen receptor-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Beyond its essential role in reproductive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], estrogen is also involved in vascular biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], lipid and carbohydrate metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], bone mineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and cognitive and other brain-related functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Estrogen is also essential for the initial development and further growth of a number of benign and malignant hormone-dependent disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Aromatase is encoded by the <italic>CYP19A1 </italic>gene in humans, which spans approximately 123 kb on chromosome 15q21.2. The ATG translational start site is located in coding exon II, and the coding region of aromatase protein is found within 30 kb of the 3'-end and contains nine exons (II-X) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The 93-kb 5'-flanking region upstream of the coding region contains a number of alternative untranslated first exons, the expression of which is driven by multiple tissue-specific promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These promoters differentially regulate expression of aromatase in gonads, adipose tissue, bone, brain, skin, fetal liver, and placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus far, 10 alternative tissue-specific first exons have been found in the human, including exon I.1, I.2 and I.2a in placenta, I.4 in adipose tissue and skin, I.5 in fetal tissues, I.f in brain, I.7 in endothelial cells, I.6 in bone, I.3 in adipose tissue, and PII in gonads. The most proximal promoter, PII, and 2 other proximal promoters, I.3 and I.6, are within the 1-kb region upstream of the ATG translational start site, whereas promoter I.4 is located 73 kb upstream of exon II. The most distally located promoter, I.1, is found approximately 93 kb upstream of the coding region. All of these 5'-untranslated first exons are spliced onto a common junction located 38 bp upstream of the ATG translational start site. Consequently, the aromatase protein is the same regardless of the splicing pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In mice, aromatase is encoded by a single gene, <italic>Cyp19a1</italic>, located on chromosome 9. Similar to humans, the ATG translation start site lies in coding exon II and the coding region of aromatase protein is found in the downstream 29-kb portion of the gene and contains 9 exons (II-X) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast to the human gene, only 3 tissue-specific untranslated first exons of the mouse <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>gene have been reported, including an ovary-specific first exon (Eov), a testis-specific first exon (Etes), and a brain-specific first exon (Ebr). To generate mouse tissue-specific aromatase transcripts, a tissue-specific first exon is spliced onto a common coding region as a result of the activation of its upstream promoters, which regulate aromatase expression in the ovary, testis, or brain. The mouse ovary- and brain-specific first exons share 100% and 93% homology with the human exons PII and I.f, whereas the recently discovered testis-specific first exon is unique to the mouse. According to a previous study, the entire mouse <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>locus is approximately 60 kb. The 3 untranslated first exons and their flanking promoter regions span more than 30 kb, whereas the 9 coding exons are restricted to about 29 kb. Promoters for Ebr and Etes are located about 31 kb and 10 kb upstream of the translation start site. As in other species, the promoter for Eov is the most proximal promoter, located 121 bp upstream of the translation start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the human, extragonadal aromatase expression plays a key role in estrogen production, especially in men and in postmenopausal women, in whom ovarian aromatase expression ceases after menopause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In particular, skin and adipose fibroblasts express physiologically significant levels of aromatase to produce sufficient quantities of estrogen, which may prevent bone loss in both sexes or contribute to endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Promoter I.4 is primarily responsible for regulating aromatase expression in adipose tissue and skin in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Aromatase expression, however, has not been reported in mouse adipose or skin tissue. Thus, we were particularly interested in determining whether aromatase is expressed in mouse extragonadal tissues, including fat or skin, and whether a novel promoter comparable to the human promoter I.4 regulates peripheral aromatase expression in mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Animals were housed according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Five clones from the ovary had identical transcriptional start sites (position 221 of EMBL/GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="D67046">D67046</ext-link>), and the sequences of the 5' UTRs of the ovarian transcripts (Tov) were identical to ovarian <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>cDNA described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>transcripts from 8 5'-RACE clones were identified as brain aromatase cDNA (Tbr) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The transcription start site in male mice was at position 382 of EMBL/GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="D67045">D67045</ext-link>, which was 47 nucleotides upstream from that described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

The small discrepancy between our results and previous published data with respect to the presumed transcription start sites of brain- and testis-specific <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>mRNAs may be due to a range of possible initiation sites within a confined region or slightly different techniques used in various laboratories.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of mouse <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>adipose-specific transcript in various tissues</title><p>To determine the distribution of Tad, Tov, Ttes, and Tbr in male gonadal fat, ovary, testes, and hypothalamus, exon-specific RT-PCR analysis of RNAs was performed using 5'-UTR-specific forward primers and reverse primers located in coding exon II.

Those results were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in 10-week-old and 16-week-old mouse gonadal fat (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Tbr and Tov were found in the hypothalamus.

This result indicated that basal promoter activity is conferred by a sequence located within -343/-1 bp and there may be a negative regulatory sequence within the -1637/-343 bp region of the promoter. Luciferase activity of the empty vector was not altered following dexamethasone treatment, whereas activity of the -343/-1 promoter increased by 1.6 fold after treatment with dexamethasone compared with vehicle. In the presence of dexamethasone, luciferase activity of -1637/-1 increased by 3.4 fold as compared with vehicle treatment. Both basal and dexamethasone-stimulated promoter activity levels were significantly diminished in -1637/-1 compared with the -343/-1 sequence. Although dexamethasone response was preserved in both, this is suggestive of a general silencer-type element in the -1637/-343 region, which does not eliminate glucocorticoid action.

Thus far, 2 adipose tissue-specific first exons in humans have been identified, exons I.4 and I.3, located 73 kb and within 1 kb upstream of the translational start site, respectively. Here, we demonstrated for the first time the presence of an adipose tissue-specific untranslated <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>first exon in male, but not female, mouse gonadal fat.</p><p>The mouse <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>gene, including 3 unique untranslated first exons, is expressed in ovary, testis, and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

However, analysis of the sequence of exon I.4 and Ead showed no significant similarity, nor did the Ead sequence show similarities to any other previously reported exons in humans or mice using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). Thus, our results extended the <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>5' UTR from 31 kb up to 75 kb upstream of the first coding exon.

A previous study also showed that Tgon is expressed in the testis and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and we found that Tgon was also expressed in adipose tissue. Tbr was only expressed in brain and testis, which was not consistent with a previous study which also described ovarian expression of Tbr. As shown in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], Ttes was uniquely expressed in testis, but we also found that Tgon was the major <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>transcript in testis.</p><p><italic>CYP19A1 </italic>expression in premenopausal women is mainly found in ovarian follicles, and estrogen functions as a circulating hormone on distal target tissues.

Regional variations in <italic>CYP19A1 </italic>expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue have been observed in humans, and its expression in buttocks and thighs is 2- to 3-fold greater than that in subcutaneous abdominal tissue and breast tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the present study, we showed regional variations of <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>expression in mice. <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>was expressed in male, but not female, mouse gonadal fat, and there was no <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>expression in subcutaneous fat or brown adipose tissue in either sex.</p><p>The <italic>CYP19A1 </italic>transcripts in human breast adipose tissue contain exon I.4 followed by exon 1.3 and II. In adipose stromal cells, the transcription of I.3 and II is stimulated by cAMP or prostaglandin E2. Promoter I.4 contains the interferon &#x003b3; activation element followed by a glucocorticoid response element that is a SP1-binding site, and I.4 expression is stimulated by class I cytokines and TNF&#x003b1; through the JAK1/STAT3 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We found that <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>promoter activity in male mouse gonadal fat was induced by dexamethasone, and did not change after Bt2cAMP plus PDA treatment. Adipose-specific <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>mRNA expression in primary MAF was increased by dexamethasone and augmented by FBS. This response is similar to that seen in human promoter I.4 activation, which is enhanced by binding of glucocorticoid receptors to glucocorticoid response elements. We also performed a TF search for cis-regulating elements in the new adipose promoter and found three half glucocorticoid response elements(GREs) located at -139/-134, -163/-159,-316/-311bp. Thus, it is likely that this new mouse adipose-specific aromatase promoter has a similar regulatory profile to the human adipose/skin promoter I.4, which has binding sites for glucocorticiod receptor. Our results from both Ead luciferase reporter assay and primary cultured mouse adipose fibroblasts support this notion. The promoter activity of the <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>transcript in male mouse gonadal fat may also be induced through JAK1/STAT3 pathway. Thus, cytokines in serum may function synergistically with glucocorticoid to activate this promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Estrogens play an important role in the maintenance of lipid homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The aromatase knockout (ArKO) mouse cannot synthesize endogenous estrogens, and circulating estradiol levels are at the limit of detection. ArKO mice develop an age-dependent increase in intra-abdominal adiposity. The increase in adipose tissue is associated with hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the adipocytes with a simultaneous decrease in lean mass and development of hypercholesterolemia, hyperleptinemia, and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

Aromatase-deficient patients show a similar phenotype characterized by impaired lipid and insulin metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In our study, we found that <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>was expressed in male mouse adipose tissue. In addition to circulating estradiol, locally produced estradiol in male mouse gonadal fat may play an important physiologic role in regulating lipid metabolism. Moreover, estrogen produced in gonadal fat may exert local physiologic effects on testicular maturation.</p><p>In summary, we have shown <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>expression in male mouse gonadal fat, isolated an adipose-specific untranslated first exon, and demonstrated dexamethasone-regulated promoter activity of the adipose-specific <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>transcript. Together with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], these results suggest that in mice, at least 4 different promoters actively regulate <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>expression in adipose tissue, gonads, and brain. These results expanded the 5'-regulatory region of the murine <italic>Cyp19a1 </italic>gene to 75 kb upstream of the translation start site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).
