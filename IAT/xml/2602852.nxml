Here we describe a new mechanism of T-cell immuno-regulation focused on HSP60: HSP60 is up-regulated and presented by activated T cells (HSP60 is an ergotope) to regulatory (anti-ergotypic) T cells. Presentation of HSP60 by activated T cells was found to be MHC-restricted and dependent on accessory molecules - CD28, CD80 and CD86. Anti-ergotypic T cells responded to T-cell HSP60 by proliferation and secreted IFN&#x003b3; and TGF&#x003b2;1. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the anti-ergotypic T cells inhibited IFN&#x003b3; production by their activated T-cell targets. <italic>In vivo</italic>, adoptive transfer of an anti-ergotypic HSP60-specific T-cell line led to decreased secretion of IFN&#x003b3; by arthritogenic T cells and ameliorated adjuvant arthritis (AA). Thus, the presentation of HSP60 by activated T cells turns them into targets for anti-ergotypic regulatory T cells specific for HSP60. However, the direct interaction between the anti-ergotypic T regulators (anti-HSP60) and the activated T cells also down-regulated the regulators. Thus, by functioning as an ergotope, HSP60 can control both the effector T cells and the regulatory HSP60-specific T cells that control them.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 60 kDa HSP molecule (HSP60) has been found to induce the down-regulation of immune inflammation.

Thus is important to characterize the immune regulatory mechanisms triggered by HSP60.</p><p>HSP60 appears to affect immune inflammation by at least two different mechanisms: as a ligand for innate immune receptors and as an antigen recognized by adaptive immune receptors.</p><p>HSP60 can control T cells by innate receptor dependent mechanisms. Soluble human HSP60 was found to directly signal human T cells via toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). The activation of TLR2 dependant signalling on effector T cells has two consequences: First, it inhibits the migration of T cells towards the chemokine SDF-1 &#x02013; irrespective of their antigen-specificity &#x02013; and so inhibits the general entry of T cells into inflammatory sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-ZaninZhorov1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, it down-regulates T-bet, NF-&#x003ba;B, and NFAT, and up-regulates GATA-3, leading to decreased secretion of TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3; and enhanced secretion of IL-10 by the responding T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-ZaninZhorov2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to its direct effects on effector T cells, HSP60-triggered activation of TLR2 signalling boosts the suppressive activity of human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-ZaninZhorov3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. These innate, TLR-2 mediated effects of soluble HSP60 can down-regulate T-cell dependent inflammation.</p><p>HSP60 can also control T cells by T-cell receptor dependent mechanisms. In T1DM, for example, vaccination with HSP60 epitopes activates HSP60-specific regulatory T cells that affect the T-cell response to disease-associated antigens (insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase and HSP60 itself) by inducing a shift from the secretion of INF&#x003b3; to IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Quintana1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Elias4">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>; HSP60 vaccination induces a similar cytokine shift in the response to the mycobacterial antigens that trigger AA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Quintana2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Quintana3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

In other words, might the anti-ergotypic HSP60-specific T-cell lines be affected differently by seeing their HSP60 epitopes presented by activated T cells compared to recognizing HSP60 presented by classical APC? To study this possibility, we incubated the Anti-p277 line for 3 days with either irradiated APC and p277 peptide or with irradiated, activated A2b T cells. The Anti-p277 T cells were then recovered from the cultures, maintained for 4 additional days in culture without APC or A2b T cells, and then stimulated with APC and p277 peptide, with mitogenic Con A or immobilized anti-TCR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004026-g008">Figure 8</xref> presents the outcome. It can be seen that the Anti-p277 T cells, following co-culture with APC and p277 could still respond to a second stimulation with APC and p277 or with mitogenic &#x003b1;TCR or ConA; however, previously co-culturing the anti-p277 line with activated A2b T cells rendered the Anti-p277 line anergic; the line now failed to proliferate in response to APC and p277 or to either of the two mitogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004026-g008">Figure 8A</xref>).

It remains to be seen whether HSP60 epitopes are also presented by other, non-classical MHC molecules.

However, we did not detect a concomitant increase in the number of IL-10 secretors, as we have previously described upon vaccination with DNA vaccines coding for HSP60 or its fragments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Quintana2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Quintana3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, or following vaccination with the HSP60 peptide Hu3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Quintana3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, the participation of HSP60 in anti-ergotypic regulatory networks might only account for some, but not all, of the regulatory activities of HSP60-specific T cells. Indeed, it has been recently shown that HSP60 can have direct anti-inflammatory effects on human T cells which are TLR2-dependant: free HSP60 can inhibit T-cell migration towards the inflammatory chemokine SDF-1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-ZaninZhorov1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and modify the levels of transcription factors involved in T-cell polarization, leading to decreased secretion of TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3; and enhanced secretion of IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-ZaninZhorov2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-ZaninZhorov3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Finally, the present study indicates that HSP60-specific anti-ergotypic regulatory T cells can be down-regulated as a result of their interaction with their target T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004026-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Indeed, the induction of a strongly arthritogenic T-cell effector response leading to adjuvant arthritis was found to suppress the anti-ergotypic regulator response; this down-regulation of the regulators by the effectors could be overcome by vaccinating the rats with an ergotope, CD25 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Mimran1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the magnitude of an immune response can be influenced decisively by a dynamic balance between regulators and effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Mimran2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In this light, we can view the complex roles of HSP60 in immuno-regulation: HSP60 facilitates the recognition and control of activated T cells via anti-ergotypic interactions, and this regulatory interaction also down-regulates the activity of the HSP60-specific regulators. The regulatory molecules on activated T cells that down-regulate the anti-ergotypic regulators remain to be discovered; however, it has been reported that mutual interactions between T cells (T-T interactions) can induce T-cell anergy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-LaSalle1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Taams1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the numbers of regulatory T cells reactive to HSP60 might be positively influenced by the presentation of HSP60 by professional APC and negatively influenced by the presentation of HSP60 by activated T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Cohen6">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>; regulators, too, need regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Cohen3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that the varied regulatory mechanisms mediated by HSP60 are complex indeed; not only does the immune system use innate and adaptive receptors to respond to HSP60 expressed <italic>in situ</italic> by the tissues and in body fluids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004026-Pockley1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, we can now conclude that the immune system uses its own HSP60 expressed on activated T cells as a marker that reflects their functional state and their need of regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Rats</title><p>Female Lewis rats were raised and maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the Animal Breeding Center of the Weizmann Institute of Science.
