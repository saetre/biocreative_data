The elucidation of its structure-function relationship with centromeric DNA and other kinetochore proteins is critical to the understanding of centromere assembly. CENP-C carries two regions, the central and the C-terminal domains, both of which are important for the ability of CENP-C to associate with the centromeric DNA. However, while the central region is largely divergent in CENP-C homologues, the C-terminal moiety contains two regions that are highly conserved from yeast to humans, named Mif2p homology domains (blocks II and III). The activity of these two domains in human CENP-C is not well defined. In this study we performed a functional dissection of C-terminal CENP-C region analyzing the role of single Mif2p homology domains through in vivo and in vitro assays. By immunofluorescence and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) we were able to elucidate the ability of the Mif2p homology domain II to target centromere and contact alpha satellite DNA. We also investigate the interactions with other conserved inner kinetochore proteins by means of coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation on cell nuclei. We found that the C-terminal region of CENP-C (Mif2p homology domain III) displays multiple activities ranging from the ability to form higher order structures like homo-dimers and homo-oligomers, to mediate interaction with CENP-A and histone H3. Overall, our findings support a model in which the Mif2p homology domains of CENP-C, by virtue of their ability to establish multiple contacts with DNA and centromere proteins, play a critical role in the structuring of kinethocore chromatin.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper chromosome segregation during cell divisions depends on a specialized chromosomal site, the centromere. This nucleo-proteinaceous element performs key functions in all eukaryotes from yeast to human. The structural organization of the centromere is generally multilayered and consists of a pairing domain that maintains the cohesion between sister chromatids, a central domain that contains specific centromeric DNA, and the kinetochore, the DNA/protein complex which provides the attachment site for spindle microtubules and regulates the movement of chromosomes towards the spindle poles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Earnshaw1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Failure in any of these processes results in chromosome loss and gain leading to the formation of aneuploid cells. In most organisms, centromeres are constituted by large arrays of repeats known as satellite sequences (alpha satellite in humans). These DNA sequences direct the assembly of kinetochore proteins and are strikingly divergent between even closely related species. On the other hand, numerous kinetochore proteins have been identified in both human and model organisms and found to be very conserved during evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Amor1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Foltz1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, understanding how these highly conserved proteins assemble onto divergent satellite DNA to form functional centromeres remains one of the key problems in chromosome biology. Mammalian centromeres contain mega bases of repetitive satellite DNA. This is organized into specialized chromatin consisting of nucleosomes in which histone H3 is replaced by CENP-A, an H3-like variant. This protein is composed of a variable N-terminal region and a conserved C-terminal region carrying a histone-fold domain similar to that of histone H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Sullivan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Since CENP-A depletion reduces fidelity of chromosome segregation and causes mislocalization of various kinetochore proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Howman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Blower1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, it is believed that this protein may hierarchically recruit other centromere and kinetochore components to generate a high-order chromatin structure required for the formation of the inner kinetochore surface (for recent reviews see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Allshire1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-DurandDubief1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>CENP-C is another essential kinetochore protein that localizes to the inner kinetochore plate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Saitoh1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and associates with the alpha satellite DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Politi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Trazzi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Notably, comparative analysis of the CENP-C homologues isolated from other species shows that the central and C-terminal region of the human CENP-C display different degrees of conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Talbert1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Particularly, while the central domain is poorly conserved, the C-terminal domain contains two regions that are highly conserved from yeast to mammals, suggesting that such regions might be preserved during evolution to exert critical centromere functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Talbert1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on their degree of conservation with the yeast Mif2 protein, the two regions have been named Mif2p homology domain II and III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Brown1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The Mif2p homology domain II (aa 737/759 of human CENP-C), also called CENP-C motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Talbert1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, is present in all CENP-C homologues, though its specific function has not been defined. The Mif2p homology domain III (aa 890/943 of human CENP-C) appears to be required, at least in vitro, for CENP-C dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Sugimoto1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and shares significant similarity with a protein motif that appears to be responsible for the oligo-multimerization of Cupin proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Dunwell1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

Detection of FLAG-tagged proteins in the IP-anti-HA sample lane indicates that the HA- and FLAG-labelled proteins can interact possibly by forming dimers or oligomers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows that the FLAG::638/943 and FLAG::760/943 CENP-C polypeptides were efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with the C-terminal region of CENP-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g004">Figures 4B,D</xref>).

This finding suggests that the last 120 aa of the CENP-C terminal end are critical for CENP-C self-association. To further investigate the nature of the association, HA-proteins were overexpressed in HEK-293 cells, purified through an anti-HA affinity column and eluted with an HA peptide used as a competitor. Eluted proteins were tested for oligomerization in vitro by using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent in order to stabilize possible CENP-C oligomers. Next, cross-linked proteins were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. CENP-C dimers/oligomers were detected by western blot using anti-HA polyclonal antibodies.

A construct expressing an HA::CENP-A protein was transfected into HEK-293 cells and nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies. IP-protein complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-CENP-C antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, CENP-A can co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous CENP-C protein, suggesting that CENP-A and CENP-C can interact. Next, we determined which portion of CENP-C is required for this interaction. To do this, HEK-293 cells were transfected with the HA::CENP-A expression plasmid along with FLAG::CENP-C constructs expressing different portions of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Again the HA::CENP-A was immunoprecipitated and the IP complexes were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. Results show that the C-terminal domain (aa 638&#x02013;943) can be efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with CENP-A. Consistent results were obtained when the reciprocal experiment was performed. HA::CENP-C and FLAG::CENP-A constructs were cotransfected into HEK-293 cells, immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and FLAG-tagged proteins were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Collectively these findings support the view that the C-terminal domain of CENP-C is required to contact CENP-A possibly at centromeres.</p><fig id="pone-0005832-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005832.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>CENP-C can interact with CENP-A and histone H3 through its C-terminal domain.</title><p>(A) HA::CENP-A coimmunoprecipitates the endogenous CENP-C.

The results of the experiments, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, indicate that the C-terminal CENP-C domain interacts with histone H3, in addition to CENP-A, while the transcription factor c-Myc was not immunoprecipitated by CENP-C protein fragments. To further investigate which portion of the C-terminal region of CENP-C can mediate the interaction observed with CENP-A and histone H3, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay using FLAG tagged histones co-expressed along with the HA-CENP-C constructs obtained from the partitioning of C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

To this purpose we adopted the Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) assay. The technique is based on the observation that a fluorescent protein (in this work Enhanced-GFP) can be splitted in two fragments no longer able to emit a bright fluorescence. If the two fragments, fused to proteins that physically interact, are brought in close proximity they can functionally complement and emit bright fluorescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Hu1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Kerppola4">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

To this purpose plasmids have been created to express: i) the HA::CENP-C protein fused at the HA epitope with the GFP N-terminal half (N-GFP::HA::CENPC) or with the C-terminal half (C-GFP::HA::CENPC), and ii) the HA::CENP-A protein fused at the C-terminal with the GFP C-terminal (HA::CENPA::C-GFP) or N-terminal halves (HA::CENPA::N-GFP). The four expression plasmids have let us to perform the BiFC assay by coexpressing two different chimeric protein combinations: 1) N-GFP::HA::CENPC/HA::CENPA::C-GFP and 2) C-GFP::HA::CENPC/HA::CENPA::N-GFP. Since the two sets of experiments produced very similar results we will describe in detail only the data obtained coexpressing N-GFP::HA::CENPC and HA::CENPA::C-GFP chimeric derivatives. HEK-293 cells where transiently transfected to express the two chimeric proteins either together or individually as negative controls. After 24 hours cells have been immunolabelled with a mouse-monoclonal anti-HA antibody to monitor the chimeric proteins subcellular localization and with polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit to visualize, in interphase cells, an endogenously expressed centromeric protein used as centromere marker (anti-CENP-B in double transfection experiment; anti-CENP-A in N-GFP::HA::CENPC single transfection; anti-CENP-C in HA::CENPA::C-GFP single transfection). To monitor the green GFP emission due to fluorescence complementation, the described primary antibodies were revealed with secondary antibodies conjugated with the Cy5 and Cy3 fluorochromes whose fluorescence emission is respectively in the far-red and red wavelength range. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g008">figure 8</xref> we could observe a punctate pattern due to bright green fluorescence only in cells that coexpress the CENP-C and the CENP-A derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g008">figure 8AI</xref>) but not in cells that express either one or the other chimeric protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g008">figure 8BI</xref>). This result indicates that fluorescence complementation can arise only when both N-GFP::HA::CENPC and HA::CENPA::C-GFP proteins are present in the same cell confirming our previous results that support a CENP-C/CENP-A direct interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g006">Figures 6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g007">7</xref>). Moreover we assessed that the two proteins interact at centromeres observing that the GFP punctate pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g008">Figures 8AI</xref>) and the centromere marker position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g008">Figures 8AII, 8AV</xref>) colocalize as revealed by merged patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g008">Figures 8AII</xref>): in detail 65,9&#x00025; of the green dots colocalize with the centromere marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005832-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). To check if the CENP-C Mif2p homology domain III is indeed required for the CENP-C/CENP-A interaction at centromeres, we have built a plasmid to express a N-GFP::HA::CENPC derivative that lacks aa 890/943 (N-GFP::HA::CENPC&#x00394;890/943). Following the above described procedure we have performed a BiFC assay coexpressing N-GFP::HA::CENPC&#x00394;890/943 and HA::CENPA::C-GFP.

Here, we have extended our previous results by further dissecting the C-terminal region of CENP-C and defining specific functions for the highly conserved Mif2p homology domains. Computational analysis of CENP-C protein sequences from different species reveals that the C-terminal Mif2p homology domains of CENP-C are strongly conserved during evolution; indeed, this region displays more than 80&#x00025; amino acid identity between human and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Talbert1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Brown1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Burkin1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation suggests that these domains must have been under negative selective pressure possibly to preserve an essential role for centromere function from yeast to mammals. Until now the specific role of the Mif2p homology domains of the C-terminal region have remained elusive. Our results show that the two regions display multiple and complex functions. First, ChIP experiments show that the Mif2p homology domain II is able to associate with the alpha satellite DNA and assign a specific function to this region. This result provides evidence for previous speculations, which proposed that this region might correspond to a putative DNA binding domain based on its specific amino acid content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Talbert1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and by the observations that the C-terminal region of CENP-C (aa 638&#x02013;943) could weakly bind DNA in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Yang1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. These data are also consistent with previous observations showing that mutations in the Mif2p homology domain II of yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and chicken can respectively, impair the proper structuring of the centromere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Brown1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Meluh1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, abolish centromere localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Heeger1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, and induce metaphase delay and chromosome mis-segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Fukagawa3">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. It should be mentioned that the CENP-C motif, at least for the yeast protein, has been described as containing acidic and proline-rich tracts typically found in the mammalian HMGI(Y) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Aravind1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Brown2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

This could be the case also for the Mif2p homology domain II considering that CENP-C, as well as CENP-A and PARP, was found to associate with active neocentromeres that apparently do not contain repetitive sequences, typical of conventional centromeres, suggesting that their localization to centromere may occur through epigenetic mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Choo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Depinet1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Sullivan3">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Second, our results indicate that the Mif2p homology domain III, corresponding to residues 890&#x02013;943, is required for CENP-C dimerization and/or oligomerization. This finding is consistent with what has been proposed by Sugimoto and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Sugimoto1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, and extends this previous study by showing that the Mif2p homology domain III is required to sustain dimer/oligomer formation in vivo. Unlike Sugimoto, we were unable to find evidences of oligomers formation with N-terminal or central CENP-C domains. As previously proposed for the centromere heterochromatin antigen CENP-B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Sugimoto2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, the DNA binding and self-associating activities of CENP-C could contribute to the packaging of kinetochore DNA into centromere chromatin. Notably, a very recently published paper supports our data showing that in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Mif2p protein the two domains corresponding to human CENP-C Mif2p homology domains II and III display DNA-binding activity and dimerization ability, respectively, and both of them are required for an efficient yeast growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Cohen1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Third, we show that the C-terminal region of CENP-C can physically interacts with CENP-A. This is an important result since it provides a mechanistic explanation for previous correlative studies showing that the centromere localization of CENP-C is strictly dependent on the presence of CENP-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Howman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Blower1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Ando1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Moore1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the dependence of CENP-C on CENP-A for targeting to centromere appears to be a general rule, one would expect that conserved domains could mediate the interaction between these proteins. Indeed, using both coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we show that the C-terminal region of CENP-C, containing the evolutionarily conserved Mif2p homology domains III, is required for the interaction with CENP-A at the centromere position. It is possible that other proteins may participate CENP-C loading to centromere; for example it has been shown that Mif2p homology domains can interact with CENP-B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that this interaction may represent the principal mechanism by which CENP-C is recruited to centromere considering that CENP-B gene inactivation does not affect kinetochore assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Hudson1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> and that CENP-B is absent from the Y chromosome centromere or in neocentromeres where CENP-C is instead correctly localized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Choo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Depinet1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Sullivan3">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another important finding reported here is the interaction between the Mif2p homology domain III on the C-terminal region of CENP-C and the histone H3 protein. This result, as well as the observation of a requirement of the same CENP-C domain for the association with CENP-A are supported by two papers published while this article was under revision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Erhardt1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Hori1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In these two papers the authors, using different approaches and different cell systems, strongly argue in favour of CENP-C being able to associate both with CENP-A and histone H3. In addition, another recent study suggests that a subset of heterotypic nucleosomes containing both histone H3 and CENP-A may exist in centromeric chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Foltz1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

On the basis of these observations it has been proposed that the CENP-A containing chromatin is organized along the exterior surface of each sister chromatid whereas interior surface is occupied by H3-containing nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Blower2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Sullivan4">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005832-Black1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>). Our findings extend this view and would allow us to speculate that CENP-C, by virtue of its ability to establish multiple contacts with DNA and centromere proteins, may serve to structure and/or stabilize the nucleosomal blocks of the interior and exterior surfaces of each sister chromatids.

To build N-GFP::HA::CENPC and C-GFP::HA::CENPC expression plasmids, the Enhanced-GFP N-terminal (N-GFP, aa 1/157) and the C-Terminal (C-GFP, aa 158/239) halves were generated by PCR using as template the pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech, GenBank Acc.: U57607) and subcloned into the HA-tagged CENP-C full length construct previously described. The HA-epitope has been left as flexible linker between the GFP derived fragment and CENP-C. The oligonucleotide sequences used as primers and the cloning procedures to generate the different expression plasmids are described below: i) full length N-GFP::HA::CENPC: NGFPCENPCH3F: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GGG<underline>AAGCTT</underline>ATGGTGAGCAAGGG-3&#x02032;</named-content> and NGFPCENPCH3R: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GGG<underline>AAGCTT</underline>CTTGTCGGCCATG-3&#x02032;</named-content>. The PCR products were digested with HindIII and cloned into pCDNA3.1/HA-CENPC after HindIII digestion at a HindIII target site placed 5&#x02032; with the respect to the HA epitope ATG codon and in frame with the N-terminal HA-tag. The correct orientation of the cloned N-GFP fragment has been evaluated by PCR assay using a CENP-C internal reverse primer. ii) full length C-GFP::HA::CENPC: CGFPCENPCF: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-ATGCAGAAGAACGGCATCAAG-3&#x02032;</named-content> and CGFPCENPCR: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TGTTATCTAGATCCGGTGGATCC-3&#x02032;</named-content>. PCR products were phosphorylated at the 5&#x02032;-OH terminals with T4 polynucleotide Kinase (New England Biolabs) following manufacturer instructions and blunt-end ligated in pCDN3.1/HA::CENPC::23/943 after digestion at the Hind III site placed 5&#x02032; to the HA coding sequence and after fill-in standard procedure to make blunt HindIII protruding terminals. The correct orientation of the C-GFP fragment was evaluated on the base of BamHI digestion in the C-GFP fragment and downstream of the HA epitope coding sequence. The N-GFP::HA::CENPC&#x00394;890/943 deletion mutant was generated by PCR starting from the described N-GFP::HA::CENPC full length construct using as primers the following oligonucleotides: NGFPCENPCPst1F: <named-content content-type="gene">GGG<underline>CTGCAG</underline>ACCATGGTGAGCAAGGG</named-content> and CENPC889ER1R: <named-content content-type="gene">CCG<underline>GAATTC</underline>TCATATATCCTGGCCAAC</named-content>. The PCR products were digested with PstI and EcoRI and directionally cloned into the pCDNA3.1 vector.</p><p>The HA::CENPA::N-GFP and HA::CENPA::C-GFP expression plasmids were generated as described below and notably creating an aqueous soluble and flexible 2XGly-Ser-Ser-Ser linker between the CENP-A C-terminal end and the GFP fragments N-terminal end by introducing the linker coding sequence in the oligonucleotides used as primers for the PCR reactions. HA-CENPA coding sequence has been amplified by PCR starting from the described HA-CENPA plasmid and using as primers the following oligonucleotides: CENPASAL1F: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AAA<underline>GTCGAC</underline>ATGGGCCCGCGCCGC-3&#x02032;</named-content> and CENPALNKSPH1R: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AT<underline>GCATGC</underline>GCTGCTGCTGCCGCCGAGTCCCTCCTC-3&#x02032;</named-content>. The PCR product was digested with SphI and SalI restriction enzymes. The N-GFP and C-GFP fragments were amplified by PCR using as template the pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech, GenBank Acc.: U57607) and as primers the following oligonucleotides: i) for N-GFP amplification NGFPLNKSPH1F: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AT<underline>GCATGC</underline>GGCAGCAGCAGCATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-3&#x02032;</named-content> and NGFPER1R: <named-content content-type="gene">T<underline>GAATTC</underline>TCACTTGTCGGCCATGATATAGACGTT</named-content>; the PCR product was digested with SphI and EcoRI restriction enzymes; ii) for C-GFP amplification CGFPLNKSPH1F: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AT<underline>GCATGC</underline>GGCAGCAGCAGCCAGAAGAACGGCATC-3&#x02032;</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CGFPMFE1R: CTCCTC<underline>CAATTG</underline>CTCCTCTCAGTTATCTAGATCCGG-3&#x02032;</named-content>. The PCR product was digested with SphI and MfeI restriction enzymes. The MfeI restriction enzyme leaves protruding ends compatible with EcoRI terminal ends. The pairs of PCR products identified by the forward and reverse primer combinations listed below where added in the same ligation reaction and directionally cloned into pCDNA3.1 after digestion with EcoR1 and SalI restriction enzymes: i) CENPASAL1F/CENPALNKSPH1R and NGFPLNKSPH1F/NGFPER1R to build the HA::CENPA::N-GFP expression plasmid; the correct cloning was verified by HindIII and EcorI digestion at internal and MCS restriction sites; ii) CENPASAL1F/CENPALNKSPH1R and CGFPLNKSPH1F/CGFPMFE1R to build the HA::CENPA::C-GFP expression plasmid; the correct cloning was verified by HindIII digestion at internal restriction sites. All the above described plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and the molecular weight of the fusion proteins produced after transfection in cells has been checked by standard SDS-PAGE/Western-Blot procedure as described below using both anti-HA and anti-CENP-C or anti-CENP-A antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Antibodies Production</title><p>Anti CENP-A antibodies: the DNA sequence encoding amino acids 1&#x02013;40 of human CENP-A was cloned into pGEX2T vector and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 cells.

The centromere localization of the HA::CENP-C fusion proteins and the BiFC assay analyses have been performed using a conventional epifluorescence microscope (Axioskop, Zeiss) equipped with a digital CCD camera (Axiocam, Zeiss) used for image capturing. For each HA::CENPC deletion mutant at least 100 transfected nuclei were scored for colocalization of HA and CENP-B signals. For the BiFC assay cells images were captured registering in grey-scale the emission signal in 4 different wavelength ranges: green from complementing GFP, far-red from anti-centromeric marker labelling, red from anti-HA labelling; ultraviolet from DNA. Image coloring and collages were made using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator (Adobe System, Inc).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Coimmunoprecipitation assay</title><p>HEK-293T cells (2&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>) were cotransfected with 10 &#x000b5;g of the two different HA/FLAG::CENP-C construct plasmids in equal ratio by means of the lipofectamine method (Roche).
