Furthermore, <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-negative cells are found in chains of <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-positive spermatogonia, suggesting that cells in the A<sub>al </sub>spermatogonia could revert to a more primitive state.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Spermatogenesis is a productive self-renewing system of adult stem cells that continuously generates spermatozoa through life. At the foundation of this system is the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In mouse testis, isolated A (single) spermatogonia (A<sub>s</sub>) are believed to be the most primitive cells and contain the stem cells. In normal situations, while half of A<sub>s </sub>cells divide and give rise to A<sub>pr </sub>(paired) spermatogonia that are interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges due to incomplete cytokinesis, the remaining half of A<sub>s </sub>cells undergo self-renewal divisions. The A<sub>pr </sub>spermatogonia further divide to become chains of 4, 8, 16, or 32 A<sub>al </sub>(aligned) spermatogonia. The A<sub>s</sub>, A<sub>pr</sub>, and A<sub>al </sub>spermatogonia can only be identified by their topographical configurations on the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules and are collectively referred to as "undifferentiated" spermatogonia, although this nomenclature causes confusion because this population contain both progenitor cells that undergo differentiation and stem cells that are truly undifferentiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The A<sub>al </sub>spermatogonia differentiate into A1 spermatogonia, which undergo six cell divisions before entering meiosis via A2, A3, A4, Intermediate, and B spermatogonia. The transition from A<sub>al </sub>(undifferentiated) to A1 (differentiating) is a sensitive step during spermatogonial development, as it can be disrupted by several conditions such as cryptorchidism and Vitamin A deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Spermatogonial transplantation along with other studies have demonstrated that SSCs are a subpopulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia, most likely A<sub>s </sub>cells, but not differentiating spermatogonia (A1 to B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Subdivision of the undifferentiated spermatogonia using cytological markers would greatly facilitate characterization of this unique cell population, but so far has not been achieved.</p><p>We previously identified <italic>Lin28 </italic>(formerly called <italic>Tex17</italic>) as a gene differentially expressed in mouse spermatogonia by a cDNA subtraction screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. <italic>Lin28 </italic>is predominantly expressed in primitive type A spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. <italic>Lin28</italic>, encoding an evolutionarily conserved small RNA-binding protein, was first identified as a key regulator of developmental timing in <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Lin28 </italic>is expressed in early larval stage but is rapidly suppressed during embryogenesis and in adult animals by the lin-4 microRNA and the Lin-14 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, LIN28 was used together with OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG to reprogram human somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In mice, <italic>Lin28 </italic>is expressed in diverse embryonic tissues, embryonic stem cells, and embryonic carcinoma cells, but not in most adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Collectively, these studies have demonstrated that the expression of <italic>Lin28 </italic>is associated with pluripotency.</p><p>In this report, we find that <italic>Lin28 </italic>is specifically expressed in the undifferentiated spermatogonia (A<sub>s </sub>to A<sub>al</sub>) of adult mouse testis.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis using enriched germ cell populations showed that the expression of <italic>Lin28 </italic>in testis is restricted to spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Western blot analysis of a panel of adult mouse tissues revealed that the LIN28 protein is abundantly expressed in testis but not in other tissues examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The testis of XX<sup>Y* </sup>male mice completely lack germ cells but contain somatic cells such as Sertoli and Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The absence of LIN28 in XX<sup>Y</sup>* testes demonstrated that LIN28 was germ cell-specific (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As controls, LIN28 protein was abundant in mouse embryonic stem cells but absent in fibroblast feeder cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We examined the relative protein level of LIN28 in juvenile testes. LIN28 was detectable in testes right after birth, increased its abundance with age, and was most abundant around puberty (day 12 &#x02013; 18) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of LIN28 in mouse testis</bold>.

LIN28 was expressed in gonocytes from postnatal day 1-old mice and in spermatogonia from day 6- and day 14-old mice. LIN28 was predominantly cytoplasmic with punctate nuclear staining. Immunostaining analysis of adult testis sections revealed that LIN28-expressing cells were sparsely located at the periphery of seminiferous tubules (close to the basement membrane), suggesting that LIN28 is expressed in a subset of spermatogonia but not in meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). We also found that the number of LIN28-positive spermatogonia per tubule varied among the stages of seminiferous tubules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The seminiferous epithelium of mice is divided into twelve stages, each of which is defined by a unique association of differentiating germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. For example, undifferentiated A<sub>al </sub>spermatogonia become differentiating A1 spermatogonia during stages VII-VIII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Our results showed that the number of LIN28-positive spermatogonia peaked at stage VIII but decreased sharply at stage IX, indicating that LIN28 might be expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Seminiferous epithelium stage-dependent distribution of LIN28-positive spermatogonia</bold>.

Chromatin was stained with DAPI (blue) but was presented in black and white in the second row of panels to show nuclear morphology and the amount of heterochromatin.

In these studies, undifferentiated spermatogonia can be definitively identified as A<sub>s</sub>, A<sub>pr</sub>, or A<sub>al</sub>. The A<sub>pr </sub>and A<sub>al </sub>spermatogonia are connected by intercellular cytoplasmic bridges as a chain of 2<sup>n </sup>cells. We found that the expression of LIN28 was restricted to A<sub>s </sub>and the chained 2<sup>n </sup>cells (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 cells) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). A chain of 32-interconnected cells was very rare (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Chains with a non-2<sup>n </sup>number of LIN28-positive cells were also observed at a low frequency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). GFRA1 (GDNF receptor) is a marker of undifferentiated spermatogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As expected, LIN28 was expressed in GFRA1-positive spermatogonia (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).

Currently, there are no cytological markers that could distinguish SSCs from "non-stem" A<sub>s </sub>cells. To examine whether LIN28 is expressed in SSCs, we performed double immunostaining of cultured spermatogonia highly enriched for SSCs with anti-LIN28 and anti-PLZF or anti-GFRA1 antibodies.

However, siRNA treatment did not causes a change in the total number of cultured cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), suggesting that the remaining LIN28 protein might be sufficient for maintaining SSC or that LIN28 is dispensable for the survival of SSCs.</p><p>Several recent studies have demonstrated that LIN28 is a negative regulator of let-7 microRNA biogenesis in embryonic stem cells and other stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

Overall, ~40% of LIN28-positive A<sub>s </sub>spermatogonia were GFP-positive, supporting that the population of A<sub>s </sub>cells were not homogeneous.

In this study, we found that LIN28, a pluripotency factor, is specifically expressed in the undifferentiated (A<sub>s </sub>to A<sub>al</sub>) spermatogonia, suggesting that it might play a role in maintaining the undifferentiated state in spermatogonia. <italic>Lin28 </italic>is expressed in mouse and human embryonic stem cells, embryonic carcinoma cells, neural stem cells, and diverse embryonic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Recently, LIN28, together with OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, was used to reprogram human fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In mammalian cultured cells, the expression of LIN28 appears to be associated with "stemness" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Very recent studies have discovered a feedback loop, in which LIN28 blocks the maturation of the let-7 microRNAs and <italic>Lin28 </italic>is downregulated by let-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Specifically, LIN28 prevents the processing of let-7 precursor microRNAs by Dicer through mediating the terminal uridylation of let-7 precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Notably, LIN28 is not essential for reprogramming human fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells but does increase the reprogramming efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The siRNA knockdown experiments suggested that LIN28 might not be essential for self-renewal of human ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We tested the role of LIN28 in the maintenance of SSCs by siRNA knockdown. The siRNA treatment did not cause a change in the total number of cells in culture, suggesting that LIN28 might be dispensable for maintenance of SSC or that the remaining LIN28 protein after knockdown might be sufficient for its full function. However, consistent with the known function of LIN28 in blockade of let-7 miRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we found that siRNA knockdown of LIN28 in cultured SSCs caused an increased level of mature let-7g miRNA. In a recent study of five genes (<italic>Bcl6b</italic>, <italic>Etv5</italic>, <italic>Bhlhe40</italic>, <italic>Hoxc4</italic>, and <italic>Tec</italic>) involved in the SSC self renewal, siRNA treatment caused a decrease in the number of SSC stem cells as determined by transplantation without changing the total number of cells in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, the possible involvement of LIN28 in SSC self-renewal remains to be determined by siRNA treatment followed by transplantation in future studies.</p><p><italic>Ngn3 </italic>is also specifically expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Pulse-chase labeling studies using <italic>Ngn3</italic>/Cre&#x02122; CAG-CAT-Z transgenic (driven by 6.7 kb <italic>Ngn3 </italic>upstream sequence) mice identified two compartments of spermatogonial stem cells: the actual stem cells and the potential stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In a normal situation, the actual stem cells undergo self-renewal and give rise to transit cells that further divide to become terminally differentiated cells. The transit cells, immediate progeny of actual stem cells, are potential stem cells, in a sense that they can function as stem cells in the case of loss of actual stem cells or when transplanted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Nakagawa et al showed that <italic>Ngn3</italic>-Cre-mediated pulse-labeled spermatogonia contributed to only 0.3% of actual stem cells and to 11.7% of potential stem cells. However, it is difficult to image that such low percentages of contribution to stem cells might be entirely due to the low efficiency of <italic>Ngn3</italic>/Cre-mediated recombination as previously discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>We have demonstrated that the population of undifferentiated spermatogonia is cytologically divided into two subpopulations: <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-negative and <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-positive. A<sub>s </sub>cells, the most primitive type of undifferentiated spermatogonia, are heterogeneous. More than 40% of LIN28-positive A<sub>s </sub>spermatogonia are <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-negative. The percentage of <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-positive clusters increases progressively with the chain length of interconnected undifferentiated spermatogonia (2-, 4-, 8-, 16-cell clusters), suggesting that <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-expressing spermatogonia are more committed to differentiation (with low stem cell activity), while <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-negative ones are more primitive (with high stem cell activity). We hypothesize that the low contribution of <italic>Ngn3</italic>-Cre-mediated pulse-labeled cells to stem cells found in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] is more likely attributed to the previously unknown population of <italic>Ngn3</italic>-negative undifferentiated spermatogonia. Therefore, our current studies together with the pulse-chase labeling experiments done by Nakagawa et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] show that the <italic>Ngn3</italic>-positive cells contain few (0.3%) actual stem cells and some potential stem cells (11.7%). By inference, these studies suggest that the <italic>Ngn3</italic>-negative undifferentiated spermatogonia might contain &#x0003e;99% of the actual stem cells and nearly 90% of potential stem cells.</p><p>According to the A<sub>s </sub>model, A<sub>s </sub>(single) spermatogonia and a few A<sub>pr </sub>(false pairs) can act as stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In this model, the A<sub>s </sub>spermatogonium divides either to produce two new stem cells if separate or to become A<sub>pr </sub>if two daughter cells remain connected by an intercellular bridge. However, it remains unknown whether A<sub>pr </sub>and A<sub>al </sub>spermatogonia in mouse could potentially act as stem cells. In <italic>Drosophila </italic>testis and ovary, transit-amplifying germ cells can dedifferentiate and revert into functional stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Recently, c-kit-positive (differentiating) spermatogonia were shown to be able to revert to functional stem cells when transplanted into testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Studies of CDH1-expressing spermatogonia showed heterogeneous expression of <italic>c-Kit </italic>and <italic>Tacstd1 </italic>among undifferentiated spermatogonia, lending support for de-differentiation in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In the current study of mouse testis, we have observed that, in the same chain of A<sub>al </sub>spermatogonia, one or two cells are <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-negative, while the remaining cells are <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-positive, suggesting that <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-negative cells in the A<sub>al </sub>spermatogonia might have reverted to a more primitive state.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that LIN28, a pluripotency factor, is specifically expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia in mice, suggesting that it might play a role in maintenance of the undifferentiated state of this primitive germ cell population. We have also found that the undifferentiated spermatogonia exist as two subpopulations: <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-negative (high stem cell potential) and <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP-positive (high differentiation commitment). In addition, our study provides cytological evidence supporting dedifferentiation of spermatogonia in mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Mouse tissues were homogenized using a glass homogenizer in the extraction buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol). Protein lysate (20 &#x003bc;g) was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and electro-blotted onto PVDF membranes. Western blotting was performed using the following antibodies: goat anti-LIN28 antibody (1:100, Cat# AF3757, R&#x00026;D Systems) and anti-&#x003b2;-actin monoclonal antibody (1:2,500, Cat# A5441, Sigma-Aldrich).

Testes were embedded with Neg 50 tissue freezing solution (Cat# 6502, Thermo Scientific) and frozen in dry ice/ethanol. Sections (8 &#x003bc;m) were cut using a Reichert-Jung cryo-microtome and then post-fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 10 minutes prior to immunostaining.</p><p>For whole-mount analysis, seminiferous tubules from adult (2-month-old) C57BL/6J mice were prepared as previously described with modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Briefly, testis tubules were washed once with PBS, fixed in 5 ml 4% PFA for 3 hours, and incubated sequentially with 5 ml of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% TBST (1&#x000d7;TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) at 4&#x000b0;C each for 30 minutes. Testis tubules were frozen in 1&#x000d7;TBS at -20&#x000b0;C. Immunostaining of testis sections, whole mounts of seminiferous tubules, or SSCs was performed with the following primary antibodies: goat anti-LIN28 (1:100), guinea pig anti-ACRV1 (1:500, gift from PP Reddi) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], rabbit anti-GFP (1:500, Cat# Ab6556, Abcam), anti-PLZF (1:200, Cat# OP128L, Calbiochem), and anti-GFRA1 (1:20, Cat# sc-10716, Santa Cruz Biotech). Texas red or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (Vector Laboratories). Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI provided in mounting medium. Samples were visualized under a Zeiss Axioskop 40 fluorescence microscope. Images were captured with an Evolution QEi digital camera (MediaCybernetics) and processed with the Image-Pro software (Phase 3 Imaging Systems).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP and XX<sup>Y* </sup>mice</title><p>The derivation of <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP mice has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Adult (2-month-old) <italic>Ngn3</italic>-GFP heterozygous mice on a mixed (129/C57BL/6) genetic background were used, because homozygous (<italic>Ngn3</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice die by postnatal day 3.

Briefly, single-cell suspensions were prepared from eight testes from post-natal day 6~8 C57BL/6 pups by digestion with Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%, Invitrogen) and DNase I (7 mg/ml, Sigma). Cell suspensions were layered on top of a 30% Percoll solution and were centrifuged to enrich germ cells. After resuspension, SSCs were isolated by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) using Thy1.2 antibody-conjugated microbeads (Cat#130-049-101, Miltenyi Biotec). Thy1<sup>+ </sup>cells were seeded at a density of 0.5 &#x02013; 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per well on 12-well culture plates with mitomycin C-treated STO feeders. Self-renewing SSCs were cultured in a chemically defined serum-free MEM&#x003b1; medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.2% BSA, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml Transferrin, 7.6 &#x003bc;eq/L free fatty acids, 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-8 </sup>M Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>, 50 &#x003bc;M &#x003b2;-ME, 5 &#x003bc;g/ml Insulin, 60 &#x003bc;M Putrescine, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10 mM HEPES), 20 ng/ml GDNF (R&#x00026;D Systems), 150 ng/ml soluble GFR&#x003b1;1 (R&#x00026;D Systems), and 1 ng/ml bFGF (BD Biosciences). The medium was changed every 2&#x02013;3 days. All cultures were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. Cells were passaged at 7-day intervals at 1:2&#x02013;3 dilution.</p><p>Mouse <italic>Lin28 </italic>siRNAs (On-target plus Smartpool, Cat# L-050153, Thermo Scientific Dharmacon) was used. Silence<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>siRNA served as a negative control (Cat# AM4611, Ambion). After trypsin digestion and washing, SSCs were plated into wells of a 12-well dish without feeders in the antibiotic-free culture medium at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well. Cells were allowed to settle for 2&#x02013;3 hours prior to siRNA treatment. For each well, 75 pmol of siRNA and 2 &#x003bc;l of LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) were mixed with 200 &#x003bc;l of OptiMEM (Invitrogen). After the 30-hour incubation, total RNA and proteins were prepared for qPCR and western blotting. Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed using SYBR green on an ABI 7300 sequence detection system with the following <italic>Lin28 </italic>primers: AGACCAACCATTTGGAGTGC and AATCGAAACCCGTGAGACAC. Level of mature let-7g miRNA was measured by using specific TaqMan probes per the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Quantification of <italic>Lin28 </italic>and mature let-7g transcript levels was normalized to <italic>Rps2 </italic>(ribosomal protein S2) within the log phase of the amplification curve. For SSC count, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well after 30-hour siRNA treatment were plated onto fresh feeders, cultured in a defined serum-free media with 20 ng/ml GDNF, 150 ng/ml GFR&#x003b1;1 and 1 ng/ml bFGF for 7 days. Each experiment was performed on three independent SSC lines.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KZ and XW performed experiments. XW and KHK contributed material.
