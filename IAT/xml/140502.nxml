Here we report on the cloning of a new human Mcm gene (hMcm8) and on characterisation of its protein product. The hMcm8 gene contains the central Mcm domain conserved in the Mcm2&#x02013;7 gene family, and is expressed in a range of cell lines and human tissues. hMcm8 mRNA accumulates during G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S phase, while hMcm8 protein is detectable throughout the cell cycle.

In the nucleus, the hMcm8 structure-bound fraction is detectable in S, but not in G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M, phase, as for hMcm3. However, unlike hMcm3, the hMcm8 structure-bound fraction is not detectable in G<sub>1</sub> phase. Overall, our data identify a new Mcm protein, which does not form part of the Mcm2&#x02013;7 complex and which is only structure-bound during S phase, thus suggesting its specific role in DNA replication.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x8c32bc8.0x9932868" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no.

This requires that DNA replication takes place once and only once per cell cyle in the S phase and that a given DNA fragment is not amplified more than once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c1">1</xref>).</p><p>The strategy of eukaryotic cells to restrict DNA replication to one round per cell cycle can be viewed as a concerted effort to regulate the many activities of the Mcm complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c2">2</xref>). The key to this strategy is the periodic recruitment and discharge of the Mcm complex at replication origins, and the temporal separation of pre-replication complex assembly from initiation of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c3">3</xref>). In fact, the current view of replication initiation is that the origins are licensed for firing during G<sub>1</sub>, but are only activated under cellular conditions that preclude their relicensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c4">4</xref>).</p><p>A series of limiting steps has been described, which renders chromatin competent for replication (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c5">5</xref>). Formation of the pre-replication complex during the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle results from the sequential loading of: (i) six origin recognition complex (ORC) proteins, which act as a replication &#x02018;landing pad&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c8">8</xref>); (ii) CDC6p and Cdt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c10">10</xref>), which interact with the ORC and are required for loading of minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins; (iii) Mcm proteins on specific DNA regions called &#x02018;origins of replication&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c12">12</xref>). Recruitement of the Mcm complex is restricted to the period of time between the exit from mitosis and the initiation of DNA synthesis. It occurs indiscriminately to all replication origins, potentially licensing them for replication, although not all licensed origins are activated at the same time. In fact, the initiation of DNA synthesis appears to be controlled locally, the earliest events taking place at the G<sub>1</sub> to S phase transition and later events occurring throughout the S phase.</p><p>All six Mcm proteins contain a central region of approximately 200 amino acids of extensive similarity. One element similar to the A motif of the Walker-type NTP-binding sequence and the Mcm signature motif IDEFDKM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c13">13</xref>) are found in this region. In addition, an N-terminal zinc finger-type motif CX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>18&#x0002f;19</sub>CX<sub>2&#x0002f;4</sub>C is present in four of the Mcm proteins (Mcm2, Mcm4, Mcm6 and Mcm7). Homologies in the N- and C-terminals are interspersed. The overall identity between the different Mcm proteins reaches &#x0223c;30&#x00025; and the similarity &#x0223c;50&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c11">11</xref>). The divergency between the primary structure of the Mcm proteins highlights the specialised functions of each member of the Mcm family. Indeed, inactivation or loss of a member inhibits DNA replication, both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c16">16</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c19">19</xref>).</p><p>Cell extracts contain subcomplexes of Mcm proteins, the Mcm3&#x0002f;5 dimer and the Mcm2&#x0002f;4&#x0002f;6&#x0002f;7 tetramer. Subcomplex Mcm4&#x0002f;6&#x0002f;7, but not the six-membered Mcm complex, has exhibited limited helicase activity, only unwinding very short duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c21">21</xref>). However, further support for the hypothesis of Mcm helicase function was provided by the finding that the archeal hexameric Mcm complex behaves like a processive DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c24">24</xref>) and, more recently, by the demonstration that the processive DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4&#x0002f;6&#x0002f;7 complex requires forked DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c25">25</xref>). Mcm proteins have been reported to be involved in transcriptional control through their interaction with RNA II polymerase holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c26">26</xref>), and to activate transcription through interaction with the transcription activating domain of STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c27">27</xref>). Furthermore, recent evidence has highlighted the role of the Mcm complex in the elongation phase of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c17">17</xref>).</p><p>To date, all human Mcm genes have been cloned as the human counterparts of yeast Mcm genes. In a screening program aimed at isolating cancer-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c28">28</xref>), we have analysed the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA integration sites in the cellular DNA extracted from human hepatocellular carcinomas. In one tumor, the HBV genome was found to be integrated into a cellular sequence identical to part of a Mcm gene-like sequence on chromosome 20p12.3&#x02013;13. We show here that the protein encoded by this gene is a new member of the Mcm2&#x0002f;7 protein family which, although it has a central conserved Mcm domain, does not participate in the Mcm3&#x0002f;5 and Mcm2&#x0002f;4&#x0002f;6&#x0002f;7 subcomplexes and only binds to chromatin in the S phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning of a new human Mcm cDNA</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from human normal liver using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Gibco BRL, Bethesda, MD).

This antibody was then characterised by subcloning the hMcm8 cDNA sequence into a prokaryotic and a eukaryotic expression vector. The anti-hMcm8 antibody recognised the recombinant hMcm8 protein produced in bacteria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f2">2</xref>A) or overexpressed as a myc-tagged protein in the CCL13 cell line (data not shown).</p><p>To rule out any cross-reaction between the anti-hMcm8 antibody and human Mcm2&#x02013;7 proteins, we performed a western blot analysis using HeLa total cell extract, and then hybridised the stripes corresponding to parallel wells using anti-hMcm8 antibody or antibodies against other known Mcm proteins. The anti-hMcm8 antibody detected a single 95 kDa band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f2">2</xref>C), and no other band corresponding to the size of the other hMcm was detected after longer exposures (data not shown). The hMcm of a most similar size was hMcm4, with a molecular weight of 97 kDa; however, the hMcm4 band appeared as a double band corresponding to the differentially phosphorylated forms of hMcm4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c32">32</xref>), and the unique size of hMcm8 was slightly smaller than the lower band of hMcm4. Furthermore, the adsorption of anti-hMcm8 antibody with the 16 amino acid synthetic peptide (used to raise the antibody) abolished detection of both the recombinant and endogenous hMcm8 proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f2">2</xref>B). We therefore concluded that the polyclonal anti-hMcm8 antibody specifically recognises the hMcm8 protein.</p><p>Using this antibody, we detected a unique, endogenous 95 kDa band in fibroblasts (Hs27) and tumor-derived human cell lines (HeLa, HEK-293 and Huh7) as well as in normal human liver and skeletal muscle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f2">2</xref>D), which could be abolished by the adsorption test (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the accumulation of hMcm8 protein was higher in a proliferative, liver-derived, tumor cell line (HuH7) than in the corresponding non-proliferative tissue (normal liver).</p></sec><sec><title>hMcm8 mRNA is expressed during late G<sub>1</sub> to S phase</title><p>Cells from the human fibroblast cell line Hs27 were density arrested in G<sub>0</sub>, trypsinised when no mitosis was apparent and then released by re-seeding cells at a lower density. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that 93&#x00025; of the cells were arrested in G<sub>0</sub>. Under these conditions, 35&#x00025; of cells entered the S phase 24 h after release and 28&#x00025; reached the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phase 32 h later (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f3">3</xref>A). The mRNA of both hMcm4, used as a control, and hMcm8 were absent in cells analysed 0, 6 and 12 h after release (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f3">3</xref>A and B). hMcm8 and hMcm4 mRNA accumulation were first observed 18 h after release and continued to increase during the S and G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f3">3</xref>B). Since it is known that hMcm4 accumulation occurs in G<sub>1</sub> (and not in G<sub>0</sub>) and since the accumulation patterns of hMcm8 and hMcm4 were identical, we conclude that, like for hMcm4, hMcm8 mRNA accumulation begins in G<sub>1</sub> and continues into the S and G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phases of the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f3">3</xref>B). This result also indicates that, in our experimental conditions, synchronised Hs27 cells are in G<sub>0</sub> phase at 0, 6 and 12 h after release, and in G<sub>1</sub> phase 18 h after release.</p></sec><sec><title>hMcm8 protein levels remain stable during the cell cycle</title><p>We then evaluated the level of hMcm8 protein during the cell cycle. All known mammalian Mcm proteins exhibit only minor variations in their protein levels during the cell cycle. This is probably because of their stability and low turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c34">34</xref>), the exception being the hMcm6 protein, the level of which rises dramatically during G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c35">35</xref>).</p><p>Using western blots, we analysed the total protein extracts of the same synchronised Hs27 cells used for northern blot analysis, and re-hybridised the same western blot using anti-tubulin antibody as a reference for protein loading (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f3">3</xref>D). hMcm8 protein expression is very low in G<sub>0</sub> phase (0 and 12 h after release) while its level increases as cells enter G<sub>1</sub> and remains stable during the S and G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phases.</p></sec><sec><title>hMcm8 is a nuclear protein</title><p>Mammalian Mcm2&#x02013;7 proteins are nuclear throughout the cell cycle. However, only Mcm2 and Mcm3 proteins contain a NLS. In fact, the murine homologues of Mcm4&#x02013;Mcm7 are mainly cytoplasmic when overexpressed in COS cells, while their co-expression with Mcm2 or Mcm3 leads to a shift in their localisation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c36">36</xref>). Furthermore, the association of Mcm proteins in a hexameric complex is a prerequisite for their nuclear localisation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c37">37</xref>). It is thus plausible that the Mcm2 and Mcm3 NLS is involved in translocating the complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.</p><p>The subcellular localisation of hMcm8 was determined by laser confocal microscopy. Non-transfected Hs27 or HeLa cells were stained by immunofluorescence (FITC) with the anti-hMcm8 antibody. The nuclei were counterstained with 7-AAD. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f4">4</xref>, the anti-hMcm8 signal was mainly nuclear, while no specific staining was observed using the preimmune serum (negative control). The absence of a NLS in the hMcm8 protein sequence suggests that this protein could be carried to the nucleus as a result of its interaction with other nuclear proteins. The variable pattern of hMcm8 punctate nuclear staining could be related to differences in the expression level of hMcm8 and&#x0002f;or to changes in the proportion of structure-bound versus nucleosolic hMCM8 in different phases of the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>hMcm8 protein has a structure-bound and a nucleosolic fraction</title><p>It has been shown that Mcm proteins comprise two nuclear fractions, a nucleosolic soluble fraction, which is released by permeabilising the nuclei with non-ionic detergents, and a chromatin-bound fraction which can be extracted by increasing the salt concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c38">38</xref>). In order to determine whether this is also the case for hMcm8, HeLa cells in the exponential phase of growth were treated with a hypotonic buffer containing Triton X-100. After centrifugation, we obtained the soluble hMcm8 nucleosolic fraction in the supernatant and the structure-bound fraction in the pellet. As indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f5">5</xref>A, a fraction of total hMcm8 is structure-bound. Subsequent extractions of this fraction using a buffer containing increasing salt concentrations dissociated hMcm8 from the chromatin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f5">5</xref>A, NaCl). Therefore, hMcm8 localises to the nucleus, where it exists as soluble, nucleosolic and structure-bound protein.</p></sec><sec><title>hMcm8 protein is structure-bound in the S phase, after the establishment of DNA replication forks</title><p>Chromatin binding of Mcm2&#x02013;Mcm7 proteins is tightly regulated during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c1">1</xref>). In order to analyse the behaviour of hMcm8 during the cell cycle, HeLa cells were synchronised with nocodazole and then released to enter the cell cycle. At 0, 5, 10 and 20 h after release, cells were harvested and equal amounts of nucleosolic and structure-bound fractions were blotted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f5">5</xref>B). The relative proportions of nucleosolic and structure-bound hMcm3 and hMcm8 protein were assessed by image analysis of specific bands obtained by western blot. The majority of hMcm3 protein was nucleosolic in cells arrested in the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phase by nocodazole. An increasing fraction of hMcm3 protein was structure-bound starting from G<sub>1</sub> phase (29&#x00025; of total protein), reaching 52&#x00025; at S phase. The hMcm8 protein was also nucleosolic in nocodazole-arrested cells. However, unlike hMcm3, the structure-bound fraction of hMcm8 in G<sub>1</sub> phase was barely detectable (0.2&#x00025;). A fraction (11&#x00025;) of hMcm8 protein started to be structure-bound in S phase, then reaching 32&#x00025; of the total protein. In order to consider this point in greater depth, we repeated the same experiment using HeLa cells treated with 0.5 mM mimosine for 25 h or with aphidicoline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f5">5</xref>C). Under these conditions, mimosine blocks the cells in the late G<sub>1</sub> phase (thus before the establishment of active replication forks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c39">39</xref>). Aphidicoline is an inhibitor of DNA polymerase &#x003b1; and it suppresses the migration of the replication fork, but it does not prevent the initiation of replication. Therefore, aphidicoline causes a cell cycle arrest in the beginning of the S phase. In mimosine-arrested cells, an important fraction (20&#x00025;) of hMcm3 is structure-bound. Strikingly, all the hMcm8 protein is nucleosolic in these cells, indicating that, unlike other Mcm proteins, hMcm8 is not structure-bound in cells arrested in late G<sub>1</sub> phase. In cells arrested at the beginning of S phase with aphidicoline, 29&#x00025; of hMcm3 protein is structure-bound, while only a small fraction (9&#x00025;) of hMcm8 protein is structure-bound. These data are consistent with the view that, at variance with the other members of the Mcm protein family, hMcm8 is structure-bound in the early S phase after the establishment of replication forks, and not in G<sub>1</sub> phase.</p></sec><sec><title>hMcm8 protein does not co-immunoprecipitate with the Mcm2&#x02013;7 complex</title><p>Mcm2&#x02013;7 proteins are found as a heterohexameric complex in HeLa cells. In addition to the Mcm2&#x02013;7 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c31">31</xref>), Mcm2&#x0002f;4&#x0002f;6&#x0002f;7, Mcm4&#x0002f;6&#x0002f;7 and Mcm3&#x0002f;5 subcomplexes have also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c40">40</xref>). To investigate whether hMcm8 can associate with one of these Mcm subcomplexes, we performed immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses using exponentially growing, asynchronous HeLa cell extracts and polyclonal antibodies specific to hMcm3 or hMcm4. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f6">6</xref>A, anti-hMcm3 antibody immunoprecipitated both hMcm3 and hMcm5, but not hMcm8. Using the anti-hMcm4 antibody, we were able to immunoprecipite hMcm4, hMcm6 and hMcm2, but not hMcm8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f6">6</xref>B). Although we do not rule out any possible interaction between hMcm8 and other Mcm proteins, hMcm8 does not seem to be involved in the Mcm2&#x02013;7 complex.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our understanding of the mechanisms involved in eukaryotic replication origins has been greatly improved in the last few years and several key proteins have been identified. These studies have revealed a sophisticated programme determining that initiation occurs only once at every cell division and fixing the time at which individual origins fire during the S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c5">5</xref>). However, this finely tuned process has not yet been completely elucidated, and the identification of new players may throw further light on its complexity.</p><p>Mcm genes were first discovered in budding and fission yeast as genes required to enable progression through the cell division cycle or to maintain minichromosomes containing autonomously replicating sequences (ARS). Characterisation of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genes Mcm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c41">41</xref>), Mcm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c42">42</xref>) and Cdc46&#x0002f;Mcm5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c44">44</xref>) suggested their involvement in DNA replication. The protein family grew rapidly with cloning of the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> genes cdc21&#x0002f;Mcm4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c45">45</xref>) and mis5&#x0002f;Mcm6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c46">46</xref>) and of the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Cdc47&#x0002f;Mcm7 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c47">47</xref>). The evolutionarily preserved homologues of the six yeast Mcm proteins were rapidly characterized in fruit fly, frog, mouse and humans. No other homologues of these genes have been identified in the complete genome of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. Therefore, since the replication initiation mechanisms seem to be highly conserved from yeast to humans, it has been hypothesised that the six members of the Mcm family did not diversify any further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c11">11</xref>).</p><p>In contrast with this view, we describe here a new member of the human Mcm protein family, hMcm8. It contains the typical domains and functional motifs of the Mcm2&#x02013;7 protein family. hMcm8 mRNA accumulates during the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S&#x02013;G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phase, while its protein product is detectable throughout the normal cell cycle. Its nuclear localisation and association with chromatin in a cell cycle-regulated manner suggest its role in DNA replication. Database searches have revealed that the Mcm8 protein is evolutionarily conserved, thus allowing the prediction of its potentially relevant biological function. However, the precise role of hMcm8 remains unknown. Our results show that hMcm8 does not participate in the Mcm3&#x02013;5 and Mcm2&#x0002f;4&#x0002f;6&#x0002f;7 subcomplexes, and that its binding to chromatin is restricted to the S phase. The nuclear localisation of hMcm8 protein in the absence of a NLS suggests that hMcm8 may have a nuclear protein partner(s) which could cause its translocation to the nucleus. However, the data we obtained in HeLa cells show that this partner is not a known member of the Mcm family. At present, we can only speculate as to the biological function of Mcm8. It may be involved in conformational changes to the Mcm complex during the S phase and&#x0002f;or in the melting of origin DNA. Mcm proteins have also been shown to be involved in transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c26">26</xref>) and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c27">27</xref>). Furthermore, the role of the Mcm complex in the elongation phase of DNA replication has recently been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c17">17</xref>). hMcm8 may participate in one or several of these activities, and further study is required to explore its function.</p><p>It has recently been shown that the down-regulation of Mcm proteins is a common downstream mechanism causing a loss of proliferative capacity in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c48">48</xref>). In fact, a loss of replication licensing coincides with the commitment of precursor cells to a specific lineage of differentiation or with cell quiescence. Mcm proteins have been proposed as new biomarkers capable of detecting G<sub>1</sub> cells &#x02018;with growth potential&#x02019;. These properties of Mcm proteins highlight their potential usefulness in cancer biology as tumor markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c50">50</xref>), and in studies focusing on stem cell differentiation. Our preliminary data show that hMcm8 expression is higher in a proliferative cell line than in the corresponding (liver) non-proliferative tissue. However, these results need to be extended to a wider range of tissues and completed by cell cycle analyses.</p><p>In this context, it is also noteworthy that we recently reported on an <italic>in vivo</italic> hMcm8 gene mutation occurring selectively in a tumorous tissue and not in adjacent, non-tumorous cells, suggesting that hMcm8 mutations may play a role in cell transformation (see the mutated hMcm8 protein expressed in the tumor in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg136f3">3</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg136c28">28</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have described a new member of the Mcm protein family, evolutionarily conserved, which, unlike the other known Mcm proteins, displays restriction of nuclear structure binding to the S phase and does not participate in the Mcm complex. Although further work is required to elucidate the biological function of this new gene, its mutation in clonally expanded human tumor cells suggests its potential impact on the control of cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_31_2_570__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_31_2_570__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg136f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Phylogenetic tree of Mcm protein sequences.
