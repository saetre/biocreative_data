Despite significant progress in defining both the viral and cellular determinants of HIV-1 assembly and release, the trafficking pathway used by Gag to reach its site of assembly in the infected cell remains to be elucidated. The Gag trafficking itinerary in primary monocyte-derived macrophages is especially poorly understood. To define the site of assembly and characterize the Gag trafficking pathway in this physiologically relevant cell type, we have made use of the biarsenical-tetracysteine system. A small tetracysteine tag was introduced near the C-terminus of the matrix domain of Gag. The insertion of the tag at this position did not interfere with Gag trafficking, virus assembly or release, particle infectivity, or the kinetics of virus replication. By using this <italic>in vivo</italic> detection system to visualize Gag trafficking in living macrophages, Gag was observed to accumulate both at the plasma membrane and in an apparently internal compartment that bears markers characteristic of late endosomes or multivesicular bodies. Significantly, the internal Gag rapidly translocated to the junction between the infected macrophages and uninfected T cells following macrophage/T-cell synapse formation. These data indicate that a population of Gag in infected macrophages remains sequestered internally and is presented to uninfected target cells at a virological synapse.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The viral Gag protein is both necessary and sufficient for the assembly of a new generation of virus particles. There has been a significant amount of debate in recent years regarding the site in the cell at which HIV-1 assembly takes place. Of particular interest has been the site of assembly in macrophages, a cell type that serves as an important target for HIV-1 infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, we examine the site of Gag localization and virus assembly in primary human macrophages in living cells by using biarsenical dyes that become fluorescent when they bind a small target sequence introduced into HIV-1 Gag. We observe Gag localization both at the plasma membrane and in an apparently internal compartment that bears markers characteristic of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Significantly, when infected macrophages are cocultured with uninfected T cells, the apparently internal Gag moves rapidly to the contact site, or synapse, between the macrophage and the T cell. These findings support the hypothesis that infected macrophages sequester assembled HIV-1 particles in an internal compartment and that these particles move to synapses where cell&#x02013;cell transmission can occur.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag polyprotein precursor, Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>, plays an essential role in virus assembly and release.

To this end, we developed a system for visualizing in living cells the localization and trafficking of Gag expressed in the context of a fully infectious and replication-competent HIV-1 molecular clone. We used the biarsenical-tetracysteine labeling method first described by Tsien and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Adams1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Gaietta1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Griffin1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. This system is based on the insertion of a small tetracysteine (TC) motif into a protein of interest. Cells expressing the TC-tagged protein are treated with a membrane-permeable biarsenical dye &#x0005b;e.g., green (FlAsH) or red (ReAsH)&#x0005d; that fluoresces upon binding to the TC tag. The advantages of this method are that the TC tag is very small and that labeling occurs immediately upon binding of the dye to the TC tag. Recently, this system was used to label Gag expressed from non-infectious clones in HeLa, Mel Juso and Jurkat T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Perlman1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Rudner1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We introduced the TC tag near the C-terminus of the MA domain of Gag in the context of the full-length infectious HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3. Insertion of the TC tag had no significant effect on HIV-1 Gag function. By using VSV-G-pseudotyped viruses, we were able to infect and follow Gag trafficking in primary MDMs. Our data indicate that in MDMs Gag accumulates both at the PM and in an apparently internal MVB-like compartment. Although we obtained no evidence for constitutive movement of the internal Gag to the PM, or for internalization of the PM-localized Gag to apparently internal structures, we observed rapid relocation of the internal population of Gag to the site of cell-cell contact following addition of susceptible T cells to the infected macrophage cultures. These findings support a model whereby newly assembled virus particles are sequestered in infected macrophages and then efficiently presented to susceptible target cells following synapse formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Introduction of a TC tag near the C-terminus of the MA domain of HIV-1 Gag does not disrupt virus replication, assembly and release, or Gag trafficking</title><p>The MA domain of HIV-1 Gag performs several important functions in virus assembly and release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Freed1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>; however, deletion of a number of C-terminal residues (amino acids 116-128) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Yu1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, or the insertion of a Myc or green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag near the C-terminus of MA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Muller1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> does not block virus assembly and release, suggesting that the C-terminus of MA is relatively insensitive to mutation.

In this particular time course, 40 min after adding Jurkat T cells to the MDMs (t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0 min), Gag has already accumulated at the contact site between M1 and T1. Gag-containing compartments are also rapidly recruited to the site of M1/T2 contact. Movement of other Gag-containing compartments toward the site of MDM-MDM (M1/M2) contact can be observed starting at time t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;25 min and is complete at t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;40 min. These data demonstrate that Gag present in internal compartments can be rapidly redistributed to the site of contact with uninfected cells. After its movement to the MDM/MDM synapse, Gag can be seen moving along the surface of macrophage M2 (e.g., at 45 and 50 min). A movie of Gag movement to the synapse can be viewed at <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000015.s010">Video S7</xref>. Intriguingly, we frequently observed an apparent preference for MDM/T-cell synapse formation at sites close to high levels of Gag concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000015-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>).

This resulted in the movement and attachment of the T-cell with the infected MDM near the site of Gag accumulation.</p><fig id="ppat-1000015-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000015.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Real-time trafficking of Gag to the synapse in infected MDMs.</title><p>(A) MDMs infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped NL4-3/MA-TC virus were labeled with FlAsH 48 hrs postinfection.

Although these studies provided important insights, disadvantages of using GFP and its derivatives in protein trafficking analyses include the large size of the fluorescent protein and the fact that achieving their fluorescent state requires time-dependent chromophore maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Nagai1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Remington1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. We have also observed that Gag expressed from some codon-optimized constructs assembles relatively inefficiently and forms perinuclear cytosolic aggregates not typically observed with WT Gag (unpublished results). In this study, we describe the application of the biarsenical labeling system to visualize HIV-1 Gag trafficking in primary MDMs. We show here that the TC tag that serves as the binding site for the biarsenical dye FlAsH is remarkably well tolerated with respect to preserving Gag function when introduced near the C-terminus of the MA domain. The MA-TC tagged Gag produces virus particles with WT efficiency, and these particles are fully infectious in both single-cycle assays and in spreading infections. The MA-TC Gag can be readily delivered to primary cells as a VSV-G pseudotype. Overall, this system provides a rapid and efficient method for observing WT Gag trafficking in living cells.</p><p>The biarsenical labeling system employed in this study allowed us to examine Gag localization after &#x0223c;20 hrs postinfection, the earliest time point at which Gag expression could be readily and consistently visualized. At this early time point, we observed a mix of PM and apparently internal Gag staining. Between 20 and 96 hrs postinfection, we did not observe a shift in the percentage of cells displaying PM, intracellular, or PM&#x0002b;intracellular staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000015-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) nor did we observe a time-dependent accumulation of internal Gag. These results differ from those of a recent study in which intracellular Gag-GFP staining increased over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Jouvenet1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. We note that the TC-tagged Gag in the current study is fully functional for particle assembly and release and produces infectious virions. Furthermore, our TC-tagged Gag is expressed in the context of a full-length molecular clone that encodes all the HIV-1 accessory proteins including Vpu. Indeed, elimination of Vpu expression led to a time-dependent accumulation of Gag in internal compartments (unpublished results), consistent with recent reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Harila1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Neil1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with the study of Jouvenet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Jouvenet1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, we did not observe an effect on virus release of treating infected cells with U18666A, a drug that arrests endosome motility (unpublished results). This observation supports the hypothesis that release of HIV-1 in MDMs occurs from PM-assembled VLPs. Although the FlAsH method can be accompanied by high background staining, we observed that this problem is largely mitigated by using very brief labeling periods. We also observed that background staining in MDM is less evident in MDM than in HeLa cells.</p><p>The most significant finding in this study is the visualization of apparently internal Gag moving to the site of cell-cell contact after synapse formation with uninfected T cells. It therefore appears that the tetraspanin-rich, apparently internal compartment in which HIV-1 assembles in MDMs can serve as a storage compartment for rapid presentation of virus particles at cell-cell junctions. These findings have clear implications for HIV-1 transmission from MDMs. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the virions in these internal vesicles reportedly remain infectious for weeks postinfection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Sharova1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref> and that virus transmission between infected MDMs and T cells is extremely rapid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Carr1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. In several respects, our observations with infected MDMs are similar to those made with dendritic cells treated with HIV-1. Binding of HIV-1 virions to dendritic cells can lead to transfer of virus to uninfected T-cells through the formation of a virological or infectious dendritic cell/T-cell synapse without the dendritic cell itself being productively infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Jolly1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-McDonald1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Garcia1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Wu1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Turville1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Wang1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Virions bound to the dendritic cell are reportedly internalized into an internal compartment that is strongly positive for CD81 but only weakly positive for CD63. Synapse formation induces the redistribution of virus particles and CD81 to the site of cell-cell contact, presumably facilitating transfer of virus to the T cell. The internal virus-containing compartment in dendritic cells is weakly acidic, as also reported for the virus-positive compartment in MDMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Jouve1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it appears that HIV-1 has evolved to subvert a pathway in both MDMs and dendritic cells that allows infectious virus particles to be retained in an apparently internal compartment and then redistributed to the cell surface following infectious synapse formation. Transfer of HIV-1 between T cells also involves the formation of a synapse that bears tetraspanin markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Jolly3">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>; however, there is currently no evidence for long-term retention of infectious virus particles within an internal compartment in T cells. Interestingly, whereas the generation of T-cell/T-cell infectious synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Jolly2">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref> and formation of cell-cell filopodial bridges that allow intercellular transfer of virus particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Sherer2">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref> have been reported to require Env expression, we found no such Env dependence for Gag translocation to the synapse formed between MDMs and T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000015-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported that mutations in the highly basic domain of MA (e.g. 29KE/31KE) induce a shift in Gag localization in HeLa cells and T cells from PM to MVBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Ono3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

This finding is confirmed here (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000015-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000015-g008">8</xref>). Interestingly, while WT MA-TC Gag rapidly translocates to the MDM/T-cell junction after synapse formation, we did not observe significant movement of 29KE/31KE-TC Gag to the MDM/T-cell synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000015-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). These results imply that WT and 29KE/31KE Gag localize to distinct tetraspanin-positive compartments in MDMs. A possible interpretation of these observations is that 29KE/31KE Gag localizes to &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; MVBs which do not move to the synapse, whereas WT Gag localizes to a compartment that is apparently internal but is connected to the PM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Deneka1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000015-Welsch1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. It is this PM-connected tetraspanin-positive compartment that undergoes a shift in localization following synapse formation, thereby allowing virus particle movement to the site of cell-cell contact. Surprisingly, we frequently observed that T-cells made contact with regions of the MDM PM under which Gag was concentrated, and in many cases the T-cells formed pseudopodia to contact this site (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000015-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>). These results imply that the T cell can &#x0201c;sense&#x0201d; regions of the PM that overlie the putative invaginations in which assembled virus particles are concentrated. These regions of the PM may be enriched in lipid rafts and/or tetraspanin-enriched microdomains.
