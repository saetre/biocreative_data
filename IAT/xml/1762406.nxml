Here we show that global expression profiling of Oct3/4-manipulated ES cells delineates the downstream target genes of Oct3/4. Combined with data from genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipitation &#x00028;ChIP&#x00029; assays, this analysis identifies not only primary downstream targets of Oct3/4, but also secondary or tertiary targets. Furthermore, the analysis also reveals that downstream target genes are regulated either positively or negatively by Oct3/4. Identification of a group of genes that show both activation and repression depending on Oct3/4 expression levels provides a possible mechanism for the requirement of appropriate Oct3/4 expression to maintain undifferentiated ES cells. As a proof-of-principle study, one of the downstream genes, <italic>Tcl1</italic>, has been analyzed in detail. We show that Oct3/4 binds to the promoter region of <italic>Tcl1</italic> and activates its transcription. We also show that Tcl1 is involved in the regulation of proliferation, but not differentiation, in ES cells. These findings suggest that the global expression profiling of gene-manipulated ES cells can help to delineate the structure and dynamics of gene regulatory networks.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Evans1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Martin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, can be maintained indefinitely <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Suda1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> in an undifferentiated self-renewing state in the presence of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Smith1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Williams1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Ying1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

These studies have provided a list of genes that are primary downstream targets of Oct3/4, and demonstrated physical associations between transcription factor proteins and promoter sequences <italic>in vitro</italic>. On the other hand, ChIP-on-chip or ChIP-PET assays do not provide information about whether these primary target genes are activated or repressed by Oct3/4 binding. In addition, secondary downstream target genes, which are regulated by the primary target genes, cannot be identified by such studies.</p><p>We have manipulated Oct3/4 levels in ES cells and carried out expression profiling by microarray analysis to identify new candidate genes as downstream targets of Oct3/4.

These results were consistent with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Niwa2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and were further confirmed by real time Q-PCR (data not shown).</p><p>As a first step toward assessing global trends, we identified changes in expression levels of individual genes by examining 20,251 genes that showed consistently-replicated expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s007">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). The expression patterns of these genes in ZHTc6 cells and ZHBTc4 cells were analyzed separately using a k-means clustering algorithm and grouped into ten clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g001">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Upper panels show the expression changes of individual genes in a 3D landscape map, whereas lower panels show the pattern of averaged gene expression changes and the number of genes grouped into each cluster. There were marked differences in the expressions of many genes between ZHTc6 cells and ZHBTc4 cells. In ZHBTc4 cells, genes showed relatively consistent trends over 5 days, whereas in ZHTc6 cells, larger numbers of genes responded rapidly, but were restored to original levels by day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g001">Figure 1B, C</xref>). The transient alteration of large numbers of genes in ZHTc6 cells could reflect the complexity of gene expression regulation by Oct3/4, or may instead reflect the presence of heterogeneous cell populations in ZHTc6 cultures, as evidenced by the upregulation of markers for broader cell types, including primitive/definitive endoderm (<italic>Gata6, Gata4</italic> and <italic>Afp</italic>), mesoderm (<italic>T, Gsc</italic>), and ectoderm (<italic>Cdh2, Mbp, Nefl</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s001">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s010">Supplemental Table S4</xref>).</p><p>To further compare the gene expression changes between the Oct3/4-repression condition (ZHBTc4) and Oct3/4-overexpression condition (ZHTc6), we plotted the fraction of genes in each cluster of ZHTc6 cells present in each cluster of ZHBTc4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Four major peaks were observed. In ZHBTc4 cells nearly half the genes (69 genes out of 144 genes) in cluster 1 and 20&#x00025; of the genes (143 out of 667 genes) in cluster 4 were grouped in cluster 10 in ZHTc6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, green arrow). This indicates that genes downregulated under Oct3/4-repression conditions tend to be also downregulated under Oct3/4-overexpression conditions. This group of 212 genes (129 unique gene symbols) included known direct targets of Oct3/4 such as <italic>Spp1/Opn, Sox2, Fbxo15, Otx2</italic>, and <italic>Zfp42/Rex1</italic>, as well as newly identified direct targets of Oct3/4 by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Boyer1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Loh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g001">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s008">Supplemental Table S2</xref>). In ZHBTc4 cells, nearly half the genes (84 genes out of 223 genes) in cluster 5 and 13&#x00025; of the genes (122 out of 906 genes) in cluster 2 were grouped in cluster 1 in ZHTc6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, red arrow). Thus, genes upregulated under the Oct3/4-repression conditions tend to be also upregulated under the Oct3/4-overexpression conditions. This group of 206 genes (180 unique gene symbols) included <italic>Igf2, Krt1-18</italic>, and <italic>Krt2-8</italic>, which are known for their high expression in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g001">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s009">Supplemental Table S3</xref>).</p><p>The diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g001">Figure 1E</xref> summarizes this unique mode of gene expression regulation by Oct3/4. Some of the direct Oct3/4 target genes seem to be regulated by Oct3/4 in a bell-shaped dose-response manner or in an inverse bell-shaped dose-response manner. It is thus inappropriate to simply classify all Oct3/4-downstream genes as positively or negatively regulated by Oct3/4. Bell-shaped expression regulation by Oct3/4 has been first demonstrated using tandem Octamer motif promoter constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Scholer3">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been demonstrated that both low and high levels of Oct3/4 repress the Zfp42/Rex1 promoter, whereas intermediate levels of Oct3/4 expression activate the Zfp42 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-BenShushan1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>; Lower panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The current results have not only confirmed these earlier works, but established that this is rather common mode of expression regulation by Oct3/4, because many other genes show similar expression patterns. Furthermore, the current analysis has revealed that genes that show the inverse bell-shaped expression pattern exist. That is, low and high levels of Oct3/4 activate the promoter, but intermediate levels of Oct3/4 repress the gene promoter (upper panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). These gene regulation relationships perhaps underlie a unique mechanism of Oct3/4 regulation, which is required to be maintained in a narrow range of appropriate expression for maintenance of pluripotency: either the increase or decrease of Oct3/4 levels from the intermediate range leads to the differentiation of ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Niwa2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identifying Oct3/4 downstream genes</title><p>To obtain a list of Oct3/4-downstream candidate genes, we first used Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

However, it is generally difficult to identify primary targets of Oct3/4 by searching for canonical octamer motifs, 5&#x02032;-ATTA/TGCAT-3&#x02032;, because it has been shown that Oct3/4 can bind to other similar sequence motifs such as 5&#x02032;-ACTAGCAT-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-ATCAGCAT-3&#x02032; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Loh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Nishimoto1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, binding at the octamer motif is not unique to Oct3/4, but common to all Oct gene family members, e.g., Oct1. To reduce the large number of targets identified by the use of degenerate consensus sequence motifs, we searched for clusters of multiple OCT binding sites within &#x02212;8 kb to &#x0002b;2 kb from transcription start sites of all possible genes in the mouse genome. However, even the search for genes carrying clusters of at least three sites with sequence conservation (&#x0003e;50&#x00025; compared to the human genome sequence) identified 9326 target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s012">Supplemental Table S6</xref>), and the search for genes carrying the clusters of at least five sites with the sequence conservation (&#x0003e;50&#x00025;) and mismatch score (&#x0003c;0.05) identified 4396 target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s013">Supplemental Table S7</xref>). Without experimental validations of individual Oct3/4-target genes, the utility of genes identified by searching octamer-binding motifs are limited at this point.</p><p>Another approach is to use a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and to identify all promoter sequences that are bound by Oct3/4. Recently, Boyer <italic>et al</italic>. have conducted a large scale analysis of promoter binding for OCT4 in human ES cells using ChIP-Chip technologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Boyer1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. They demonstrated that OCT4 was associated with 581 of the promoter regions for known protein-coding genes in the &#x02212;8 kb to &#x0002b;2 kb region, relative to the transcription start site. Similarly, Loh <italic>et al</italic>. have identified 963 genes as a direct downstream target of Oct3/4 in mouse ES cells using a ChIP-PET (paired-end ditag) assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Loh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. We compared our Oct3/4 downstream gene lists with the data by Loh <italic>et al</italic> and Boyer <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Only a small fraction of genes (61 genes) overlap between human ES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Boyer1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and mouse ES cell data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Loh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This is partially due to the biological differences between mouse and human systems as discussed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Loh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. However, some of this effect may also be due to differences in sensitivity and specificity between the techniques used in these studies. In fact, genes that have been experimentally shown to be direct downstream targets of Oct3/4, such as Zfp42/Rex1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-BenShushan1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, were not detected in either Boyer <italic>et al</italic>. or Loh <italic>et al</italic>. (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g003">Figure 3A</xref> for a complete list). Thus, we have decided to include all genes that have been shown by either Boyer <italic>et al</italic> or Loh <italic>et al</italic> to be primary targets of Oct3/4 in our list of Oct3/4 target candidates. We compared our combined list (list 1 and list2) with the gene list by Boyer <italic>et al</italic>. and that of Loh <italic>et al</italic>. We found that 372 genes were overlapping with ChIP-based assay results and considered them primary Oct3/4-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows gene symbols of 377 primary target genes (372 genes plus five well-known Oct3/4-target genes that were not included in the ChIP-based assays; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s014">Supplemental Table S8</xref> for the details about these genes). The remaining 4040 genes, which were included in either list 1 or list 2 of our Oct3/4-downstream candidate genes, but not included in Oct3/4-binding target by either ChIP-on-chip or ChIP-PET studies, should be considered as the secondary or tertiary targets of Oct3/4. These genes are most likely regulated by the primary target genes of Oct3/4.</p><p>Unlike the informatic searching of Oct3/4-binding motifs or ChIP-based assays, expression profiling data can also provide the information about the direction of regulation, i.e., whether the downstream genes are up-regulated or down-regulated by the repression of Oct3/4 in ZHBTc4 ES cells. Out of 396 primary target genes, 159 genes belong to the former category, whereas 213 genes belong to the latter category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g004">4A</xref>). Out of 4040 secondary/tertiary target genes, 2238 genes belong to the former category, whereas 1802 genes belong to the latter category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, the expression profiling of Oct3/4-manipulated ES cells provides important insights into not only the structure, but also the dynamics of Oct3/4-regulated gene networks. The results clearly demonstrate that both ChIP-based assays and expression profiling of Oct3/4-manipulated ES cells are required to delineate the downstream cascades of Oct3/4-regulated genes.</p><p>To gain insights into the functions of the 372 primary Oct3/4-downstream candidate genes, we analyzed GO annotations of these genes. Out of these genes, 287 genes had GO annotations representing 160 GO categories with a statistical significance threshold of FDR&#x0003e;0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s015">Supplemental Table S9</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows representative GO categories. Interestingly, one-fourth of the 287 genes were involved in &#x0201c;transcription.&#x0201d; This indicates that Oct3/4 can regulate a large number of genes by regulating many transcription factors, which in turn regulate their downstream genes. Other notable GO categories include &#x0201c;cell proliferation,&#x0201d; which indicates the direct involvement of Oct3/4 in the regulation of cell proliferation. A significant fraction of genes annotated as &#x0201c;enzyme-linked receptor protein signaling pathway&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Wnt receptor signaling pathway&#x0201d; indicate that Oct3/4 directly regulates key cellular signaling pathways in ES cells. Oct3/4 also directly regulates genes involved in various &#x0201c;system development&#x0201d; sub-categories, such as &#x0201c;nervous system development,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;angiogenesis,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;lung development.&#x0201d; The direct regulation of the variety of cellular and developmental processes by Oct3/4 is consistent with the profound and diverse effects of Oct3/4 expression levels in ES cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Validation of candidate genes for downstream targets of Oct3/4</title><p>Global gene expression analyses of Oct3/4-manipulated ES cells have provided an independent validation to the primary target genes identified <italic>de novo</italic> by the ChIP-on-chip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Boyer1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> or ChIP- PET <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Loh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> analysis, so it stands to reason that the list of genes identified by combining all three data sets, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g004">4A</xref>, is the most reliable at this point. However, to meet more rigorous molecular biology standards, whether these genes are indeed directly regulated by Oct3/4 have to be validated individually by standard molecular biological techniques such as electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and luciferase reporter assays. Such validations, however, are not straightforward. It is well-known that genes can be regulated by cis-regulatory elements that are located far from the transcription start sites. Isolating and assaying a few kb upstream region of these target genes would not suffice to conclude whether the genes can be directly regulated by Oct3/4 or not. Especially, it will be difficult to establish that genes cannot be regulated by Oct3/4, because the cis-regulatory elements may not be included in the genomic region assayed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nevertheless, we tested this strategy to validate at least a gene from this target gene list.</p><p>First, we selected four putative primary target genes in a rather arbitrarily manner: <italic>Trh, Tcl1</italic>, and <italic>Id2</italic> were selected from top 30 gene lists in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <italic>Nfatc2ip</italic> was selected from a gene list in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. We also selected <italic>Zfp42</italic> as a positive control. We amplified by PCR the &#x0223c;2 kb upstream putative promoter regions of these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s002">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). To investigate whether Oct3/4 can indeed regulate the expression of these genes, we constructed a luciferase reporter gene driven by the upstream putative promoter region and cotransfected it with or without an Oct3/4-expressing plasmid into 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. Of 5 reporter constructs, the two constructs containing <italic>Tcl1</italic> and <italic>Zfp42</italic> promoters were activated by Oct3/4, as judged by more than 2-fold difference in luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). To confirm regulation in a more natural context, we transfected each reporter construct into ZHBTc4 cells, where Oct3/4 levels can be repressed by Tet. Constructs with <italic>Trh, Tcl1</italic>, and <italic>Zfp42</italic> promoters responded to Oct3/4, as judged by more than 2-fold difference of luciferase activity in the presence or absence of Tet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably, <italic>Tcl1</italic> showed even a stronger response than <italic>Zfp42</italic>, a well-known downstream target of Oct3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These results identified at least <italic>Tcl1</italic>, along with <italic>Zfp42</italic>, as regulated by Oct3/4.</p><p>In order to identify Oct3/4 regulatory elements, a series of 5&#x02032;-deletion mutants of the <italic>Tcl1</italic> promoter were generated and transfected into the ZHBTc4 cells. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that deletion of two regions that cover &#x02212;0.8 kb &#x0223c; &#x02212;1.3 kb and &#x02212;0.4 kb &#x0223c; &#x02212;0.5 kb, where variant Octamer-binding motifs were found, sharply reduced the responsiveness to Oct3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). We further examined whether Oct3/4 binds to these motifs by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). As a control, a c1-oligonucleotide that contains the established Oct3/4-binding motif of <italic>Zfp42</italic> was used. For the Oct3/4-binding motifs of <italic>Tcl1</italic>, we used an s1 oligonucleotide that contains an AAAGGCAT motif and an s2 oligonucleotide that contains an ATGTAGAT motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). The s2 oligonucleotide, but not the s1 oligonucleotide, showed a distinctive band after incubation with ES cell lysates. The band was shifted by Oct3/4 antibody and disappeared when a 2-bp mutation was introduced into the Oct3/4-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, Oct3/4 present in ES cell lysates binds to the s2 oligonucleotide. To further narrow the region, a series of single-base mutant oligonucleotides were generated and subjected to EMSA. The results clearly showed that &#x0201c;ATGTAGAT,&#x0201d; located 410 bp upstream of the <italic>Tcl1</italic> gene, is a functional Oct3/4 binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s003">Supplemental Figure S3B, C</xref>). To further confirm the binding of Oct3/4 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis and demonstrated that Oct3/4 indeed binds to the s2 region, but not to the s1 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). A luciferase assay using another series of finer deletion mutants of the <italic>Tcl1</italic> promoter further confirmed that the region s2 was indeed an Oct3/4-responsive element in ZHBTc4 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s003">Supplemental Figure S3A</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that Oct3/4 binds to this variant Oct3/4-binding site (ATGTAGAT) in the <italic>Tcl1</italic> promoter region and directly activates its expression. Interestingly, unlike other Oct3/4-binding sites, there is no Sox2-binding site around this Oct3/4-binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Functional analysis of Tcl1 in ES cells</title><p>To gain insights into the functional involvement of <italic>Tcl1</italic> in the Oct3/4 pathway in ES cells, <italic>Tcl1</italic> expression was knocked down by transfecting siRNA against <italic>Tcl1</italic> (si<italic>Tcl1</italic>). The proliferation of ES cells was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s004">Supplemental Figure S4A</xref>). Unlike the suppression of proliferation when Oct3/4 expression is repressed in ZHTc4 cells, this suppression of proliferation was not accompanied by any detectable morphological differentiation of ES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s004">Supplemental Figure S4A</xref>). However, it is conceivable that this rather general proliferation suppression phenotype might be caused by either non-specific or off-target effects of siRNA. To address this issue, we first generated mouse ES cell clones (Tcl1-ROSA) with a Tet-controllable Tcl1 gene by integrating the ORF of <italic>Tcl1</italic> into a ROSA locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Masui1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. We then established multiple ES cell clones, where a plasmid expressing shRNA against the 3&#x02032;-UTR of <italic>Tcl1</italic> (shTcl1) was stably transfected into the Tcl1-ROSA ES cell clone. In these mouse ES clones (named shTcl1#2-1, shTcl1#2-5, shTcl1#2-7, and shTcl1#3-3), the expression of endogenous <italic>Tcl1</italic> was constitutively repressed by shRNA, but the expression of exogenous <italic>Tcl1</italic> was repressed only when Tet was added to the cell culture medium. Consistent with the transient siRNA results, the repression of <italic>Tcl1</italic> suppressed the proliferation of ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The reductions of <italic>Tcl1</italic> in these ES cells at RNA level and protein level were confirmed by the RT-PCR and Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Because the proliferation of a parental cell line (EBRTcH3) was not suppressed by Tet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), the suppression of proliferation observed here was indeed caused by the repression of <italic>Tcl1</italic>. The suppression of proliferation by the repression of <italic>Tcl1</italic> was also reversible even after 4 days of culture under Tcl1-reduced conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g006">Figure 6C, D</xref>). This is in sharp contrast to the irreversible effects of Oct3/4-repressed conditions, which not only reduce cellular proliferation, but also differentiate ES cells into the trophoblast lineage.</p><p>Further support for the notion that Tcl1 acts on cell proliferation but is not directly involved in the differentiation of ES cells came from the microarray analysis of siTcl1-transfected ES cells. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the selected 1,043 genes that represent PC2(&#x02212;) in ZHBTc4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) indicated that ZHBTc4 cells showed changes from an expression pattern like ES cells (d0) to a pattern like TS cells (d2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s005">Supplement Figure S5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s016">Supplemental Table S10</xref>). Unlike ZHBTc4 cells at a comparable time point (d2), siTcl1-transfected ES cells showed an expression pattern like ES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s005">Supplemental Figure S5A</xref>). In particular, genes involved in cell proliferation regulation showed similar expression changes in siTcl-transfected ES cells and ZHBTc4 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s005">Supplemental Figure S5B</xref>), whereas trophoblast-lineage markers were not significantly upregulated in siTcl1-transfected ES cells. The microarray analyses were thus consistent with the phenotypic changes observed in ES cells following repression of Tcl1: slowdown of proliferation, but no differentiation towards the trophoblast lineage. Consequently, Tcl1 seems to fractionate the effects of repression of Oct3/4, which causes both the slowdown of proliferation and the differentiation into trophoblast cells.</p><p>To investigate whether Tcl1 is a major mediator of the effects of Oct3/4 on the proliferation of ES cells, we established multiple stable cell clones (Tcl1-#2A1, Tcl1-#2D5, and Tcl1-#1A6) by transfecting a plasmid vector constitutively expressing Tcl1 into ZHBTc4 ES cells. In these cells, the repression of Oct3/4 by Tet does not cause the repression of Tcl1, and therefore, the effect of Oct3/4 repression can be uncoupled with the repression of Tcl1. However, the results clearly showed that the constitutive expression of Tcl1 could not prevent the suppression of ES cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g006">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>The only known function of Tcl1 protein is to enhance the kinase activity of Akt1 (thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1) in leukemia cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Pekarsky1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Akt1 is a key kinase in the Ras/PI3K/Akt1 signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Datta1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. To investigate whether Tcl1 also activates Akt1 in ES cells, Western blot analysis was performed. The total amount of Akt1 protein was unchanged, but the active form of Akt1, which is phosphorylated at the Ser-473 site, was reduced in Tcl1-repressed ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Similar results were obtained in siTcl-transfected ES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s004">Supplemental Figure S4B</xref>). The suppression of ES cell proliferation by the repression of Tcl1 was restored by the transfection of a plasmid expressing a constitutively active form of Akt1 (caAkt1), suggesting that Akt1 mediates at least some of the proliferation-reducing action of Tcl1 in ES cells. Finally, it is worth mentioning that Oct3/4 expression levels were not changed when Tcl1 expression was repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that there is no feedback loop from Tcl1 to Oct3/4.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Oct3/4 plays a central role in the maintenance of undifferentiated ES cells, which are characterized by their pluripotency and self-renewal activity.

Our microarray analysis confirms that repression of Oct3/4 differentiates ES cells into the trophoblast lineage by showing the global similarity of gene expression patterns to those of TS cells. However, the analysis indicates that ZHTc6 cells differentiate into more different cell types than appreciated previously, suggesting that overexpression of Oct3/4 alone does not completely determine the fate of ES cells, but may rather facilitate differentiation by perturbing the maintenance of self-renewal. This notion is consistent with recent findings that the effect of Oct3/4 overexpression depends on context. For example, overexpression of Oct3/4 enhances differentiation towards neurons on PA6 stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Shimozaki1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas it enhances differentiation towards beating cardiac muscles in embryoid bodies and hematopoietic cells on OP9 stromal cells (H.N., data not shown).

The presence of these &#x0201c;bell-shaped&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;inverse bell-shaped&#x0201d; gene expression regulation relationships indicates that the maintenance of appropriate Oct3/4 levels is built into the gene regulatory network in mouse ES cells.</p><p>Two examples of such regulations by Oct3/4 have been reported.

Global ChIP assay provides the structure, i.e., connections or wiring of the gene regulatory network, whereas the global expression profiling provides the dynamics, i.e., behavior or kinetics of the gene regulatory network. For example, ChIP-on-chip assays of human ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Boyer1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and ChIP-PET assays of mouse ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Loh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> have provided a large list of primary target genes whose regulatory sequences, e.g., enhancers/promoters, can be bound by Oct3/4. However, these global ChIP assays cannot provide information about whether Oct3/4 activates or represses the expression of these downstream genes. Such information can be obtained only by doing the global gene expression profiling of ES cells in which the Oct3/4 level is specifically altered. In this report, the global expression profiling of Oct3/4-repressed mouse ES cells uncovered &#x0223c;4500 candidate genes as potential downstream targets of Oct3/4. Although it is not easy to distinguish the primary or secondary target genes by global expression profiling alone, the meta-analysis of the combined data sets of global ChIP assays and global expression profiling were able to dissect the downstream gene regulatory network of Oct3/4 as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g004">4</xref> (see a complete list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s014">Supplemental Table S8</xref>).

We have also shown that the forced repression of Tcl1 primarily affects ES cell proliferation, but not differentiation, based on morphology and microarray-based gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s016">Supplemental Table S10</xref>). As one of the genes with a bell-shaped expression pattern relative to Oct3/4 level, both overexpression and repression of Oct3/4 reduces the expression level of Tcl1. These data suggest that the reduction of ES cell proliferation caused by both overexpression and repression of Oct3/4 is mediated by Tcl1&#x02013;a primary target gene of Oct3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). However, it is also clear that Tcl1 is not the only primary Oct3/4 target gene that controls proliferation in ES cells, because the constitutive expression of Tcl1 cannot prevent the reduction of proliferation by the repression of Oct3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000026-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, it is important to point out that Oct3/4 is not the only upstream gene for Tcl1, because we have observed that Tcl1 also responds immediately to the activation of Stat3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000026.s006">Supplemental Figure S6</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that Tcl1 enhances the kinase activity of Akt1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-Pekarsky1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

The rescue of the siTcl1-induced phenotype by a constitutively active form of Akt1 implies that Tcl1 acts through Akt1 in ES cells. Akt1 is one of the key kinases whose activation enhances cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis.

Genes involved in cell proliferation regulation showed similar expression changes in siTcl-transfected ES cells and ZHBTc4 cells. For example, CyclinD1 and Cdk2 were downregulated in both systems, whereas Cdkn1a/P21Cip1 and Rbl2/P130 were upregulated. These expression patterns indicate the suppression of cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000026-FurukawaHibi1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, trophoblast-lineage markers were not significantly upregulated in siTcl1-transfected ES cells. For example, Plac1 showed a 2.8-fold increase at day 2 of ZHBTc4 cells, but was not increased in siTcl1-transfected ES cells. Similarly, Krt2-8 showed a 14.3-fold increase at day 2 in ZHBTc4 cells, but very little (1.4-fold) increase in siTcl1-transfected ES cells. The microarray analyses were thus consistent with the phenotypic changes observed in ES cells following repression of Tcl1: slowdown of proliferation, but no differentiation into trophoblast lineage. The Tcl1 thus fractionates the effects of repression of Oct3/4, which causes both the slowdown of proliferation and the differentiation into trophoblast cells.</p><p>(2.54 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000026.s011.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000026.s012"><label>Table S6</label><caption><p>Primary targets of Oct3/4.
