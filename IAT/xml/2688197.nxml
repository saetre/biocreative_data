The normal asporin allele contains 13 aspartic acid repeats in a 382 amino acid protein, and is designated D13. There are now three polymorphisms thought to be strongly associated with osteoarthritis (OA) susceptibility; these occur in the asporin gene (<italic>ASPN</italic>), the secreted frizzled-related protein 3 gene (<italic>FRZB</italic>), and the calmodulin 1 gene (<italic>CALM1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have identified populations of individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee and asporin alleles with 14 aspartic acid repeats in the N-terminal region of the protein (designated D14). Work by Kizawa <italic>et al</italic>. first identified an association of the <italic>ASPN </italic>single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with knee and hip OA in Japanese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As shown by Iida <italic>et al</italic>., there are at least 19 SNPs in asporin in Japanese patients with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Associations of the <italic>ASPN </italic>SNPs with OA have been studied by Shi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and by Nakamura <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In non-Asian populations, however, recent studies appear to show a lack of association of the <italic>ASPN </italic>SNPs with OA susceptibility, as reflected in the work by Rodriguez-Lopez <italic>et al</italic>. in Spanish Caucasians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and work by Mustafa <italic>et al</italic>. in British Caucasians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Our laboratory has become interested in asporin in the human intervertebral disc following the finding of Song <italic>et al</italic>. of an association of the <italic>ASPN </italic>D14 allele with disc degeneration in Asians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our literature search was not able to identify any studies showing immunolocalization of asporin in the human disc. The objectives of the present study, therefore, were to determine the localization patterns of asporin within the human and sand rat intervertebral disc, and to assess asporin expression in the human disc <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Clinical study population</title><p>Experimental study of human disc specimens was approved prospectively by the authors' Human Subjects Institutional Review Board at Carolinas Medical Center. The need for informed consent was waived since disc tissue was removed as part of routine surgical practice. Scoring of disc degeneration utilized the Thompson scoring system; this system scores disc degeneration over the spectrum from a healthy disc (Thompson grade I) to discs with advanced degeneration (grade V, the most advanced stage of degeneration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Patient specimens were derived from surgical disc procedures performed on individuals with herniated discs and degenerative disc disease. Surgical specimens were transported to the laboratory in sterile tissue culture medium. Care was taken to remove all granulation tissue and to sample only disc tissue. Non-surgical control donor disc specimens were obtained via the National Cancer Institute Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN); they were shipped overnight to the laboratory in sterile tissue culture medium and processed as described below. Specimen procurement from the CHTN was included in our approved protocol by our human subjects Institutional Review board.</p></sec><sec><title>Sand rat intervertebral disc tissue</title><p>Animal studies were carried out following approval by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. <italic>Psammomys obesus</italic>, the sand rat, is studied in our laboratory as a model of spontaneous, age-related disc degeneration.

Spines from seven animals were analyzed in the present study of immunolocalization of asporin.

Cells cultured in three dimensions and in monolayers were assayed for gene expression using the Affymetrix microarray system (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Total RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol reagent (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), reverse transcribed to double-stranded cDNA, subjected to two rounds of transcription, and hybridized to the DNA microarray in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400. Affymetrix human U133 X3P arrays were used. The GCOS Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System (version 1.2, Affymetrix) was used for determining gene expression levels of asporin [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_017680.1">NM_017680.1</ext-link>].

Slides were incubated for 1 h with polyclonal anti-asporin (GenWay Biotech, San Diego, CA, USA) at a 1:400 dilution. Secondary antibody was LSAB2 Link Antibody (Dako) applied for 10 minutes followed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dako) for 10 minutes, and DAB (Dako) for 5 minutes. Some sand rat spine specimens and three-dimensional cultured human disc cells were prepared using the Vector VIP (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) red chromagen. Universal Negative Control Rabbit (Dako) was used as a negative control. A positive control from a young rat articular cartilage joint was also included with each run.

Novel work reported here shows the presence of asporin associated with cells in the outer annulus and, less frequently, with cells in the inner annulus and nucleus pulposus. We also found that the asporin gene was expressed in healthy and degenerated discs, and by annulus cells in monolayer and three-dimensional cell culture.</p><p>Our studies showed significantly higher asporin expression levels in more degenerate intervertebral discs; these findings are similar to those presented from recent work by Kizawa <italic>et al</italic>. in cartilage from osteoarthritic subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. They found high levels in osteoarthritic subjects, but much lower levels in control subjects. They also found that a chondrogenic cell line with overexpression of asporin showed suppression of chondrocyte marker genes aggrecan and type II collagen during chondrocyte differentiation. These cells also showed suppression of TGF&#x003b2;-mediated expression of aggrecan and type II collagen. Overexpression of asporin also was associated with proteoglycan content of the ECM. These findings led Kizawa <italic>et al</italic>. to suggest that asporin may play a major role in modulating chondrocyte matrix homeostasis.</p><p>Our studies presented here have several shortcomings that should be mentioned. Since the majority of the disc specimens which we received are Thompson grade III and IV, it is unfortunate that we did not have any of the most degenerate grade V specimens which could be used for gene expression studies. However, in spite of this problem, the data did show significantly greater asporin expression in the more degenerate grade IV specimens studied here as compared to expression in grades I, II and III (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <italic>P </italic>= 0.004).</p><p>Secondly, we have not yet been able to examine our study population for the presence of the asporin polymorphisms now known to be present in Asian patients with disc degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Such studies are now underway. It is also important that further research be carried out at the cellular level to elucidate the function and role of asporin in the progression of disc degeneration. Final points for future work include studies of expression in nucleus pulposus cells. Another important future project would be to carry out an analysis in disc as was reported by Kizawa <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] in cartilage. Another shortcoming is that we were not able to carry out a complete analysis of the localization of asporin in the aging/degenerating lumbar spine of the sand rat; we look forward to this future analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the discs of Caucasian subjects studied here, and in the sand rat (an small rodent with spontaneous age-related disc degeneration), greater immunolocalization was found in the outer, compared to inner, annulus. Localization was rare in the nucleus. Similar patterns were found for the presence of asporin in lumbar discs of sand rats. Gene expression studies showed greatest expression of asporin in the more degenerate human discs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Asporin was also expressed in human annulus cells cultured in monolayer and three-dimensional culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p><italic>ASPN</italic>: asporin gene; <italic>CALM1</italic>: calmodulin 1 gene; CHTN: Cooperative Human Tissue Network; ECM: extracellular matrix; <italic>FRZB</italic>: secreted frizzled-related protein 3 gene; GEO: Gene Expression Omnibus; SLRP: small leucine-rich proteoglycan; SNP: single nucleotide polymorphism.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HEG and EN conceived the study and participated in design and coordination.
