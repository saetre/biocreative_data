It is based on the consecutive restriction digestions of 3' terminal cDNA fragments to produce a fingerprint of gene expression. cDNA molecules are synthesized using a biotinylated oligo(dT) primer, digested with a frequently cutting restriction endonuclease and the 3'-terminal restriction fragments are isolated using streptavidin microbeads. After amplification by PCR, cDNA fragments are immobilized again on streptavidin beads, radiolabeled and treated sequentially with a set of restriction endonucleases. The products of individual enzymatic reactions from two or more different RNA populations are resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and compared to reveal differentially expressed genes. This strategy enabled us to identify and clone the fragments of five genes expressed differentially in murine thymus and spleen. One of the genes was found to encode terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase; others are apparently previously unknown genes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0163-a" xlink:role="2956"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0164-a" xlink:role="2957"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2954"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0162.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2955"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2956"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2957"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00015-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2958"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
