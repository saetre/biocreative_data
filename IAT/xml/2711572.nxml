Our prior work has shown that integrin signaling forms part of the cell&#x02013;cell interactions that ensure only those oligodendrocytes contacting axons survive. Here, therefore, we have asked whether integrins regulate the interactions that lead to myelination. Using homologous recombination to insert a single-copy transgene into the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus, we find that mice expressing a dominant-negative &#x003b2;1 integrin in myelinating oligodendrocytes require a larger axon diameter to initiate timely myelination. Mice with a conditional deletion of focal adhesion kinase (a signaling molecule activated by integrins) exhibit a similar phenotype. Conversely, transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative &#x003b2;3 integrin in oligodendrocytes display no myelination abnormalities. We conclude that &#x003b2;1 integrin plays a key role in the axoglial interactions that sense axon size and initiate myelination, such that loss of integrin signaling leads to a delay in myelination of small-diameter axons.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myelination represents a spectacular cell&#x02013;cell interaction in which axons are ensheathed by multiple layers of membrane from specialized glia&#x02014;oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The threshold axon diameter for myelination is a regulated process, with a minimum axon diameter for myelination of 1 &#x000b5;m in the PNS and of 0.2 &#x000b5;m in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Waxman and Bennett, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Voyvodic, 1989</xref>). Moreover, the number of wraps is precisely related to the axon diameter such that the ratio of the diameter of the axon to that of the entire myelinated unit&#x02014;the g-ratio&#x02014;is constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friede, 1972</xref>). This points to the existence of signals on the axon surface that both initiate the myelination process and then determine exactly how many times the myelinating process wraps around the axon before the extrusion of cytoplasm (a process termed compaction) and the formation of the mature multilamellar sheath. In the PNS, a necessary and sufficient signal is type III neuregulin-1 (Nrg1), increased expression of which on the axon results in a thicker myelin sheath, whereas reduced axonal expression results in thinner myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michailov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taveggia et al., 2005</xref>). The overexpression of Nrg1 also causes the myelination of axons whose size is below the normal threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taveggia et al., 2005</xref>), showing that Nrg1 is a signal that initiates myelination in addition to its role in regulating wrapping. In the CNS, however, the role and identity of any such initiation signals remains unknown, with the contribution of neuregulins at this and later stages of myelination being unclear. Although type III Nrg1<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice show reduced myelin sheath thickness in the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taveggia et al., 2008</xref>), normal myelination in mice where the Nrg1 gene has been excised in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brinkmann et al., 2008</xref>) shows that other signals must contribute to the precise relationship between axon and oligodendrocyte.</p><p>Cell adhesion molecules represent excellent candidates for these additional signals regulating myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laursen and ffrench-Constant, 2007</xref>). One of these is &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin, a receptor expressed on oligodendrocytes for laminins expressed in axon tracts at the time of myelination that promotes oligodendrocyte survival by amplification of growth factor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colognato et al., 2002</xref>). This provides a mechanism for the target-dependent survival of oligodendrocytes, with those that fail to establish normal contact with axons during development undergoing programmed cell death. The importance of integrins in oligodendrocyte biology is further underscored by the finding that integrin-mediated signaling pathways are strongly represented in a genome-wide analysis of expression in differentiating oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cahoy et al., 2008</xref>). Here, therefore, we have asked whether integrins play a role in the regulation of myelination, either by contributing to the signals that initiate myelination or by regulating the thickness of the resulting myelin sheath.</p><p>Prior studies on the role of &#x003b2;1 integrin in CNS myelination in vivo have been contradictory. Constitutive disruption of the &#x003b2;1 integrin gene resulted in early lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fassler and Meyer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stephens et al., 1995</xref>), requiring the use of conditional ablation or dominant-negative strategies to examine function. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al. (2006)</xref> reported that mice expressing a &#x003b2;1 integrin lacking the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (&#x003b2;1&#x00394;C) in oligodendrocytes displayed region-specific hypomyelination in optic nerve and spinal cord and no myelination abnormalities in the corpus callosum. In contrast, conditional inactivation of the &#x003b2;1 integrin gene in premyelinating oligodendrocytes showed that &#x003b2;1 integrin is not required for CNS axon ensheathment, myelination, or remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benninger et al., 2006</xref>). Nonetheless, the contribution made by integrin signaling to oligodendrocyte survival, evidenced by our earlier studies on the &#x003b1;6 knockout CNS, was confirmed by a transient reduction in oligodendrocyte numbers in the developing cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benninger et al., 2006</xref>). However, it is possible that both these studies fail to reveal the specific function of &#x003b2;1 integrin in myelinating oligodendrocytes. In the knockout study, gene deletion occurs early, at the premyelinating stage of oligodendrocyte development, thus potentially enabling compensation by other integrins to occur by the stage of myelination. The ability of different integrin &#x003b2; subunits to compensate for one another has been previously shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin-Bermudo et al., 1999</xref>). In the dominant-negative study, the construct used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al. (2006)</xref> contained a normal integrin extracellular domain that will bind laminin and compete with any other laminin receptors for available ligand in the myelinating tract. Here, therefore, we have used the reverse strategy&#x02014;expression in oligodendrocytes of a well-characterized dominant-negative &#x003b2;1 integrin subunit containing only the intracellular domain that will not bind ligand and would thus be predicted to be more specific in targeting &#x003b2;1 integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">LaFlamme et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Relvas et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, we have minimized the time available for compensatory mechanisms to develop by expressing the dominant-negative subunit only at the myelinating stage in oligodendrocytes using the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farhadi et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of dominant-negative &#x003b2;1 integrin transgenic mice (dn&#x003b2;1)</title><p>To examine the role of &#x003b2;1 integrin signaling in myelination in vivo, without perturbing the earlier stages of oligodendrocyte precursor migration and proliferation, we generated transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative chimeric &#x003b2;1 integrin (dn&#x003b2;1) under the control of the 9.5-Kb MBP promoter. This promoter drives specific expression in myelinating oligodendrocytes within the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farhadi et al., 2003</xref>), as we confirmed in lacZ reporter mice that showed expression of &#x003b2;-galactosidase only at the time of myelination in different white matter tracts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807010/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). The dominant-negative construct used contains the &#x003b2;1 intracellular domain and the extracellular and transmembrane domains were replaced by the nonsignaling &#x003b1;-subunit of the human interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R&#x003b1;). This chimeric integrin has been shown to function in a dominant-negative manner in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">LaFlamme et al., 1994</xref>) and when expressed in oligodendrocyte precursors transplanted into demyelinated lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Relvas et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>To overcome the usual limitations of random and multiple-copy insertion in standard transgenesis, we used the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) targeting system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farhadi et al., 2003</xref>) for the generation of the genetically modified embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing the dn&#x003b2;1 integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). This technology uses homologous recombination to target a single copy of the desired transgene (in this case the dn&#x003b2;1 integrin) driven by a specific promoter (in this case the MBP promoter) into the hprt locus on the X-chromosome. The ES cell line used lacks a complete hprt gene and the targeting vector &#x0201c;rescues&#x0201d; the hprt gene by replacing the lost sequences in addition to inserting the desired transgene and its promoter. As a result, ES cells with the correct insertion can easily be selected by virtue of their expression of hprt and the subsequent ability to grow in HAT medium. This process was extremely efficient, with 12 out of 12 clones selected having the correct insertion, as evidenced by PCR analysis performed as described in the Materials and methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). We then generated transgenic mice from one of these ES cell lines to establish a dn&#x003b2;1 transgenic line. These mice had no overt phenotype, and in particular showed no evidence of locomotor defects.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of dominant-negative &#x003b2;1 integrin transgenic mice (dn&#x003b2;1).</bold> (a) The hprt targeting system used in our study: the dn&#x003b2;1 transgene (comprising the IL2R&#x003b1; extracellular and transmembrane domains and the &#x003b2;1 integrin cytoplasmic domain) and the MBP promoter were inserted by homologous recombination in single copy into the disrupted hprt locus on the X-chromosome of the hprt (&#x02212;) ES cell line. The targeting vector contains the missing hprt sequences and thus restores hprt functionality and enables subsequent growth of the ES cells in HAT medium. (b) Transfected hprt (&#x02212;) ES cells bearing a functional hprt gene (after successful recombination) were selected for HAT medium and screened by PCR using the primers represented as arrows in panel a. A band of 290 bp indicates the presence of the dn&#x003b2;1 transgene. Twelve out of the twelve HAT<sup>+</sup> clones correctly recombined. (c) Genotyping of transgenic mice was performed by PCR for wild-type (Wt) and dn&#x003b2;1 transgenic alleles (dn&#x003b2;1).

(1996)</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200807010_GS_Fig1"/></fig><p>A second major advantage of using this technology is that single-copy insertion of the transgene into the same place in each line eliminates position and copy number effects, and makes comparison of multiple transgenic lines unnecessary. This has been confirmed by experiments where different mouse lines derived using this strategy from independently targeted ES cell clones expressing the same bcl-2 transgene exhibited comparable levels of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bronson et al., 1996</xref>) and by our own previous studies showing that pairs of transgenic lines expressing different MBP regulatory sequences show similar levels of &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression within each pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farhadi et al., 2003</xref>). Hemizygous and wild-type littermate males of the single line were therefore used as mutant and control mice, respectively, throughout this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Dn&#x003b2;1 mice express the dominant-negative &#x003b2;1 integrin in white matter tracts</title><p>Expression of the dn&#x003b2;1 integrin in the mutant was initially confirmed by RT-PCR. Primers hybridizing to the human IL2R&#x003b1; gene, only present in the inserted dominant-negative construct, showed specific amplification in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>). To visualize the expression of the dn&#x003b2;1 integrin protein in the myelinating tracts, we used immunofluorescence labeling with an anti&#x02013;human IL2R&#x003b1; antibody on transverse sections of optic nerve, sagittal sections of cerebellum, and coronal sections of corpus callosum in wild-type and mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>). The dn&#x003b2;1 integrin was expressed in white matter tracts within these regions in mutant mice, whereas no expression was detected in the wild-type animals. These results confirm that the dn&#x003b2;1 integrin is expressed in transgenic mice at the RNA and protein level in the predicted pattern within myelinating tracts.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Dn&#x003b2;1 mice express the dominant-negative &#x003b2;1 integrin in white matter tracts.</bold> (a) RT-PCR analysis from cortex of 3-mo-old wild-type (Wt) and transgenic mice (dn&#x003b2;1) reveals RNA expression of &#x003b2;1 integrin in both Wt and transgenic mice but dn&#x003b2;1 integrin (IL2R&#x003b1;) only in the mutant.

(c) Dn&#x003b2;1 expression is nervous system specific as confirmed by an RT-PCR analysis on various tissues from P22 mutant mice. IL2R&#x003b1; primers were used for detection of the dn&#x003b2;1 expression (top). Actin primers were used as control (bottom).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200807010_RGB_Fig2"/></fig><p>Next, we tested if this expression was specific to the nervous system. We analyzed RNA from several tissues of the dn&#x003b2;1 mice by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 c</xref>). Transgene expression was found to be restricted to cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, optic nerve, and sciatic nerve and absent from other tissues such as heart, liver, lungs, kidney, muscle, testis, spleen, and stomach. This confirms that, as we would predict from the known expression pattern of the MBP, the dn&#x003b2;1 expression is restricted to the nervous system.</p></sec><sec><title>Integrin signaling is inhibited in the dn&#x003b2;1 mice</title><p>To confirm the efficacy of our strategy, we asked to what extent the dn&#x003b2;1 construct expressed in the transgenic mice inhibited the endogenous &#x003b2;1 integrin. First, we compared the expression levels of the endogenous and the transgenic &#x003b2;1 integrin. In vitro studies have demonstrated that approximately equal expression levels of the IL2R-integrin chimera to the endogenous integrin are sufficient to inhibit integrin-mediated cell spreading and migration, confirming that this level of transgene expression exerts a dominant-negative effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">LaFlamme et al., 1994</xref>). We therefore designed a semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis using two distinct sets of primers, one specific for the endogenous &#x003b2;1 integrin and another for the dn&#x003b2;1 integrin, taking advantage of the differences in their extracellular domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>). To examine whether the levels of &#x003b2;1 integrin inhibition might vary in the different areas of the nervous system, we performed this RT-PCR analysis on several areas of the nervous system. We showed that in all CNS white matter tracts the dn&#x003b2;1 integrin expression levels were equal to or greater than the levels of the mRNA for the endogenous integrin, with significantly higher levels seen in optic nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>). The same expression pattern was observed in four pairs of mice analyzed, with the mean levels of the dn&#x003b2;1 mRNA relative to the wild-type &#x003b2;1 mRNA being 2.22 &#x000b1; 0.37 in optic nerve (P = 0.033), 1.6 &#x000b1; 0.37 in spinal cord, and 1.22 &#x000b1; 0.17 in cerebellum, as compared with 0.92 &#x000b1; 0.10 in cortex.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Integrin signaling is inhibited in the dn&#x003b2;1 mice.</bold> (a) Design of a semi-quantitative RT-PCR using two distinct sets of primers (represented as arrows) binding the extracellular domains of the endogenous (&#x003b2;1) and the transgenic (IL2R) &#x003b2;1 integrins to evaluate their relative expression levels.

A single experiment is shown; quantification of four sets of experiments is presented in the text. (c) Western blot analysis for P-FAK (Y397) shows that integrin downstream signaling is reduced in spinal cord and optic nerve in mutant mice (dn&#x003b2;1) as compared with the levels seen in wild-type mice (Wt).

Activation of FAK via autophosphorylation, on tyrosine 397, occurs after integrin binding to ECM ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schaller et al., 1994</xref>). We showed, by Western blot analysis for P-FAK (Y397), that &#x003b2;1 integrin signaling was significantly reduced (45 &#x000b1; 9.3%, P = 0.018, <italic>n</italic> = 3 pairs of animals) in the optic nerve of P18 dn&#x003b2;1 mice, as compared with wild-type mice of the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 c</xref>).

Additionally, no evidence of a higher frequency of dysmyelinated axons in mutant optic nerve, corpus callosum, or spinal cord was observed.

As in the later stages, no significant differences in the thickness of those myelin sheaths that had formed and appeared fully compacted by this age were detected in the optic nerve (P = 0.65), with average g-ratios for control and mutant mice of 0.79 &#x000b1; 0.007 and 0.80 &#x000b1; 0.016, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, a and b</xref>). Interestingly, however, we noted at this age that wild-type oligodendrocytes were myelinating smaller axons to a larger extent than their dn&#x003b2;1 counterparts. This became apparent in the g-ratio analysis by a reduced population of myelinated axons with small diameters in dn&#x003b2;1 optic nerves as compared with wild-type nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 c</xref>). These very small axons must therefore have been unmyelinated in the dn&#x003b2;1 nerve. We therefore hypothesized that oligodendrocytes with inhibited &#x003b2;1 integrin signaling would require a higher axon diameter to initiate myelination. To address this question, we compared the relationship between axon diameter and the percentage of axons myelinated for wild-type and dn&#x003b2;1 mice. We measured the axon diameter of more than 400 axons from at least three random nonoverlapping photos and scored them as myelinated or unmyelinated. The axon diameters were then subdivided into 0.1-&#x000b5;m intervals and plotted against the percentage of axons that were myelinated within each interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 d</xref>). As some variability was noted between litters, littermate controls were examined in each case. The percentage of myelinated axons across all axon diameter intervals for the dn&#x003b2;1 mutant optic nerves (62.08 &#x000b1; 10.55%, <italic>n</italic> = 2,494 from 3 animals) was lower (P = 0.023) than for their wild-type littermates (66.30 &#x000b1; 10.09%, <italic>n</italic> = 2,506 from 3 animals). This phenotype was most evident in small axons of &#x02264;0.6 &#x000b5;m diameter (P = 0.0085), whereas a similar percentage of myelination was seen in larger axons of &#x0003e;0.6 &#x000b5;m of diameter. In particular, mutant axons of a diameter within the 0.3&#x02013;0.4-&#x000b5;m range showed the most significant reduction in myelination as compared with wild-type controls (P = 0.023). These results therefore show that the threshold diameter required to initiate myelination is increased in the dn&#x003b2;1 optic nerve.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>The axon diameter required to initiate myelination is increased in the dn&#x003b2;1 mice.</bold> (a) Representative electron micrographs show a reduction in the frequency of small myelinated axons in optic nerve sections of P17 dn&#x003b2;1 mutant mice compared with wild-type mice.

This correction resulted from restoration of the ability of the mutant oligodendrocytes to myelinate smaller-diameter axons with age, rather than an overall increase in axon diameter, as evidenced by the higher percentage of axons with a diameter less than 0.5 &#x000b5;m that are myelinated at P28. Thus, at P17 the percentage of axons myelinated of diameters 0.2&#x02013;0.3, 0.3&#x02013;0.4 and 0.4&#x02013;0.5 &#x000b5;m were 1.2, 12.7, and 37.2%, whereas at P28 the percentages were 6.1, 51.4, and 83.6%, respectively.</p><p>As an alternative method to demonstrate the increased threshold diameter required to initiate myelination in the dn&#x003b2;1 mice, we compared the frequency distribution of the diameters of all myelinated and total axons (irrespective of myelination status) between wild-type and dn&#x003b2;1 mutants in P17 optic nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 e</xref>).

To test this we examined P16&#x02013;P21 optic nerves from mice in which FAK had been deleted in myelinating glial cells by crossing mice homozygous for a floxed FAK allele with a Cnp-Cre line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grove et al., 2007</xref>). As discussed above, FAK is a key part of the integrin signaling pathway, binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain and being activated by phosphorylation after integrin ligand binding, and loss of FAK activity in oligodendrocytes has very recently been shown to result in hypomyelination in the developing mouse optic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forrest et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly to the dn&#x003b2;1 mice, we found that an increased threshold diameter was required for myelination at this age, as evidenced by a reduced percentage of myelinated axons in knockout (57.37 &#x000b1; 10.38%, <italic>n</italic> = 2,186 from 4 animals) compared with wild-type (64.93 &#x000b1; 10.70%, <italic>n</italic> = 2,560 from 4 animals) optic nerves of P16&#x02013;P21 animals (P = 0.0087; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), whereas there was no difference in the percentage of myelinated axons in adult (P60) nerves (Fig. S3).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>A greater threshold for myelination is also seen in FAK-deficient mice.</bold> (Left) Representative electron micrographs show a reduction in the frequency of small myelinated axons in optic nerve sections of P16-P21 FAK knockout mice compared with wild-type mice.

First, an intrinsic abnormality of the oligodendrocyte such that it cannot respond appropriately to the axoglial signal proportional to axon diameter that is required to initiate myelination. As a result, the smallest axons no longer generate a signal within the oligodendrocyte of sufficient strength to trigger myelination. Second, a reduction in oligodendrocyte numbers such that there are no longer sufficient cells to myelinate all available axons. In this last situation, it would be expected that those axons myelinated last during development, i.e., the smallest-diameter axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Remahl and Hildebrand, 1982</xref>), would be myelinated late or not at all during development in the mutant mouse. The former mechanism represents an intrinsic defect in the oligodendrocyte, whereas the latter is an extrinsic effect secondary to a reduction in cell numbers.</p><p>To discern which mechanism is responsible for our observations, we performed co-culture experiments in which oligodendrocytes are provided in considerable excess (thus eliminating any extrinsic effects of cell number variation) and examined myelination by oligodendrocytes derived from wild-type or dn&#x003b2;1 mice. These oligodendrocytes were cultured in the presence of wild-type dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and their myelination efficiency was evaluated as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) by determining the percentage of oligodendrocytes forming myelin. Although not the normal target of CNS oligodendrocytes, axons formed by DRG neurones grown in culture have a range of diameters of less than 2 &#x000b5;m (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807010/DC1">Fig. S4 a</ext-link>), similar to those in the optic nerve studied here, and are myelinated by oligodendrocytes added to these cultures. They therefore provide an appropriate test of the intrinsic myelinogenic capacity of the oligodendrocyte. We found that dn&#x003b2;1 oligodendrocytes myelinated DRG axons significantly less efficiently (P &#x0003c; 0.01) than wild-type oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). To show any intrinsic defect more clearly, we then asked whether each dn&#x003b2;1 oligodendrocyte myelinated a reduced number of internodes and/or internodes with reduced length. We therefore quantified for each individual cell the number and average length of internodes in a total of 50 wild-type and dn&#x003b2;1 oligodendrocytes in co-culture. Dn&#x003b2;1 oligodendrocytes showed a reduced number of internodes (37 &#x000b1; 2) when compared with wild-type (50 &#x000b1; 5) oligodendrocytes (P &#x0003c; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 5). This difference was not due either to a reduced neurite density or perturbed oligodendrocyte differentiation in the dn&#x003b2;1 cultures, as these were similar in the cultures of all three genotypes (Fig. S4 b). By contrast, no difference was found between the average internodal length per oligodendrocyte from the two genotypes (Fig. S4 c, wild-type: 45.8 &#x000b1; 0.9 &#x000b5;m; dn&#x003b2;1: 44.2 &#x000b1; 0.8 &#x000b5;m, <italic>n</italic> = 5) or in the number of primary processes generated by each oligodendrocyte (wild-type: 4.12 &#x000b1; 0.10, <italic>n</italic> = 74 from 4 experiments; dn&#x003b2;1: 4.25 &#x000b1; 0.12, <italic>n</italic> = 79 from 4 experiments).

The same hprt targeting method was used to generate the dn&#x003b2;3 transgenic mice, thus creating single-copy insertion into exactly the same locus as with the dn&#x003b2;1 mice. This ensures comparable expression of the two coding sequences, as confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis showing the distribution and expression pattern of the dn&#x003b2;3 protein to be the same as that previously seen for dn&#x003b2;1 protein (Fig. S5). Hemizygous and wild-type male littermate mice were generated and compared with the dn&#x003b2;1 mice.

The first would be based on the observation that in the PNS an axonal signal proportional to the diameter and above a certain threshold is required to initiate myelination by the contacting glial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taveggia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nave and Salzer, 2006</xref>). If there is a reduction in the glial response to the axonal signal due to perturbation of integrins, then the prediction would be that the signal on the small axons will not be detected as above the required level and a reduced percentage of myelination of these small-diameter axons will be observed. In contrast, the large axons could either provide a signal that is in excess of the threshold level or express an additional signaling molecule that initiates myelination without any requirement for integrin function, and thus would not be affected by integrin perturbation. In the second mechanism, small-diameter axons could be preferentially affected by the reduction in &#x003b2;1 integrin signaling as a result of a compromised ability of the oligodendrocyte to change their morphology and generate multiple processes for myelination. It has been shown that toad oligodendrocytes myelinating small axons extend more processes than those myelinating large axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stensaas and Stensaas, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hildebrand et al., 1993</xref>). Additionally, oligodendrocytes in rat white matter areas constituted of small axons possess more branches than those in areas with both large and small axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matthews and Duncan, 1971</xref>). A reduction in &#x003b2;1 integrin signaling that compromises process outgrowth via the established role of this receptor in cytoskeletal reorganization would therefore be expected to reveal a phenotype in those tracts where more processes are required, i.e., those with small-diameter axons. In agreement with this, knockout mice for the regulator of the actin cytoskeleton WAVE1 exhibited a reduced number of myelinated axons in the optic nerve and corpus callosum, with WAVE1 knockout oligodendrocytes showing a reduced number of processes in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Models for the failure in myelination of small-diameter axons resulting from perturbed &#x003b2;1 integrin signaling.</bold> (a) The oligodendrocyte initially extends processes to reach large and small axons and then initiates myelination. Large axons are myelinated earlier than small axons. (b) Model I: an axonal signal proportional to the diameter and above a certain threshold is required to initiate myelination by the contacting glial cell. Due to the expression of dn&#x003b2;1 integrin there is a reduction in the glial signaling in response to this signal, such that the signal initiated by some small axons will now not be above the required (threshold) level for myelination. By contrast, the large axons provide a signal that is significantly in excess of the threshold level and/or additional signals, and thus will not be affected by perturbation of integrin signaling. (c) Model II: myelinating tracts rich in small-diameter axons require more oligodendrocyte processes than those tracts rich in large axons. Small axons are, therefore, particularly susceptible to any failure of the oligodendrocyte to generate multiple processes for myelination, as might occur after perturbation of integrin signaling, leading to an impaired ability of the cell to reorganize the cytoskeleton. See text for a discussion of the evidence for and against the two models.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200807010R_RGB_Fig10"/></fig><p>Three observations argue against the latter mechanism&#x02014;perturbation of cytoskeletal function as the cause of the phenotype in the dn&#x003b2;1 mice. First, although the number of internodes myelinated by each dn&#x003b2;1 oligodendrocyte in the myelinating cocultures is reduced, the length of internodes is unaltered, with the majority of internodes myelinated by wild-type, dn&#x003b2;1, and dn&#x003b2;3 oligodendrocytes distributed between 27 and 40 &#x000b5;m as recently reported for cortical oligodendrocytes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murtie et al., 2007</xref>; Fig. S4 c). A compromised ability of the oligodendrocyte to extend processes would be expected both to reduce the number of internodes and to shorten internodal length, as this latter measurement must reflect process extension along the axon once contact has been established. Second, the similar g-ratios seen in the P17 optic nerve of wild-type and dn&#x003b2;1 mice show that the cytoskeletal reorganization required for myelin sheath compaction is not affected by inhibition of integrin signaling. Third, the number of primary processes is not significantly different between wild-type, dn&#x003b2;1, and dn&#x003b2;3 oligodendrocytes in premyelinating co-cultures. Dn&#x003b2;1 oligodendrocytes are, therefore, able to extend processes normally, as evidenced by their number of primary processes and internodal length, but then myelinate less efficiently with fewer internodes.</p><p>The conclusion that oligodendrocyte integrins form part of the recognition complex for axonal signals that determine whether or not myelination occurs is important, as the identity of such axonal signals in the CNS is unknown. In the PNS, the level of axonal type III Nrg1 has been shown to play a crucial role in determining both whether an axon is myelinated and in the regulation of myelin thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michailov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taveggia et al., 2005</xref>). We have shown that laminin-binding integrins amplify neuregulin signaling as part of the mechanisms that regulate target-dependent survival of newly formed oligodendrocytes in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colognato et al., 2002</xref>). Our results here would therefore be consistent with a model in which axonal neuregulins in the CNS, recognized by oligodendrocyte ErbB receptors, generate a signal to initiate myelination that is further amplified by integrins. In the case of small-diameter axons, this amplification is essential for triggering myelination, whereas large-diameter axons generate sufficient signal without integrin amplification. However, the role of neuregulins in CNS myelination has not been resolved. Exogenous addition of Nrg1 promotes myelination in co-cultures of oligodendrocytes and DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) and myelination of type III Nrg1-deficient DRG neurons is significantly reduced in co-culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taveggia et al., 2008</xref>). Hypomyelination is seen in transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative ErbB receptor in oligodendrocytes, and in mice haploinsufficient for type III Nrg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taveggia et al., 2008</xref>). However, in contrast to the PNS, increased expression of this axonal signal does not promote myelination of very small, and normally unmyelinated, axons in co-cultures of superior cervical ganglion neurons and oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taveggia et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, conditional mutants with ablation of Nrg1, ErbB3, or ErbB4 exhibit no cortical myelination abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brinkmann et al., 2008</xref>), a result that rather compellingly argues against a necessary role for Nrg1 signaling in CNS myelination. Additional neuregulin isoforms may be important in the CNS but equally, and in contrast to the PNS, other axonal signals may be required for regulating myelination. These may also be amplified by integrins, as seen for a number of different growth factors in other cell types. The hypothesis that such multi-component signaling complexes initiate and regulate myelination by oligodendrocytes provides a mechanism to explain the &#x0201c;catch-up&#x0201d; by the mutant oligodendrocytes in the older animals, as compensatory interactions within the complex will facilitate restoration of normal axoglial interactions.</p><p>Interestingly, both in monkeys and humans the area of the CNS most prone to remyelination failure is the optic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lachapelle et al., 2005</xref>). A model in which amplification of a myelination signal is required for small- but not large-diameter axon myelination could explain both the vulnerability of the optic nerve and the regional selectivity of the phenotype seen in the dn&#x003b2;1 mouse, as the optic nerve contains entirely small-diameter axons. Similar regional differences in myelination are observed in other mutants that perturb integrin signaling, such as the Fyn knockout and the laminin-2&#x02013;deficient (dy/dy) mouse. In these mice myelination defects are seen in optic nerve but not in spinal cord, where the density of larger axons is higher. Another possibility to explain regional heterogeneity, intrinsic differences in the oligodendrocytes arising from different regions of the developing CNS, seems less likely given that ablation of one such population is followed by replacement from a different region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, transplantation of oligodendrocytes from optic nerve into spinal cord reveals that the transplanted cells can myelinate the full range of axon diameters in their new environment, even though these diameters are much greater than those present in their original location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanarraga et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Although the two previous studies examining the role of &#x003b2;1 integrins in regulating CNS myelination appear contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benninger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), the current study allows their reconciliation. Here we have concluded that inhibition of integrins perturbs axoglial signaling and delays myelination of small-diameter axons, but has no effect on the subsequent formation of the myelin sheath. This conclusion is consistent with our previous report on the absence of g-ratio disturbances in the oligodendrocyte-specific conditional &#x003b2;1 knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benninger et al., 2006</xref>), where the analysis focused on myelin sheath thickness in older animals. Hypomyelination after expression of &#x003b2;1&#x00394;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2006</xref>) can be explained by a requirement for dystroglycan in sheath formation. As noted in the introduction, the &#x003b2;1&#x00394;C integrin extracellular domain will form heterodimers with integrin-&#x003b1; subunits and thus compete for ligand with other oligodendroglial laminin receptors. One of these is dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colognato et al., 2007</xref>), for which the main binding site on laminin overlaps with that of integrins at the laminin G domains LG1-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Talts et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wizemann et al., 2003</xref>). We have shown that dystroglycan is a significant laminin receptor for CNS myelination in vitro, and transgenic studies reveal an essential role in PNS myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saito et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Occhi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colognato et al., 2007</xref>). We propose, therefore, that the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al. (2006)</xref> expressing &#x003b2;1&#x00394;C reveals a requirement for dystroglycan in later stages of myelin sheath formation in addition to the role of integrins in the earlier stages of initiation. Our present and previous studies, by contrast, specifically target integrin signaling and would thus not reveal any later role of other laminin receptors.</p><p>The identification of the signals regulating the initiation of myelination may lead to the development of strategies to promote effective remyelination by oligodendrocytes within MS lesions arrested at the premyelinating stage and therefore unable to contribute to repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2002</xref>). Further studies examining the partners and ligands of the integrins expressed on oligodendrocytes represent promising new approaches toward understanding this goal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cloning and dn&#x003b2;1/dn&#x003b2;3 ES cell generation</title><p>For the generation of the genetically modified embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing the dn&#x003b2;1/dn&#x003b2;3 integrin we used the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) targeting system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farhadi et al., 2003</xref>).
