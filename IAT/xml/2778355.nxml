The ring is stabilized by a number of proteins among which the widely conserved ZapA protein. Using antibodies against ZapA, we found surprisingly that the cellular concentration of ZapA is approximately equal to that of FtsZ. This raised the question of how the cell can prevent their interaction and thereby the premature stabilization of FtsZ protofilaments in nondividing cells. Therefore, we studied the FtsZ&#x02212;ZapA interaction at the physiological pH of 7.5 instead of pH 6.5 (the optimal pH for FtsZ polymerization), under conditions that stimulate protofilament formation (5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and under conditions that stimulate and stabilize protofilaments (10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Using pelleting, light scattering, and GTPase assays, it was found that stabilization and bundling of FtsZ polymers by ZapA was inversely correlated to the GTPase activity of FtsZ. As GTP hydrolysis is the rate-limiting factor for depolymerization of FtsZ, we propose that ZapA will only enhance the cooperativity of polymer association during the transition from helical filament to mid cell ring and will not stabilize the short single protofilaments in the cytoplasm. All thus far published <italic>in vitro</italic> data on the interaction between FtsZ and ZapA have been obtained with His-ZapA. We found that in our case the presence of a His tag fused to ZapA prevented the protein to complement a <italic>&#x00394;zapA</italic> strain <italic>in vivo</italic> and that it affected the interaction between FtsZ and ZapA <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi901461p</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2009-01461p</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value>40.75</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fs1" fn-type="funding-statement"><label>&#x02020;</label><p>This work was supported by a Vernieuwingsimpuls grant from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) (016.001.024; T.d.B. and G.E.J.P.) and Grant BIO2008-04478-C03-03 COMBACT_CM S-BIO-0260/2006 (G.R.).

In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> this universally conserved tubulin homologue is able to polymerize into a ring-like structure (known as the Z-ring) at the impending site of division. This cytoskeletal element is not only crucial for bacterial cell division but is also required for assembly of other constituents of the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). The ring-like structure is highly dynamic and tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). A number of proteins are involved in the regulation and stability of the Z-ring at mid cell. These regulators are expected to affect the transition from assembly to disassembly and vice versa of the Z-ring. The FtsZ level of 5 &#x003bc;M in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) is sufficient to promote polymerization as the critical concentration for FtsZ polymerization is in the order of 2 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). To avoid the production of mini cells due to polar constrictions, the Min system inhibits FtsZ polymerization near the cell poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), and the nucleoid occlusion (Noc) protein SlmA, which is associated with the bacterial chromosome, inhibits FtsZ polymerization in the vicinity of the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). As a result FtsZ can only polymerize at mid cell where a local DNA minimum is realized due to segregation of the nucleoids. ZipA, FtsA, and the widely conserved Z-ring associated protein ZapA are reported to stabilize the Z-ring during its formation.</p><p>FtsZ is able to bind and hydrolyze GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), and its polymerization has been extensively studied in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Assembly of FtsZ into polymers is dependent on GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Association of two FtsZ monomers induces hydrolysis of the interface-bound GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), which is followed by a release of the phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). The remaining GDP-bound FtsZ favors depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Depending on experimental conditions, FtsZ can form a variety of polymeric structures. Alterations in concentrations of, for example, FtsZ, GTP, KCl, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> can affect the polymerization process and result in distinct morphologies of the polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Particularly, Mg<sup>2+</sup> is required for the hydrolysis of GTP as it binds the &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-phosphate. At Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels between 1 and 5 mM the GTPase activity of FtsZ was demonstrated to be enhanced, resulting in the formation of protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Above 5 mM (e.g., 10 mM) Mg<sup>2+</sup> the GTPase activity is reduced, and the filaments are more stable, which results often in enhanced lateral association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>) and Figures 6 and 8 of this report. Other divalent cations such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DEAE-dextran are not required for assembly but induced lateral associations of protofilaments in very large bundles.</p><p>Up to now, most studies reported on the effect of <italic>E. coli</italic> ZapA (12.594 kDa) on FtsZ polymerization were carried out at the nonphysiological pH of 6.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) as this is the more optimal pH for FtsZ polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Under these conditions His-ZapA strongly promotes the bundling of FtsZ and prevents the disassembly of these bundles on a time scale that surpasses the duration of a bacterial cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). This seems to be in conflict with the very dynamic nature of the Z-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Therefore, we determined the stoichiometry of FtsZ and ZapA <italic>in vivo</italic> and the interaction with FtsZ <italic>in vitro</italic> at pH 7.5 and 6.5 and discovered that the His tag had a substantial effect, questioning previous studies done without removing the His tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Materials and Strains</title><p>Purified proteins were dialyzed against the buffers used in the experiments.

The cultures were then grown for another 2 h after which the cells were harvested by centrifugation.

After washing three times with 10 mL of binding buffer and one time with buffer containing 100 mM imidazole, 6His-ZapA was eluted in 5 times 5 mL elution buffer (20 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol). The eluted fractions were pooled, and the protein concentration was determined using a protein determination kit (micro BCA kit; Pierce) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.

Complete digestion of ZapA and removal of unwanted protein parts was confirmed by SDS&#x02212;PAGE, and the concentration of the protein was determined by BCA or by Quant-iT assay (Invitrogen).

The ZapA concentration in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> was estimated to be about 5% of the FtsZ concentration in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). Given the large difference in DivIB (FtsQ) function and concentration in <italic>B. subitilis</italic> compared to <italic>E. coli</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>), we decided to determine the ZapA concentration in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Although the number of FtsZ molecules per cell is well-known, the average number of FtsZ molecules per cell was determined as well to have an internal control for the reliability of our quantification method. In addition, we would be able to directly compare the cellular ZapA concentration with that of FtsZ in cells grown under identical conditions. To this purpose, LMC500 cells were grown to steady state in GB1 at 28 &#x000b0;C. A cell lysate and a purified ZapA concentration range (1&#x02212;4 ng) were applied in duplicate on SDS&#x02212;PAGE and subsequently blotted on nitrocellulose (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the case of FtsZ, a 10&#x02212;100 ng range of purified FtsZ was used as a standard (data not shown). The protein bands were visualized using affinity-purified antibodies against ZapA or FtsZ, and their intensities were determined by chemiluminescence density analysis. By comparing the total signal of the ZapA or FtsZ bands from the cell lysate to that of the standards, the average number of ZapA molecules was calculated to be 6100 &#x000b1; 1000 per average cell (which equals 5.38 &#x003bc;M or 67.76 &#x003bc;g/mL) as deduced from the average of three separate experiments. This is clearly different from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ZapA for which the number of molecules per cell was estimated to be 250 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>).

The number of FtsZ molecules per average <italic>E. coli</italic> cell was 4800 &#x000b1; 1300 as was determined from three separate experiments (results not shown). This is in agreement with the earlier published values for FtsZ of 5000 molecules per cell under comparable growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>), 3200 molecules per cell in <italic>E. coli</italic> B/r (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), and 5000 molecules per cell found in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>).

Much higher concentrations were required to obtain similar results with the His-ZapA of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Because ZapA is a rather small protein of molecular mass 12500 Da, the addition of six histidine residues and the enterokinase recognition site of four aspartic acids, a lysine, and an alanine could affect the tetramerization and function of ZapA. Therefore, we first established whether the protein still behaved as wild-type protein <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. To this end we determined the oligomeric state of His-ZapA by sedimentation velocity and composition-gradient static light scattering (CG-SLS). We analyzed the sedimentation velocity profiles in terms of distribution of sedimentation coefficients, allowing an evaluation of protein homogeneity and self-association.

We observed that the major species (&#x0003e;95%) sediment with a standard <italic>s</italic>-value of 3.4 &#x000b1; 0.2 S. The sedimentation velocity of the protein did not change upon increasing the salt concentration to 0.5 M KCl or by chelating the magnesium with EDTA (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Based on the <italic>c</italic>(M) distribution (insert in Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A), the molecular mass of His-ZapA was estimated to be 55 &#x000b1; 0.5 kDa, which is compatible with the expected mass of the protein tetramer (molecular weight of the His-ZapA monomer is 14273). To further measure the molecular mass of the 3.4 S protein species, we carried out in parallel composition-gradient static light scattering experiments. The normalized scattering intensity of His-ZapA in buffer, pH 7.5, with 0.5 M KCl and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> is plotted as a function of protein concentration in Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B.

The surprisingly high concentration of ZapA in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, given the reported 250 molecules of ZapA in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>), made us wonder how <italic>E. coli</italic> can prevent ZapA to prematurely stabilize and bundle FtsZ polymers in the cytosol before they are needed to assemble the Z-ring. Recently, it was shown that ZapA is able to prevent the FtsZ polymerization inhibitory activity of MinC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). Thus, MinC might prevent the stabilization of FtsZ polymers by ZapA. However, ZapA is present throughout the cytosol, whereas the Min system is thought to be predominantly functional in the cell poles. Therefore, additional mechanisms might be needed to prevent premature interaction between ZapA and FtsZ. To understand how ZapA might interact with FtsZ in nondividing cells and with the Z-ring in dividing cells, we performed the experiments at the physiological pH of 7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). To check for consistency with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) the experiments were also performed at pH 6.5. In addition, it was attempted to assay their interaction under conditions that do not stimulate bundling (to mimic predivision conditions) and conditions under which FtsZ filaments were already somewhat stabilized (to mimic Z-ring formation). The first condition was assessed by measuring polymerization in the presence of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup>.

In contrast, in the presence of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at pH 7.5, ZapA did not pellet FtsZ (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A), whereas at pH 6.5 FtsZ was still pelleted by ZapA albeit less efficiently (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B).

The ability of ZapA to pellet FtsZ was most markedly stimulated by 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. (See for the behavior of His-ZapA <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref> Figure S2.)

No increase in light scattering signal was seen when either 1 mM GDP replaced GTP or no guanosines were employed as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). A light scattering signal increase was also absent when ZapA was assayed in the absence of FtsZ (<xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref> Figure S3). With 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and in the presence of a substoichiometric to stoichiometric ZapA concentration, the light scattering signal showed a small increase (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref> Figure S4; see for His-ZapA data <xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref> Figure S5). This might indicate that ZapA binds to protofilaments and causes an augmentation in the amount of scattered light due to the increased thickness of the filaments or due to a change in the length of the filaments (see EM data below). In the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> the light scattering signal increased much more (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). At pH 7.5 the polymers started to depolymerize within the time course of the experiment (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). However, at pH 6.5 the light scattering signal was completely stable within the time span of the experiment (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). To verify that the FtsZ polymers were able to depolymerize at pH 6.5 in the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, the experiment was repeated with 0.03 mM GTP instead of 0.2 mM GTP as was used in the above experiments. Under these conditions depolymerization of FtsZ occurred within the time span of the experiment (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which meant that with a molar ratio of FtsZ to GTP of 1:3 a considerable amount of polymers was still formed in the presence of ZapA. FtsZ polymers are normally very transient in the absence of an excess of GTP because of the high rate of GTP turnover by FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). These results suggested, therefore, that ZapA considerably stabilized the polymers by decreasing the GTPase activity of FtsZ or by simply cross-linking the polymers (see below).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Light scattering analysis shows that ZapA stimulates FtsZ polymer bundling in the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> but not in the presence of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

A fluorescent molecule 7-methylguanosine that is converted to a nonfluorescent molecule by purine nucleoside phosphorylase was used to monitor the phosphate release due to the GTP hydrolyzing activity of FtsZ. First, the GTPase activity of 8.3 &#x003bc;M FtsZ in the absence of ZapA was measured under the four conditions used: pH 6.5, pH 7.5, and 5 or 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The lowering of the pH gave a small decrease in the GTPase activity of FtsZ, whereas the addition of 10 mM instead of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> caused a decrease in GTPase activity of 30% (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Subsequently, the GTPase activity of 8.3 &#x003bc;M FtsZ was measured using the same four buffer conditions in the presence of ZapA or His-ZapA (<xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref> Figure S7) in concentrations ranging from 1 to 8.3 &#x003bc;M. The resulting GTPase activities are plotted as a percentage of the FtsZ GTPase activity in the absence of ZapA (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Overall, it seems that up to a stoichiometric concentration of 8.3 &#x003bc;M, ZapA had little effect on the GTPase activity of FtsZ in the presence of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, confirming its lack of effect on the polymers in general under these conditions. In the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> the GTPase activity was slightly inhibited up to 20% at the highest ZapA concentration used. It should be noted that FtsZ polymers are already stabilized at much lower ZapA concentration in the light scattering experiments (not shown) and pelleting experiments (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) in the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

Lateral association of FtsZ protofilaments is known to decrease the GTPase activity of FtsZ, which consequently stabilizes the bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). The weak effect of ZapA on the GTPase activity of FtsZ in combination with its strong stabilizing effect suggests that ZapA does not actively reduce the GTPase activity of FtsZ and that the observed mild decrease in GTPase activity might be just the consequence of the lateral association of FtsZ protofilaments.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>GTPase activity of 8.3 &#x003bc;M FtsZ in HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 (black), or MES buffer, pH 6.5 (gray), in the presence of 5 or 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> as indicated.

In contrast, the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and its accompanying reduced GTPase activity of FtsZ might stimulate bundling of protofilaments. This would provide a binding site for which ZapA could have a much higher affinity. To verify this hypothesis, the morphology of the filaments was studied by electron microscopy (EM) using the same experimental conditions as described for the light scattering and GTPase activity measurements. Samples were applied on an EM grid 15 s after addition of GTP that initiated the polymerization reaction in HEPES, pH 7.5, buffer.

If the tetrameric ZapA (MW 50 kDa) would bind to the FtsZ (45 kDa) protofilaments, one would expect the filaments in the presence of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> to become slightly thicker because of the added mass. However, this is not observed. In the absence of FtsZ, it was not possible to see recognizable ZapA structures on the grids. Therefore, the EM images are not conclusive as to whether ZapA binds to the filaments in the presence of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Occasionally, about four adjacent filaments similar to those observed in the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> were seen, suggesting that ZapA is in principle able to promote bundling at the lower MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration. The His-ZapA induced arrays of parallel running filaments in the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> with an interfilament distance of 24.8 &#x000b1; 4.7 nm, <italic>n</italic> = 88. Interestingly, the filaments bundled by ZapA were almost always double protofilaments (thickness 10.5 &#x000b1; 3.1 nm, <italic>n</italic> = 79), whereas the His-ZapA bundled single protofilaments (thickness 6.5 &#x000b1; 1.7 nm, <italic>n</italic> = 85) as if the His-ZapA tetramer lacked two binding sites (Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). In conclusion, ZapA seems to arrange double FtsZ protofilaments in a precise conformation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Electron microscopy images of uranyl acetate stained FtsZ filaments in the absence and presence of ZapA in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mM KCl buffer at 30 &#x000b0;C.

We found that the concentration of the ZapA protein in minimal medium grown bacteria was approximately identical to that of FtsZ (i.e., 5 &#x003bc;M). We could not reconcile this high ZapA concentration in the cell with the published <italic>in vitro</italic> data showing the strong and persistent promotion of FtsZ bundling by ZapA. <italic>In vivo</italic>, FtsZ is always present in the cell at a concentration sufficiently high to polymerize, but the small polymers are continuously depolymerized due to the inhibitory activities of the Min system and the nucleoid occlusion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). One would expect ZapA to stabilize these small emerging protofilaments and cause FtsZ to form large precipitates in the cell. This is not what generally is reported in FtsZ localization studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>). To find out how ZapA discriminates in the cell, which protofilaments should be stabilized, we tried to mimic two conditions. One condition would result in predominantly protofilaments (5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup>) that would resemble small cytosolic FtsZ filaments in nondividing cells. The second condition would mimic the assemblage of the Z-ring by modestly inhibiting the GTPase activity of FtsZ causing the protofilaments to be more stable and often associate (10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></sup>). We decided to study the interaction between ZapA and FtsZ at pH 7.5 because this reflects the pH of the cytosol more closely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>) than pH 6.5, which is more optimal for FtsZ polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>The His-ZapA Is Not Functional <italic>in Vivo</italic></title><p>The His-ZapA appeared not to be functional, as it could not restore the filamentous phenotype of our ZapA deletion strain to normal rod shape whereas expression of ZapA could. In addition, the His tag protein did not pellet FtsZ stochiometrically in the pelleting assay and behaved differently from ZapA in all <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Therefore, the His tag was removed by enterokinase digestion for all experiments apart from studies on the oligomeric state of ZapA.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Effect of Buffer Composition on the <italic>in Vitro</italic> Interaction of ZapA and FtsZ</title><p>The interaction between FtsZ and ZapA was studied by pelleting, light scattering, and GTPase activity assays. Significant differences in polymer behavior between pH 7.5 and pH 6.5 as well as with the two concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> were found.</p><p>In all experiments up to stoichiometric concentrations of ZapA had little effect on the polymerization of FtsZ in the presence of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> either at pH 6.5 or at pH 7.5. Under these conditions, FtsZ forms short filaments that are not laterally associated. This suggests that ZapA can only stabilize FtsZ filaments that are already somewhat associated. This is illustrated by the ability of ZapA to bundle FtsZ in the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, which itself stimulates lateral association of FtsZ filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>). The stoichiometry of the interaction appears to be 1:1 as was found for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> His-ZapA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> His-ZapA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). The His-ZapA of Small et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) pelleted FtsZ in a 1:2 stoichiometry, and our His-ZapA did not pellet FtsZ in a fixed ratio (<xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref> Figure S2), suggesting that the His tag in the case of <italic>E. coli</italic> ZapA is more of a hindrance than in the other two organisms.</p><p>The presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> did reduce the GTPase activity of FtsZ by 30%, causing an increase in the length of the FtsZ polymers but not in the amount of filaments bundling as judged from the electron microscopy images of polymers sampled after 15 s. As the bundling is cooperative, longer incubation times result in more bundling in the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> compared to 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> as published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>). The subsequent addition of ZapA did not affect the GTPase activity of FtsZ particularly but caused a considerable change in the morphology of the bundles, which appeared to consist of very orderly parallel-aligned filaments separated by a constant space of 22 nm. Remarkably at pH 7.5, this stabilizing effect was transient whereas at pH 6.5 the stabilization lasted at least 30 min before the light scattering signal began to decrease again. A reduction in the ZapA concentration to 2 &#x003bc;M and the GTP concentration to 30 &#x003bc;M (approximately 1 FtsZ molecule to 3 GTP molecules) was required to observe depolymerization in the time span of the experiment (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). As the Z-ring is reported to be completely renewed every 18 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), the extreme stabilization of FtsZ polymers at pH 6.5 cannot reflect, in our opinion, the endogenous situation. Theoretically, ZapA possesses the same charge at pH 6.5 as at pH 7.5, whereas FtsZ has a charge of &#x02212;18 at pH 6.5 and of &#x02212;20 at pH 7.5. Overall, this seems to be a small difference, but locally two extra charges can affect the interaction between two proteins. However, it is the GTPase activity that is decreased by the lower pH and by the higher MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Because the GTPase activity is the limiting factor in polymer turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), the polymers are more stable at pH 6.5 and at 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. For the cross-linking of FtsZ protofilaments, ZapA has to bind multiple FtsZ monomers, which makes it plausible that FtsZ polymer stability affects the ZapA binding ability. We could not reproduce the 100% inhibition of the GTPase activity of FtsZ by His-ZapA as published by Small et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). At a 1:1 His-ZapA concentration we find about 40% inhibition (<xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref> Figure S6). The differences between our data and the data of Small are most likely due to a difference in the His-tagged version of ZapA.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>Morphology of the ZapA-Stabilized FtsZ Filaments</title><p>On the basis of the crystal structure of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ZapA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) it was anticipated that the amino-terminal His tag was unlikely to interfere with the tetrameric state of ZapA as the carboxy termini are the responsible parts for tetramerization (<xref rid="notes-1">Supporting Information</xref> Figure S7). Using analytical ultracentrifugation and static light scattering, we found that His-ZapA is predominantly a tetramer irrespective of salt levels, pH, or magnesium concentration. The published <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 320 nM for His-ZapA determined in MES buffer, pH 6.5, and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> by Small et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) and the fact that association of proteins is favored by the macromolecular crowding in the cytoplasm strongly suggest that at the cytosolic concentration of 5 &#x003bc;M all ZapA molecules will be part of a tetramer. The length of the unhydrated tetrameric ZapA molecule, as derived from its crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), is approximately 10 nm, whereas the distance from the middle of a double FtsZ filament to the next parallel double filament in Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>A is 22 &#x000b1; 4 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 110). If a ZapA tetramer would bind in between them (Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>A), the distance to be covered would be 11.5 nm (Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>A) and more or less correspond to the length of a ZapA tetramer, which could differ somewhat between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ZapA. The width of the parallel double FtsZ filaments is about 10.5 &#x000b1; 3 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 79). Possibly, a ZapA tetramer is also able to bind on top of a double FtsZ filament. Although electron microscopic tomography images show FtsZ filaments as scattered arcs in a <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>), a configuration in which FtsZ filaments should be kept segregated by ZapA tetramers seems to be in conflict with the not very essential nature of ZapA. Therefore, the binding in between filaments should more likely have a function in bringing the filaments together, which is supported by the following observations.</p><p>The GTPase activity of FtsZ is determined by the pH of the buffer and to a much larger extent by the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>)). A high GTPase activity results in shorter protofilaments than a lower GTPase activity because GTP hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step in polymer depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Because of the cooperative nature of the polymerization and of the lateral association of protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>), the protofilaments will more readily bundle at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.5 and still more in the case of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> compared to 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Based on the results of the <italic>in vitro</italic> assays presented in Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the magnitude of the FtsZ&#x02212;ZapA interaction follows the same trend while ZapA affects the GTPase activity of FtsZ itself marginally (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This suggests that the presence of lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers stimulates the binding of ZapA and most likely is a requirement for the interaction of ZapA with FtsZ. In the EM images that were collected after 15 s of polymerization (Figures <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) but also in images obtained after incubation for 30 s or for 5 min (not shown) regular arrays of parallel double FtsZ filaments separated by a fixed width are observed. We speculate that by binding in between the protofilaments ZapA enhances their chance to associate. As the association is cooperative, the filaments will become more stable when they are annealed over a particular length of the filaments making continued action of ZapA superfluous.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><title>ZapA&#x02212;FtsZ Interaction <italic>in Vivo</italic></title><p>The MinC protein of the Min system that prevents polar Z-ring formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) has been reported to prevent lateral association of FtsZ filaments and possibly to compete with ZapA for the same binding site on FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). ZapA requires two adjacent FtsZ filaments to stimulate their lateral association, whereas MinC needs only one filament to prevent association. This putative higher affinity of MinC for small protofilaments could prevent ZapA from effectively binding and associating FtsZ polymers near the cell poles. The SlmA protein inhibits Z-ring formation in the vicinity of the nucleoid by a presently unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>).</p><p>We propose the following model for the interaction of ZapA with FtsZ during the cell cycle (Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). In nondividing cells the MinC and SlmA activity that negatively regulate polymerization of FtsZ prevent the growth of the FtsZ polymers to a length sufficient to laterally associate. ZapA is not able to bundle single protofilaments, and therefore no FtsZ ring can be initiated despite the presence of ZapA and FtsZ at stoichiometric concentrations. At a specific cell length the MinC and SlmA activity is too low to prevent FtsZ polymers from becoming of sufficient length, and with the help of FtsA and ZipA a helical arrangement of FtsZ polymers is formed underneath the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>). Especially under conditions of fast growth when less time is available to depend on lateral association by chance only, ZapA will be beneficial to the survival of the cells by bringing the helical FtsZ filaments together and thus assist in the timely formation of the Z-ring. As a result only &#x00394;<italic>zapA</italic> cells grown in rich medium have a phenotype. Once the Z-ring is established, ZapA binds to the ring where it has perhaps a weak structural function in the assembly of the divisome.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Hypothetical model for the interaction between ZapA and FtsZ. From top to bottom: In young cells FtsZ (red and blue) forms continuously short filaments that are destabilized by the Min and nucleoid occlusion systems. At the appropriate length to initiate cell division the inhibition of MinC, which functions predominantly at the cell poles, and of the partly segregated nucleoids is not sufficient any more, and the filaments will become longer, eventually organizing, possibly with the help of FtsA and ZipA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>), into a helical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>). This structure assembles into the Z-ring. By binding in between the filaments ZapA (orange) increases the chance of lateral association. Once the Z-ring is established, this ZapA activity is not needed anymore, and ZapA will bind at the cytoplasmic side on top of the filaments, where it might have a weak structural function in the association of other cell division proteins.
