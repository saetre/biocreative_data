Although early prostate specific antigen (PSA) detection and surgery have decreased the death rate, most of the patients still die of metastasis and recurrence of prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, the mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of prostate cancer are poorly understood at the molecular level. It is important to understand the molecular biology of this cancer for its prevention, early diagnosis, and effective treatment.</p><p><italic>PCAN1 </italic>(prostate cancer gene 1, also known as <italic>GDEP</italic>) is highly expressed in prostate epithelial tissue and frequently mutated in prostate tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. <italic>PCAN1 </italic>expression is undetectable in the highly undifferentiated DU145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines and weakly detected in the more differentiated LNCaP cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This gene is localized to chromosome 4q21, a region of the genome that experiences frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in prostate cancer. It is mutated in 35% of the tumor samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Therefore,<italic>PCAN1 </italic>has been proposed to have tumor suppressing function in prostate cancer.</p><p><italic>NKX3.1 </italic>is a prostate-specific homeobox gene that is thought to play an important role in the normal development of prostate and carcinogenesis. In mice <italic>Nkx3.1 </italic>is exclusively expressed in prostate epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Its targeted disruption leads to aberrations in prostate ductal morphogenesis and secretory protein production, and epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Notably <italic>Nkx3.1 </italic>mutant mice display the pathologic changes of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] that is the presumed precursor to prostate cancer in humans, implying that loss of <italic>Nkx3.1 </italic>expression correlates with the initiation of prostate carcinogenesis. Human <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>has been mapped to human chromosome 8p21, a region with frequent loss of heterozygosity in human prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This gene has been proposed to have tumor suppressing function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It also inhibits the growth of cultured prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]<italic> in vitro</italic>. The strong association of <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>with prostate development and prostate cancer makes this gene an attractive molecular target for further study.</p><p><italic>NKX3.1 </italic>and <italic>PCAN1 </italic>are both prostate-specific genes strongly related to prostate development and prostate cancer.

Analysis of the 2.6 kb sequence with MatInspector 2.2 revealed potential binding sites of some important transcription factors, including NKX3.1, P53, Sp1, cEBP and PPAR/RXR heterodimers. In our study, the eukaryotic expression plasmids containing <italic>NKX3.1, p53, Sp1, cEBP&#x003b1; </italic>and <italic>PPAR&#x003b3; </italic>were respectively used to study their effects on <italic>PCAN1 </italic>expression. We found that NKX3.1 upregulated <italic>PCAN1 </italic>promoter activity and mRNA expression. To explore the regulatory mechanisms of NKX3.1 on <italic>PCAN1 </italic>transcription, we focused on identifying the functional NKX3.1 binding sites (NBSs) upstream of the <italic>PCAN1 </italic>gene.

NKX3.1 protein has been proposed to act as a specific tumor suppressor in prostate. Loss of <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>expression correlates with prostate carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and prostate tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It was reported that NKX3.1 could collaborate with other transcription factors, such as serum response factor (SRF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], Sp-family protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and prostate derived Ets factor (PDEF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], to regulate the expression of target genes. The potential for NKX3.1 to exert a differentiating and growth suppressing effect on prostatic epithelium was confirmed by targeted gene disruption of <italic>Nkx3.1 </italic>in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Deletion of either one or both copies of <italic>Nkx3.1 </italic>resulted in prostatic epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia that increased in severity with age. Magee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] has analyzed the expression profiles of prostate tissues from wild-type,<italic>Nkx3.1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, and <italic>Nkx3.1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice and identified Nkx3.1 target genes. However, the genes directly regulated by human NKX3.1 have yet to be identified. In the present study, we found that <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>upregulated the expression of the <italic>PCAN1 </italic>gene in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and identified two functional NKX3.1 binding sites upstream of the <italic>PCAN1 </italic>gene.</p><p><italic>PCAN1 </italic>is highly expressed in prostate epithelial tissue and was initially identified in a screen for prostate-specific genes. As an important gene in prostate cancer initiation or progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], it has been shown that <italic>PCAN1 </italic>is frequently mutated or deleted in prostate tumor samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and differentially expressed in tumor versus normal prostate tissue, demonstrating a prostate tumor suppressor role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. So far, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of <italic>PCAN1 </italic>gene expression as well as the relevant regulatory elements and factors. Cross et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] has identified <italic>PCAN1 </italic>gene in prostate epithelial tissue and demonstrated its expression pattern in different cells. They did an initial characterization of 2.5 kb sequence upstream of the initiation sites with the MatInspector program, in which they found several important transcription factor binding sites, including NKX3.1 binding sites. In our study, we cloned a 2.6 kb <italic>PCAN1 </italic>promoter sequence and five NKX3.1 binding sites were found in this region with the MatInspector (core/matrix sim: 0.75/optimized). We further performed reporter assays, RNAi, EMSA and ChIP to demonstrate that NKX3.1 could directly bind to NKX3.1 binding sites in the <italic>PCAN1 </italic>promoter to enhance <italic>PCAN1 </italic>gene expression in prostate cancer cells. This finding provides a foundation for future studies of the regulatory mechanisms and roles of <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>on <italic>PCAN1 </italic>gene expression in prostate development and prostate cancer.</p><p>NKX3.1 is proposed to be a nuclear transcriptional factor. It preferentially binds the TAAGTA sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] to regulate its target gene expression. It is reported that NKX3.1 acts as a transcription factor through recruitment of some corepressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] or coactivators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] to repress or activate its target genes. Our study provided some evidences to show that NKX3.1 directly binds to NKX3.1 binding sites in the <italic>PCAN1 </italic>promoter to activate <italic>PCAN1 </italic>gene expression in prostate cancer cells. However, further studies will be required to explore the regulatory mechanisms and the cofactors involved in the regulation. <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>is a prostate-specific gene required for maintenance of the normal differentiated state of the prostate epithelium. It is proposed to have tumor suppressing function. However, it is not a classic tumor suppressor gene. Despite that loss of function of <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>predisposes to prostate cancer, it is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. Moreover, while one allele of <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>is lost by means of chromosomal deletion in prostate cancer, the other allele does not undergo mutational inactivation. These features are not consistent with activities of "classic" tumor suppressor genes. Instead, <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>appears to act more like a tumor modulator, serving as a regulator of differentiation, which in turn prevents cancer initiation. Our finding that NKX3.1 upregulates <italic>PCAN1 </italic>expression will give a clue for further exploring the relationships between <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>and <italic>PCAN1 </italic>and understanding the functional importance of NXK3.1 in regulating <italic>PCAN1 </italic>in prostate differentiation and carcinogenesis. Identification of the specific biological functions of NKX3.1 in prostate cancer may provide targets for the early diagnosis and prevention of prostate cancer.</p><p><italic>NKX3.1 </italic>is an androgen regulated gene and its expression is upregulated by androgens. It is presumed that androgens upregulate <italic>PCAN1 </italic>expression through increasing <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>expression. In the experiments we have analyzed the effect of androgen (R1881) on endogenous <italic>PCAN1 </italic>and <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>expression in LNCaP cells. Our results showed that R1881 (10<sup>-8</sup>~10<sup>-10 </sup>M) increased <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>expression but have no significant effects on <italic>PCAN1 </italic>expression in RT-PCR (results are not shown in this paper) and <italic>PCAN1 </italic>promoter activity in luciferase reporter assays (results are shown in our paper in Cell Mol Biol Lett). So far, it is not very clear whether or not <italic>PCAN1 </italic>gene expression is regulated directly by androgens. It may be possible that <italic>PCAN1 </italic>is negatively regulated by androgens and <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>compensates this effect through positively regulating <italic>PCAN1</italic>. In addition, <italic>AR</italic>, <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>and <italic>PCAN1 </italic>play different roles in prostate development and cancer, and their interactions in prostate are very complicated and need further to be investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we cloned and characterized the human <italic>PCAN1 </italic>promoter, and identified two functional NKX3.1 binding sites upstream of the <italic>PCAN1 </italic>gene, which were involved in the positive regulation by NKX3.1 of <italic>PCAN1 </italic>gene expression. Both <italic>NKX3.1 </italic>and <italic>PCAN1 </italic>are related to prostate development and prostate cancer.
