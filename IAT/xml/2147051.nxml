While the contribution of innate microglial inflammatory activities to disease are known, evidence for how adaptive immune mechanisms may affect the course of PD remains obscure. We reasoned that PD-associated oxidative protein modifications create novel antigenic epitopes capable of peripheral adaptive T cell responses that could affect nigrostriatal degeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Nitrotyrosine (NT)-modified &#x003b1;-Syn was detected readily in cervical lymph nodes (CLN) from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxicated mice. Antigen-presenting cells within the CLN showed increased surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, initiating the molecular machinery necessary for efficient antigen presentation. MPTP-treated mice produced antibodies to native and nitrated &#x003b1;-Syn. Mice immunized with the NT-modified C-terminal tail fragment of &#x003b1;-Syn, but not native protein, generated robust T cell proliferative and pro-inflammatory secretory responses specific only for the modified antigen. T cells generated against the nitrated epitope do not respond to the unmodified protein. Mice deficient in T and B lymphocytes were resistant to MPTP-induced neurodegeneration. Transfer of T cells from mice immunized with N-&#x003b1;-Syn led to a robust neuroinflammatory response with accelerated dopaminergic cell loss.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data show that NT modifications within &#x003b1;-Syn, can bypass or break immunological tolerance and activate peripheral leukocytes in draining lymphoid tissue. A novel mechanism for disease is made in that NT modifications in &#x003b1;-Syn induce adaptive immune responses that exacerbate PD pathobiology. These results have implications for both the pathogenesis and treatment of this disabling neurodegenerative disease.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="20"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by resting tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Dauer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The recruitment of activated T cells, specific for disease-associated protein modifications in &#x003b1;-Syn, may, in turn, promote a toxic microglial phenotype.

Our own studies demonstrated that immunization of mice with glatiramer acetate generate T cells that recognize myelin basic protein (T<sub>MBP</sub>), secrete interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;, and confer protection against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurodegeneration presumably by suppression of microglial activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Benner1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Antibodies generated through active immunization of human &#x003b1;-Syn transgenic mice with purified human &#x003b1;-Syn protein reduced &#x003b1;-Syn aggregation in cell bodies and terminals, and was associated with protection of dopaminergic nerve terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Masliah1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The conclusions were that anti-&#x003b1;-Syn antibodies target the aggregated protein to lysosomal pathways for degradation and that the strategy could be applied for treatment of human disease. That work was conducted however in an animal model of PD that lacks a neuroinflammatory component. As such, the study did not address the cellular arm of the immune system, which likely requires cytokine and chemokine gradients for efficient cell entry into diseased regions. Nevertheless, the work of Masliah et al., 2005 supports the potential importance for adaptive immunity and for immune-based strategies for the treatment of PD. Certainly, research activities into the potential use of &#x003b1;-Syn as an immunogen will require further study.</p><p>Here, we report that NT-modified CNS antigens drain to the deep cervical lymph nodes (CLN) of mice following exposure to MPTP. Moreover, antigen-presenting cells (APC) within CLN increase surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, initiating the molecular machinery necessary for efficient antigen presentation. The differential outcome on the susceptibility to MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration amongst WT and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice suggest a functional link of the adaptive immune system to MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. We further demonstrate in mice of two disparate haplotypes, that adoptive transfer of T cells from syngeneic WT donors immunized with nitrated &#x003b1;-Syn (N-&#x003b1;-Syn) prolongs MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss and hence warrants caution against the use of N-&#x003b1;-Syn or self-proteins that are prone to nitrate modifications for vaccine-based PD therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>Male 6&#x02013;7 week old, WT C57BL/6J (stock 000664, denoted as B6) (H-2<sup>b</sup>), B6.CB17-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup></italic>/SzJ (stock 001913, herein denoted as SCID) (H-2<sup>b</sup>) and B10.BR-<italic>H2<sup>k</sup> H2-T18<sup>a</sup></italic>/SgSnJ (stock 000465, herein denoted as B10.BR) (H-2<sup>k</sup>) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).

modifications of &#x003b1;-Syn in draining lymphatic tissue following MPTP-induced nigrostriatal injury, along with evidence of lymphoid-associated APC activation provided support for antigen presentation to T cells and subsequent immune responsiveness. To substantiate this idea, we explored whether an endogenous adaptive immune system was required for MPTP-induced nigrostriatal degeneration. B6 WT mice, B6 SCID mice, and B6 SCID mice reconstituted with 10<sup>8</sup> B6 WT splenocytes (SPC) (RCS-SCID) were treated with PBS or a chronic MPTP regimen. Mice were sacrificed at 21 days after the last MPTP injection, and VMB sections immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, left panels). The numbers of TH<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neurons in the SN showed a 33&#x00025; reduction in WT B6 animals that received MPTP compared to those that received PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). No significant difference in the numbers of TH<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neurons was observed in MPTP-treated SCID mice compared to SCID mice that received PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, immune reconstituted SCID mice (RCS-SCID) treated with MPTP showed significantly fewer TH<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neurons compared to the SCID MPTP group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). To validate the reconstitution of RCS-SCID mice, spleens were immunostained for CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, right panels). T cell repopulation was confirmed by the presence of CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath of RCS-SCID mouse spleens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g002">Figure 2A</xref>),</p><p>VMB and cerebellum control sections of WT, SCID, and RCS-SCID mice treated with MPTP were immunostained for T cells using antibodies against CD3, CD4, and CD8. CD3 immunostaining of MPTP-treated B6 mice demonstrated CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the VMB beginning at day 0, present at day 4 after MPTP intoxication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) that persisted to day 14.

No T cell accumulation was observed in PBS or MPTP-treated SCID mice at any time point (data not shown), whereas CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell accumulations in VMB of RCS-SCID mice after MPTP-treatment were identified. Cerebellar tissue of MPTP animals had &#x02264;1 CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell per high power field examined present suggesting specific cell entry into affected regions. Taken together, these data support the occurrence of an adaptive immune response triggered by modified CNS antigens that modulates the vulnerability of the dopaminergic neurons to MPTP through the migration of T cells into the CNS.</p><fig id="pone-0001376-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001376.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Nigral degeneration following MPTP-intoxication in B6 SCID mice before and after lymphoid cell reconstitution.</title><p>(A) Photomicrographs of TH-immunostained SN (left panels) and CD3-immunostained spleen sections (right panels) from B6 (WT), SCID, and reconstituted SCID (RCS-SCID) mice treated with PBS or MPTP and obtained on day 21 post-MPTP intoxication.

However, since the last 40 aa of the mouse &#x003b1;-Syn contains 4 Tyr residues available for nitration, our analysis focused on this C-terminal &#x003b1;-Syn fragment. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001376-t002">Table 2</xref> shows that H-2K<sup>k</sup> epitopes have a superior ability to bind with high and intermediate affinity &#x003b1;-Syn-derived 8-11-meric peptide fragments derived from the whole &#x003b1;-Syn molecule or from its C-terminal 38-meric fragment. These data demonstrate significant T cell induction potential. In fact, &#x003b1;-Syn has 100 potential T cell epitopes, 73 of which contain Tyr that were predicted to bind H-2K<sup>k</sup> molecules, while only 8 and 15 potential epitopes may bind H-2D<sup>b</sup> and H-2K<sup>b</sup> molecules, respectively. This was also for nitrated epitopes containing Tyr residue including those with a Tyr residue within the central region of the epitope that presents prominently to the T cell receptor. These epitopes do not contain anchor aa that mediate binding to the MHC groove. Dramatic difference in the number of Tyr-containing T cell epitopes from C-terminal segment of &#x003b1;-Syn predicted to bind H-2K<sup>k</sup> but not any of H-2<sup>b</sup> molecules (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001376-t002">Table 2</xref>, data in brackets) suggests a potential preference for H-2K<sup>k</sup> versus H-2<sup>b</sup> mice to induce T cell responses to nitrated C-terminal fragments of &#x003b1;-Syn. These fragments, if facing T cell receptors, have greater chances of inducing MHC class I-restricted CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells due to lack of negative selection against N-&#x003b1;-Syn epitopes in the embryonic thymus. Further epitope prediction analysis revealed a number of 15-meric epitopes, including Tyr-containing peptides from C-terminal, that can bind with increased affinity class II MHC groove, thus increasing the propensity of inducing MHC class II-restricted CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells specific for Tyr-containing &#x003b1;-Syn C-terminal fragments. Therefore, mice expressing MHC class I and II molecules of H-2<sup>k</sup> haplotypes are capable of generating immune responses to NT-modified &#x003b1;-Syn. Interestingly, that &#x003b1;-Syn C-terminal fragment contains several Tyr-containing peptides with predicted significant binding affinity for IA<sup>k</sup> and IA<sup>b</sup> MHC molecules (18 and 14 epitopes, respectively) suggests a significant potential for CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells of mice expressing IA<sup>k</sup> or IA<sup>b</sup> to respond to nitrated epitopes from &#x003b1;-Syn

NT modifications of 4YSyn peptide (N-4YSyn) after peroxynitrite nitration was confirmed by Western blot using mouse monoclonal anti-NT antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Homogeneity of purified 4YSyn and its modified forms (aggregated and nitrated) was assessed based on: 1D SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The predominant peak for 4YSyn by MALDI-TOF analysis was 6592 m/z, which corresponded to the 6718 expected mass of purified recombinant &#x003b1;-Syn within &#x0003c;2&#x00025; mass accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g003">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001376-t003">Table 3</xref>). To provide proof that the mass discrepancy originated from recombination errors within the His-tag region obtained during protein purification, but not within the biologically active portion of the molecule, we digested the recombinant 4YSyn protein with trypsin and measured masses of resulting fragments using MALDI-TOF. The observed masses of the generated fragments were Arg-cleaved 4YSyn and Lys-cleaved 4YSyn. These corresponded to the expected masses with 0.07&#x00025; of mass accuracy. Next, we compared the mass of native 4YSyn to N-4YSyn. The oxidized peptide or its trypsin cleaved fragments revealed a 184 D mass increase that is analogous to the expected mass of 4 nitro groups corresponding to 4 NT- residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g003">Figure 3A and 3D</xref>). Based on these observations, we concluded that reaction of 4YSyn with peroxynitrite, under the conditions used in this study, efficiently nitrated all four available Tyr residues in 4YSyn.</p><fig id="pone-0001376-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001376.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Characterization of purified and nitrated recombinant 4YSyn.</title><p>(A) Primary aa sequence of His-tagged 4YSyn peptide.

Significant effects from any treatment were not observed among the numbers of non-dopaminergic neurons (Nissl&#x0002b;TH-). Correlation analysis of total Nissl&#x0002b; neurons compared to TH&#x0002b; and TH- neurons demonstrated that the number of total neurons strongly correlated with numbers of TH&#x0002b; neurons (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.981, p&#x0003c;0.0001) compared to numbers of TH- neurons (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.522, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.004). This confirmed that differences in TH&#x0002b; neuron counts are due to differences in numbers of structurally intact neurons and eliminates the possibility that differences resulted from the down-regulation of TH itself.

However, this approach used a cell line derived from rat embryonic mesencephalon cells that were fused with mouse neuroblastoma cells as an immunogen in the guinea pig. This experimental strategy precludes the challenge of breaking tolerance to self, the primary hurdle in autoimmune pathology, as mouse or rat proteins would likely be viewed as &#x0201c;foreign&#x0201d; in the guinea pig. Moreover, this work models PD as a primary autoimmune disease, for which little supporting evidence exists, and does not give any indication as to how, or under what circumstances, such autoimmune reactions may occur. Our data provides a rationale and a novel mechanism, which includes immunity to modified self-proteins as a disease modifier, rather than autoimmunity as a primary pathological mechanism. This idea nicely supports existing hypotheses where toxic injury (environmental or endogenous) results in damaged self-proteins capable of immune activation. Adaptive immune responses may play a role in amplifying and sustaining innate immune mechanisms operative in PD. Moreover, this may provide insight as to why antigenically related sites are also affected in PD such as the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, and nucleus basalis of Meynert.</p><p>Innate neuroinflammatory reactions, primarily associated with activated microglia, significantly contributes to secondary neuronal loss in animal models of PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Liberatore1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Wu2">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. Mice intoxicated with an acute regimen of MPTP exhibit a robust inflammatory response, which precedes neuronal loss and resolves by day 4 post-intoxication during which most degeneration takes place. The acute nature of this inflammatory response seen in mice is in striking contrast to idiopathic PD that slowly progresses over a period of years. Unlike the mouse data, humans and non-human primates intoxicated with MPTP have sustained microglial activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Langston1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-McGeer2">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. Mechanisms linking innate immune activation and dopaminergic neuronal cell loss are under active study. One potential mechanism for sustaining innate neuroinflammatory reactions includes peripheral activation of the adaptive immune system against CNS antigens originating in damaged tissue. Foreign antigen introduced into CNS compartments, including the anterior chamber of the eye or striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>, results in the education of peripheral T cells in the spleen or CLN, respectively, and primarily favors tolerance induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Kosiewicz1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, dendritic cells populate perivascular regions of the CNS in normal physiological and pathological states, and have been proposed to migrate out of the CNS where they may act as APC in secondary lymphoid organs. &#x0201c;New&#x0201d; brain antigens (foreign or modified self) presented to the immune system during CNS inflammatory disease states may not favor tolerance induction. Here, we first detected a NT-modified protein with molecular mass &#x0003c;20 kD within the CLN of MPTP-treated mice, which was not observed in any other lymphoid tissue examined.

Two different strains of mice, B10.BR (H-2<sup>k</sup>) and B6 (H-2<sup>b</sup>), expressing disparate MHC haplotypes were employed. Predictions of MHC binding affinities for &#x003b1;-Syn T cell epitopes suggested an increased number of peptides with intermediate and high degree binding to class I MHC molecules of H-2<sup>k</sup>, but not H-2<sup>b</sup>. An overall stronger immunogenic binding potential even to MHC class II was predicted for H-2<sup>k</sup> when compared to H-2<sup>b</sup>. These predictions suggested the 2 strains would exhibit different levels of T cell responses to N-&#x003b1;-Syn with consequential heterogeneous outcomes affecting disease. It is not clear, whether in PD patients the C-terminal fragment of &#x003b1;-Syn, which is nearly identical in mice and human, is nitrated. However, earlier studies demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies to N-&#x003b1;-Syn recognize fragments that include nitrated Tyr<sup>125</sup> and Tyr<sup>133</sup> residues within &#x003b1;-Syn C-terminal fragment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Giasson1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies confirmed preference of NT in close proximity to carboxylates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Sacksteder1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with previous data that promote nitration of Tyr by nearby negative charges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Souza1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, within the Tyr-containing 42 aa C-terminal of &#x003b1;-Syn more than 28&#x00025; (12 aa) are charged negatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001376-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). All together, we posit that monitoring of T cell responses to epitopes predicted in this study may determine the association of neurodegeneration and &#x003b1;-Syn immune responses.</p><p>The focus of the current study was to elucidate and characterize new cellular and molecular mechanisms that explain the prolonged neuroinflammation and progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD as modeled by the administration of MPTP. B10.BR or B6 mice immunized with the unmodified C-terminal tail of &#x003b1;-Syn failed to generate detectable proliferative responses after SPC were stimulated with 4YSyn or N-4YSyn, thus suggesting a degree of tolerance to this self-protein. Conversely, both strains of mice immunized with N-4YSyn developed robust proliferative responses to the modified protein <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, immune cells that recognized only the modified form did not proliferate in response to the unmodified form suggesting a high degree of specificity in generating adaptive immune responses to the nitrated epitope. Exacerbation of dopaminergic neuronal loss in both MPTP-intoxicated B6 and B10.BR mice that received N-4YSyn immune cells from syngeneic donors was observed in our studies. The loss of dopaminergic neurons within the SN of those recipient mice was significantly greater compared to MPTP-treated animals or those that received SPC from mice immunized with 4YSyn or PBS. Transfer of SPC from mice immunized with unmodified 4YSyn yielded no difference in SN dopaminergic neuronal loss compared to those mice treated with MPTP alone. Importantly, the transfer of purified T cells from N-4YSyn immunized donors exacerbated nigral degeneration in B10.BR mice. Elimination of adjuvant (CFA/IFA) from the immunization strategy for B6 donors and subsequent adoptive transfer of N-4YSyn immune SPC produced the most severe dopaminergic neuronal losses. While behavioral testing of MPTP mice was considered to substantiate dopaminergic neurodegeneration, those were not performed as rodents do not develop typical parkinsonism and behavioral testing in MPTP mice has not proven to be consistently reliable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Rommelfanger1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Tillerson1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While the exact phenotype of the T cell response generated in this vaccination strategy is unknown, a proinflammatory T<sub>H</sub>1 response was likely generated and associated with exacerbation of inflammatory responses and neurotoxicity. We also demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> that antigen-activated immune responses to N-4YSyn augment N-4YSyn-induced, cell-mediated dopaminergic toxicity with macrophages activated by N-&#x003b1;-Syn, linked to an induction of TNF-&#x003b1; production by stimulated T cells. This suggests a potent mechanism for exacerbation of inflammatory responses and progression of dopaminergic neurodegenerative processes conferred by N-4YSyn specific T cells. These data also emphasize caution in design of vaccine-based therapeutic strategies for PD or other neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, a promising A&#x003b2; vaccine strategy was employed in transgenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) mice as a model for Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Bard1">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Schenk1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>. In these studies, immunized APP transgenic animals showed markedly reduced A&#x003b2; deposition, preservation of normal neuronal structures, and improved performance in memory and spatial learning tasks. After completing a successful phase I trial with no significant toxicities, phase II trials came to an abrupt end when 15 vaccine recipients experienced meningoencephalitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Check1">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Nicoll1">&#x0005b;82&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Orgogozo1">&#x0005b;83&#x0005d;</xref>. Clearly, immune system can generate T cell responses to proteins that are similarly modified as those found in PD but alternative routes of administration may generate entirely different effects on the disease process and as such do not preclude using these proteins as potential vaccine candidates. For example, nasal administration favors the generation of regulatory type T<sub>H</sub>2/T<sub>H</sub>3 responses to antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Faria1">&#x0005b;84&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001376-Weiner1">&#x0005b;85&#x0005d;</xref>. Mucosal vaccination using N-4YSyn may result in dramatically different results than those presented here.</p><p>All together, we demonstrated for the first time, that NT &#x003b1;-Syn modifications circumvent immunological tolerance. We posit that these observations are directly relevant to the tempo and progression of PD. Indeed, NT-modifications of &#x003b1;-Syn are present in Lewy bodies during disease and when present in the extracellular spaces of the brain appears in the CNL where a robust adaptive immune response is produced that accelerates nigral dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Most importantly the abilities of N-&#x003b1;-Syn to evade immunological tolerance provides a novel pathogenic mechanism for PD and new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Drs.
