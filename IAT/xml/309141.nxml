We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of rpb2, and parts of the PCR-amplified rpb2 cDNA. The predicted coding sequence of a polypeptide of 1210 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 138 kilodaltons was interrupted by a short intron. The overall amino acid sequence homology of the S. pombe subunit 2 is 68, 62 and 62% with the corresponding protein from S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens, respectively. Southern analysis of the genomic DNA digested with various restriction enzymes showed that rpb2 was present as a single copy in the S. pombe genome. Northern analysis showed that the transcript of rpb2 was about 4 kb in length.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0118-a" xlink:role="472"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="469"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="470"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="471"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="472"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00052-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="473"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
