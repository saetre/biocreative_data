The role of the endometrial receptors in this complex embryo-maternal interaction is still unclear.

The expression levels of PRA ratio to PRB, and the 50 kDa c-MET isoform were significantly lower in HEC-1A as compared with RL95-2. Attachment rates and growth of JAR spheroids into HEC-1A were significantly lower as compared with RL95-2. Stimulation of PR with progesterone altered attachment rates to HEC-1A. Inhibition of PR with RU-486 mildly increased attachment rate to HEC-1A whereas it slightly decreased attachment rate to RL95-2. c-Met inhibition decreased attachment rates only to HEC-1A cells that expressing high levels of Plexin-B1 (PB1). Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that c-Met and PB1 associate in complexes in the endometrial cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Differential endometrial receptor profiles are expressed during the receptivity period. The attachment and invasion processes are separately regulated.

Successful implantation depends on a pre-implantation embryo developing into a competent blastocyst that reaching the uterus precisely at its receptive stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Endometrial receptivity is suggested to be a property of the endometrial epithelial cells (EECs). The molecular mechanisms by which the surface of human EECs acquires morphological changes, leading to receptive features, are still unclear. Cytokines, growth factors, hormones, extracellular matrix proteins and enzymes, angiogenic factors, cell-cell adhesion molecules and receptors are all involved in this complex process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated the appearance of morphological or biological markers for endometrial receptivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However functional physiological markers are still unknown. The cross talk, between the active blastocyst and the receptive uterus, is solely reliant on mediation and interrelationship by a variety of receptors in the endometrium. Despite the possibility of extra corporal fertilization and extensive new technology, the process of implantation and the interaction between maternal endometrium and invading trophoblast are even today difficult to explore.</p><p>Hence, the search for better understanding of this process continues and is transferred into the in vitro setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] we showed that Plexin B1 (PB1), a membrane receptor, has a role in endometrial receptivity and in the attachment process. The current study was designed to explore and compare the expression and role of the membrane receptor c-Met, which is known to be expressed as a complex with PB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the nuclear receptor PR in two human endometrial cell lines, RL95-2 and HEC-1A, used as a model for high receptivity and low receptivity endometrium respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The progesterone receptor (PR) is a member of a large family of ligand-activated nuclear transcription regulators, which are characterized by organization into specific functional domains and are conserved between species and family members. The PR is made up of a central DNA binding domain and a carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain. Studies on human PR indicate that there are at list 3 different alternatively spliced forms to the PR. Two of the PR isoforms, namely PR-A and PR-B, mediate the effects of progesterone. Detailed function studies indicate that PR-B, in all cellular contexts in-vitro, functions as a ligand-dependent trans-activator. This in contrast to PR-A, which in some contexts acts as a ligand-dependent transcriptional repressor of PR-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. There is increasing evidence to date that PR-A and PR-B are functionally different. The PRB/PRA ratio was found to be of clinical importance in several tissues, [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]]. These differences are yet to be fully understood. It is the balance between these two forms that may make it possible for progesterone to affect such diverse physiological targets. Progesterone's action has been shown to be essential for proper endometrial maturation, endometrial receptivity and the maintenance of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These effects of progesterone are thought to be mediated primarily through its cognate receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The establishment of normal endometrial receptivity appears to be closely associated with the down-regulation of epithelial PR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Histologic delay is associated with a failure of PR down-regulation and the lack of normal markers of endometrial receptivity.</p><p>The proto-oncogene Met encodes a transmembrane tyrosin kinase of 190 kDa. c-Met is a heterodimer composed of two disulfide-linked chains of 50 kDa and 140 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Met is the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It is frequently over expressed in neoplastic cells and in host tissue. Due to its prominent role in the control of motility and invasion, it is involved in metastasis formation. The role of c-Met in endometrial receptivity still needs to be investigated.</p><p>Stromal and trophoblast cells produce HGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] while its receptor is expressed in the endometrial epithelia and stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Recent data indicate that signaling activity of the Met receptor is affected by an association with other receptors such as RON and PB1 and it was published that cells expressing the endogenous proteins, PB1 and c-Met, associate in a complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition it was shown that membrane-bound semaphorin Sema4D, PB1's ligand, can trigger the activation of the oncogenic receptor Met, which is associated with PB1 on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>Two endometrial cell lines were used as in vitro model for endometrial receptivity. Cell line RL95-2 (ATCC catalog No.CRL-1671), derived from a moderately differentiated adeno-squamous carcinoma of the endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] was used as a model for receptive endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] Cell line HEC-1A (ATCC catalog No. HTB-112) derived from human endometrial carcinoma, served as a model for the non-receptive state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Third cell line was established in our laboratory, HEC-1A cells were transfected with human PB1 (was provided kindly by Prof. Luca Tamagnone, the transfected cell line named HEC-1A-2. (HEC-1A-2 was characterized in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Human trophoblast cell line, JAR (ATCC catalog No. HTB-144) was used as a model for blastocysts.</p></sec><sec><title>Endometrial cell culture</title><p>HEC-1A cells were cultured in Meckoy 5A medium (Kibbutz Beit-Ha'Emek, Israel) containing 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) (Kibbutz Beit-Ha'Emek, Israel) and penicillin/streptomycin (Kibbutz Beit-Ha'Emek, Israel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. RL95-2 cells were cultured in DMEM F: 12 medium (Kibbutz Beit-Ha'Emek, Israel) containing FCS, penicillin/streptomycin, 2.5 mM Glutamine (Kibbutz Beit-Ha'Emek, Israel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Cell cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C. RL95-2 cells (1&#x02013;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) and HEC-1-A cells (1&#x02013;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) were seeded in 24-well culture plates for 10 days, and the growth medium was renewed every 2&#x02013;3 days. All studies performed with serum free medium.</p></sec><sec><title>Attachment and growth assays</title><sec><title>Attachment of JAR spheroids to endometrial cell monolayer</title><p>For the attachment assays JAR spheroids were prepared and tested as described in details elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]: briefly, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>JAR cells per 10 ml M-199 medium (Kibbutz Beit-Ha'Emek, Israel) containing 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin were agitated at 37&#x000b0;C on a Comfort shaker at 200 rpm (12 &#x000d7; g). In order to distinguish JAR spheroids from underlying endometrial cell lines (HEC-1A and RL95-2) or primary culture we have labeled the JAR spheroids with the membrane-permeable fluorescent dye CMFDA (Invitrogen, Dorset, UK) that after enzymatic cleavage serves as a long-term cytoplasmic marker. Spheroids were agitated at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 hours. Thereafter spheroids were gently delivered with micro denuding pipette (150 &#x003bc;m diameter) onto a confluent monolayer of endometrial cell lines (HEC-1A and RL95-2) grown in 24-wells culture plates in M-199 growth medium containing 1.5% FCS. After 60 minutes of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C the culture plate was shaken aggressively at 15 &#x000d7; g (VORTEX GENIE, Scientific Industries, Chicago, U.S.A) for 60 minutes. The medium containing unattached spheroids was collected, and fresh medium was added to the wells. Spheroids remaining in each well were counted using a phase-contrast microscope or florescence microscope. Spheroids attachment is expressed as a percentage of seeded spheroids. In certain experiments HEC-1A and RL95-2 cell lines were pretreated with Progesterone 0&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M (Sigma, ST Louis, MO, USA) or with RU-486 (PR antagonist) (Sigma, ST Louis, MO, USA).

After electrophoresis, the proteins (50 &#x003bc;g/lane) were blotted from the SDS-PAGE onto 0.45 &#x003bc;m nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher &#x00026; Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the nitrocellulose membranes for 1 hour with 5% BSA (Sigma, ST Louis, MO, USA) in Tris-buffered saline. The membranes were then washed four times with Tris-buffered saline, containing 0.75% Tween-20, and incubated for 1 hour with antibodies against PR (Santa Cruz, Biotech, California, USA sc-539) or c-Met (Santa Cruz Biotech, California, USA sc-161) in 0.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline, containing 0.01% Tween-20. The membranes were subsequently washed with Tris-buffered saline, containing 0.75% Tween-20 and incubated for 1 hour with HRP-conjugated Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti- rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno-research, Enco, Israel) in 0.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline, containing 0.01% Tween-20. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Kit, Kibbutz Beit-Ha'Emek, Israel,) and quantified using the BioImaging gel documentation system (Dinco &#x00026; Renium, Jerusalem, Israel) endowed with TINA software (Raytest, Taubenhardt, Germany).

PR was identified in the nuclei of epithelial cells, stromal cells, and myometrial smooth muscle cells of the uterus. The PR content of endometrial epithelium and stroma varies with the menstrual cycle. The epithelium demonstrated very strong PR expression during the proliferative phase and in the early secretory phase while at the post-ovulation phase it decreased sharply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In general, there was homogeneous expression of the two isoforms in nuclei within the same tissue compartment during most stages of the menstrual cycle, although there were exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However according to another study expression of only one isoform, either PRA or PRB, is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The mRNA expression of PRB was high in RL95-2 and low in HEC-1A. However, at the protein level the PRB expression was high in HEC-1A and low in RL95-2. Discrepancy between the abundance of RNA molecules and the cognate protein has been recently reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Protein and RNA represent different steps of a multi-stepped cellular genetic information process, in which under differential-regulatory steps they are dynamically produced and degraded. The current study results suggest posttranscriptional modulation of PRB expression in these cells. During the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, high levels of both PRA and PRB were noted in the epithelium. The intensity of PR staining increased during the proliferative phase, reaching maximal levels in the mid- to late proliferative phase, and a similar increase in levels of PRA and PRB was evident. By the mid-secretory phase, although overall PR protein concentrations were still further reduced, predominant expression of the PRB isoform was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we found significantly lower PRB protein expression level in RL95-2 as compared with HEC-1A cells. Moreover, the PRB/PRA ratio in the nucleus of RL95-2 cells is significantly lower as compared with HEC-1A. RL95-2 represents receptive epithelial endometrium cells during window of implantation or early secretory phase, while HEC-1A represents epithelial endometrium cells out of the window of implantation. Our results are seemingly contradictory with previous studies, which had demonstrated earlier down regulation of nuclear PRA during early secretory phase in epithelium endometrial cells, while PRB was the predominant isofrm at this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This difference may be due to the difference in measurement techniques between the two studies.</p><p>The distribution of PR subtypes may have important clinical consequences. Both the A and B isoforms of PR are capable of binding progesterone and dimerizing and interacting with progesterone-responsive elements, as well as the transcriptional machinery to regulate gene expression. A growing body of evidence has accumulated in recent years demonstrating that the PRA and PRB proteins are functionally different. PRB has a higher activity in response to progesterone stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In addition, they may regulate different physiological target genes in response to progesterone, and each protein may display different trans-activation capabilities in different target tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. It is the balance between these two forms that may make it possible for progesterone to affect such diverse physiological targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>To facilitate uterine remodeling for embryo attachment, progesterone is known to attenuate estrogen-induced gene expression in uterine epithelial cells. Intriguingly, this suppression is mediated by stromal PR, suggesting that the coordinated action of estrogen and progesterone depends on cross talk between the epithelial and stromal compartments of the uterus. The mechanism by which progesterone suppresses estrogen's action remains poorly defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. PRA was implicated as the more important mediator of stromal- epithelial interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. More recently, selective ablation of the PRA and PRB proteins in mice had facilitated examination of the contribution of the individual PR isoforms to the reproductive activities of progesterone. Ablation of PRA results in severe abnormalities in ovarian and uterine function leading to female infertility, whereas ablation of PRB does not affect either ovarian or uterine function. The anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory roles of PR, both of which are anti-estrogenic, may be imparted primarily by the A protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Thus, PRA is both necessary and sufficient to elicit the progesterone-dependent reproductive responses necessary for female fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This report is consistent with our finding that PRA is the dominant isoform in RL95-2.</p><p>In order to study the involvement of PR in spheroid attachment to endometrial cell lines, we stimulated PR with progesterone. A dual progesterone effect was found in HEC-1A cells (low concentration of progesterone significantly inhibited spheroids attachment, while higher concentrations of progesterone increased attachment rates to HEC-1A cells). It is well known that progesterone function in regard to trophoblast-endometrium interaction is dose-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and that the progesterone response is biphasic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Attachment rates of JAR spheroids to RL95-2 were not altered in response to low concentrations of progesterone. It might be explainable by the different dominant PR isoform in those cells: PRA in RL95-2 and PRB in HEC-1A cells.</p><p>Progesterone is known to control cell adhesion proteins including ECM proteins and their cellular receptors, integrins. It was shown that progesterone upregulates the expression of these molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It might be suggested that progesterone's action in increasing the attachment rate occurs via integrin stimulation.</p><p>In our study, PR antagonist RU-486 appeared to decrease the JAR spheroid attachment rate to RL95-2 cells by 10%, while it increased the attachment rate of JAR spheroids to HEC-1A cells by 18.5%. In accordance with our study it was shown that RU-486 inhibits the expression of endometrial receptivity markers (LIF, Integrin &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>, MUC1) and also inhibits attachment of human embryos to an in-vitro endometrial construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It was shown that the potent progesterone antagonist RU-486 has the potential to acquire substantial agonist activity in response to stimulation of cAMP signaling pathways. Moreover, agonist activity appears to be the result of authentic RU-486 activity through the PR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. There is significant implication for the PR subtype in regarding to RU-486 effect. It was documented that the ratio of PR isoforms B/A strongly influences the direction of a tissue's response to progesterone antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It might be suggested that RU-486 acts differently on each of the endometrial cell lines. In HEC-1A the dominant isoform is PRB. Inhibition of it by RU-486 changed the ratio PRB/PRA and elevated the relative amount of PRA, which seemed to be involved in the attachment process. Nevertheless it requires further investigation.</p><p>The expression pattern of c-Met and its biological role have been studied in various tumors, but, as yet, these findings have not been incorporated into the implantation studies. We undertook this study to characterize the expression pattern of c-Met and to determine whether c-Met is a potential target for trophoblast epithelial interaction. There was no difference in transcript expression level of c-MET between the two cell lines. However at the protein level we found a different expression profile in the two cell lines. The ratio of 50 kDa/140 kDa of c-Met isoforms was found to be significantly lower in the HEC-1A cell line as compared to RL95-2. The c-Met expression pattern in HEC-1A-2 was similar to the pattern observed in HEC-1A. Nevertheless, the ratio 50 kDa/140 kDa of c-Met isoforms were lower in the first.</p><p>The Met proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase of 190 kDa (p190MET), which has recently been identified as the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF). p190Met is a heterodimer composed of two disulfide-linked chains of 50 kDa (p50 alpha) and 145 kDa (p145 beta). It is believed that the truncated 50 kDa form is a cytosolic form called cyto-Met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. This form is suggested to be degraded by rapidly polyubiquitinated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. It was also hypothesized that the production of the C-terminal truncated Met forms may have a physiological role in modulating the Met receptor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. They interfere with the Met receptor signal transduction pathway by competing with the intact receptor for binding to the ligand. Such a negative regulatory role has already been shown. Moreover, the transmembrane truncated receptors, devoid of tyrosine kinase activity, may form inactive heterodimers with the intact receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>It was suggested that in mouse the presence of the shorter variant transcript and its corresponding protein isoform in a variety of normal tissues has a unique physiological role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Thus it might explain our observation of a different expression profile of the two forms of c-MET receptor between the cell lines, which differ in their receptivity potential.</p><p>According to our results, c-Met AS was sufficient to inhibit spheroid attachment to HEC-1A-2 cells but not to HEC-1A or RL95-2. The only difference between RL95-2 and HEC-1A-2 is the higher expression level of the truncated c-Met form and between the HEC-1A and HEC-2A is the higher PB1 expression level in the latter. It was published that cells expressing the endogenous proteins, PB1 and c-Met, associate in a complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, binding of Sema 4D to PB1 stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Met, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This suggests that integration of cell-restricted expression of receptor partners that modulate kinase outputs with the intrinsic signaling features of receptors is required for specification of biological responses. In this study we suggest that c-Met interacts with PB1 in all endometrial cell lines. However, a high interaction was observed in HEC-1A-2 and RL95-2, which is not surprising since PB1 expression level is significantly higher in these cell lines. However this scenario is probably more complex because plexins can interact with a variety of growth factors and receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Attachment and invasion processes seem to be separately regulated.
