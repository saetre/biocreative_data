In the monoiodoacetic acid-induced arthritis model, anti-FGF8 antibody reduced ECM release into the synovial cavity. In cultured chondrocytes, FGF8 induced the release of matrix metalloproteinase 3 and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, and caused degradation of the ECM.

Aging, mechanical stress and traumatic injury, genetic susceptibility, and metabolic predisposition are considered risk factors for this disease. Degeneration is mainly characterized by the destruction of articular cartilage, which is composed of abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) that is rich in sulfated proteoglycan and type II collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In OA, synovitis is believed to be a reactive process as a result of cartilage destruction and the release of ECM-degradation products in the synovial fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Loss of the ECM is caused by the secretion of degradative enzymes from chondrocytes in response to cytokines and prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) within the joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in the destruction of articular cartilage in arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. MMP-3 is believed to be a key enzyme involved in the degradation of the ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. MMPs are produced as proenzymes, which need to be activated by other enzymes such as plasmin or already activated MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Levels of proMMP-3 are reported to increase in joint injury and OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a family of at least 24 growth-regulatory proteins &#x02013; sharing 35% to 50% amino acid sequence identity &#x02013; that have potent mitogenic effects on a variety of cells of mesodermal and ectodermal origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. FGF8 was originally isolated from the conditioned medium of an androgen-dependent mouse mammary tumor cell line (SC-3) as an androgen-induced growth factor, and was later classified as a member of the FGF family based on structural similarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Alternative splicing of the FGF8 gene potentially gives rise to eight different protein isoforms (FGF8a to FGF8h) in mice, and to four isoforms (FGF8a, FGF8b, FGF8e, and FGF8f) in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. FGF8b has the highest capacity among these isoforms on NIH3T3 cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>FGF signaling is transduced through the formation of a complex of a growth factor, a proteoglycan, and a high-affinity fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), which is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Four different high-affinity receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4) bind FGF ligands and display varying patterns of expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Extracellular domains of FGFRs consist of three immunoglobulin-like loops (loop I, loop II, and loop III). Alternative mRNA splicing of loop III of FGFR1 to FGFR3 leads to distinct functional variants (IIIb and IIIc) that have different ligand-binding specificities and affinities.</p><p>FGF8 can bind to three receptors &#x02013; FGFR2IIIc, FGFR3IIIc, and FGFR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] &#x02013; and has an important role in embryogenesis and morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. FGF8 is expressed during gastrulation and is involved in the process of limb and facial morphogenesis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and in chicks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the complete absence of both FGF4 and FGF8, limb development fails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. FGF8 may also be involved in ectopic bone and cartilage formation by breast cancer cells that produce high amounts of FGF8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, expression of FGF8 mRNA in the synovial sarcoma cell line has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The function of FGF8 in OA has not yet been characterized.</p><p>Treatment of OA patients is aimed at controlling pain, improving function, and reducing disability. The most common pharmacologic therapeutic agents used currently are analgesics, which include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and hyaluronic acid, but these drugs do not prevent the development and progression of OA.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to examine whether FGF8 is involved in the destruction of cartilage in OA models. Initially, a rabbit meniscectomy model of OA, in which typical degenerative changes are observed in the operated knee joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], was used to detect the expression of FGF8. The activities of FGF8 were studied <italic>in vitro </italic>using cultures of rabbit articular chondrocytes. We also examined a neutralizing monoclonal anti-FGF8 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] to prevent the progression of cartilage degradation in the rat OA model, which was induced by the injection of monoiodoacetic acid (MIA) into the joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Recombinant human FGF8 was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). The anti-FGF8 neutralizing antibody, KM1334, was prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. KM1334 recognized FGF8b and FGF8f specifically out of the four human FGF8 isoforms, and showed little binding to other members of the FGF family. Neutralizing activity of KM1334 was shown by the blocking of FGF8b binding to its receptors. KM1334 neutralizes the activity of human FGF8, rabbit FGF8, and rat FGF8.</p></sec><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board. Male New Zealand white rabbits were purchased from Kitayama Labes (Nagano, Japan). Male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Japan (Kanagawa, Japan). All animals were kept in a specific pathogen-free animal facility at a temperature of 22 to 24&#x000b0;C, a humidity of 50% to 60%, and with a 12-hour day/night cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Partial meniscectomy model in the rabbit knee</title><p>Six male rabbits (2 to 2.5 kg) were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (15 mg/kg) and xylazine (2 mg/kg). Each animal was subjected to section of the fibular collateral and sesamoid ligaments of the left knee and the resection of a 3 to 4 mm segment (approximately 30% to 40%) of the lateral meniscus (the meniscectomized group) according to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In four additional animals, the ligaments were resected and the joint space of the left knee was exposed without subsequent partial meniscectomy as a sham operation. Two weeks after the surgery, the rabbits were killed by an intravenous overdose of anesthetic.</p><p>Histological evaluation was performed on sections of the synovia and articular cartilage from meniscectomized knees, from sham-operated knees (the sham group), and from nonoperated knees of the sham group (the normal group). Specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, decalcified, and embedded in paraffin. Four-micrometer sections were prepared and stained with H&#x00026;E or safranin O, and were subjected to immunohistochemistry for FGF8. Histopathology of the synovial membranes of the knee joints were evaluated using the specimens stained with H&#x00026;E.</p><p>Serial sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry for FGF8. These sections were treated with primary antibody (anti-FGF8 antibody KM1334 or mouse IgG<sub>1</sub>, 2.7 &#x003bc;g/ml in PBS without calcium and magnesium containing 1% BSA) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and were washed with PBS without calcium and magnesium containing 1% BSA. Secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG rabbit polyclonal antibody (Dako Japan, Kyoto, Japan) diluted 1:200 in PBS without calcium and magnesium containing 1% BSA) was then added and incubation continued for 60 minutes at room temperature. Finally, the sections were washed, developed using diaminobenzidine, and were counterstained with hematoxylin.</p><p>The presence of proteoglycan in cartilage was assessed using the specimens stained with safranin O&#x02013;fast green. The articular cartilage was graded according to the modified Mankin scale, as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Histological evaluations were performed in a blinded manner using the following criteria: grade 0, normal; grade 1+, very slight; grade 2+, slight; grade 3+, moderate; and grade 4+, marked.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Articular chondrocytes were isolated from the shoulder and knee joints of 3-week-old rabbits as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Cartilage was digested with 0.4% actinase E (Kaken Pharmaceuticals, Tokyo, Japan) for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C, followed by 0.025% collagenase P (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) for 5 hours at 37&#x000b0;C. The viability of the harvested cells as assessed by trypan blue exclusion was always &#x0003e;95%. The chondrocytes were then suspended in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% FBS (Intergen, Purchase, NY, USA) and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin; Invitrogen). The chondrocytes were cultured in each well of 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml under 5% carbon dioxide&#x02013;95% air at 37&#x000b0;C. Primary cultures maintained in a monolayer were used for all the experiments.</p><p>Synovial cells were collected from the knee joints of 3-week-old rabbits by the method of Hamilton and Slywka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The cells were suspended in 10% FBS/DMEM with antibiotics in 80 cm<sup>2 </sup>bottle flasks.</p></sec><sec><title>Degradation of the extracellular matrix in chondrocyte cultures</title><p>After the chondrocytes reached confluence, the culture medium was replaced with 0.5% FBS/DMEM, followed by culturing for 24 hours. The culture medium was removed, and cells were incubated with 1 ml of 0.5% FBS/DMEM in the presence of FGF8 and/or recombinant human IL-1&#x003b1; (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with various concentrations of anti-FGF8 antibody. A concentration of FGF8 (100 ng/ml) that caused ECM degradation was used. FGF8 at 10 ng/ml did not induce ECM degradation. A low concentration (0.01 ng/ml) of IL-1&#x003b1; that showed no effect by itself on ECM degradation was used. After 48 hours of incubation, the concentrations of proMMP-3 and PGE<sub>2 </sub>in the culture supernatant were measured using commercially available kits &#x02013; proMMP-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and PGE<sub>2 </sub>(Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The amount of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (S-GAG) in the ECM remaining on the plate was measured using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Growth of synovial cells</title><p>Rabbit synovial cells were collected by trypsin treatment, suspended in 10% FBS/RPMI 1640 medium, and cultured in each well of 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well under 5% carbon dioxide&#x02013;95% air at 37&#x000b0;C. After 24 hours the culture medium of each well was removed, and then 0.2% FBS/RPMI 1640 medium (200 &#x003bc;l) with or without FGF8 and/or various concentrations of anti-FGF8 antibody were added to the cells. After 48 hours, 9.25 kBq methyl [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each well. The radioactivity of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporated into the cells was measured 24 hours after the incubation using a liquid scintillation counter (1205 Beta Plate; Perkin Elmer Japan, Kanagawa, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Intraarticular injection of FGF8 in rats</title><p>Arthritis-like symptoms were induced in 7-week-old rats using FGF8 as follows. FGF8 (50 &#x003bc;g/site, 50 &#x003bc;l of 1 mg/ml solution in sterile saline) was injected into the right knee joint of each rat (the FGF8 group). The anti-FGF8 antibody KM1334 was dissolved in sterile saline at a concentration of 4 mg/ml. KM1334 (20 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection 1 hour before the injection of FGF8 (the anti-FGF8 antibody group). For the vehicle group, sterile saline was administered intraperitoneally instead of the antibody solution. For the saline group, 50 &#x003bc;l sterile saline was injected into the knee joint and sterile saline was administered intraperitoneally instead of the antibody solution. Each group consisted of five rats.</p><p>After 3 days, the inside of the knee articular capsule was washed with 30 &#x003bc;l saline containing 0.38% sodium citrate, and this washing liquid (synovial lavage fluid) was collected according to the method of Yamada and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]; this procedure was repeated 10 times. The amount of S-GAG in an aliquot was measured by the 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue method. The patella of the knee joint was taken out and the cartilaginous portion was digested with papain, and the weight of the residual bone was measured according to a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Briefly, papain was dissolved in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.8) containing 50 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and then added to 5 mM <sc>L</sc>-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate (final concentration of papain at 20 mg/ml). The patella was incubated with 1 ml papain solution overnight at 60&#x000b0;C. The residual bone was weighed.</p></sec><sec><title>Monoiodoacetic acid-induced arthritis in rats</title><p>The MIA-induced rat arthritis model was performed according to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. MIA (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved at 10 mg/ml in sterile saline, and 25 &#x003bc;l solution was injected into the right knee joint of 7-week-old rats. Each group consisted of 10 animals. The anti-FGF8 antibody KM1334 was dissolved in sterile saline to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml, and was administered by intraperitoneal injection (20 mg/kg) 1 hour before the injection of MIA. For the vehicle group, sterile saline was administered intraperitoneally instead of the antibody solution. In a saline group of animals, saline was injected in the knee joint instead of the administration of MIA. After 3 days, synovial lavage was performed to the knee articular capsule as described above.

We analyzed the rabbit knee in a partial meniscectomized model to clarify the expression of FGF8 &#x02013; which was very slightly expressed or not expressed in normal joints. Two weeks after meniscectomy, the cartilage from the lateral femoral condyle and from the lateral tibial plateau of meniscectomized animals showed degenerative changes that were similar to those observed in human OA. In the meniscectomized group, FGF8 was expressed on proliferated synovial cells and fibroblasts, but expression of FGF8 was absent or minimal in normal joints. Weak expression of FGF8 was also exhibited in the joints in which the ligaments were resected and the articular spaces were exposed (the sham group). These data indicate that expression of FGF8 is induced by chronic joint injury.</p><p>Degradation of the ECM was promoted in the presence of FGF8. The function of FGF8 on cartilage destruction was examined using a primary culture of rabbit chondrocytes. Rabbit articular chondrocytes are useful to detect biological responses. In the present study, we used primary culture of chondrocytes from 3-week-old rabbits according to the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. IL-1-induced matrix degradation according to the induction of metalloproteases was reported in cultured chondrocytes from 300 to 500 g young rabbit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Articular chondrocytes from 4-week-old rabbits underwent more doubling <italic>in vitro </italic>compared with those from 3.5-year-old adult rabbits, but showed no difference in shape at primary culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. FGF8 induced the production of proMMP-3 by cultured chondrocytes, and anti-FGF8 antibody attenuated the release of these factors. MMP-3 plays an important role in cartilage degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and is a major factor in the catabolism of cartilage macromolecules. MMP-3 resolves proteoglycan in the ECM and also activates the other MMPs that participate in the degradation of the matrix in joints. MMP-3 is increased both in cartilage and in synovial membranes from OA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In our study, FGF8 induced the production of proMMP-3 and significantly decreased the residual amount of S-GAG in the ECM in cultured chondrocytes. These data indicate that FGF8 can promote the destruction of articular cartilage by the induction of factors such as MMP-3 and PGE<sub>2 </sub>in joints.</p><p>FGF8 and IL-1 synergistically accelerated the degradation of the ECM. The participation of synovial inflammation in the progression of cartilage changes at the clinical stage of OA is becoming increasingly obvious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A number of clinical studies demonstrate a clear association between inflammation and disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A large number of inflammatory factors, such as IL-1 and TNF&#x003b1;, are synthesized within inflamed synovium and play an important role in articular destruction in OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In cultured chondrocytes, degradation of the ECM induced by FGF8 was further enhanced by a small amount of IL-1. Anti-FGF8 antibody blocked this FGF8 with IL-1-induced degradation of the ECM. IL-1 causes both matrix degradation and downregulation of proteoglycan synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but further studies are required to clarify whether FGF8 also downregulates ECM synthesis.</p><p>FGF8 induced the production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>from cultured chondrocytes. PGE<sub>2 </sub>is the major prostaglandin in the synovial fluid of OA patients, and is produced by IL-1-stimulated chondrocytes and synoviocytes from OA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Cartilage specimens from OA patients spontaneously release more PGE<sub>2 </sub>than does normal cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, are commonly used to control pain and inflammation in OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These drugs inhibit the production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>and consequently relieve pain caused by PGE<sub>2</sub>. In the present study, a low concentration of anti-FGF8 antibody markedly inhibited the production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>by cultured chondrocytes. Anti-FGF8 antibody might be expected to provide an analgesic effect because it inhibits PGE<sub>2 </sub>production by chondrocytes.</p><p>FGF8 induced joint destruction <italic>in vivo</italic>. Injection of FGF8 into the rat knee joints promoted the release of S-GAG from cartilage into the synovial fluid. Following injection of FGF8, the weight of the patella was reduced. Further study is required to determine whether FGF8 induces morphological change as shown in OA. Many of the etiologic factors responsible for OA are related to the breakdown of extracellular macromolecules. FGFs are one of the candidates that cause progression of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. FGF2 has various physiological effects on bone and cartilage metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. FGF2, which is expressed ubiquitously in mesodermal and neuroectodermal cells, has various physiological functions. In the present study, we have demonstrated that FGF8 is selectively expressed in injured joints. Cartilage degradation is induced by exogenous FGF8. These results indicate that FGF8 is one of the selective mediators of arthritis. FGF8 is involved in the process of limb and facial morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Further studies are required of whether FGF8 has a physiological function in maturing of joints and diseases in children such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>FGF8 is expressed in synovial cells and concentration-dependently enhances growth of cultured synovial cells. It is possible that FGF8 promotes growth of synovial cells via autocrine signaling. FGF8 also induced degradation of the ECM in cultured chondrocytes. These studies suggest that the injury of synovia induces the expression of FGF8 in the joint, and this may promote degradation of cartilage via a paracrine system. The bone weight of the patella was decreased following an injection of FGF8 into the rat joint. Synovial hyperplasia is known to initiate bone and cartilage erosions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Bone degradation following intraarticular injection of FGF8 may therefore be due to the growth of synovial cells and also production of various factors from synoviocytes, fibroblasts, or other cells. FGF8 can induce cartilage and bone degradation to cause the arthritis-like syndromes and possibly aggravate the pathology of OA. Other factors such as mechanical stress, cytokines, and inflamed cells are also important for cartilage degeneration. Further studies are required to elucidate the contribution of FGF8 on bone absorption and joint destruction.</p><p>Anti-FGF8 antibody not only reduced cartilage degradation induced by the injection of FGF8 in the joints, but also decreased cartilage degradation in the MIA-induced rat arthritis model. These data indicate that systemic application of anti-FGF8 antibody protects the FGF8-dependent cartilage degradation. The use of MIA to chemically induce degenerative arthritis was first described by Kalbhen and Blum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and subsequently by other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The injection of MIA into the knees of rats provides a model where lesions resemble some aspects of human OA. The amounts of MMP were significantly elevated after the injection of MIA. This model has been used for the development of chondroprotective drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Anti-FGF8 antibody inhibited release of S-GAG in the MIA-induced arthritis model. Anti-FGF8 antibody suppressed the production of proMMP-3 and PGE<sub>2 </sub>from cultured chondrocytes. These findings provide evidence for the potential use of anti-FGF8 antibody in the treatment of articular tissue degradation and pain in OA. An anti-FGF8 antibody is expected to attenuate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. We are studying the effects of anti-FGF8 antibody on collagen-induced arthritis and on adjuvant-induced arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated that the expression of FGF8 on synovia is increased in an experimental model of OA in rabbits. FGF8 induced production of MMP-3 and PGE<sub>2</sub>, and caused degradation of the ECM <italic>in vitro</italic>. Degradation of S-GAG was detected by intraarticular injection of FGF8 in rats. Anti-FGF8 antibody attenuates the destruction of cartilage in the MIA-induced arthritis model. These data indicate that FGF8 has a possible pathophysiological role in the degradation of cartilage in OA models.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BSA = bovine serum albumin; DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ECM = extracellular matrix; FBS = fetal bovine serum; FGF = fibroblast growth factor; FGFR = fibroblast growth factor receptor; H&#x00026;E = hematoxylin and eosin; IL = interleukin; MIA = monoiodoacetic acid; MMP = matrix metalloproteinase; OA = osteoarthritis; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PGE<sub>2 </sub>= prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>; S-GAG = sulfated glycosaminoglycan.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>MU, TT, TS and IM are employees of Kyowa Hakko Kogyo.
