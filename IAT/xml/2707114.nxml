We found that Rab4b was localized in endosomal structures in preadipocytes whereas in adipocytes it was localized in GLUT4 and in VAMP2-positive compartments, and also in endosomal compartments containing the transferrin receptor (TfR). When Rab4b expression was decreased with specific siRNAs by two fold, an extent similar to its decrease in obese diabetic subjects, we observed a small increase (25&#x00025;) in basal deoxyglucose uptake and a more sustained increase (40&#x00025;) in presence of submaximal and maximal insulin concentrations. This increase occurred without any change in GLUT4 and GLUT1 expression levels and in the insulin signaling pathways.

It is mainly expressed in cells that exhibit insulin-regulated glucose uptake, <italic>i.e</italic> adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. The intracellular trafficking of GLUT4 is a major determinant of the acute regulation of glucose transport in these cells. In basal state, GLUT4 is present in intracellular locations, referred to as the sequestration compartments, from which it undergoes insulin dependent movement to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Bryant1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In type 2 diabetic patients, alterations in GLUT4 translocation arise from defects in insulin signalling and in GLUT4 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Smith1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, GLUT4 appears mis-located in muscles and adipocytes of diabetic patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Garvey1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Maianu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> or in omental adipocytes of women with gestational diabetes, even when its expression remains normal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Garvey2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, the machinery that regulates GLUT4 trafficking could be altered in insulin-responsive cells of diabetic patients. Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling GLUT4 trafficking and their alteration in insulin-resistant situations thus represents a major issue for understanding this pathology.</p><p>Small GTPases of the Rab family are main organizers of intracellular trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Jordens1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

However Rab8 and Rab14 would act in muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Ishikura2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> whereas Rab10 would be more important in adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Sano1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Rab31, a Rab5 family member, participates in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Insulin delocalizes its exchanger Gapex-5 to the plasma membrane and inhibits Rab31 activity, thus potentiating insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Lodhi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we first aimed at determining whether the expression of Rab proteins of the endocytic recycling pathway was modified in adipose tissues from obese diabetic subjects. We found that Rab4b expression was modified in adipose tissues from both diabetic obese human and mice. It has already been proposed that Rab4a, that possesses 93&#x00025; of homology with Rab4b, could play a role in GLUT4 trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Cormont2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Cormont3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Knight1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Vollenweider1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, at least in part through its interaction with the Rab4a effector Rabip4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Mari1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and with the kinesin KIF3B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Imamura1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of Rab4b is unknown and we thus aimed at determining whether Rab4b could be involved in the control of GLUT4 localization and glucose transport in adipocytes. First, we showed that Rab4b is mainly located with GLUT4, in its sequestration compartment and in TfR containing endosomes. Rab4b is thus the first Rab protein identified in the GLUT4-sequestration compartment. Second, using different approaches we showed that the inhibition of Rab4b expression resulted in GLUT4 localization changes, with an equilibrium redistribution towards the plasma membranes and probably its sequestration compartments. We thus postulate that Rab4b could be involved in GLUT4 trafficking cycles that allow for GLUT4 intracellular retention in basal conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Modifications of some Rabs of the endocytic recycling pathway in diabetes</title><p>Because defects in GLUT4 trafficking could participate in insulin-resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Garvey1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Maianu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, we determined whether the expression of Rabs involved in endocytic recycling was modified in adipose tissues from obese diabetic mice and humans. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005257-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows that the expression of Rab4a and Rab4b mRNAs, and IRS1 mRNA used as a control, was significantly decreased in the epididymal adipose tissues from the obese diabetic <italic>db/db</italic> animals, compared to their lean control (<italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;) mice.

By using three experimental approaches we found that the down regulation of Rab4b expression was accompanied by a change in GLUT4 subcellular location towards the plasma membrane. First, we observed in basal conditions an increased number of adipocytes with a GLUT4 rim, a characteristic image of adipocyte with plasma membrane GLUT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005257-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Interestingly, the down regulation of Rab4a did not induce obvious GLUT4 subcellular distribution modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005257.s005">Figure S4</xref>).

Second, very few of these vesicles were sensitive to ablation (condition with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Because the total GLUT4 amount was unchanged in lysates, the results suggest that in normal condition nearly half of intracellular GLUT4 were outside the TfR containing endosomes and, more importantly, that GLUT4 appears to be mainly excluded from endosomes when Rab4b is down regulated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Rab proteins are main players of intracellular vesicular traffic because they control the transport of vesicles between two adjacent organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Jordens1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The identification of Rab proteins associated with the GLUT4 sequestration compartments represents a major challenge to understand the GLUT4 recycling pathway.

It is thus not surprising that a large number of Rabs has been found associated with GLUT4, because GLUT4 traffics through numerous organelles on top of its sequestration compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Bryant1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The method of choice to determine which Rabs localize in GLUT4 sequestration compartment is thus indirect immufluorescence using confocal microscopy. The lack of antibodies recognizing endogenous Rab in immunofluorescence has likely restrained such studies, and only one describes a small colocalization of Rab14 with GLUT4 positive vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Larance1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The Rab proteins specifically associated with the GLUT4-sequestration compartments thus remain to be identified and our results strongly suggest that Rab4b is one of them. Indeed, we found Rab4b widely located with GLUT4, thus indicating that under basal condition Rab4b localized in most of the numerous GLUT4 compartments, including the GLUT4-sequestration one. In accordance, the majority of VAMP2-containing structures, known to correspond to the GLUT4 sequestration compartments, are also labelled by Rab4b. Rab4b is thus the first Rab of these specialized compartments, but it is also found in TfR-containing endosomes. This endosomal localization in adipocytes could explain why Rab4b is mainly colocalized with the endosomal marker Rab4a in fibroblasts and not in adipocytes. Indeed, the GLUT4 sequestration compartment is absent in fibroblast and is formed along the adipocyte differentiation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Govers1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data concerning Rab4b localization are strengthened by the fact that the extent of colocalisation between Rab4a and GLUT4 is low, whereas Rab4a is essentially colocalized with TfR. To circumvent the lack of antibodies able to detect endogenous Rab4b by immunofluorescence, we used the GFP-tag as the Rab location reporter. This fusion protein is predicted to have similar functions and thus the same location as the wild type Rab4b. Indeed, N-terminal GFP fusion with Rab proteins does not affect their functionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-BuvelotFrei1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and GFP-Rab4b co-localized with the Rab4b fused with a smaller tag (HA-Rab4b). We used a retrovirus infection in order to obtain a low level of exogenous Rab4b expression unlikely to impair their localization and organelle morphology (less than 2 fold). We further observed that a higher expression of GFP-Rab4b did not impair its extent of colocalization with GLUT4.</p><p>Because Rab4b is present in early endosomes as well as in the GLUT4 sequestration compartment, it could play a role in its traffic between these two compartments. If such is the case, the inhibition of Rab4b function should interfere with GLUT4 recycling and probably with insulin-induced glucose transport. Decreasing the expression levels of Rab4b mRNA by 60&#x00025; yields to a small increase in basal glucose uptake and a more sustained effect at a physiological and maximal concentration of insulin. The insulin effect remained similar in control and anti Rab4b siRNA treated adipocytes. The down regulation of Rab4a expression, by contrast, did not changed basal nor insulin-induced glucose transport. However, previous studies using overexpression of Rab4a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Cormont2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> or of the Rab4a effector Rabip4 led to the conclusion that Rab4a was involved in GLUT4 trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Mari1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. One explanation could be that Rab4b could fulfil Rab4a function in its absence. It should also be kept in mind that Rab4a is weakly expressed compared to Rab4b in adipocyte. Further, Rabip4 is an effector of both Rab4a and Rab4b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Monzo1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This increase in glucose uptake observed with Rab4b siRNA treatment could be explained by the presence of more GLUT4 molecules at the plasma membrane, as evidenced by multiple experimental approaches. Our results indicate that decreasing the amount of Rab4b perturbs the location of GLUT4, but not that of TfR. Rab4b would thus act on a trafficking step which does not involve the classical endosomal recycling, but specifically concerns the GLUT4-sequestration compartment. Furthermore, the increase in plasma membrane GLUT4 in basal condition does not appear to result from a decrease in GLUT4 endocytosis or from a transfer of GLUT4 towards the endocytic compartments, as indicated by the Tf-HRP induced endosomal ablation. This would be indeed predicted from recent results showing that an increase in GLUT4 amount at the plasma membrane in basal and insulin conditions could be due to a redistribution of GLUT4 from its sequestration compartment to the endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Blot1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, a possible mechanism could be that Rab4b is involved in the intracellular retention machinery of GLUT4 both in basal and in insulin-stimulated conditions. Rab4b could be involved in a GLUT4 cycle between the sequestration compartment and plasma membrane or/and between the sequestration compartment and other intracellular organelles, as schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005257-g010">figure 10</xref>. The function of Rab4b seems however to differ from that of Rab31. Indeed, Rab31 knock-down does not favour plasma membrane GLUT4 localization in basal condition. Furthermore, Rab31 potentiates insulin action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Lodhi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas the efficiency of insulin to recruit GLUT4 at the plasma membrane is unaffected by the inhibition of Rab4b expression. Rab4b function also differs from that of Rab4a. Indeed, in absence of coupling of Rab4a with its effector Rabip4, GLUT4 traffic between endosomes and the sequestration compartment is altered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005257-Mari1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. When Rab4b expression is decreased, intracellular GLUT4 is mainly in its sequestration compartment thus suggesting that trafficking between endosomes and the sequestration compartment occurs. The next steps will be to determine the exact trafficking event(s) controlled by Rab4b. The challenge will be to develop new experimental strategies to invalidate more efficiently Rab4b and to characterize specific Rab4b effectors in adipocytes.</p><fig id="pone-0005257-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005257.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the putative role of Rab4b in GLUT4 trafficking control.</title><p>TfR (transferrin receptor in orange) and GLUT4 (in green) continuously recycle between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane.
