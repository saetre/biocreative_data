Camptothecin (CPT) inhibits topoisomerase I (Topo I) and is one of the DSB-inducing reagents for which the action mechanism has been characterized in detail. The drug reversibly abolishes the religation activity of Topo I to generate SSBs to which the protein is covalently linked. DSBs arise when replication forks collide with the SSBs and run off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pommier et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, CPT-induced DSBs are largely replication dependent. Eukaryotes have two pathways for repairing DSBs: homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). The relative contribution of these two DSB repair pathways seems to differ depending on the cell cycle; HR occurs more frequently in the S and G2 phases, and NHEJ is most efficient in the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Takata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Essers et al., 2000</xref>). For these reasons, CPT-induced replication-dependent DSBs are usually repaired by the HR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnaudeau et al., 2001</xref>). The choice of these two DSB repair pathways is likely to be decided by a molecular mechanism activated immediately after DSB formation.</p><p>Poly-ADP ribosylation is a posttranslational modification catalyzed by poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and PARP-2 and is one of the earliest cellular responses to DNA damage. PARP-1 and -2 bind to the damage sites and activate themselves by automodification. This process causes chromatin decondensation around damage sites, recruitment of repair machineries such as DNA ligase III&#x02013;XRCC-1 base excision repair complexes, and accelerates DNA damage repair, especially in the case of SSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caldecott et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Masson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leppard et al., 2003</xref>). PARP-1 also seems to affect DSB repair because PARP-1&#x02013;deficient cells are hypersensitive to DSB-inducing agents, especially to CPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chatterjee et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pommier et al., 2003</xref>). Biochemical studies showed that NHEJ proteins such as Ku and DNA-PK are poly-ADP ribosylated by PARP-1, and the affinity of Ku to DSBs was decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ariumi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galande and Kohwi-Shigematsu, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, a genetic study showed that PARP-1 could protect the HR pathway from toxic interference by Ku70 (in DT40 and mammalian cells) in response to CPT-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hochegger et al., 2006</xref>). These studies suggest that PARP-1 can interfere with NHEJ, which might be unfavorable for DSB repair in S phase and provide access for the HR machineries. These findings have also suggested the possibility that PARP-1 is involved in the regulation of replication fork progression coupled with HR-dependent DSB repair via its poly-ADP ribosylation activity. However, the role of PARP-1 in HR-coupled replication fork modulation in vivo has not been fully investigated.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the contributions of PARP-1 to the progression of replication forks on CPT-damaged DNA using an in vivo replication labeling assay and a dynamic molecular combing technique that allowed us to analyze the progression of individual replication forks in vivo. Interestingly, the addition of CPT significantly slowed down fork progression when PARP-1 was active, whereas inhibition or deficiency of PARP-1 resulted in unchanged fork progression rates in the presence of CPT. We also found that this slowing down of the replication fork in wild-type cells depended on the HR pathway, which was diminished in PARP-1 knockout cells as a result of negative interference by Ku.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Previous studies showed that PARP-1 interacted with some replication fork machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dantzer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frouin et al., 2003</xref>). To test for a possible association between PARP-1 and replication forks in our experimental system, we examined the immunofluorescence of PARP-1 and replicating DNA in mouse fibroblast cells, m5S. We found that PARP-1 is likely to interact with replication forks because some of the PARP-1 foci in the nucleus colocalized with replication foci throughout S phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Next, PARP-1&#x02013;enhanced YFP (EYFP) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)&#x02013;RFP were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and BrdU pulse labeling was performed. We found that in S phase, PARP-1&#x02013;EYFP was adjacent or colocalized to PCNA-RFP and BrdU foci (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Similar results were also observed when we transiently expressed Topo I&#x02013;DsRed instead of PCNA-RFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In BrdU-negative cells, PARP-1&#x02013;EYFP was enriched in nucleoli as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yung et al., 2004</xref>) and did not form any foci as seen in S-phase cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). We confirmed that a fraction of PARP-1&#x02013;EYFP seemed to colocalize to PCNA- and BrdU-containing foci in HeLa cells. Again, PARP-1&#x02013;EYFP appeared to be concentrated in nucleoli in nonreplicating HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of PARP-1 to the replicating genomic region.</bold> (A) Digoxigenin&#x02013;deoxy-UTP was introduced into m5S cells to label replicating cells.

Before analysis of replication fork kinetics, we evaluated poly-ADP ribosylation activity after CPT treatment and the inhibitory effect of NU1025. CPT-induced DNA damage is largely replication dependent. In fact, &#x003b3;-H2AX foci were detected only in the presence of CPT in S-phase nuclei (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). First, we performed Western blotting to detect poly-ADP ribosylated proteins using FITC-NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> as a substrate. Compared with untreated cells, the poly-ADP ribosylation level in CPT-treated cells was higher over a wide size range of proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). NU1025 treatment led to the disappearance of poly-ADP ribosylated proteins. Using fluorescence microscope analysis, we confirmed that poly-ADP ribosylation was inhibited by NU1025 in the presence of CPT and found that NU1025 sensitized cells to CPT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>A PARP inhibitor abrogates CPT-induced replication fork slowing.</bold> (A) m5S cells were labeled with digoxigenin&#x02013;deoxy-UTP and release cultured in the presence of CPT.

To measure the rate of fork progression, HeLa cells were pulse labeled for 20 min with IdU followed by CldU for 20 min in the presence or absence of CPT. After genomic DNA preparation and dynamic molecular combing, IdU- and CldU-labeled DNA were immunostained with each appropriate antibody. This allows use of the first label, which is always incorporated under normal circumstances, to normalize the second-label fork rate for differences in fork rates that are intrinsic to different forks. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 (E and F)</xref> shows typical images of replicating DNA in cells treated as indicated. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref> shows the histogram of the distribution of the ratio of fork rates during first and second pulse label. Saturating amounts of CPT were added during CldU labeling. The mean ratio in CPT-treated HeLa cells was about twofold higher compared with untreated cells. If CPT-induced DSBs decrease the rates of replication fork progression in a PARP-1&#x02013;dependent manner, a PARP inhibitor should affect the replication fork progression kinetics. Interestingly, a similar mean ratio was observed in NU1025-treated cells in spite of CPT treatment during CldU pulse label. These results indicated that NU1025 counteracted the fork slowing induced by CPT. This result was confirmed in another cell line, m5S (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806068/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806068/DC1</ext-link>). These results were also evident when the distribution of fork rates during IdU and CldU labeling was quantified and plotted. Compared with the fork rates during IdU labeling, the entire distribution of fork rates shifted to slower fork rates during CldU labeling after CPT addition, and this decrease was reversed by NU1025 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 H</xref>). These results suggest that PARP activity could be responsible for lower rates of fork progression in response to CPT-induced DNA damage in mammalian cells.</p><p>To further evaluate the effect of PARP on replication forks, PARP-1 was reduced with a PARP-1&#x02013;specific siRNA. PARP-1 was effectively decreased in HeLa cells at 48 and 72 h after transfection of two individual siRNAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Compared with cells transfected with the negative control siRNA, the poly-ADP ribosylation level was decreased to the background level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The ratio of fork rates during IdU and CldU labeling was about twofold higher in cells transfected with PARP-1&#x02013;specific siRNA compared with those with the negative control siRNA in the presence of CPT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Consistent with this result, the entire distribution of fork rates during CldU labeling shifted to faster fork rates in the presence of CPT in those cells transfected with the PARP-1 siRNAs compared with cells transfected with negative control siRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).

Second, Topo I&#x02013;DNA covalent complexes that encounter replication forks lead to the formation of DSBs. PARP may suppress the toxic effect of NHEJ-mediated repair, which may result in chromosomal translocation and thereby indirectly facilitate accurate HR-mediated DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hochegger et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To address a role of PARP-1 in SSB repair (SSBR), we analyzed the rate of fork progression in polymerase &#x003b2;&#x02013;deficient DT40 cells, but CPT-induced fork slowing was not reversed in <italic>polymerase &#x003b2;</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (Fig. S2, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806068/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806068/DC1</ext-link>).

To confirm the dependency of the PARP-1 phenotype on Ku, we investigated the rate of fork progression using <italic>PARP-1</italic>/<italic>Ku70<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells that stably expressed exogenous Ku70. As expected, the fork rates did not decrease after CPT addition, which is similar to the PARP-1 single mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> and Fig. S3). Collectively, these results suggest that progression of the replication fork can be modulated by the HR pathway when replication forks collide with CPT-induced DNA damage. This activity clearly depends on PARP-1, which seems to function as a safeguard against the NHEJ pathway on stalled replication forks.</p><p>In this study, we found that PARP-1 can slow replication forks in response to DNA damage induced by CPT. We focused on the PARP-1&#x02013;related repair pathways and found that the HR-dependent repair pathway may be involved in the modulation of fork progression on damaged templates in vertebrate cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Previous studies indicated that PARP-1 interacts with the Ku&#x02013;DNA-PK complex that is required for the NHEJ pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ariumi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galande and Kohwi-Shigematsu, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2004</xref>), and PARP-1 poly-ADP ribosylates Ku, decreasing the binding affinity of Ku to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2004</xref>). After these observations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hochegger et al. (2006)</xref> suggested a biological role of the interaction of PARP-1 and NHEJ factors, proposing that PARP-1 minimized the suppressive effect of Ku and the NHEJ pathway on HR after replication fork collapse. Consequently, PARP-1 deficiency could result in reduced efficiency of HR because of the presence of Ku, resulting in enhanced progression of the replication fork. A previous study supports this idea, which found that replication fork arrest or slowing on damaged chromosomes was induced in an HR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Henry-Mowatt et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, the reason why concomitant deletion of Ku70 in <italic>PARP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mutants resulted in fork slowing in response to CPT is likely to be reestablishment of HR-mediated DSB repair processes.</p><p>We think the reason why fork rates in <italic>PARP-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells were the same as those of wild-type cells in the presence of CPT because of the following points. A mutant of the checkpoint protein, Hus1, showed normal replication fork rates in the presence of CPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). This mutant is also deficient in the HR process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Intriguingly, PCNA dissociates from chromatin in response to CPT treatment in wild-type cells but not in the Hus1 mutant, indicating that restoration of chromatin binding of PCNA appears to be associated with a normal rate of fork progression in the presence of CPT. However, another study reported that Ku facilitated the association of PCNA to chromatin in response to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Park et al., 2004</xref>), so it is conceivable that restoration of chromatin binding of PCNA by Ku associates with normal fork rates on damaged DNA in PARP-1 or HR-defective cells. Indeed, we found that the chromatin-bound PCNA decreased in response to CPT but not in the presence of NU1025 (unpublished data). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heller and Marians (2006)</xref> showed that replication could be restarted and that leading-strand synthesis reinitiated downstream of an unrepaired block to leading-strand progression. If this occurs downstream of a DSB, de novo loading of PCNA by Ku might facilitate the restart. Further in-depth investigations are required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>We also suggest an alternative plausible model. Recently, the molecular details of a cytotoxic mechanism for CPT were suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koster et al., 2007</xref>). They suggested that the accumulation of positive supercoils was induced by CPT ahead of the replication machinery and that DNA damages were induced within the supercoil. If PARP-1 or HR is deficient, Ku-mediated chromosomal translocation might occur within the supercoil. Presumably, the replication fork could then move on the translocated chromosome. However, we do not have any evidence to support this hypothesis.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that PARP-1 activity influences replication fork progression when replication forks collapse at CPT-induced single-strand gaps. The target of PARP-1 activity in this novel mechanism appears to be Ku, which interferes with HR-dependent DSB repair at the collapsed replication fork.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and drug treatment</title><p>HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and m5S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sasaki and Kodama, 1987</xref>) were grown in DME supplemented with 10% FBS at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
