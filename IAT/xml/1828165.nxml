Its 162 aa protein core is extensively O-glycosylated, which results in a doubling of the molecular weight up to 45 kDa. The podoplanin mRNA was identified for the first time in the murine osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and later it was found to be expressed in murine colon carcinoma and melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], in the stromal cells of peripheral lymphoid tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], in skeletal muscle, heart, placenta, lung, skin, bone and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Podoplanin has also been detected in the ciliary epithelium of the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], in transformed epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and in the choroid plexus and neuronal cells of the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In our lab, podoplanin has been discovered as a membrane protein of glomerular epithelial cells, which was found to be downregulated in puromycin nephrosis and caused a flattening of podocytes, hence its designation "podoplanin" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, podoplanin has been found in endothelia of lymphatic vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and has been established as a discrimination marker between lymphatic (LEC's) and blood endothelial cells (BEC's) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The widespread localization of podoplanin has lead to a multiplicity of synonyms for its expression forms of human, murine and rat origin: murine OTS-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], gp38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], T1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], PA2.26 antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], RANDAM-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] or Aggrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], rat E11 antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or RTI40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and human gp36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The exact biological function of podoplanin remains controversial and seems to be versatile. Though its highly abundant expression in a multiplicity of tissues, distinct cell-specificities and functions have been described. In the lung, podoplanin has been shown to be restricted to type I lung alveolar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], where it also functions as the main receptor for influenza C virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Also quite early, podoplanin has been described as a platelet aggregating factor in murine and human colon carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and murine melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Podoplanin/T1&#x003b1; deficiency in mice lead to disruption of normal lymphatic vasculature formation and development of lymphedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, podoplanin has been demonstrated to bind chemokines in the lymphatic vessels of renal transplants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and to promote cell motility by downregulating E-cadherin expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recent studies, therefore, have focussed on its potential role as a key player in tumour vessel formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and as a tumour progression factor in skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and germ line carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Podoplanin becomes upregulated in cells of the invasive cancer front, where it induces filopodia formation and promotes tumour cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Rat podoplanin/E11 has been reported to be a marker for late steps in the differentiation pathway of the osteoblastic lineage, being expressed by mature osteoblasts and newly formed osteocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The human osteosarcoma cell lines MG63 and Saos-2 used in this study represent differentiated late stage osteoblasts, nonetheless showing different degrees of maturation. Whereas MG63 cells exhibit a premature fibroblast-like state, Saos-2 cells display an epithelial phenotype and appear more rounded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Podoplanin/E11 was detected in a restricted subset of osteoblastic cells which is in direct contact with bone matrix, suggesting a functional role as an anti-adherent molecule according to its high sialic acid content. Nevertheless, the function of podoplanin in the bone is unknown.</p><p>Despite considerable progress that has been made in describing the expression pattern of podoplanin under normal and various pathological conditions, little is known about the mechanisms leading to the widespread gene activity of podoplanin. Due to its certain specificities and potential role in tumour progression, the regulation of <italic>PDPN </italic>gene expression is of high interest. In an early study, podoplanin/OTS-8 could be induced by phorbolester in the mouse osteoblastic cells MC3T3-E1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and therefore it was defined as a target gene for early response proteins. However, the molecular mechanism underlying podoplanin expression in osteoblasts remains largely unclear. In rat alveolar type I cells, Sp1 elements and a thyroid transcription (TGT3/HNF-3) factor site have been identified as essential for transcriptional activation of podoplanin/T1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In lymphatic endothelial cells, podoplanin/T1&#x003b1; is an early responder to the lymphatic-specific master regulator Prox-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and recently, podoplanin expression was shown to be under control of endogenously produced IL-3 in human lymphatic endothelial precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, no direct cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements involved in cell-specific upregulation of human podoplanin have been elucidated so far.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate a cell-specific difference between MG63 and Saos-2 cells in the binding of nuclear proteins to sequences immediately adjacent and more distal to the transcription start site of the <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter. We identify four Sp1/Sp3 binding-sites inside a 654 bp element upstream of the <italic>PDPN </italic>gene and establish that two of them mediate basal transcription in MG63 cells, whereas Saos-2 cells seem to lack sufficient amounts of nuclear Sp1/Sp3 for <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter activation. We show that these two functional Sp-binding sites may involve further activator elements. Moreover, we assess the functional hierarchy of another regulatory system, the chromatin modification, which is strongly altered in MG63 versus Saos-2 cells distal of the core promoter and leads to enhanced expression of podoplanin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Podoplanin mRNA expression in the human osteoblastic cell lines MG63 and Saos-2</title><p>To identify cell lines which are positive for podoplanin expression, reverse transcription PCRs were performed with a series of human cell lines of different origin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line MG63 exhibited a strong RT-PCR signal, whereas Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells lacked it. This result was confirmed by real-time PCR analyses showing that MG63 cells contained three logs more podoplanin mRNA transcripts than Saos-2 cells. While in MG63 cells the podoplanin mRNA population represented approximately 3% of GAPDH mRNA population, it made up just 0.003% in Saos-2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). A Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of two podoplanin transcript variants in MG63 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). A 2.8 kb transcript corresponding to the full length mRNA was seen, and a shorter species was detected at 1.1 kb. As determined by 3' RACE analysis using MG63-derived cDNA, this short mRNA species represented a transcriptional variant ending after a cryptic polyA-signal at bp 345 of the 2068 bp 3'-UTR (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Podoplanin mRNA transcription and transcriptional initiation in the human osteoblast-like cell line MG63</bold>.

Thus, MG63 and Saos-2 cells proved to be a suitable cell system for investigation of transcriptional podoplanin regulation. To assess which portions of the promoter were involved in regulation of podoplanin expression, reporter plasmids harboring progressive deletions from the 5' end of the bp -1885/+171 <italic>PDPN </italic>flanking region were set according to putative binding sites of transcription factors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The sixteen promoter fragments were inserted upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and were evaluated in transient expression analyses. Luciferase transcription was consistently 30 times more active in MG63 than in Saos-2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In MG63 cells, bp -1104/+171 construct provided highest promoter activity (761 Luc/Ren &#x000d7; 100), whereas Saos-2 cells exhibited highest normalized luciferase activity with bp -498/+171 construct (27 Luc/Ren &#x000d7; 100). Transcriptional activity diminished progressively with further deletion of the 5' region, showing three activity minima with the constructs bp -666/+171, -261/+171 and -76/+171 in MG63 cells, and with constructs bp -186/+171 and -76/+171 in Saos-2 cells, which indicated the loss of positive regulatory elements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The low promoter activity of the smallest bp -26/+171 construct in both cell lines suggested that the 171 bp spanning 5'-UTR of podoplanin mRNA was not involved in upregulation of promoter activity.

To test the binding of Sp-proteins to these elements, supershift analyses with anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies were performed. When anti-Sp1 antibody was added, complex I disappeared in favor of a supershifted band, which showed the predominant contribution of Sp1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lanes Sp1). Addition of anti-Sp3 antibody blocked protein-DNA binding, which resulted in loss of complex II, whereas no supershifted complex appeared (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lanes Sp3). When used together, Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies supershifted or inhibited both complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lanes Sp1+Sp3).

Nevertheless, coexpression of both, Sp1 and Sp3, further increased promoter activity up to 21-fold. Since Sp1 activity was not decreased in the presence of pPac-Sp3, Sp3 seemingly did not compete with Sp1 for binding to the same site. The same effects were visible on a reduced level with mutant variant Sp.4-1mut and pGL3-Basic, indicating background activity of these constructs.

Sp1 activated both constructs up to 1.4-fold in both cell lines.

Cell viability was tested by increasing concentrations of the agents over a cultivation period of 3 days to exclude mRNA downregulation effects upon apoptosis. Then, cells were treated either with 5-azaCdR and TSA alone or with 5-azaCdR followed by TSA, and podoplanin mRNA amounts were analyzed by quantitative Northern blot analysis. In Saos-2 cells, the drugs were not able to initiate <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of podoplanin mRNA (data not shown), which demonstrated that lack of <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription was not under epigenetic control. In MG63 cells, variations of both podoplanin mRNA bands seen in Northern blot were evaluated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). 5-azaCdR treatment did not change <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription levels when compared to untreated cells, while 0.6 &#x003bc;M TSA lead to a respective 28% and 48% reduction of <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription.

Complete i<italic>n vitro </italic>methylation of the promoter plasmids pGL3(-1885/+171) and pGL3(-857/+171) lead to more than 90% loss of promoter activity in MG63 and Saos-2 cells, indicating that the vectors were susceptible to inhibition by methylation. To further assess promoter activity upon selective methylation of defined promoter regions, fragments bp -1885/+171 and -857/+171, or fragments bp -1885/-189 and -825/-189, which comprised the region that wasmethylated <italic>in vivo </italic>in MG63 cells, were generated by restriction digest with <italic>Sac</italic>I/<italic>Xho</italic>I or <italic>Sac</italic>I/<italic>Apa</italic>I, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>). The four fragments were methylated by <italic>Sss</italic>I methylase or mock-methylated, religated into the unmethylated reporter plasmid backbone and transfected into MG63 and Saos-2 cells. <italic>In vitro </italic>methylation of all promoter CpGs until bp +171 revealed a weak trend towards transcriptional deactivation being more pronounced in Saos-2 than in MG63 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>). This result supported the observation that methylation of site Sp1.2 did not affect Sp1/Sp3 binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>). Conversely, selective methylation of CpG sites upstream of bp -189 containing 35 or 24 CpG sites, respectively, led to considerable promoter activity increase versus mock methylated constructs, which added up to more than 40% and 30% in MG63 and to more than 25% and 60% in Saos-2 cells. These data indicated that a putative methylation-dependent enhancement mechanism, possibly efficiently altering chromatin structure, was able to act on <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of the <italic>PDPN </italic>gene promoter region in human osteoblast-like cell lines. It was our aim to clarify which mechanisms account for cell type-specific expression of podoplanin in MG63 versus Saos-2 cells, as direct regulators of <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription in human systems have not been elucidated yet. We show that <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription was initiated from several start sites within 97 bp, the most 3' located transcript of which corresponded to the major initiation site in the murine and rat gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Generally, the <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter seems to belong to the group of regulative genomic entities which are characterized by the absence of a consensus TATA and CAAT box, by a high GC content and multiple potential binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1. Such genes are usually either ubiquitously expressed (e.g. housekeeping genes) or are growth related, as for instance dihydrofolate reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Nonetheless, genes possessing these features have been identified to be expressed in tissue-specific manner, e.g. RAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or thioredoxin reductase 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The chosen promoter fragments indeed conferred intense transcriptional activity in MG63 but not in Saos-2 cells, indicating the presence of differentially bound positive regulators.</p><p>Functional analyses of the proximal <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter revealed four potential Sp1/Sp3-binding sites and the key roles of two of these at bp -700/-696 (site Sp.4) and bp -100/-95 bp (site Sp.2) for constitutive activation in both, MG63 as well as Saos-2 cells. Sp1 has been the first mammalian transcription factor to be cloned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and invariably activates transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], whereas Sp3, dependent on the position of the element within the intact promoter and the number of Sp binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], is able to either enhance or suppress transcription. Sp1 and Sp3 have been described to be involved in the regulation of osteoblast-specific genes like beta 5 integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], osteocalcin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], or alpha2 (XI) collagen (COL11A2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] yet. The role of the more distal site Sp.4, which was conserved in the rat promoter, has not been described elsewhere, whereas site Sp.3 was not conserved. Binding site Sp.2 was conserved between human, rodent and bos tauris <italic>PDPN </italic>sequence, and its activating role has previously been demonstrated in rat type I alveolar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Also binding site Sp.1 was conserved between humans and rodents.</p><p>The effect of Sp protein transactivation on the <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter was seen pronounced in <italic>Drosophila </italic>SL2 cells. Interestingly, Sp1 and Sp3 seemed to regulate <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription in a contrarious, yet overall cooperative manner. The results demonstrated a strong positive effect of Sp1 on the <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter, whereas Sp3 acted as repressor. In MG63 and Saos-2 cells, a repressive effect of Sp3 was not observed, which, however, may be masked by concurring Sp1-binding through endogenously present Sp1. On the other hand, Sp protein overexpression effects were not very pronounced in these cells, presumably by the same reason of intrinsic Sp protein background. One could argue that Sp1 or Sp3 were not essentially important to control <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter activity, but when considering the generally low transfection rates of less than 10% in MG63 cells, an overall 1.8-fold promoter activation corresponded to a 12-fold induction of promoter activity if all cells were transfected. Sp3 stimulated the <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter in Saos-2 cells stronger than in MG63 cells, which can be explained through a more potent effect due to the lowered nuclear Sp3 amounts as seen from Western blotting. Additionally, this effect might have resulted from generally better transfection efficiencies in Saos-2 cells. Real-time PCR analyses then convincingly demonstrated the effect of Sp-proteins on endogenous <italic>PDPN </italic>gene expression in both cell lines. We therefore assume that a balance between cooperatively bound Sp1 and Sp3 tightly regulates activity of the <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter in these osteoblastic cell lines.</p><p>Sp1/Sp3 site EMSA analyses suggested that they were occupied by regulators mainly present in MG63, but not in Saos-2 cells. The faint Sp1/Sp3-DNA interactions of Saos-2 nuclear extracts may be due to several reasons: Firstly, nuclear Sp-proteins can be inactivated by dephosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], or Sp-proteins may be present in the nuclei, but in very low concentrations. Indeed, Western blotting experiments pointed out that nuclear Sp1/Sp3 protein amounts were distinctively lower in Saos-2 than in MG63 cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitations confirmed the low <italic>in vivo </italic>occupancy of Sp binding sites in Saos-2 cells. Hence, these low Sp-protein concentrations might be insufficient to drive <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription and strikingly would explain the lack of podoplanin mRNA in Saos-2 cells. In MG63 cells, nuclear Sp1/Sp3 quantities were highly abundant, which could rely on increased nuclear Sp protein translocation and/or a decreased efflux of Sp proteins out of the nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Consistent with our results, hyperoxia treatment of murine lung epithelial cells caused an increased nuclear abundance of Sp1 that lead to enhanced expression of podoplanin/T1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Besides control through nuclear concentration thresholds, Sp-mediated transcriptional changes can be mediated by interactions with additional transcription factors, such as cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] or NF&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. When reducing the <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter stretch from bp -1104/+171 to bp -854/+171, transcriptional activity decreased about more than 50%. In DNaseI footprintings, however, no protected region could be detected in this region. Proteins attaching to this region might need concurrent binding of Sp1/Sp3 or of other factors more downstream. Such interaction mode without direct DNA contact could also explain the divergent results of DNaseI footprints and EMSA analyses at regions fp8, fp6, fp4 and fp3. In contrast to the reproducible footprinting results, nuclear proteins binding directly to the same motifs could not be detected in EMSAs. This result may either be explained by the presence of low affinity factors that rapidly dissociate from the DNA during the assay, or the attachment of proteins to these sites may depend on adjacent bound Sp1/Sp3-proteins and consequently could not be grasped due to the restricted length of the applied DNA probes. Consecutively, in Saos-2 cells accessory assembly of the same activating factors would be impossible due to lack of Sp allocation.</p><p>Moreover, despite its conservation between humans and rodents, we could not clearly prove functionality of binding site Sp.1 through repressive Sp3. Surprisingly, the higher promoter activity of the bp -38/+171 versus bp -76/+171 variant, as well as of the mutational Sp.1 variant rather seemed to result from additional interactions to a factor located more downstream than through repressive Sp3. Possibly, this mechanism may be a regulative to suppress extensive <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription. For example, interaction of Sp1 with E2F has been shown to control growth related gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Studies are ongoing that shall clarify the presence and identity of factors that are physically associated with Sp1/Sp3 bound to sites fp7, fp2 and fp1.</p><p>Sp7/Osterix respresents an interesting Sp protein family candidate relevant for activation of osteoblast-specific genes. It is essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and its expression has been detected in MG63 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] as well as Saos-2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Its potential role for <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter activation may be of interest and shall be clarified in future studies. As in murine and human osteosarcoma cells, on the other hand, Sp7/Osterix expression has been detected to be reduced versus normal osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], we presume that Sp7/Osterix contents might also be lowered in MG63 and Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells and therefore would exert a minor effect on <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter activation.</p><p>To unravel the transcriptional difference between MG63 and Saos-2 cells more thoroughly, potential DNA methylation of the <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter was examined. We identified complete promoter demethylation in Saos-2 cells, although no <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription took place. By contrast, in MG63 cells the distal promoter part was strongly methylated, while the <italic>PDPN </italic>gene was efficiently transcribed. This DNA modification affected the functional Sp protein binding site Sp.4, but i<italic>n vitro </italic>competition data proved that Sp-protein binding to this site was possible even when it was methylated. Our data therefore strongly support studies demonstrating that CpG methylation has no effect on attachment of Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], whereas others have found that it diminished Sp1/Sp3 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Chromatin modification by CpG methylation and/or histone deacetylation has been linked inevitably with transcriptional repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. However, our data provide evidence for a positive correlation between DNA methylation/histone modification and <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription in MG63 cells, as in our hands, induction of this classical "active chromatin state" rather conferred deactivation of gene activity. More importantly, site-specific DNA methylation by no means lead to down-modulation of promoter activity. The theoretical possibility of a repressor binding to the promoter and being competed by DNA methylation in MG63 cells has to be excluded, because demethylated <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter (i.e. the pGL3-promoter luciferase constructs) was highly active in MG63 cells. In agreement with that, no repressor-DNA interactions could be identified in Saos-2 cells. The mechanistic principle underlying the observed phenomenon could be diverse: When treating MG63 cells with 5-azaCdR in combination with TSA, consecutive conformational changes of chromatin may hinder Sp-protein binding and lead to downregulation of <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription. Secondly, it is tempting to hypothesize that methylation-dependent protein-DNA interactions being able to stimulate transcription may exist (methylation dependent factor <italic>MDF</italic>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). For example, the zinc finger protein Kaiso has been found to bind to both, methylated and sequence-specific recognition sites, fulfilling repressive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] or activating functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Here, we identify a completely different methylation scenario than has been observed in brain and lung alveolar type I cells of the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In these cells, DNA methylation was detected at key site Sp.2 under podoplanin/T1&#x003b1; non-expressing conditions, whereas its transcription could be initiated by addition of methyltransferase-inhibitor. These findings may indicate that the switch between transcriptional silencing and expression of podoplanin in different tissues/organs could depend on varying epigenetic phenomena, apparently driven by basal Sp1/Sp3 activation at conserved promoter sites. Studies using additional cell lines that constitutively or upon stimulation express podoplanin are ongoing to better understand the effect of methylation on this type of promoter. Preliminary data are pointing at again different methylation patterns in other cell lines. Moreover, altered histone modification patterns of the <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter chromatin have to be considered, as this process is intimately connected with DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Presumably, diverse regulatory pathways are mediating these epigenetic patterns in different cell types or even species.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Possible model of transcriptional control of podoplanin expression in MG63 versus Saos-2 cells</bold>.

Unlike podoplanin, this report describes increased transcription of an imprinted gene (<italic>Igf2</italic>) upon enhanced intragenic methylation, whereas in our study the 5' regulatory region was affected. Similar to our findings, some studies have shown a positive effect on gene expression when methylation downstream of the transcriptional start site had occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], and hypermethylation of CpG islands has been detected in actively transcribed regions of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. On the other hand, hypermethylated gene promoters, generally, have been associated with inappropriate gene silencing as an effect of selection during neoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], which follows a primary leakiness of the cellular repression machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. A further unexpected finding of our study is hypomethylation of an inactive promoter. In accordance with this, 1&#x02013;2% of genes of murine fibroblast cultures observed in an array study were downregulated through genomic demethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Moreover, hypomethylated inactive DNA has been detected throughout large areas of the inactive female X chromosome and in gene-poor genomic regions of tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Recapitulatory, changes in DNA methylation patterns play a fundamental role in cancer and may regard to losses or increases of epigenetic patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. The epigenetic event observed in our study may have provided a selection advantage to MG63 osteosarcoma cells and further clonal selection, considering that podoplanin recently has been assessed to contribute to tumour progression by circumventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Conclusively, we studied the cell-type specific regulation of podoplanin expression in human MG63 versus Saos-2 osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells. The results are summarized in the proposed activation model depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>.</p><p>Our findings indicate that Sp1/Sp3 members constitutively bind at least to three responsive elements of the <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter in MG63 cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that the activity of the promoter primarily depends on the integrity of two of these sites. Increased nuclear Sp1/Sp3 levels were shown to be responsible for activation of the promoter in MG63 versus Saos-2 cells. Additional transcription factor complexes located even more upstream seem to up-regulate <italic>PDPN </italic>gene expression strongly in MG63 versus Saos-2 cells. Analysis of the human <italic>PDPN </italic>promoter sequence undertaken here did not detect high score binding sites for osteoblast-specific transcription factors. However, the possibility that such factors participate in <italic>PDPN </italic>transcriptional regulation cannot be excluded, either by representing coactivators without direct DNA interaction, or by binding to far more upstream or downstream regulatory regions. A highly methylated chromatin conformation present in the distal promoter in MG63, but not in Saos-2 cells, leads to auxiliary enhancement of transcriptional activity of the <italic>PDPN </italic>gene. Our data are conflictive with previous findings supporting a negative correlation between methylation status and transcriptional activity of a promoter.

All DNA constructs were purified using Endo-free Midiprep Kit (Promega), and correct identities were confirmed by sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Transient transfections and luciferase reporter assay</title><p>MG63 and Saos-2 cells were transiently transfected in 24-wells using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen), as recommended by the manufacturer. For transfections, 0.05 pmol of each reporter pGL3-promoter construct or the external control vector pGL3-Control (Promega) were used per well. In each well, 0.005 pmol thymidine kinase driven <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase vector pRL-TK (Promega) served as an internal standard for transfection efficiency. For triple-transfection experiments, wells were transfected with 0.1 &#x003bc;g of reporter constructs and 0.01 &#x003bc;g of pRL-TK together with increasing amounts of Sp1 or Sp3 expression plasmid. Luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency according to Renilla activities. For testing effects of Sp-protein overexpression on <italic>PDPN </italic>transcription, MG63 and Saos-2 cells were transfected in 12-wells with 0.6 &#x003bc;g pCMV-Sp1 or pMCS-Sp3, or with 0.3 &#x003bc;g of each vector. SL-2 <italic>Drosophila </italic>cells were transiently transfected in 12-wells with 0.25 &#x003bc;g of pPac vectors together with 0.25 &#x003bc;g of luciferase reporter using FuGene6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 48 h, cells were lysed in 1 &#x000d7; passive lysis buffer and luciferase activities were measured by the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) per the manufacturer's instructions. When using single Luciferase signals, activities were normalized to protein amounts of the lysates as determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Measurements were made using a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (EG&#x00026;G Berthold).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of nuclear extracts</title><p>Nuclear extracts were prepared from MG63 and Saos-2 cells with minor variations of the method of Dignam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphat-buffered saline, scraped off in PBS and centrifuged 5 min at 1500 &#x000d7; g at 4&#x000b0;C. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF), left on ice for 20 min and were lyzed by passing them ten times through a 22 gauge needle. The nuclei were recovered by centrifugation for 6 min at 4500 &#x000d7; g, washed with buffer A, and the nuclear proteins were extracted with high salt buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 420 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT and 0.5 mM PMSF) on a rotating wheel for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Extracts were centifuged for 15 min at 10000 <italic>g</italic>, and supernatants were stored in aliquots at -78&#x000b0;C until use. Protein concentrations were measured by BCA protein assay (Pierce) giving typical protein yields of 3 &#x02013; 4 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l.</p></sec><sec><title>DNaseI footprint analysis</title><p>Footprinting experiments were performed with the Core Footprinting System Kit (Promega). DNA probes were dephosphorylated, labeled at both ends with (&#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P)-ATP (Hartmann Analytic) by T4 polynucleotide kinase, and digested with an restriction enzyme that released one of the labeled ends. Probes were purified on an agarose gel and DNA was recovered with the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). 5 ng of the labeled probe were incubated with 5 &#x003bc;g nuclear extract in 50 &#x003bc;l of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM KCl, 6.25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol and 1 mM DTT for 20 min on ice and then, 50 &#x003bc;l of a 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>/10 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>solution was added. After 1 min at room temperature, various amounts (0.15 &#x02013; 1.5 units) of RQ1 RNase-free DNase I were added in order to obtain an even DNase I ladder from top to the bottom of the gel, mixed gently, and after 2 min of incubation the reaction was terminated with 90 &#x003bc;l stop solution (200 mM NaCl, 30 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml yeast RNA). DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol 1:1:1, precipitated with ethanol, and the pellet was dissolved in loading solution (1:2 0.1 M NaOH:formamide (v/v), 0.1% cylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). After heating the probes 2 min at 95&#x000b0;C and chilling on ice, they were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 8 M urea and run in 1 &#x000d7; TBE buffer at 1500 Volt. Gels were dried on a filter paper and exposed to a Kodak Phosphor screen. A sequencing reaction of the respective DNA probe was carried out with the Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit (USB Corp.) using (&#x003b1;<sup>35</sup>S)-dATP (New England Nuclear) in the reaction mixture and was run side by side with the footprint assay. Images were analyzed with a STORM 830 facility (Molecular dynamics).</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)</title><p>Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were 5'-endlabeled with (&#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P)-ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. EMSAs were carried out in a 10 &#x003bc;l reaction containing 3 &#x003bc;g of nuclear extract, 250 ng poly(dI-dC), 2 &#x003bc;l of 5 &#x000d7; binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM EDTA, 40% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% NP40, 200 &#x003bc;g/ml BSA) and labeled oligo probe (80 fmoles, 20.000 cpm) for 15 min on ice. Competitive EMSAs were performed under identical conditions by adding the 50 or 100 fold amount of the same unlabeled doublestranded oligo or an unspecific oligo as negative control. For supershift experiments, 1.5 or 1 &#x003bc;l of anti-human Sp1-, or Sp3-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz) or unspecific rabbit IgG were added to the reaction mix and incubated for 20 min on ice. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacryamide gel with Tris-EDTA buffer (45 mM Tris, 44.5 mM borate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) at 350 V at 4&#x000b0;C. Gels were dried on filter paper, exposed 1 to 5 days to a Kodak Phosphor screen and scanned with a STORM 830 facility.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Nuclear extracts or total lysates from MG63 and Saos-2 cells were applied to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Western analysis was performed by incubating the membrane with rabbit anti-Sp1, -Sp3, -TFIIB, or -GAPDH antibodies (Santa Cruz), followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia). Densitometric quantification was perfomed with the LumiAnalyst 3.0 program (Roche).</p></sec><sec><title>ChIP assay</title><p>ChIP assays were performed with a ChIP kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For each chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, 2 &#x02013; 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells (80 &#x02013; 90% confluency) were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped from the culture dish and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (Upstate). Chromatin was fragmented by sonication (Labsonic U, B. Braun) in 20 sec pulses on ice to an average size of 600 bp. The lysates were diluted 1:10 with dilution buffer and pre-cleared by adding 75 &#x003bc;l protein A agarose for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. 40 &#x003bc;l of the lysate were removed as control input DNA and microcentrifuged at full speed for 10 sec to pellet residual cell debris. IP was performed by adding 4 &#x003bc;g anti-Sp1 antibody (Upstate), 4 &#x003bc;g anti-Sp3 antibody (Upstate) or 5 &#x003bc;g unspecific rabbit IgG overnight at 4&#x000b0;C under rotation, and an aliquot was incubated without antibody. Immunocomplexes were precipitated by addition of protein A agarose for 1 hr at 4&#x000b0;C. Precipitates were washed once with low salt buffer, once with high salt buffer, once with LiCl buffer and twice with TE buffer (Upstate). Protein/DNA complexes were eluted from the antibodies with 1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and DNA-protein interactions were reversed by addition of 5 M NaCl and heating to 65&#x000b0;C for 4 hrs. Proteins were digested with proteinase K for 1 hr at 45&#x000b0;C. Remaining DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and subsequent ethanol precipitation. The DNA was finally resuspended in 40 &#x003bc;l 1 &#x000d7; TE, pH 8.0, and 4 &#x003bc;l of the DNA was used for each PCR reaction. Site-specific PCR was carried out using primer pairs located at binding sites Sp1.1/Sp1.2 (193 bp), Sp1.3 (184 bp) and Sp1.4 (115 bp). PCR primers were designed as 19&#x02013;26 mers with ~55% GC content. PCR was performed with a hot start, followed by 30 &#x02013; 35 cycles of 30 s at 95&#x000b0;C, 1 min annealing at 63&#x000b0;C, 65&#x000b0;C and 68&#x000b0;C for each Sp1 site, respectively, and 30 s extension at 72&#x000b0;C. Besides that, input DNA was used concentrated (4 &#x003bc;l) and in 1:4 and 1:16 dilutions in PCR reactions. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Each ChIP experiment was carried out at least three times with similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic DNA southern blot analysis</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from MG63 and Saos-2 cells according to Sambrook et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated by cell lysis with proteinase K (Promega) digestion and extraction with phenol/chloroform. After precipitation, DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme <italic>Pst</italic>I to generate a 3989 bp podoplanin promoter fragment ranging from bp -2799 to bp +1190 and then with the isoschizomeric restriction enzymes <italic>Hpa</italic>II and <italic>Msp</italic>I (NEB) with the binding site 5'-CCGG-3' to release methylation-sensitive and -insensitive fragments. DNA fragments were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane and hybridized with five radioactively labeled probes (P/B, F2/K, F5/Bs, Ex1, Int1). After hybridization and subsequent washing, autoradiographs were analyzed with a STORM 830 facility.</p></sec><sec><title>Sodium bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing</title><p>Bisulfite genomic sequencing was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Briefly, genomic DNA (5 &#x003bc;g) was denatured in 0.3 M NaOH at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 min. Then, 3 M sodium bisulfite (Sigma) and 10 mM hydroquinone (Sigma) were added and samples were incubated at 50&#x000b0;C for 16 h. The modified DNA was purified through the Wizard Clean-Up system (Promega) and denatured by addition of 0.3 M NaOH at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 min. DNA was precipitated, resuspended in 1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 and used for PCR reactions. Three regions were amplified with primer pairs specific for bisulfite-reacted upper strands (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). PCR was performed with DNA isolated from four independent bisulfite treatment experiments and PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Fifty to eighty clones from each reaction were analyzed by sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>5-AzaCdR and TSA treatment</title><p>Viability of MG63 and Saos-2 cells under the influence of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azaCdR was tested up to concentrations of 1, 10 and 50 &#x003bc;M, and for histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA up to concentrations of 1, 2 and 3 &#x003bc;M over a period of 72 hrs. 5-azaCdR was added for 48 h at a final concentration of 1 &#x003bc;M, and TSA was added for 24 h alone, or for additional 24 h at the end of 5-azaCdR treatment final concentrations of 0.3 and 0.6 &#x003bc;M. Cells then were used for RNA isolation and subsequent quantitative Northern blotting analysis as described above.

Region-specific methylation was carried out after excision with <italic>Sac</italic>I/<italic>Xho</italic>I and <italic>Sac</italic>I/<italic>Apa</italic>I to isolate the promoter fragments -1885/+171, -1885/-189 from pGL3-II and -857/+171 and -857/-189 from pGL3-I, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In each case, half of the DNA was methylated in the absence of S-adenosyl-methionine as mock methylation. The efficiency of methylation was determined with the methylation-sensitive enzyme <italic>Hpa</italic>II. Methylated and mock-methylated fragments were religated into their descendant plasmids and equal amounts were transfected into MG63 and Saos-2 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical relevant differences were assigned to a p-value of at least &#x02264;0.05 using Student's paired t-test.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p><italic>PDPN</italic>, gene name for podoplanin; HEPES, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; 5-azaCdR, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine; TSA, trichostatin; S.D., standard deviation.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BH is responsible for the experimental design of this study, has performed the studies shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B,C</xref>, and has written the manuscript.
