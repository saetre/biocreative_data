Microarray comparisons of polysome loading in wild-type and <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant seedlings revealed that eIF3h generally helps to maintain efficient polysome loading of mRNAs harboring multiple uORFs. In addition, however, eIF3h also boosted the polysome loading of mRNAs with long leaders or coding sequences. Moreover, the relative polysome loading of certain functional groups of mRNAs, including ribosomal proteins, was actually increased in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant, suggesting that regulons of translational control can be revealed by mutations in generic translation initiation factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The intact eIF3h protein contributes to efficient translation initiation on 5' leader sequences harboring multiple uORFs, although mRNA features independent of uORFs are also implicated.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) consists of up to 13 recognized subunits and coordinates many of the events leading to start codon recognition by the small ribosomal subunit during the canonical 5' cap-dependent scanning mode of translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The budding yeast eIF3 is simpler, since only five universally conserved subunits form a so-called core complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Plant eIF3 complexes were purified with 12 distinct subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and, although recognizable in the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome sequence, homologs of eIF3j are not tightly associated with plant eIF3. The classic functions ascribed to eIF3 are threefold and include: facilitating the charging of the 40S ribosomal subunit with the ternary complex (eIF2, Met-tRNA<sup>Met</sup>, GTP); bridging between the 40S ribosomal subunit and the eIF4G subunit of the cap-binding complex, eIF4F; and inhibiting the association of 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These events occur prior to establishment of the 48S complex between the 40S subunit and the mRNA and would, therefore, apply equally to every mRNA. Yet, eIF3 remains attached to the 40S ribosome during scanning and is dislodged only during subunit joining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], which opens up the possibility that eIF3 or its subunits affect initiation in an mRNA specific fashion. There is a conceptual precedent for this possibility, as eIF3 interacts with certain internal ribosome entry sites (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]).</p><p>Roles of eIF3 downstream of 48S complex formation are of great interest because they may reveal mRNA selective functions of eIF3, yet these are only beginning to be understood. For example, certain mutations in budding yeast eIF3 subunits c and b cause defects in scanning and AUG start codon recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In fission yeast, where the eIF3 subunit composition generally conforms to that in multicellular eukaryotes, it was possible to reveal two subtypes of eIF3 that differ with respect to the presence of the eIF3e and eIF3m subunits, and associate with different subsets of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The mammalian eIF3e subunit is bound by p56 protein, a cellular component of the antiviral defense, which can shift the balance between host and viral mRNA translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. At the biochemical level, the eIF3 protein complex appears to serve as a docking site for at least two protein kinases that control the translation initiation machinery, the target-of-rapamycin (TOR) kinase, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. eIF3 and its subunits are also thought to contribute to the non-canonical translation initiation of plant viral mRNAs, by binding to a transactivator of ribosome shunting/re-initiation in cauliflower mosaic virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Finally, our lab has documented that carboxy-terminal truncations of the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>eIF3h protein compromise efficient translation of a subset of mRNAs that harbor upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5' leader sequence, effects that may underlie the pleiotropic phenotypic spectrum of the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Among the diversity of mRNA sequence determinants that poise mRNAs for translational control are uORFs, coding sequences of generally fewer than 50 codons that reside either singly or in small clusters in the 5' leader sequence. uORFs often inhibit translation initiation overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and play critical roles in signal-dependent regulation of translation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). In plants, the polyamine-repressible translation of S-adenosyl-methionine decarboxylase is mediated by a pair of short, amino acid sequence-dependent uORFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], whereas translational repression by sucrose is accomplished by a conserved uORF found in the leader of several basic leucine zipper transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>In pursuit of our goal to identify functions for individual eIF3 subunits in translation initiation, mutant analysis previously suggested that eIF3h contributes selectively to the translation initiation on specific 5' leader sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Two eIF3h-dependent mRNAs contained multiple uORFs, whereas several eIF3h-independent mRNAs contained no uORF or only one uORF. However, the number of genes analyzed did not allow a generalization, and the conclusion was based primarily on a transient reporter gene expression assay. Here we have tested the specific hypothesis that eIF3h generally functions in permitting efficient initiation on 5' leaders harboring multiple uORFs. We now present two additional lines of evidence in its favor, one based on translational reporter genes that are stably integrated into the plant genome of <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant plants, and a second based on transcriptome-wide analysis of the mRNA translation state using polysome microarrays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Transgenic analysis of translational efficiency</title><p>To examine how eIF3h contributes to the translation initiation on different 5' leader sequences, reporter gene expression cassettes were introduced as stable transgenes into <italic>Arabidopsis eif3h-1 </italic>mutant and wild-type seedlings. The <italic>eif3h-1 </italic>mutant allele harbors a T-DNA insertion that gives rise to a carboxy-terminally truncated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In these transgenes, firefly luciferase (Fluc) reports on the expression of the 5' leader to be tested while <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase (Rluc), driven by a second copy of the 35S promoter and a generic leader sequence from tobacco etch virus serves as a reference (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). The Fluc expression under the control of the 5' leader of AtbZip11 (formerly <italic>ATB2</italic>) was inhibited in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant compared to wild-type seedlings, as indicated by the about four-fold elevated Fluc/Rluc activity ratios in the wild type compared to the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b,c</xref>). The effect of the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutation was consistent (Student's paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.02) in each of the six lines examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>), even though these lines are expected to differ in their luciferase expression level, T-DNA dosage, and the extent of spontaneous gene silencing. Consistent with transient assays reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the data from this new transgenic assay now extend the effect of eIF3h over the entire aggregate of cells in seedling shoots in which the 35S promoter is active, not just the predominantly epidermal cells hit by particle bombardment. The AtbZip11 leader consistently drove higher translation in the wild type than in the mutant.</p><p>Four other 5' leader sequences were examined for their dependence on eIF3h. Neither the omega leader of tobacco mosaic virus nor the leader of the bZip transcription factor, HY5, was affected by the <italic>eif3h-1 </italic>mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref> and data not shown). Concerning the third example, the leader of tobacco etch virus (TL), one might not expect any difference in gene expression on theoretical grounds, because both Fluc and Rluc are preceded by the same promoter and leader in this case. However, a difference would arise if the mutation in <italic>eif3h </italic>caused differential effects on Fluc and Rluc protein stability, activity, or mRNA levels. The absence of a difference argues against such effects and in favor of the notion that the reporter genes serve as reliable reporters of translation initiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). As a fourth example, we tested the leader of the LHY myb domain transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which, similar to AtbZip11, harbors multiple upstream open reading frames. The LHY leader did show a tendency for reduced translation in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>), as expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Within the AtbZip11 leader, the uORF2b is responsible for translational repression in response to sucrose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Eliminating uORF2b from the AtbZip11 leader by mutating its start codon into a stop codon also caused a substantial 'recovery' of translation in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,b</xref>). In actual terms, mutating uORF2b caused a reduction of the Fluc to Rluc ratio in the wild type, perhaps because uORF2b overlaps uORF3 and uORF4 and thus tempers their potentially inhibitory effect on Fluc expression.</p><p>Some uORFs have posttranscriptional effects on mRNA stability and mRNA levels, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. As a first step to address the extent to which eIF3h may affect mRNA levels we examined FLUC mRNA levels in wild-type and <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant seedlings using RT-PCR. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref> two representative transgenic lines carrying the TL leader or the AtbZip11/2b leader showed approximately equal mRNA levels between wild type and mutant. In contrast, with the original AtbZip11 leader the mRNA level was slightly reduced in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant compared to <italic>eIF3h</italic><sup>+ </sup>wild-type plants, although the reduction was insufficient to fully account for the difference in FLUC enzyme activity (6.6-fold in this line). These results are consistent with the notion that the lack of eIF3h causes a reduction in translatability of the mRNA as well as a reduction in the mRNA level, possibly by allowing the uORF-containing mRNA to be destabilized.</p><p>Although eIF3h protein is expressed in different organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the requirement for eIF3h was most pronounced in the shoot apex and less so, yet still significant, in the cotyledon/hypocotyl (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), while in the root, no effect of the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutation could be discerned. The AtbZip11 leader lacking uORF2b showed no dependence on eIF3h in any organ.</p><p>In summary, the two leaders tested that harbor multiple uORFs, that is, AtbZip11 and LHY, showed a dependence on eIF3h, while leaders with only one uORF (HY5) showed a marginal and variable dependence on eIF3h, whereas leaders lacking uORFs (TMV omega and the TEV leader (TL)) were not dependent on eIF3h. Despite the evident correlation between uORFs and the requirement for eIF3h, one leader, AtbZip11 with the uORF2b mutation, behaved like an exception in this assay, given that this leader retains four uAUGs. It is plausible that the overall configuration and length of the uORFs, not simply the sheer number alone, defines whether intact eIF3h is needed for optimal expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray experiments</title><p>To examine whether there exists a general requirement for eIF3h for efficient translation of mRNAs harboring uORFs, microarray analysis was carried out using polysomal (PL) and non-polysomal (NP) RNA samples collected by sucrose density gradient centrifugation from <italic>eif3h-1 </italic>mutant and wild-type plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Total RNA samples were also isolated to monitor the effect of the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutation on mRNA transcript (TC) levels. Labeled samples were hybridized to <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip arrays (approximately 24,000 genes) and the resulting signals were normalized as described in the Materials and methods. Hybridization signals from each array are routinely adjusted to the same total intensity to compensate for differences in labeling and hybridization efficiency. Therefore, mRNAs that are translationally inhibited more than the average mRNA by the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutation will appear as undertranslated, and vice versa. In any event, the ratio of total polysomal/non-polysomal RNA was similar between <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant and wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, if the normalization procedure did mask a global shift in polysome loading, this shift must have been minor or negligible.</p><p>The 8,831 genes showing 'present' or 'marginal' expression across all 12 arrays, including two biological repeats, were considered for further analysis, whereas genes scored as 'absent' were excluded (see Additional data file 1 for scatter plots).</p><p>In the following, the term 'translation state' [TL] designates the ratio of the signal intensity between polysomal and non-polysomal samples (TL = PL/NP). Expressed as log<sub>2 </sub>transformed data, a positive value indicates that more transcripts were associated with ribosomes, and a negative value indicates that more transcripts were in a ribosome-free state. Both in wild-type and mutant plants, the mRNA translation state ranged from highly polysomal to highly non-polysomal, over approximately a 64-fold range (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).</p><p>Next, comparisons of the translation states of <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant and wild-type plants were performed by calculating [TL]<sub>3h</sub>/[TL]<sub>WT</sub>. After log-transformation for ease of display, a positive value indicates that an mRNA is more polysomal in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant than in the wild type, and vice versa. The difference in total mRNA transcript level was expressed using a simple log<sub>2 </sub>transformed ratio of [TC]<sub>3h</sub>/[TC]<sub>WT</sub>. Among 6,854 genes that yielded reproducible polysome loading data (see Materials and methods for selection criteria), 246 genes were translationally inhibited in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant, based on an arbitrary two-fold cutoff, and 188 genes were translationally stimulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>; see Additional data file 2 for gene lists). Changes in the transcript level were not obviously correlated with changes in translation state (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Exceptionally, the <italic>eIF3h </italic>gene itself was clearly suppressed at both the translational and transcriptional levels, presumably a consequence of the T-DNA insertion in the 10th exon of the gene. This result is consistent with the low level of the truncated eIF3h protein detected in the <italic>eif3h-1 </italic>allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The defects in the <italic>eif3h-1 </italic>mutant may be a consequence of both the reduced expression level and the truncation of the carboxyl terminus. The general trends of the microarray-based differences in translation states and transcript levels were reproduced by quantitative real-time PCR amplification using 13 different genes (Additional data file 3).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional classes of genes misregulated in the <italic>eif3h-1 </italic>mutant</title><p>To examine whether or not genes that were mistranslated in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant fall into specific functional groups, the microarray datasets were fed into MapMan (v1.8.0 [cell_functions_overview]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], which projects data from <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>Affymetrix arrays onto diagrams of metabolic pathways and gene ontology classes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). One group of genes was biased toward translational stimulation in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant, namely protein synthesis related genes (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01; <italic>X </italic><sup>2</sup>-test), in particular cytosolic proteins for small and large ribosomal proteins, but also organellar ones (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, with few exceptions (eIF3g1, eIF3k and nCBP [novel cap-binding protein]), the mRNAs for translation initiation factors did not partake in the translational stimulation, nor did other core 'protein synthesis' mRNAs, such as those for aminoacylation, translation elongation or termination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, bottom).</p><p>A higher resolution classification using MapMan revealed an additional functional group with a coordinated trend for translational enhancement in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant, namely cytosolic mRNAs encoding photosynthesis-related proteins in the chloroplast (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, top). Overall, among the 188 translationally upregulated genes, 24.3% were protein synthesis related, and 6.6% were related to photosynthetic light and dark reactions. For comparison, although many histone and nucleosome assembly related genes were highly polysomal in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant, they were also highly polysomal in wild type, resulting in a largely unchanged translation state (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>A statistically significant bias toward translational inhibition in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant could be seen for genes annotated as transcriptional regulators and protein modifiers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). A higher resolution classification revealed that transcription factors had variable polysome loading in the wild type; whereas receptor kinases, which were the most strikingly downregulated group, generally dropped from a highly loaded state in the wild type to a medium level in the mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In contrast, many other metabolic pathways represented in MapMan were not coordinately affected by the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutation, for example, development, cell wall synthesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and lipid, amino acid, secondary, nitrate, and sulfate metabolism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and data not shown). Taken together, these results clearly suggest that certain functional classes of mRNAs share specific features that make them dependent on the activity of eIF3h in a coordinated fashion.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>5' untranslated region sequences</title><p>Previous results indicated that the eIF3h protein plays a role in overcoming the inhibitory effects on ribosome scanning and translation initiation caused by uORFs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Because reduced translation initiation due to uORFs is reflected in reduced polysome loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we carried out a series of computational analyses on the polysome microarray datasets to further test and extend this hypothesis.</p><p>First, the entire set of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>5' mRNA leader sequences based on the longest expressed sequence tag sequences were downloaded from the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>Information Resource (TAIR). Since these may contain partial sequences, only the 5' leaders of genes listed in the SSP (Salk/Stanford/plant gene expression center) consortium's full-length cDNA list [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] (March 2006) were extracted, and the resulting 12,129 full-length transcript sequences were used for further analysis. The average 5' leader length was 131 bases. With the exception of leaders shorter than 20 nucleotides (nt), the distribution of the log-transformed leader lengths approximately matched a normal distribution, with a geometric mean of 91 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). Among the full-length transcripts, 3,735 (30.8%) contained at least one uAUG in their 5' leader (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>; Additional data file 4), which is higher than previous estimates (22% of 1,023 <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). The number of uAUGs correlated roughly with the length of the 5' leader sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref> shows the distribution of uORF length. The AUG triplet is the most underrepresented triplet in 5' leaders, indicating a bias against translational start codons, but surprisingly its frequency was only two-fold lower than expected by chance alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6e</xref>; see Materials and methods for details). No such bias was detected in the 3' untranslated regions (not shown). Using similar criteria, we examined the frequency of the AUG triplet in positions that result in uORFs overlapping the main ORF. Even in these positions, which must be considered strongly inhibitory for translation of the main ORF, the AUG triplet was underrepresented only between two and threefold (not shown).</p><p>Among the 30% of genes containing uORFs, almost half (1,602 or 13.2% of all mRNAs) have at least one AUG in a favorable context for plants (AnnAUGn or GnnAUGG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, many of the uAUGs are expected to be recognized by the scanning 40S subunit, rather than bypassed by leaky scanning. Moreover, 12.9% of all uAUGs (1,135 out of 8,783) either initiate, or are part of, a uORF that overlaps the main ORF (data not shown). Of these, one third (346 or 30.4%) were in a favorable start codon context. Taken together, these analyses reveal an abundance of <italic>bona fide </italic>translated uORFs in 5' leaders of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>mRNAs whose sequence has been experimentally validated.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence features of translationally regulated genes</title><p>Next, we asked whether the eIF3h-dependence of a given transcript (Log<sub>2 </sub>[TL]<sub>3h</sub>/[TL]<sub>WT</sub>) could be explained by features extracted from the 5' leader sequence. A recent large-scale analysis of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] addressed the level of variation among transcripts from the same gene. Where alternative transcription start sites exist, they are usually less than 10 bases apart and when they do occur in the 5' leader they usually consist of small shifts in splice acceptor or donor sites of typically far fewer than 30 bases. Therefore, using a single full-length cDNA sequence to search for signals affecting polysome loading is an acceptable simplification.</p><p>As we hypothesized, gene sets that were translationally repressed in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant contained a high proportion of genes harboring uAUGs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In detail, 80% of all mRNAs in the most strongly eIF3h-dependent class contained at least one uAUG. Most of these transcripts (55%) had at least one uAUG in a strong context. These uORFs generally do not overlap the main ORF but terminate within the 5' leader (not shown). By contrast, the transcripts that were translationally stimulated in the mutant were far less likely to harbor uAUGs; down to 14% in any context and down to 0% when only strong uAUGs were considered. These significant deviations from the average abundance of uAUGs clearly suggest that eIF3h is needed, transcriptome-wide, for the efficient translation initiation on mRNAs that contain uAUGs, although other factors must contribute. Among the translationally compromised genes were LHY and AtbZip11, consistent with earlier observations (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In addition, AtbZip41 and AtbZip57, two other mRNAs with similar uORF patterns as AtbZip11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] were also found in the undertranslated set (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), whereas HY5, a bZip factor with a single uORF that was not translationally affected in the reporter gene assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>), was also not affected according to the microarray. The extent of the reduction in polysome loading in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant was less than expected from the reporter assays (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>); this may be due to the fact that the reporter assay measures the compounded effects of mRNA stability and translatability whereas the microarray measures translation state as indicated by polysome loading and is not confounded by mRNA levels.</p><p>Because the eIF3h-dependent genes tend to cluster according to functional categories and tend to contain uORFs, we predicted that categories of genes that are enriched in uORFs might be particularly dependent on eIF3h in their ribosome loading and vice versa. The percentage of genes harboring uORFs in each of MapMan's 'cellular function' categories varied widely (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), from 11.5% in the protein synthesis category all the way up to 39.5%, 40.5%, and 52.5% for the categories transcriptional regulation, cell division, and protein modification, respectively. Incidentally, uORFs are also enriched among proto-oncogenes and genes functioning in cell growth and transcriptional regulation in mammalian genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>When the percentage of eIF3h-dependent genes was plotted against the percentage of uORF containing genes, a clear correlation emerged across all 26 functional categories (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a,c</xref>), regardless of the precise cutoff value to define the downregulation in polysome loading. Vice versa, groups of genes enriched in uAUGs tended to contain a very low percentage of genes that were upregulated in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b,d</xref>). This correlation underscores the role of eIF3h in the polysome loading state of uORF-containing mRNAs.</p><p>Because the correlation between uAUGs and eIF3h-dependent translation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) was incomplete, there must be factors other than uAUGs that influence the polysome loading state in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant. Consistent with earlier analyses, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a</xref> shows that increasing numbers of uAUGs were more inhibitory to the translation state [TL] in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant than in the wild type; however, presence of uAUGs did not generally result in a lower level of total mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9b</xref>). Because the likelihood of uAUGs increases with the length of the 5' leader (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>), it was expected that long leaders would be preferentially undertranslated in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant, and they were (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9c</xref>). However, length of the leader plays a more profound role because it contributed to eIF3h-dependence regardless of the number of uORFs and even in the absence of uORFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9d</xref>). The effect of uORFs was most striking among 5' leaders up to 300 nt long, which make up 92.4% of the genes. The effect of leader length may be partly due to translation initiation at non-AUG codons, which does occur in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], although we do not rule out other explanations.</p><p>The length of the main coding region also affected polysome loading in a manner sensitive to eIF3h, while the length of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) did not have any effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9e,f</xref>). In the wild type, the longer the main ORF, the higher the translation state. This was expected, given that longer mRNAs have room for more ribosomes. Surprisingly, the opposite effect was seen in the mutant; that is, longer main ORFs were significantly more dependent on eIF3h than main ORFs of intermediate length. Although leader length and main ORF length may cause eIF3h-dependence by the same mechanism, we first considered these variables separately. Main ORF length and uORF number affected the requirement for eIF3h independently because the effect of main ORF length could be seen among mRNAs lacking uORFs, there was no correlation between main ORF length and leader length or number of uORFs, and the inhibitory effect of uORFs was retained in mRNAs with main ORF lengths between 750 and 1,500 nt (not shown).</p><p>Together, presence of uORFs and length of the main ORF appear to be responsible for the majority of cases where translation state is dependent on eIF3h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). uORFs are present at high frequencies in genes for transcription factors and protein modifying proteins. Accordingly, these classes of genes are among the most dependent on eIF3h function. Among the mRNAs least dependent on eIF3h for high polysome loading are those coding for ribosomal proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The eIF3 h subunit (eIF3h) is one of the non-core subunits of the eIF3 protein complex. eIF3 subunits h and e in particular have emerged as candidate genes during tumorigenesis, by being overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], or because expression of intact or truncated forms can induce tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. By dissecting the precise contributions of these proteins to translation initiation their role in tumor formation may become clearer. Our previous data from transient reporter gene expression assays suggested that mutation of eIF3h compromises translation of a subset of transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Here we first extended these findings to stable transgenic plants (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The microarray data then highlighted that eIF3h is responsible genome-wide for the efficient polysome loading of mRNAs carrying uORFs and also seems to preferentially boost the translation state of long mRNAs.</p><p>Among the factors in the 5' leader sequence that affect the mRNA translation state are length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and uORFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To analyze the effects of these factors, we used the 5' leader sequences of full length <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>mRNAs known to be purified by means of 5' cap binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The evidence that the effects on translation states measured using microarrays are reliable and significant is as follows. First of all, chance alone does not explain correlations in translation state across gene ontology classes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and would not result in the coordinated changes in translation state observed, for example, for ribosomal proteins. Moreover, the fact that the majority of the variation in eIF3h dependence between different mRNAs can be attributed to just three factors, uORFs and length of the main ORF or 5' leader (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a,d,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>), also speaks for the authenticity of the data. Furthermore, the general tendencies in translation state deduced from the microarray analysis matched the trends from reporter gene expression assays (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><sec><title>Translational regulons</title><p>In mammalian cells, uORFs are enriched among mRNAs for regulatory proteins, including transcription factors, receptor proteins, signal transduction components, and proto-oncogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This notion is borne out by the small set of plant mRNAs with uORFs that have been studied (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]) and is echoed by this analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The altered translation state of many important regulatory proteins may have contributed to the substantial effects on mRNA transcript levels in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and may ultimately underlie the pleiotropic phenotype of the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>One class of mRNAs, coding for ribosomal proteins, showed widespread increases in polysome loading in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). A coordinated reduction of polysome loading for ribosomal protein mRNAs has been reported earlier in yeast (by the nonfermentable carbon source glycerol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and amino acid starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]) and in mammalian cells (by dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]). Are there clusters of mRNAs whose translation is regulated in a coordinated fashion in response to a number of different stimuli? Such a phenomenon would be indicative of a regulon of translational control, a concept whose biological utility is not yet widely established. The <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>ribosomal proteins show tight translational co-regulation in response to drought stress and hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], and also respond as a cohort to a mutation in <italic>eIF3h</italic>. Together with a prior study in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], this finding exemplifies that mutations in a <italic>bona fide </italic>generic translation factor can uncover a coordinated translational response suggestive of a translational regulon. Interestingly, the mRNAs for mammalian translation initiation factors are regulated transcriptionally (by glucocorticoids) rather than translationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], a finding echoed by the lack of translational coordination between ribosomal proteins and translation initiation factors observed here (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>The translational co-regulation of ribosomal protein genes may reflect a coordinated attempt of the cell to compensate for the deficiency of eIF3h. However, the potential sensing and response mechanisms are unknown. Other than their mammalian counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>ribosomal protein genes generally do not share canonical 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tracts (5' TOP motifs, not shown). Ribosomal protein mRNAs generally have short main ORFs, and their 5' leaders tend to be devoid of uORFs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), short, and GC-rich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. However, these features do not explain the coordinated upregulation of translation state in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant, because a random collection of mRNAs with these features did not show such a uniform response (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The function of eIF3h</title><p>Our results suggest that eIF3h contributes to polysome loading in at least two major ways. First, eIF3h mitigates the repressive effect of uORFs (for example, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a</xref>). This repression is associated with, but not explained by, a repression of mRNAs with long 5' leaders. Secondly, and unexpectedly, long main ORFs appear to be particularly dependent on intact eIF3h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9f</xref>). uORF number and leader length co-vary, but the effects were separable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9d</xref>). uORFs and length of the main ORF are not correlated and, therefore, the two effects are independent. Thus, having a long main ORF and a leader with uORFs is a predictor for eIF3h-dependent translation, whereas having a short main ORF and no uORFs is a predictor for eIF3h-independent translation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). At this point it is useful to consider length of the main ORF and length of the 5' leader together. A role for eIF3h as an initiation factor is more easily reconciled with its effect on uORF-containing mRNAs than on mRNAs that are simply long. Is the effect of length an indirect one? Although this cannot be ruled out, we note that the gene lists for altered polysome state or transcript level include very few initiation or elongation factors aside from <italic>eIF3h </italic>itself (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Additional data file 2). Moreover, if elongation was slowed down in <italic>eif3h</italic>, one would expect elevated polysome loading in the mutant, exactly the opposite of what was observed. The effect of mRNA length may, however, be an indirect consequence of competition between the relatively abundant, yet short, mRNAs for ribosomal and plastid proteins, which retain high polysome loading, and other, longer mRNAs. On the other hand, it may also point toward more direct, though entirely speculative, roles of eIF3h in the translation initiation of long mRNAs. For example, it is not difficult to imagine that long and short mRNAs may differ in their tendency for circularization into a closed loop via poly(A)-binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], and also that closed-loop re-initiation and <italic>de novo </italic>initiation may differ in their requirement for initiation factors such as eIF3h. Distinguishing between this and other plausible explanations, such as increased ribosome dropoff during scanning or elongation, will require additional experiments.</p><p>Translational regulation by uORFs occurs in a number of different ways (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). In the leaky scanning model, some of the scanning ribosomes recognize the uAUGs as a functional start codon, thereby reducing the chance to start at the main ORF, but some can pass the uAUG without initiation and thus reach the main ORF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. According to the re-initiation model, the ribosome recognizes the uAUG as a start codon, but after termination of the uORF the ribosome resumes scanning until it encounters the main AUG codon. Thereby the efficiency of re-initiation can control the efficiency of initiation at the main AUG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>The eIF3 complex has only recently been implicated as a regulator at or around a uORF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Generally, eIF3 prevents premature association of 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, promotes the association of ternary complex and 40S ribosomal subunit (43S complex formation), functions as a scaffold for other initiation factors, and stimulates the binding of mRNA to the 43S pre-initiation complex (48S complex formation; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). Yet, the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutations used here do not seem to affect global translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our results suggest that eIF3h may contribute to functions of eIF3 downstream of 48S pre-initiation complex formation. Potential roles are in scanning processivity by the 40S, selection of the initiation codon, or in the resumption of scanning or re-initiation downstream of a uORF. It is also possible that a primary defect in translation initiation in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant will have secondary downstream effects, which may include destabilization of a uORF-containing mRNAs. However, mRNAs identified as eIF3h-dependent in the microarray did not generally have lower mRNA transcript levels (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9b</xref>). To date, we have not detected any association between translation state in <italic>eif3h </italic>and initiation codon context. A defect in scanning processivity would predict a correlation between the length of the leader and the requirement for eIF3h, and such a correlation was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9d</xref>). Some uORFs inhibit initiation in a fashion dependent on their coding sequence, more often by peptide-dependent stalling of the ribosomes than by rare codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. However, the lengths and sequences of uORF peptides of eIF3h-dependent genes are very diverse (data not shown), arguing that the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutation does not cause peptide sequence dependent stalling of ribosomes within uORFs. Sequence-independent uORFs are found in yeast GCN4, other transcription factor mRNAs and elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]). They are inhibitory to translation because resumption of scanning and acquisition of a new ternary complex are considered inherently inefficient, compared with the 43S loading of an mRNA at the 5' cap. The cumulative inhibition by multiple uORFs in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant suggest that re-initiation following translation of a uORF may be the process in which eIF3h plays a major role.</p><p>The molecular mechanism of re-initiation is not clear, but it must involve a decision by the 40S subunit whether to resume scanning or not, and then the scanning ribosome needs to be replenished with a new ternary complex for the next initiation attempt. Re-initiation becomes less efficient as uORFs get longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] but more efficient when the uORF is followed by a long intercistronic spacer sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Interestingly, the defect in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant was not exacerbated by uORF length, at least not for single uORFs, and was not mitigated by a long spacer (data not shown). It is also known that re-initiation appears to be more efficient when the uORF is first recognized in a cap-dependent fashion and with the full complement of initiation factors than when the uORF is recognized via an internal ribosome entry site that allows initiation without eIFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. These results suggest that the eIF-primed ribosome has an inherent competence to resume scanning after termination of a uORF, but its competence is gradually lost during peptide elongation. Although there is evidence that the initiation factors are lost when a scanning ribosome begins to synthesize a polypeptide from a uORF, it is not clear whether all the initiation factors are lost, nor whether the loss occurs immediately after the initiation or after some time of elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Additional experiments are needed to define more precisely whether or how eIF3h contributes to re-initiation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, all these observations suggest that eIF3h functions in translation initiation by overcoming the repressive effect of uORFs, and by boosting the polysome loading of mRNAs with a long leader or long main ORF. Independent confirmation of the data from polysome microarray experiments was provided by translational reporter gene expression cassettes introduced into stable transgenic plants. The exact mechanism of eIF3h's activity remains to be further defined; neither do we rule out that eIF3h may play additional roles in translation initiation or beyond. It is noteworthy, however, that long uORFs such as those found to confer eIF3h dependence in AtbZip11 appear to be highly inhibitory in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], a species that does not possess a recognizable ortholog of eIF3h. uORFs are particularly abundant among <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>mRNAs encoding regulatory proteins such as transcription factors and protein kinases. Given the growing appreciation for uORFs as modules of translational control, eIF3h may be regarded as a cog in the machinery of translational regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Molecular cloning procedures</title><p>A <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase reporter gene was inserted into the binary T-DNA vector pFGC19, which shares the vector backbone and Basta resistance gene with pFGC5941 (kindly provided by R Jorgensen).

First, both of the replicates showed more than a two-fold difference in the same direction (up/down); second, the average value showed more than a two-fold difference AND the standard deviation was less than 50% of the average; or third, the standard deviation was less than 0.5 regardless of the fold change. These datasets thus selected consisted of 6,854 genes for polysome data (PL and NP) and 7,976 genes for transcript data (TC). Within this filtered set of data, 246 genes were translationally inhibited in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant, based on an arbitrary two-fold cutoff, and 188 genes were translationally stimulated. At the transcript level 253 and 144 genes were considered down- and upregulated, respectively, in the <italic>eif3h </italic>mutant. To validate this approach, we independently subjected the entire, unfiltered, set of expressed genes to 'Significance Analysis of Microarrays' (SAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] in order to estimate a false discovery rate (FDR). When the FDR was set to 0.05, a set of 229 genes, which largely overlapped with the previous set of 246, was marked as translationally downregulated in <italic>eif3h </italic>and 73 genes were marked as upregulated.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real time PCR</title><p>Total RNA, polysomal and non-polysomal RNA were isolated as described above. We incubated 1 &#x003bc;g of DNase treated RNA and 0.5 &#x003bc;g of oligo(dT) primer at 70&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes and these were chilled on ice. To this mixture 4 &#x003bc;l of 5&#x000d7; reaction buffer, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), 1 &#x003bc;l of 20 mM each dNTPs, and 200 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) were added in a total volume of 20 &#x003bc;l. The reaction was incubated at 42&#x000b0;C for 50 minutes, and then inactivated at 70&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes. The first strand cDNAs were diluted to 100 &#x003bc;l, and 1 &#x003bc;l (1/100 of initial amount) was used for a 25 &#x003bc;l quantitative (Q)-RT-PCR reaction. Three replicates of Q-RT-PCR were performed using ABsolute&#x02122; QPCR SYBER Green Mix (ABgene, Surrey, UK) in a Bio-Rad iQ5 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's guide.

The 5' UTR sequences were downloaded from the TAIR website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], which is based on the longest expressed sequence tag sequences. Among those sequences, only the sequences for genes listed in the SSP consortium's full-length cDNA list [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] were extracted to get the most reliable full-length sequences, and the resulting 12,129 genes were used for further analysis. The number of uAUGs as well as the length of each 5' leader sequence was determined. This dataset was used for analyzing our microarray result. The frequency distribution of the 5' leader length passed the Davis test for asymmetry; hence, the geometric mean was calculated. Expected triplet frequencies were calculated by generating a frame-independent dinucleotide frequency table from all 5' leaders. These dinucleotide frequencies were then used in a conditional probability formula to predict the expected triplet frequency, for example:</p><p><disp-formula>p(AUG) = p(AU) &#x000d7; p(UG)/(p(UG) + p(UA) + p(UT) + p(UC))</disp-formula></p><p>Real frequencies were then found in the manner of the previous dinucleotides, and the ratio of real to predicted was ascertained. Assorted uORF and leader properties were mined using the appropriate pattern matching scripts. All scripts were written in Perl and are available upon request.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Additional data files</title><p>The following additional data are available with the online version of this paper.
