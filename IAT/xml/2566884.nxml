We are particularly interested in understanding the process of translational termination and ribosome recycling in the mitochondrion. Several candidates have been implicated, for which subcellular localization and characterization have not been reported. Here, we show that the putative mitochondrial recycling factor, mtRRF, is indeed a mitochondrial protein. Expression of human mtRRF in fission yeast devoid of endogenous mitochondrial recycling factor suppresses the respiratory phenotype. Further, human mtRRF is able to associate with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ribosomes <italic>in vitro</italic> and can associate with mitoribosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Depletion of mtRRF in human cell lines is lethal, initially causing profound mitochondrial dysmorphism, aggregation of mitoribosomes, elevated mitochondrial superoxide production and eventual loss of OXPHOS complexes. Finally, mtRRF was shown to co-immunoprecipitate a large number of mitoribosomal proteins attached to other mitochondrial proteins, including putative members of the mitochondrial nucleoid.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mitochondria play a vital role in a wide variety of cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. They possess their own genomic DNA (mtDNA) that encodes 13 proteins, along with 22 tRNA and 2 ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). All protein products of the mitochondrial genome are part of the multi-subunit complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Synthesis of these proteins is carried out on a specialized translational apparatus located within the organelle. The components of the mitochondrial translational machinery&#x02014;translational factors and mitoribosomes&#x02014;are distinct from those in the cytosol and generally resemble bacterial counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Our understanding of the mechanisms of mitochondrial translation is far from complete. A limited number of factors involved in mitochondrial translation initiation, elongation and termination have been identified and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7">3&#x02013;7</xref>). The mechanism of the last step of protein synthesis, the disassembly of the post-termination complex, has not yet been explored in human mitochondria.</p><p>Due to the monophyletic &#x003b1;-proteobacterial origin of mitochondria, our knowledge of ribosome recycling in prokaryotes can serve as a rough model for mitochondrial processes, although it is highly likely that they will prove to be important variations. In the bacterial system, when a ribosome reaches a stop codon, the nascent polypeptide is released by the coordinated actions of a sequence-specific class I release factor (RF1 or RF2) and a sequence-independent class II release factor [RF3, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>)]. The resulting post-termination complex containing mRNA and deacylated tRNA in the P/E site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), has to be disassembled and ribosomal subunits need to be recycled to initiate a new round of protein synthesis. This process is catalysed by the ribosome recycling factor (RRF). RRF is universally conserved in eubacteria and deletion of the gene-encoding RRF (<italic>frr</italic>) has been shown to be lethal for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic>, with one of the smallest genomes reported to date, retains RRF despite losing RF2 and RF3, further supporting a key role for this factor in prokaryotic translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of bacterial ribosome recycling has been addressed by several independent laboratories [for example, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>)]. Conformational changes mediated by RRF bound to the 70S ribosome can disrupt the intersubunit bridges leading to separation of the monosome. This process requires GTP hydrolysis that is triggered by elongation factor G (EFG). Subsequently, initiation factor 3 (IF3) binds to the 30S subunit preventing re-association of the free subunits. More recently, emphasis has been placed on the exact role played by bacterial RRF in this process. Cryoelectron microscopy data on <italic>E. coli</italic> RRF binding to 70S post-termination complexes is consistent with a spontaneous movement of RRF from around the peptidyltransferase centre in the monosome to a site on the 50S subunit, resulting in the cleavage of intersubunit bridges and subunit dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, no such structural reorganization was found on X-ray crystallography of a similar but not identical <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>To date, no human mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor has been characterized. A candidate, mtRRF, was proposed several years ago from bioinformatic analyses of several overlapping EST sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) but with no supportive functional studies or investigation of subcellular localization. In this article, we report that this putative mitochondrial recycling factor is indeed a mitochondrial protein. Furthermore, we show a direct interaction of purified mtRRF with ribosomes of both bacterial and mammalian mitochondrial origin <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. To assess the physiological function of mtRRF, we have examined the ability of human mtRRF to rescue yeast strains deleted of their endogenous factor and the effect of mtRRF depletion in cultured human cells. We observed aggregation of mitoribosomes, increased ROS and profound changes in mitochondrial morphology. Our results imply that analogous to the bacterial situation, this protein is essential for mitochondrial function and viability of human cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Tissue culture manipulations</title><p>Human HeLa cells were cultured (37&#x000b0;C, humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in Eagle's modified essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich Co.Ltd, Dorset, UK) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 1 &#x000d7; non-essential amino acids and 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine.

Subsequently, complexes containing the fusion protein were isolated from solubilized mitochondria by anti-FLAG affinity purification and FLAG peptide elution. To control for non-specific binding, FLAG-tagged mitochondrially targeted luciferase (mtluc) was expressed in cells and immunoprecipitated by the same procedure. Western analysis revealed a specific interaction of mtRRF and mitoribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Mitoribosomes were very efficiently precipitated with FLAG-mtRRF.

To investigate this further, HEK293T cells were induced as above and lysates were immediately subjected to isokinetic sucrose-gradient centrifugation. This mtRRF over-expression was not deleterious to cell growth (data not shown) but led to a slight decrease in mitoribosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). No association of mtRRF with mitoribosomes at steady state was detectable. However, binding became evident on incubation (3 h) of the lysate prior to centrifugation (mimicking the IP procedure) potentially due to dissociation or hydrolysis of charged tRNAs that would naturally occupy most A/P sites. This dependence on pre-incubation was not a consequence of mtRRF over-expression, as a similar effect was noted with HeLa cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, data not shown). Further, association was not due to non-specific interactions promoted by the pre-incubation step as interactions were lost either on RNase or EDTA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, lanes 1 and 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Mitoribosomes associated with numerous mitochondrial proteins are co-immunoprecipitated with mtRRF</title><p>Immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments using mtRRF as bait revealed an association with two mitoribosomal proteins, presumably indicating the presence of the large (39S) and small (28S) ribosomal subunits (MRPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). To confirm the presence of other MRPs and determine which if any additional proteins were present, IP experiments were performed on lysates from a protease/DNase-treated HEK293T mitoplast fraction.

HeLa cells were grown in the presence of control (<italic>NT</italic>) or targeted (<italic>mtRRF</italic>) siRNA. Cytosolic protein synthesis was inhibited with emetine prior to labelling mitochondrial proteins with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine (15 min). Equal amounts of lysate (20 &#x000b5;g) were separated by 15% SDS&#x02013;PAGE and gels analysed by PhosphorImager. Polypeptides designation is as described in ref.

HeLa cells were exposed (6 days) to <italic>mtRRF-</italic> or <italic>NT-</italic>targeted siRNA prior to BN&#x02013;PAGE. Complexes were visualized with antisera to complex I, anti-39 kDa; complex II, anti-SDH 70 kDa; complex III, anti-core 2, complex IV, anti-COII. The blot accurately reflects three experiments. SDH is a complex only comprising proteins encoded in the cytosol. (<bold>F</bold>) Respiratory coupling is modestly affected in cells depleted of human mtRRF. HeLa cells were exposed (3 days) to <italic>mtRRF</italic>-or <italic>NT-</italic>targeted siRNA prior to high resolution respirometry (as in Methods), three measures of respiratory control and capacity were made.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn576f4"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Reduction of mtRRF results in redistribution of ribosomal proteins, increased ROS and mitochondrial dysmorphism.

It has been shown that in bacteria and yeast mitochondria, inactivation of RRF inhibits protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). To determine if the same is true for the mtRRF, we investigated the effect of protein depletion on an <italic>in vivo</italic> mitochondrial protein synthesis. In the presence of <italic>mtRRF</italic> siRNA, there was partial inhibition of mitochondrial protein translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Although the effect was not as dramatic as in <italic>S. cerevisiae &#x00394;rrf1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), it must be recognized that even partial translation defects result in instability and loss of mtDNA, which in turn produce a greater impairment of mitochondrial protein synthesis. The relative synthesis of most of the components was significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, data not shown). Consequently, the steady-state levels of mtDNA-encoded proteins were progressively affected as detected by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Although we did not observe significant reduction of the protein levels after short siRNA treatment (2&#x02013;3 days), longer treatment resulted in decreased steady-state levels of mitochondrially encoded proteins of up to 40% when compared to non-targeting controls (day 6). These results were consistent with the decreased levels of fully assembled OXPHOS complexes after 6 days siRNA treatment, as revealed by Blue Native gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). Moreover, polarographic measurements showed that respiration rates of the siRNA-treated cells decreased, consistent with affected function of OXPHOS complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F).</p><p>To further decipher the exact mechanism of mtRRF function in mitochondrial translation, we looked at the sedimentation profile of HeLa cell mitoribosomes in isokinetic sucrose density gradients following mtRRF depletion. Western analysis of mitoribosomes from cells treated for 4 days with <italic>NT</italic> or <italic>mtRRF</italic> siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) showed a striking contrast in distribution of DAP3 representing the small ribosomal subunit. <italic>mtRRF</italic> siRNA caused a shift from fractions 5&#x02013;8 to mainly 7. This fraction has proteins from both mitochondrial ribosomal subunits and represents monosome accumulation. Moreover, only after mtRRF depletion where both ribosomal subunits detected in the heaviest fraction (F11), suggesting aggregation of the ribosomal proteins. We conclude that on depletion of mtRRF, monosomes are poorly dissociated into single subunits and non-functional monosomes accumulate, producing aggregates. These data are consistent with mtRRF functioning as a factor responsible for disassembly of ribosomes in human mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion of mtRRF causes increased mitochondrial ROS and changes in mitochondrial morphology</title><p>The observed aggregation of mitoribosomes may have a direct influence on mitochondrial function and may be a primary cause of cell death. Stress conditions in mitochondria are frequently associated with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To assess stress due to ROS accumulation in siRNA-treated cells, superoxide and peroxide/peroxynitrite levels were measured by mitoSOX and DHR, respectively. A statistically significant increase of ROS levels over the <italic>NT</italic> control was seen at day 3, a difference that was maintained through to day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B).</p><p>Increased ROS is often paralleled by augmented mitochondrial biogenesis and mtRRF depletion also resulted in a significant increase of mitochondrial mass as measured by NAO fluorescence, a dye that binds selectively to cardiolipin in the mitochondrial inner membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B).</p><p>These abnormalities were reflected in the progressive morphological changes of mitochondria revealed by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C 3 days and 6 days <italic>mtRRF</italic> siRNA) where the longer treatment resulted in a dramatic increase in mitochondrial density. Many more tightly packed membranous sheets were observed, which was consistent with increased mitochondrial biogenesis, whereas the numerous &#x02018;black spots&#x02019; detected in the matrix compartment are consistent with mitoribosome aggregates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our studies presented here provide the first evidence that this candidate functions as the human mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor: (i) mtRRF is a mitochondrial protein, (ii) mtRRF is able to bind bacterial ribosomes <italic>in vitro</italic> and can tightly associate with human mitoribosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>, (iii) expression of human mtRRF suppresses the partial &#x00394;<italic>rrf1</italic> respiratory deficiency in fission yeast <italic>in vivo</italic> and (iv) upon depletion of mtRRF, the relative level of mitochondrial monosomes increases whereas the free ribosomal subunits are reduced, indicating a defect in ribosome disassembly as has previously been reported on depletion of the bacterial counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Our results show that although mtRRF can associate tightly with mitoribosomes, the amount of interaction is enormously increased by pre-incubation. There are many possible hypotheses to explain this observation, but it is interesting to note that high resolution studies have shown that RRF binds bacterial ribosomes that have adopted a ratchet conformation at a site spanning both P and A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Therefore, it may be speculated that tRNA bound to these sites may prevent interaction with mtRRF allowing occupancy only when these sites become vacant.</p><p>Why does expression of human mtRRF restore the respiratory function of an <italic>rrf1</italic> mutant only in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and not in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>? Human mtRRF shows a stronger identity to <italic>S. pombe</italic> than the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> orthologue (EBI tools 21.1% versus 16.8%; Figure S4). There is an overall greater similarity between fission yeast and human mtRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and these two species share a highly conserved set of general translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In bacterial systems, functional studies with heterologous RRF and EFG proteins showed poor activity on the post-termination ribosomal complex compared to assays using RRF and EFG from the same species, underlining the importance of interplay between RRF and EFG [for example, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>)]. In light of these findings, it is also possible that human mtRRF was unable to rescue the growth phenotype of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> &#x00394;<italic>rrf1</italic> due to a weak interaction with the budding yeast 70S mitoribosome or mtEFG that also has only limited similarity with the human mtEFG.</p><p>Depletion experiments revealed that mtRRF is essential for cell viability, with depletion causing gross mitochondrial dysmorphology and dysfunction. One of the primary effects of mtRRF depletion, which seemed to precede measurable translation abnormalities, was elevated ROS production (evident by day two post-transfection). The mechanisms that lead to mitochondrial ROS overproduction, although often associated with mitochondrial dysfunction are not always clear. Our recent work on depletion of the mitochondrial release factor mtRF1a also resulted in a profound increase in mitochondrial ROS without any measurable effect on mitochondrial translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). It is possible that increased ROS production could be a direct result of mitoribosome aggregation, but other subtle indirect effects cannot be ruled out. Our results are another example that even a small disruption of interplay between mitochondrial translation, respiration and ROS production may lead to profound cellular dysfunction.</p><p>In this study, lack of ribosome recycling led to a variety of deleterious downstream consequences. Shortage of available functionally active mitoribosomes eventually affected translation, and subsequently resulted in decreased steady-state levels of mitochondrially encoded proteins, hence reduced amounts of fully assembled complexes (6 days post-transfection). It was surprising, however, that a measurable decrease in mitochondrial protein synthesis took so long to manifest. It is possible that mitoribosomes are in excess in human organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) with translation being initiated by mitoribosomes that had spontaneously disassembled. A similar process could explain the partial growth defect in yeasts lacking RRF. Another intriguing explanation could be that translation may be able to initiate from monosomes that have terminated translation, processed back along the mt-mRNA in a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032;manner to reach the 5&#x02032;-terminus and then scanned to locate the closest initiation codon, all without the monosome being dissociated. Although controversial, it must be considered that there is currently no model to explain how the mitoribosome naturally locates to the mt-mRNA initiation codon in the absence of a 5&#x02032;-cap or Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno sequence.</p><p>Finally, proteomic analysis of the factors that were eluted from immunoprecipitated mtRRF-FLAG, revealed 73 MRPs, several translation-associated factors and putative nucleoid proteins on the production and protease/DNase treatment of mitoplasts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Nucleoids are dynamic structures containing mtDNA and proteins involved in maintenance, replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>)]. These structures are well described in bacteria and close association between nucleoids and ribosomes has been previously measured in the Gram positive bacteria <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, with this association being dependent on active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Coupling of transcription and translation in human mitochondria has been frequently suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), but there has been only one report showing interaction of mtRNA polymerase with a mitoribosomal protein, MRPL12, an interaction that was shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to stimulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In a recent report on proteins associated with nucleoids, 15 mitoribosomal proteins were identified, along with assorted factors that also function in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This observation is consistent with our data, but the authors were concerned that MRPs may have been present due to adventitious co-purification. Such a criticism could also be levelled at our observation, particularly as we were unable to completely remove cytosolic contamination, even in the mitoplasting experiments. Without further experimentation, this remains only tentative evidence of a direct physical link between mitoribosome and nucleoid. However, these proteomic studies also revealed several other candidate proteins that may be associated with the translational machinery and/or nucleoids. These findings open exciting avenues for further investigations.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn576/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>AFM and ANR (grant JCJC06-0163 to I.K., M.G. and N.B.); MEST-CT-FP6-503684 (to J.R. and M.W.); EUMITOCOMBAT (LSHM-CT-2004-503116 to J.W., J.S. and R.N.L.).
