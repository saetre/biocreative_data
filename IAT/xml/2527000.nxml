Just as patterning and morphogenesis are required to sculpt the body during embryogenesis and larval development, similar cellular differentiation pathways must be continuously re-deployed in the adult to compensate for the turnover of differentiated cells, to generate context-specific specialized cell types, and to repair damaged tissues. For example, in adult mammals, cellular differentiation pathways are activated to replace various cells of the hematopoietic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], to differentiate ova [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], to develop mature hair follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and to heal wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Many such "adult developmental" processes are thought to depend upon stem cells exhibiting varying degrees of developmental potency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Additionally, the same developmental processes may occur in those adult animals that are capable of extensively regenerating missing body parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>One family of genes known to be involved in both pre-adult and adult development is the Runx family of transcription factors. Runx proteins are important for myriad developmental processes in both protostomes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>) and deuterostomes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, vertebrates and echinoderms) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). The Runx protein in a basal deuterostome, the sea urchin <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus </italic>was found to be involved in basic developmental processes in the embryo and larva such as control of cell differentiation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], while an isoform of one of the zebrafish <italic>Runx </italic>genes products, Runx2b was recently found be a maternal factor acting as a ventral determining regulator in the earliest stages of axis formation in the embryo, further illustrating the importance of these factors in multiple aspects and phases of animal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Importantly, Runx factors have been also widely shown to play particularly key roles in cell fate determination and the maintenance of stem cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Some metazoans, including <italic>C. elegans </italic>and the sea urchin, have a single <italic>Runt</italic>-like gene, while others, including <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Fugu</italic>, may harbor up to four genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Mammalian genomes contain three <italic>Runx </italic>genes, each of which is critical for several different developmental processes occurring during embryogenesis: <italic>Runx1 </italic>is important for hematopoiesis and neurogenesis of distinct CNS neurons and nociceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], <italic>Runx2 </italic>is critical for skeletal morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and <italic>Runx3 </italic>is important for neurogenesis of proprioceptive neurons in the DRG and for hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Mammalian Runx proteins are also important for recurring developmental processes in the adult. For instance, loss of <italic>Runx1 </italic>in the adult causes hematopoietic abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>Runx2 </italic>in adults increases bone turnover leading to multiple fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>Runx3 </italic>controls CD8 cells, dendritic cells and CD4 Th1 cells development in adult stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p><italic>Runx </italic>genes regulate transcription of target genes by binding to a variant of the consensus binding site RCCRCA (R = purine). Cis-regulatory Runx binding sites have been found in proximal promoter regions, as distant as a few thousand base pairs from the start methionine, in introns, and even within the coding region of genes whose transcription they regulate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Runx binding is mediated by a highly conserved DNA-binding domain termed the Runt domain (RD) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). While the RD can bind DNA independently, <italic>in vivo </italic>binding usually occurs with its heterodimeric binding partner CBF&#x003b2;. The protein CBF&#x003b2; lacks a DNA-binding domain, but when bound to Runx, it increases the DNA-binding affinity of the RD several fold, substantially enhancing its transcriptional activity (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). All presently known Runx proteins terminate in a short conserved pentapeptide motif, VWRPY, which binds the co-repressor Groucho and allows them to act as transcriptional repressors under certain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A post-translational control mechanism for mammalian Runx DNA-binding activity occurs via two cysteine 'redox switch' residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, due to their ability to either activate or suppress target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], when <italic>Runx </italic>genes are mutated or their regulation is perturbed, they can act as either tumor suppressors or tumor inducers.</p><p>While <italic>Runx </italic>has been intensively studied in some triploblastic animals, little is known about its presence and function in the more ancient "basal" animal lineages such as cnidarians and sponges. These lineages are critical to understanding the early functional evolution of Runx because they diverged from the main metazoan stem lineage prior to the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Over 99% of all extant animal species belong to the Triploblastica (or the Bilateria), including deuterostomes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, vertebrates and sea urchins) and protostomes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, insects and nematodes). Additionally, basal animals may be particularly informative about the evolution of developmental genes required during pre-adult and adult stages because they exhibit much greater regenerative capacity than many triploblastic model systems. For example, both sponges and cnidarians are able to completely regenerate from very small body fragments, and even from aggregates of single cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In cnidarians, this extensive regenerative capacity extends to the nervous system, which is able to regenerate in its entirety after injury. It is experimentally possible to eliminate the entire cnidarian nervous system, obtaining viable epithelial animals which regenerate a complete and functional nerve network when repopulated with interstitial stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. During the regeneration process in hydra, pluripotent interstitial stem cells differentiate to form new nerve cells, gland cells and stinging neurons (nematocytes). In addition, the differentiated cells at the regenerating region undergo de-differentiation to form epithelial stem cells, which then re-differentiate to complete the regeneration process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Sponges have only four cell types, and one of these cell types, the archaeocyte, is a stem-cell lineage that gives rise to the three other differentiated cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus, cnidarians and sponges are excellent model organisms to study how developmental potency can be maintained in both stem cells and differentiated cells, and how de-differentiation and differentiation processes are initiated and controlled during <italic>de-novo </italic>creation of form upon regeneration.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Species level phylogeny for taxa utilized in this analysis</bold>.

In the course of this work we identified <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>genes in cnidarians and sponges, revealing that these genes existed in the ancestral metazoan, an organism which lived perhaps as much as ~300 million years before the previously known earliest <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>genes from the bilaterian ancestor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The sequence of the Runt domain is highly conserved between sponges (<italic>Amphimedon queenslandica </italic>and <italic>Oscarella carmela</italic>), cnidarians (the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, the freshwater hydra, <italic>Hydra magnipapillata</italic>, and the staghorn coral, <italic>Acropora millepora</italic>), and triploblastic animals. Likewise, the heterodimeric Runx/CBF&#x003b2; transcription factor complex and its mode of DNA-binding appear to be highly conserved between sponges, cnidarians, and humans. <italic>In situ </italic>hybridization studies in adult <italic>Nematostella </italic>reveal expression in isolated cells of the tentacles, which may represent sensory neurons or their pluripotent progenitors. This possibility is intriguing because Runx factors are required for the development of sensory neurons in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Novel <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF</italic>&#x003b2; genes in basal metazoans</title><p>To detect Runx and CBF&#x003b2; genes in phylogenetically basal organisms, we used bioinformatic approaches to search EST and genomic databases for <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>in basal metazoans and unicellular protozoans.

The incomplete ESTs we identified do not encode the complete carboxy-terminus of the proteins, thus we cannot tell whether these sponge proteins also contain the Groucho-binding motif at their C-termini. However, all of the Runx proteins we have identified contain the two cysteine residues that act as redox switches in mammals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]). Notably, the second of these two cysteine residues (aligned residue 32 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) functions as a redox switch in deuterostomes but not in protostomes (being replaced by a serine residue in the latter). This position is a cysteine in both cnidarians and in one of the two sponge sequences (<italic>A. queenslandica</italic>), while being a valine in the freshwater sponge (<italic>Oscarella carmela</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>CBF&#x003b2;</title><p>A search of the NCBI EST database revealed three cnidarian <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>ESTs &#x02013; one from <italic>Nematostella (Nv-CBF&#x003b2;)</italic>, one from <italic>Hydra magnipapillata </italic>(<italic>Hm-CBF&#x003b2;) </italic>and one from a pre-settlement stage of the coral <italic>Acropora millepora </italic>(<italic>Am-CBF&#x003b2;</italic>).

To test whether the cnidarian and sponge variants of these proteins possess the structural determinants necessary for them to interact and bind DNA together in a manner homologous to the human complex, we modeled their three dimensional structure using the human AML1(RUNX1)RD-CBF&#x003b2;-DNA complex as a modeling template (see Methods). Unless noted otherwise, all residue numbers described in the text below correspond to the human RUNX1 and CBF&#x003b2; proteins (see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> for a detailed comparison of the amino acids and their positions in the cnidarian and sponge proteins).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> shows a general view of the model of the <italic>Nematostella </italic>RD-CBF&#x003b2; dimer in complex with DNA, with the functional residues involved in RD-CBF&#x003b2; dimerization and DNA binding highlighted as ball-and-stick models.

This can best be demonstrated with a more detailed analysis of the <italic>Nematostella </italic>Runx-CBF&#x003b2;-DNA complex: in Nv-Runx, 13 of the 19 residues on the CBF&#x003b2; binding face are conserved, including all P and G residues that may be important for the folding of the polypeptide chain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Four additional residues (M106, Y113, S114 and T147) are replaced by amino acids with similar physical-chemical characteristics, and only two residues (F153 and H163) are significantly different. The latter two residues are found in the outer rim of the interface where protein-protein contacts are generally less conserved. Similarly, 12 of the 18 residues involved in Runx binding by the human CBF&#x003b2; are identical in Nv-CBF&#x003b2;. Four additional residues have conserved physical-chemical characteristics (F17, T60, S65 and M101), and 2 residues (Q67 and P100) are significantly different (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that the latter residues, while different, are well accommodated within the structure of the proteins: F153 of human Runx, which is in a hydrophobic environment (L102, T104, T121, T151), is replaced by K in Nv-Runx, whose side chain is capable of making most of the interactions with the hydrophobic environment. The positively charged end of this K makes an H-bond with the S that replaces T104. H163 in human Runx1 makes an exposed interaction (and therefore of small energetic contribution) with D66; it is replaced by C in Nv-Runx, which cannot form such an interaction but can interact with the nearby backbone carbonyl. P100 of human CBF&#x003b2;, which makes hydrophobic contacts with Y85 and I109, is replaced by H in Nv-CBF&#x003b2;. This residue can form a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of F69. Q67 of human CBF&#x003b2; is solvent exposed in the separated molecule: it is replaced by H in <italic>Nematostella </italic>without losing or gaining particular contacts.</p><p>Interestingly, while not all of the residues in the RD-CBF&#x003b2; interface are conserved between <italic>Nematostella </italic>and humans, a change in the residue of one protein is accompanied by a reciprocal change in its binding partner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). One such change involves residues F153 and M106 in human Runx1 RD, which interface with S65 and Q67 of CBF&#x003b2;. <italic>Nematostella </italic>differs at both positions in its RD, where F153 and M106 are replaced by K121 and A73 in the <italic>Nematostella </italic>protein; these changes in the Runx protein are mirrored by changes in CBF&#x003b2;, where S65 and Q67 are replaced by T65 and H67 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Another reciprocal change involves H163 of human Runx1 RD, which interfaces with T62 and F17 in CBF&#x003b2;; the corresponding residues in <italic>Nematostella </italic>are C131 (in RD) and S62 and M17 (in CBF&#x003b2;), respectively. This suggests that while the specific residues may differ between taxa, these proteins have co-evolved to maintain their functional interaction.</p><p>In contrast to the Runx proteins from the cnidarians and the demosponge <italic>Amphimedon</italic>, the CBF&#x003b2; binding face of the sponge <italic>Oscarella carmela </italic>Runx protein is quite distinct, with many non-conservative amino acid substitutions found both in the periphery and in the center of the CBF&#x003b2; binding region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). This suggests either that the corresponding CBF&#x003b2; protein in this sponge is considerably different, or that the Oc-Runx does not bind a CBF&#x003b2; protein at all.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic history of Runx and CBF&#x003b2;</title><p><italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>genes have previously been reported in many different phyla of triploblastic animals where a single species may contain multiple <italic>Runx </italic>or <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>genes. The detection of <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>genes in cnidarians and sponges allows, for the first time, reconstruction of their early evolutionary history, in the period preceding the evolutionary origin of Triploblasts.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> depicts a phylogeny of Runx proteins from sponges, cnidarians, chordates, echinoderms, and arthropods. Sequences from the nematodes <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>C. brigsae</italic>, and <italic>D. coronatus </italic>were excluded from this analysis as they are highly divergent from the other metazoan Runx proteins, and their inclusion would tend to cause long-branch attraction artifacts. An analysis including the nematode species is presented in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref> for taxon IDs). The tree is rooted using the two sponge sequences. Consistent with the prevailing view of organismal phylogeny, this gene tree groups the two sponge sequences, the eighteen triploblast sequences, the six chordate sequences, the two urchin sequences, and the ten arthropod sequences into mutually exclusive clades, with each clade receiving bootstrap support &#x0003e; 75%. The Runx sequences do not recover a monophyletic Deuterostomia as the two sea urchin sequences (<italic>Strongylocentrotus </italic>and <italic>Heliocidaris</italic>) group more closely with insects than with chordates (although the bootstrap support for this grouping is relatively low). Neither does the Runx tree support cnidarian monophyly, as the sea anemone and hydra sequences appear as successive outgroups at the base of the triploblast clade. Interestingly, this tree implies that the cnidarian proteins have evolved relatively slowly. In particular, the sea anemone Runx appears to have undergone the least amount of evolutionary change of any taxon since the time of the sponge-triploblast ancestor. The anemone may therefore represent our best source of information regarding the ancestral Runx protein. As the human Runx paralogs (Runx1&#x02013;3) and the insect Runx paralogs (e.g., Drosophila Lozenge, Runt, RuntA, and RuntB) fall into distinct and well supported clades, this tree implies that the ancestral Runx gene underwent independent gene duplication in the deuterostome and protostome lineages.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogeny of Runx (A) and CBF&#x003b2; (B) proteins</bold>. In both cases, maximum likelihood trees were constructed using the program PhyML. In the case of Runx, likelihoods were calculated using the Rt-REV amino acid substitution matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. In the case of CBF&#x003b2;, likelihoods were calculated using the JTT amino acid substitution matrix. Separate neighbor-joining analyses using the JTT distance matrix were also performed for each data set (not shown). The bars and icons indicate the locations of the taxonomic groupings on each tree with the deuterostome and protostome groups marked with filled and empty circles respectively. Both trees are rooted between the sponge sequences and the eumetazoan sequences. The length of each horizontal branch is proportional to the number of amino acid substitutions that have occurred along that branch (scale at lower part of each panel). The first and second numbers at each node indicate the percentage of 1,000 bootstrap replicates in which the given clade is recovered with maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining analyses, respectively. Nodes which failed to receive at least 40% bootstrap support in one of the analyses are not labeled.

Once again, the nematode sequences were found to be highly divergent from other metazoan CBF&#x003b2; proteins, and they were excluded from this analysis. A tree containing these sequences is presented as Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref> for taxon IDs). Like the Runx tree, this gene tree recovers the monophyly of a number of accepted taxonomic groups. It groups the three cnidarian sequences, the two sea urchin sequences, the five insect sequences, the two ascidian sequences and the eight vertebrate sequences. Furthermore, the vertebrate clade is subdivided among three well established monophyletic taxa: the two jawless fishes (<italic>Eptatretus </italic>and <italic>Petromyzon</italic>), the two ray-finned fishes (<italic>Danio </italic>and <italic>Oryzias</italic>), and the four tetrapods (<italic>Xenopus, Gallus, Mus, and Homo</italic>). Once again, as in the Runx tree, the sea urchin sequences (<italic>Strongylocentrotus </italic>and <italic>Paracentrotus</italic>) do not group with other deuterostome sequences or even with the other echinoderm sequence in the analysis, the sea star <italic>Asterina</italic>. The tree is not consistent with triploblast monophyly because the cnidarian sequences fall within a cluster of deuterostome sequences.</p><p>In addition to the apparent reciprocity of amino acid changes that we have observed in the interacting portions of Runx and CBF&#x003b2;, the anomalous position of the sea urchin sequences on both the Runx and CBF&#x003b2; trees could be another reflection of co-evolution between these proteins. To explore this hypothesis further, we employed a variation on the protein co-evolution test proposed by Sato and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). When each of the phylogenies described above is limited to only those 11 taxa contained in both phylogenies, and the tree topologies are constrained to the accepted organismal phylogeny (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), the resultant branch lengths on the two trees are significantly and strongly correlated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, <italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.83; Linear Least Regression test for significance: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,17 </sub>= 85.11, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001). In contrast, the branch lengths from a glyceraldehyde-phosphate-dehydrogenase phylogeny, which is a "house-keeping" gene serving as a control, are not correlated with the Runx branch lengths (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,17 </sub>= 2.73, <italic>p </italic>= 0.1167) and only weakly correlated with the branch lengths from the CBF&#x003b2; phylogeny (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,17 </sub>= 9.31, <italic>p </italic>= 0.0072, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>= 0.35).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Co-evolution of Runx and CBF&#x003b2; proteins</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>We generated the accepted organismal phylogeny relating 11 taxa for which both Runx and CBF&#x003b2; sequences are available.

The presence of only a single <italic>Runx </italic>locus in Porifera and Cnidaria, two of the most ancient animal phyla, along with the fact that both the maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) trees can be rooted such that the sponge and cnidarian sequences emerge from the base of the tree, supports the hypothesis that the eumetazoan ancestor possessed only a single <italic>Runx </italic>locus. Subsequently, it appears that this ancestral <italic>Runx </italic>gene underwent independent duplications within arthropods and within vertebrates. While the non-insect arthropods are only known to possess single <italic>Runx </italic>genes, and the Runt1 sequences from spider (<italic>Cupennius</italic>), mite (<italic>Tetranychus</italic>), and crayfish (<italic>Pacifastacus</italic>) cluster together, distinct <italic>Runt</italic>, <italic>Runx</italic>A, and <italic>Lozenge </italic>genes are found in both <italic>Anopholes </italic>and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <italic>Drosophila </italic>also possesses a fourth Runx paralog, <italic>RuntB</italic>. This requires at least three gene duplications among dipteran insects, with at least two of these gene duplications clearly predating the divergence between fruit fly and mosquito. While only single Runx proteins are known from the non-vertebrate chordates (<italic>Branchiostoma floridae, B. lanceolatum</italic>, and <italic>Ciona</italic>), there are three human paralogs (<italic>Runx 1&#x02013;3</italic>), which cluster together on the tree. This is not surprising given that two rounds of whole genome duplication are known to have occurred early in vertebrate evolution, prior to the divergence of the ray-finned fishes from the lobe-finned fishes. The genomes of pufferfishes (<italic>Fugu </italic>and <italic>Tetraodon</italic>), which are ray-finned fishes, contain four <italic>Runx </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], three of which appear as orthologs of the mammalian <italic>Runx1&#x02013;3</italic>. The additional <italic>Runx </italic>gene has a relatively short coding region; it has been suggested that it represents an ancestral vertebrate <italic>Runx </italic>that was subsequently lost in the tetrapod lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Zebrafish also contain four <italic>Runx </italic>genes, however two of those are clearly <italic>Runx2 </italic>orthologs (<italic>Runx2a </italic>and <italic>Runx2b</italic>) that likely arose from partial or whole genome duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The two zebrafish Runx2 paralogs have different functions, including the aforementioned role of Runx2b in dorso-ventral axis formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, the evolution of this gene family displays dynamic changes in gene number as a result of gene duplications but also of possible gene loss.</p><p>With respect to CBF&#x003b2;, the presence of only a single known CBF&#x003b2; homolog in all taxa except the fruit fly, including other insects (e.g., <italic>Apis </italic>and <italic>Bombyx</italic>) points to a single, relatively recent gene duplication, in the lineage leading to <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>On both the Runx and CBF&#x003b2; trees, two sea urchin sequences group together with robust bootstrap support (100%), but fail to group with other deuterostome taxa as expected. In the case of <italic>Runx</italic>, the two echinoid sequences (<italic>Strongylocentrotus </italic>and <italic>Heliocidaris</italic>) appear most closely related to an arthropod clade, although with relatively low bootstrap support (65%). In the case of CBF&#x003b2;, the two echinoid sequences (<italic>Strongylocentrotus </italic>and <italic>Paracentrotus</italic>) fail to group with a fellow echinoderm, the starfish <italic>Asterina</italic>, instead appearing most closely related to a sequence from a snail (<italic>Biomphalaria</italic>). The bootstrap support for this particular grouping is &#x0003c;40%. The low bootstrap support indicates that the echinoids are not exhibiting a strong affinity for protostome sequences so much as they are exhibiting a lack of affinity for the more closely related deuterostome sequences. The simplest explanation for this pattern, which is also supported by echinoid-specific residues in the sequence alignments (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) is that these proteins have undergone echinoid-specific sequence changes that obscure their underlying affinity to other deuterostome sequences.</p><p>For both proteins, the amino acid substitution rates differ between lineages. In particular, both Runx and CBF&#x003b2; have diverged rapidly in <italic>Drosphila </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>, resulting in the fruit fly and nematode proteins being less similar to their human homologs than are the cnidarian proteins, despite being more closely related to humans by some 50 million years. <italic>Drosophila </italic>Runx RD's share, on average, ~72% of residues with human Runx proteins (as compared to 81% for <italic>Nematostella</italic>) while <italic>C. elegans and C. briggsae </italic>share, on average, only ~48% residues with human RD. Likewise, the CBF&#x003b2; proteins from cnidarians share 57&#x02013;59% of the residues with human CBF&#x003b2;, respectively, whereas <italic>Drosphila </italic>and <italic>C. elegans </italic>share only ~55% and 22%, respectively. These data are consistent with a number of recent studies that have noted greater genomic similarity between humans and anthozoan cnidarians than between humans and the major protostome model systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. It remains to be seen whether the gene duplication events of both <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>in various lineages are correlated with a diversification of the roles and regulatory networks in these organisms. Such questions may be addressed through functional studies of proteins and computational predictions of regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec><title>Runx and CBF&#x003b2; binding, co-evolution, and co-expression</title><p>The majority of the amino acids involved in the binding of CBF&#x003b2; to Runx, and the binding of the Runx-CBF&#x003b2; protein complex to DNA, are highly conserved between human and <italic>Nematostella</italic>. Our comparative protein modeling results show a high degree of stabilizing selection within the Runt domain (RD) and the RD-interacting face of CBF&#x003b2;. Further, the complete conservation within the metazoa of residues necessary for interaction between the RD and DNA suggests that the RD-CBF&#x003b2;-DNA complex has been essentially conserved throughout the ~700 million year history of the eumetazoa, in animals whose morphology, ecology, and physiology are as diverse as terrestrial vertebrates, aerial arthropods and marine invertebrates. Interestingly, the CBF&#x003b2;-binding faces of the sponge proteins are more divergent. Indeed, the <italic>Oscarella </italic>Runx represents the longest branch on the Runx phylogeny. This is interesting given that we failed to recover a CBF&#x003b2; homolog from this sponge. This higher degree of sequence divergence within the CBF&#x003b2;-binding face of <italic>O. carmela </italic>Runx combined with the lack of CBF&#x003b2; expression in developmentally mixed EST pools could indicate CBF&#x003b2; loss within this demosponge or indicate that this demosponge may deserve a basal position within the metazoan lineage, pre-dating the origin of CBF&#x003b2;. Targeted sequencing for CBF&#x003b2; within genomic sequence of <italic>O. carmela </italic>may help resolve this.</p><p>Notably, where the <italic>Nematostella </italic>CBF&#x003b2; protein differs from human, there appear to be compensatory changes in the <italic>Nematostella </italic>RD. The possibility of compensatory substitutions in the RD and CBF&#x003b2; proteins of sea anemone and human suggests that functional constraints require that directional selection on either protein may promote commensurate divergence in its partner. To test this hypothesis over broad phylogenetic distances, we employed a variation on the protein co-evolution test proposed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Our results indicate a significant and highly predictive relationship between the branch lengths of Runx and CBF&#x003b2; phylogenetic trees, providing further support that the evolutionary rates of these two domains are correlated.</p><p>However, shared evolutionary histories could result in significant correlations between any pair of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. For example, any two proteins will exhibit a correlation if they have evolved in clock-like fashion on the same underlying phylogeny, or if the species from which they are derived differ substantially in their overall rates of molecular evolution. To evaluate the contribution of shared history to the observed correlation, we can compare proteins that do not interact functionally. We observed no correlation between the molecular evolution of Runx and GAPDH, a well-conserved 'house-keeping' gene, and we observed only a weak correlation between CBF&#x003b2; and GAPDH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Taken together with the reciprocal amino acid changes that have occurred over deep evolutionary divergences, this strongly suggests that these two proteins have co-evolved from sponges and cnidarians to humans to maintain their ability to co-regulate the transcription of target genes.</p></sec><sec><title>A role for Runx and CBF&#x003b2; in nerve cells of adult <italic>Nematostella</italic>?</title><p>In the adult anemone, <italic>Nv-Runx </italic>is expressed in scattered ectodermal cells, mainly in the tentacles, and predominantly in the tentacle tips. Scattered cells in the body wall ectoderm also express <italic>Runx</italic>. Similarly, <italic>Nv-CBF&#x003b2; </italic>is expressed most strongly in the ectoderm of the tentacle tips. However, in contrast to <italic>Runx</italic>, <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>is also expressed in the mouth and upper portion of the pharynx. Thus, <italic>Nv-Runx </italic>and <italic>Nv-CBF&#x003b2; </italic>are expressed in similar, but possibly not completely overlapping regions of the anemone head and tentacles. Here, as in other systems, including mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and sea-urchins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], CBF&#x003b2; likely functions together with Runx in the sites where they overlap. At other sites, where CBF&#x003b2; is expressed in the absence of Runx, CBF&#x003b2; may have other roles, which may involve other partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The tentacles of sea anemones, where the expression of both <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF</italic>&#x003b2; is most predominant, are the part of the animal involved in prey capture and manipulation. This region is relatively poor in cell types, with the majority of differentiated cell types present involved either in prey capture (nematocytes, spirocytes) or in its detection (sensory neurons and ganglion cells) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7H</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]). The nematocytes themselves do not seem to express either <italic>Runx </italic>or <italic>CBF&#x003b2;</italic>, nor do the gland/mucous cells, which are found exclusively in the apical part of the ectoderm (<italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>expression is seen mainly in the mid and basal parts of the ectoderm). Thus, we speculate that the cells expressing <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>are probably neuronal cells. Alternatively, they could be precursors of one of the above differentiated cell types &#x02013; most likely of nematocytes and spirocytes, which are highly enriched in the tentacles, especially towards the distal tips.</p><p>In vertebrates, Runx proteins are known to play critical roles in neural differentiation. For example, in mice, <italic>Runx1 </italic>and <italic>Runx3 </italic>influence the development and survival of sensory neurons in several ganglia types such as dorsal root ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].

Based on these findings, it was speculated that a <italic>Runx3 </italic>ortholog may play an analogous role in the highly similar anemone nematocysts response circuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. The spatial expression of <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>in adult <italic>Nematostella </italic>suggests that these proteins might also be involved in neural differentiation.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest a putative role for Runx in the maintenance of specific neurons in the tentacles of adult anemones, in addition to the diversity of other networks and functions in which Runx is also likely involved. In vertebrates, Runx proteins regulate disparate functions at different developmental stages, in each case by interacting with a different regulatory network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

Future studies involving microarray analysis of gene expression, CHIP-ChIP analysis of <italic>Nv-Runx </italic>target genes, and gene knockdown experiments may help identify the various roles played by Nv-Runx, Nv-CBF&#x003b2;, and their regulatory networks at different stages in the life history of <italic>Nematostella</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we showed that <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>are found in the most basal metazoans, cnidarians and sponges, and that in these animals they probably interact and bind DNA in a manner similar to that found in humans. Structural motifs involved in the regulation of the Runx-CBF&#x003b2; pair, such as the Runx C-terminal Groucho binding motif and the cysteine redox switches, are also conserved, suggesting that other parts of the regulatory network in which Runx and CBF&#x003b2; are embedded are also evolutionarily conserved. Both Runx and CBF&#x003b2; are expressed mainly in small cells within the ectoderm of the tentacles, the identity of which still await proof, but may be sensory neurons or their precursors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Maintenance of Anemones</title><p><italic>Nematostella vectensis </italic>was obtained from the Aquatic Resources Division of the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, as well as from the stock maintained at the Finnerty laboratory at Boston University.

Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze the expression of <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>transcripts in different body regions of the anemone. Adult anemones were first anesthetized by gradually supplementing the culture medium with 14% w/v MgCl<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;6H<sub>2</sub>O. Transverse sections were made using a razor blade to divide each animal into four distinct axial regions: (1) tentacles, (2) head/pharyngeal region (containing tentacle bases), (3) body column, and (4) physal region. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using RevertAid&#x02122; H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Life Sciences, EU). <italic>Runx </italic>and <italic>CBF&#x003b2; </italic>were amplified from these cDNA pools in a Mastercycler gradient PCR machine (Eppendorf) using Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas) under the conditions specified by the manufacturer. The oligonucleotides used were: <italic>Nv-Runx </italic>TCTCCGAATTTTGTGTGCAG and TTCTACTGCGGAATCCATCC of exon 1 and exon 3 respectively; <italic>Nv-CBF&#x003b2; </italic>GAAAACTCGCTCGTGAATCC and AGTCTTTGCTTCGCCTGTTC of exon 1 and exon 5 respectively and actin primers CATGGAATTGTCACAAACTGG and CACACTTCATGATGGAGTTG that are general for cnidarians. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega), and sequenced at the Hebrew University Genome Center.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In-situ </italic>hybridization</title><p><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization was performed using the protocol reported by Martinez and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>] with several modifications. Briefly, medium sized adult <italic>Nematostella </italic>(3 days after last feeding) were transferred into a small dish, allowed to relax for about one hour and anesthetized as described above. After about 10 minutes, the anemones did not respond to tactile stimulation, at which point they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in NM for at least four hours at room temperature. The animals were dehydrated through a methanol series, rehydrated into PBST (Phosphate Buffered Saline containing 0.1% Tween-20), and digested for 20 minutes with 0.3 U/ml Proteinase K (Roche). The digestion was terminated by incubation in 4% Glycine in PBST for ten minutes. The animals were then washed twice in PBST, twice in 0.1 M triethanolamine (pH 7.8) twice in 0. 25% (v/v) acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine, twice more in PBST, and then refixed for one hour in 4% PFA in PBST. After several more washes in PBST, the anemones were washed once in 50% PBST/50% HS (Hybridization Solution: 50% formamide, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 &#x000d7; SSC, 0.1% CHAPS, 1&#x000d7; Denhardt's solution, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml heparin and 200 &#x003bc;g/ml tRNA), once in 100% HS, and prehybridized in 100% HS for at least two hours at 55&#x000b0;C. Hybridization was performed in HS containing 0.05 ng/&#x003bc;l of the appropriate DIG-labeled probe (produced using the DIG RNA labeling kit, Roche) for 48&#x02013;72 hours at 55&#x000b0;C. Following hybridization, the animals were taken through a series of seven washes, each lasting 1 hour at 55&#x000b0;C (100% HS/tRNA; 100%, HS/2 &#x000d7; SSC; 75% HS/2 &#x000d7; SSC, 50% HS/2 &#x000d7; SSC; 25% HS/2 &#x000d7; SSC; 2 &#x000d7; SSC/1% CHAPS, 2 &#x000d7; SSC/1% CHAPS). The animals were then transferred to MAB (Maleic Acid Buffer: 0.1 M Maleic Acid, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5), blocked for at least two hours in blocking solution (20% Goat Serum, 1% Bovine Serum Albumin, 0.1% Sodium Azide in MAB) and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies (Roche) that had been preadsorbed to adult <italic>Nematostella</italic>. Following incubation with the antibody, the animals were washed extensively in MAB over a 24-hour period at room temperature and transferred into NTMT (0.1 M NaCl, 0.05 M MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.1% Tween-20 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.5). Presence of the antibody was detected using the color substrate NBT-BCIP (Roche). The staining reaction was terminated by extensive washing with PBST. Pictures were taken with either an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with an Optronics camera or an Olympus dissecting microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an Olympus DP10 CCD camera (Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Sectioning of animals after whole mount <italic>in-situ </italic>hybridization</title><p>Following whole-mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization, animals were washed extensively in PBST, infiltrated with 30% sucrose in PBST as a cryoprotectant, immersed in Tissue-Tek medium and frozen on dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Ten-micron sections were taken using a Leica CM1850 cryostat (Wetzlar, Germany). The sections were counterstained in Eosin and mounted in glycerol without dehydration and tissue clearing, as this can cause loss of the color precipitate. Micrographs were takes with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with an Optronics camera. For the histological sections of the mouth region, an anemone was taken after whole mount <italic>in-situ </italic>hybridization with a control probe, refixed in 4% PFA in PBST, dehydrated into isopropanol and embedded in Agar-100 resin. Two-micron sections were taken with an Ultratome-3 (LKB-Prodikter) and stained with Methylene Blue.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JCS, DS, JRF and UG conceived and designed the study.
