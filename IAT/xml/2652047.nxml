Bacterial cold shock proteins function as RNA chaperones by destabilizing RNA secondary structures and promoting translation as an adaptative mechanism to low temperature stress. In animals, cold shock domain proteins exhibit broad functions related to growth and development. In order to understand better the function of CSPs <italic>in planta</italic>, detailed analyses were performed for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> CSPs (<italic>AtCSPs</italic>) on the transcript and protein levels using an extensive series of tissue harvested throughout developmental stages within the entire life cycle of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. On both the transcript and protein levels, <italic>AtCSPs</italic> were enriched in shoot apical meristems and siliques. Although all <italic>AtCSPs</italic> exhibited similar expression patterns, <italic>AtCSP2</italic> was the most abundantly expressed gene. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization analyses were also used to confirm that <italic>AtCSP2</italic> and <italic>AtCSP4</italic> transcripts accumulate in developing embryos and shoot apices. <italic>AtCSPs</italic> transcripts were also induced during a controlled floral induction study. <italic>In vivo</italic> ChIP analysis confirmed that an embryo expressed MADS box transcription factor, AGL15, interacts within two <italic>AtCSP</italic> promoter regions and alters the respective patterns of <italic>AtCSP</italic> transcription. Comparative analysis of <italic>AtCSP</italic> gene expression between Landsberg and Columbia ecotypes confirmed a 1000-fold reduction of <italic>AtCSP4</italic> gene expression in the Landsberg background. Analysis of the <italic>AtCSP4</italic> genomic locus identified multiple polymorphisms in putative regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-elements between the two ecotypes. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that <italic>AtCSPs</italic> are involved in the transition to flowering and silique development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cold shock domain proteins</kwd><kwd>floral development</kwd><kwd>RNA binding proteins</kwd><kwd>silique development</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cold shock domain proteins (CSPs) are DNA/RNA binding proteins, which are conserved from bacteria to animals and higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Makino <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karlson and Imai, 2003</xref>).

A wheat CSP (WCSP1) localizes to the ER network, nuclear envelope, nucleus, and Cajal bodies and exhibits similar <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> functions as bacterial cold shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakaminami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that plant CSPs share a similar function with prokaryotic counterparts and may function at the transcriptional and/or translational level <italic>in planta</italic>.</p><p>In other eukaryotic systems, many CSPs have been identified and extensively studied. A <italic>Xenopus</italic> Y-box protein, FRGY2 accumulates during oogenesis and embryogenesis and functions during nucleolar disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tafuri and Wolffe, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gonda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003, 2006</xref>). The rabbit P50 protein was identified as a component of ribonucleoprotein particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evdokimova <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>) and it functions to maintain mRNA stability via binding to the cap region of mRNA and, consequently, inhibits translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evdokimova <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nekrasov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The post-transcriptional regulator from <italic>C. elegans</italic>, LIN-28 has an essential role in the timing of developmental transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moss <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seggerson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). YB-1 (dbpB) is a well-studied multi-functional human CSD protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakura <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wolffe, 1994</xref>) which is involved in the regulation of transcription and translation, DNA repair, stress response, and RNA masking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evdokimova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). YB-1 also regulates gene expression of cell cycle-related genes and plays an important role for embryo development in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jurchott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uchiumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Collectively, these aforementioned studies enabled us to hypothesize that plant CSPs may also play an important role related to developmental transitions such as flowering and silique development <italic>in planta</italic>.</p><p>Throughout the various stages of plant development, a myriad of regulatory genes are expressed. For example, in the vegetative stage, leaf development is largely regulated by KNOX1, a homeotic transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bharathan and Sinha, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hake <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). To generate the inflorescence, dramatic alterations occur between the vegetative and reproductive stages within apical meristems. Floral development is regulated by many genes including homeotic genes. As described in the ABC model of floral development, APETALA2 (AP2), APETALA1 (AP1), APETALA3 (AP3), PISTILLATA (PI), and AGAMOUS (AG) are integral components for regulating the development of various floral organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coen and Meyerowitz, 1991</xref>). Seed development and embryogenesis have also been extensively studied on a molecular level. Among the numerous genes associated with embryogenesis, AGAMOUS-like 15 (AGL15) is a well-studied MADS domain transcription factor that is implicated to have an important role during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heck <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rounsley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). Developmental related transcription factors regulate specific downstream gene targets and may trigger a response in plants which promotes transitions in development such as the initiation of flowering and embryogenesis. Consequently, the identification of downstream targets for developmental-related transcription factors is of great interest.</p><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> contains four CSP homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karlson and Imai, 2003</xref>). In this study the gene family is referred to as: <italic>AtCSP1</italic> (<italic>CSDP1</italic>; At4g36020), <italic>AtCSP2</italic> (<italic>AtGRP2</italic>/<italic>CSDP2</italic>; At4g38680), <italic>AtCSP3</italic> (At2g17870), and <italic>AtCSP4</italic> (<italic>AtGRP2b</italic>; At2g21060). AtCSPs contain an N-terminal cold shock domain and either seven or two C-terminal glycine-rich regions for AtCSP1/AtCSP3 and AtCSP2/AtCSP4, respectively. Similar to bacterial CSPs and winter wheat WCSP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakaminami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), two independent studies recently demonstrated that <italic><underline>A</underline>rabidopsis <underline>t</underline>haliana</italic> CSPs (AtCSPs) exhibit DNA/RNA binding and RNA chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fusaro <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> reported that <italic>AtCSPs</italic> are localized to the shoot apical meristem and ovules. These data suggested that AtCSPs are related to flowering and silique development. However, the precise functional relationship of AtCSPs to these aforementioned developmental stages is poorly understood. In the present study it was confirmed that <italic>AtCSPs</italic> gene expression patterns are strongly correlated to various stages of plant development by using qRT-PCR, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, and Western blot analysis. In good accordance to public microarray data, <italic>AtCSPs</italic> are highly expressed in shoot apices and in the early stages of floral tissue, especially in siliques, which contain developing embryos. Consistent with the study of AtGRP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fusaro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), these correlative data strongly suggest that <italic>AtCSPs</italic> may have an important functional role related to flowering and silique development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotypes Columbia and Landsberg erecta were used in this study.

On a DNA level, a few conserved DNA polymorphisms were found in the ORF region, however, none of these resulted in the alteration of translatable amino acids. Interestingly, the adjacent At2g21050 gene locus was 100% identical between Landsberg and Columbia ecotypes. The 1.3 kb promoter region of both <italic>AtCSP4</italic> genes was analysed using the PLACE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/">http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/</ext-link> web site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).

Unfortunately due to their identical predicted size, it was not possible to distinguish AtCSP2 from AtCSP4. It is likely that AtCSP1 (30 kDa) and AtCSP3 (29.5 kDa) bands were not detected due to their very low expression levels. Western blot analysis of purified recombinant AtCSP proteins confirmed that the antibody recognizes all four AtCSPs (data not shown). In relative comparison between shoot apices and rosette leaves, AtCSP2 and 4 accumulate in shoot apices and progressively increase during the developmental time-line, peaking at 3 weeks, just prior to bolting in the Columbia background.

AGL15 binds to its own promoter region and can therefore be used as a positive control in this assay. An <italic>AGL15</italic> fragment was amplified in input DNA and recovered by the ChIP reaction in the Columbia background, however, this fragment was not recovered in the mutant background (data not shown). Similarly, the <italic>AtCSP4</italic> fragment was not enriched in the mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8B</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that AGL15 can bind promoter regions of <italic>AtCSP2</italic> and <italic>AtCSP4</italic> and may affect the gene expression of <italic>AtCSP2</italic> and <italic>AtCSP4</italic> during silique development.</p><p>As a means to determine whether gene expression of <italic>AtCSP2</italic> and <italic>AtCSP4</italic> is affected by AGL15, qRT-PCR analysis was performed to quantify expression levels of <italic>AtCSP2</italic> and <italic>AtCSP4</italic> in AGL15 overexpression or <italic>agl15/18</italic> knock-out lines during various stages of silique development. The preparation of silique samples was performed as previously described and all stages were confirmed with microscopy (data not shown). <italic>AGL15</italic> expression levels were quantified first from silique samples harvested from overexpression or knock-out lines. <italic>AGL15</italic> expression was clearly elevated and suppressed in the overexpression and knock-out lines, respectively (data not shown).

In addition, <italic>AtCSP4</italic> expression patterns were altered in both AGL15 overexpressed and knock-out mutant backgrounds. Collectively, these data suggest that promoters for both <italic>AtCSP2</italic> and <italic>AtCSP4</italic> are bound by AGL15 and that AGL15 affects their transcription patterns during various stages of silique development.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization of <italic>AtCSP2</italic> and <italic>AtCSP4</italic> in developing floral and silique tissue</title><p>According to the analysis of <italic>AtCSP</italic> gene and protein expression, AtCSPs are correlated to floral and silique development. In addition, both a ChIP enrichment assay and expression analysis linked <italic>AtCSP2</italic> and <italic>AtCSP4</italic> to the AGL15 MADS domain transcription factor during silique development.

In order to better understand how AtCSPs may function in relation to plant development, gene expression, protein accumulation, and localization analyses were performed using a variety of developmental stages. In this study, a detailed analysis describing the relationship of AtCSPs to flowering and silique development is provided. As shown by expression analysis, <italic>AtCSP2</italic> is the most abundantly expressed gene followed by <italic>AtCSP4</italic>. On the other hand, <italic>AtCSP1</italic> and <italic>AtCSP3</italic> are expressed at a considerably lower level. According to these analyses, <italic>AtCSPs</italic> expression was enriched in the tissues which normally possess very high activity of cell division, like shoot apices, floral buds, and the early stages of embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). In addition, a floral induction study was performed and it was shown that <italic>AtCSPs</italic> are up-regulated during the transition to flowering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Collectively, these observations support the hypothesis that <italic>AtCSPs</italic> may function during various stages of plant development and from the transition of vegetative to the reproductive stage.</p><p>Animal cold shock domain proteins are known to regulate the gene expression of cell cycle-related genes and play important roles for embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jurchott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uchiumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Lu <italic>et al.</italic> reported transcriptomic and proteomic analyses using YB-1 mutant lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). According to this study, the mutation in the cold shock domain protein did not have a major effect on gene and protein expression under normal conditions, however, the expression of several genes was altered under stress conditions. Specifically, they were cell cycle related genes, <italic>p16Ink4a</italic> and <italic>p21Cip1</italic>, which are G1-specific cell cycle inhibitors, and YB-1 exerted negative regulation on the transcriptional level. Therefore, YB-1 has been implicated in cell proliferation under stress conditions. In animals, these data suggested that cold shock domain proteins are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and development. Our observation of enrichment of AtCSPs in cell tissues which commonly exhibit high cell division are agree with these examples. Unfortunately, no significant alterations of embryo development were observed relative to wild-type (data not shown) from analysis of a homozygous insertion line for AtCSP4 (GABI-KAT; GK-623B08.01). Since the AtCSP4 knock-out line grew normally, and its expression is drastically reduced in expression in Landsberg, it is assumed that its functional role can be complemented by AtCSP2. In the future, it will be of great interest to determine whether AtCSP mutants may have altered cell cycles and altered floral and/or silique development.</p><p>Animal YB-1 has been well studied and is important for both early and late stages of embryo development. YB-1 knock-out mice exhibited embryonic and perinatal lethality due to abnormal patterns of cell proliferation. MSY4, which is a homologue of YB-1, is also expressed during embryogenesis and is important for embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jurchott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uchiumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In this study, it is confirmed that <italic>AtCSPs</italic> are localized in embryos and especially high levels of expression were detected at the globular and late stages of embryo development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figs 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern351/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S5</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Interestingly, RNAi analysis of AtCSP2 was shown to affect embryo development and altered flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fusaro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The authors suggested that RNAi plants exhibited an early flowering phenotype due to an alteration in the translation of flowering-related proteins. In this study, <italic>AtCSPs</italic> were highly expressed during floral transition and were induced under conditions conducive for stimulating flowering. Taken together, these data suggest that AtCSPs may exhibit preferential target specificity related to floral transition. AtCSPs may bind and maintain the stability of target genes and function to regulate translation due to RNA chaperone activity.</p><p>AGL15, which is a well-studied MADS-domain transcription factor, regulates gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perry <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and is functionally redundant with AGL18 in relation to somatic embryogenesis and the control of flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thakare <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamczyk et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to confirm that AGL15 could bind promoter regions of both <italic>AtCSP2</italic> and <italic>AtCSP4</italic>. In addition, when a time-course of silique development was analysed in mutant backgrounds of AGL15, alterations of gene expression patterns for both <italic>AtCSP2</italic> and <italic>AtCSP4</italic> were observed. Taken together with our gene and protein expression studies, these data provide additional evidence supporting a putative role of AtCSPs in silique development and flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>Cold shock domain proteins are highly conserved from bacteria to higher plants and animals. In previous studies of a winter wheat cold shock domain protein (WCSP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakaminami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), WCSP1 exhibited nucleic acid binding activity and functioned as an RNA chaperone similar bacterial cold shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The functional significance of RNA chaperone activity is the ability of cold shock domain proteins to melt stabilized secondary structures of nucleic acids and subsequently to maintain them in a single-stranded state. Under stress conditions, this is important since RNA typically adopts secondary structures. In bacteria, cold shock domain proteins relax mRNA secondary structures and play a crucial role for subsequent translation of proteins under low temperature stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Previous nucleic acid binding assays of plant CSD proteins utilized lambda phage DNA as the source of nucleic acids. Thus, plant CSPs appear to bind nucleic acids with apparent non-specificity. However, it is important to note that specific targets of cold shock domain proteins do exist. For example, YB-1 binds to a sequence called the Y-box sequence in the promoter of major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, a cold shock domain protein (NAB1) binds <italic>LHCBM</italic> genes, which are light-harvesting antenna of photosystem II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mussgnug <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In this study it was not investigated whether AtCSPs have preferential nucleic acid targets. However, the expression patterns and localization of AtCSPs makes it tempting to speculate that AtCSPs may target a subset of genes that are related to plant development. In the future, it will be necessary to utilize knock-out or RNAi mutants to determine if mutations in AtCSPs have an effect on the post-transcriptional level for any genes related to plant development.</p><p>Although other plant CSPs have been correlated to abiotic stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karlson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"><italic>b</italic></xref>), high levels of <italic>AtCSPs</italic> expression were clearly detected in meristem tissues under non-stress conditions. Therefore, plant cold shock domain proteins probably possess multi-functions containing an RNA chaperone activity that may be important under both stress and non-stress conditions. In the future, more research would help to determine if AtCSPs exhibit preferential binding to specific gene targets, thereby affecting their translation through an RNA masking activity or perhaps affecting mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evdokimova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2006</xref>).</p><p>Our confirmation for the dramatic suppression of <italic>AtCSP4</italic> gene expression in the Landsberg background was consistent with the previous observation which designated the At2g21060 locus as one of a few highly polymorphic loci between Landsberg and Columbia ecotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmid <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In order to understand further the striking difference between expression of the <italic>AtCSP4</italic> gene between Landsberg and Columbia, the <italic>AtCSP4</italic> genomic locus from Landsberg was cloned and comparative sequence analysis between Landsberg and Columbia were performed. According to this analysis, two different <italic>cis</italic>-elements of interest (SEBFCONSSTPR10A and SITEIIATCYTC) existed in Landsberg and Columbia, respectively. The SEBFCONSSTPR10A element represents the binding site of the silencing element binding factor (SEBF). In the Landsberg ecotype, this element sequence is &#x02018;TTGTCAC&#x02019; whereas in Columbia is &#x02018;TTGTCAT&#x02019;. Interestingly, the last nucleotide of this element, &#x02018;C&#x02019; is a critical nucleotide for the binding of SEBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle and Brisson, 2001</xref>). Thus, this difference in nucleotide sequences may represent one of the potential mechanisms for altering <italic>AtCSP4</italic> gene expression between Landsberg and Columbia ecotypes. Another putative <italic>cis</italic>-element of interest is the SITEIIATCYTC binding site for TCP-domain transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Welchen and Gonzalez, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2006</xref>). This element is frequently present in more then one copy and it is important to note that two SITEIIATCYTC elements are found in all <italic>AtCSPs</italic> promoter regions in the Columbia background. However, in the case of the <italic>AtCSP4</italic> Landsberg locus, no SITEIIATCYTC elements were identified in our genomic sequence analysis. The TCP domain protein TCP2 or 3 has been reported to localize in shoot apices, vegetative leaf primordia, and floral organ primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cubas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) and <italic>Cytc-1</italic> genes regulated by a TCP domain transcription factor are also expressed in meristematic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Welchen and Gonzalez, 2005</xref>). In good accordance to these aforementioned examples, temporal and spatial expression patterns of <italic>AtCSPs</italic> are very similar to those of the TCP domain genes. Thus, it is possible that the difference in this putative <italic>cis</italic>-element may also affect the transcription of AtCSP4 <italic>in planta</italic>. Transgenic studies in the Landsberg ecotype with over-expression of <italic>AtCSP4</italic> or transfer of the entire Columbia <italic>AtCSP4</italic> gene locus, will enable us to decipher any functional effect of the reduced AtCSP4 expression in Landsberg wild-type. In addition, a future comparative ChIP analysis between Landsberg and Columbia ecotypes using antibodies specific for transcription factors of interest will allow us to understand potential mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in greater detail.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Readers are encouraged to view the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern351/DC1">supplementary data</ext-link> files that can be found at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern351/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>.</bold><italic>AtCSP</italic> expression analysis during vegetative growth and floral transition.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern351/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>.</bold><italic>AtCSP</italic> gene expression in vegetative growth and floral induction.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern351/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link>.</bold> Analysis of <italic>SOC1</italic> gene expression during floral induction.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern351/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link>.</bold> Analysis of <italic>AtCSP</italic> gene expression during stages of silique development.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern351/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S5</ext-link>.</bold><italic>AtCSP</italic> gene expression during stages of silique development.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern351/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>.</bold> List of context sequences and amplicon lengths for Applied Biosystems Taq-Man probes.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern351/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>.</bold> List of primers used for SYBR-green qRT-PCR and ChlP analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="ern351_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="ern351_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr Ryozo Imai and Mr Kentaro Sasaki (National Agricultural Research Center for Hokkaido Region) for kindly providing the anti-WCSP1 antibody.
