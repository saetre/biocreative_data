It plays a role in embryonic and early postnatal brain development and contributes to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report that activation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> nucleotide receptor (P2X<sub>7</sub>R) in rat primary cortical neurons (rPCNs) causes biochemical (i.e., caspase activation) and morphological (i.e., nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation) changes characteristic of apoptotic cell death. Caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in rPCNs induced by the P2X<sub>7</sub>R agonist BzATP were inhibited by the P2X<sub>7</sub>R antagonist oxidized ATP (oATP) or by pre-treatment of cells with P2X<sub>7</sub>R antisense oligonucleotide indicating a direct involvement of the P2X<sub>7</sub>R in nucleotide-induced neuronal cell death. Moreover, Z-DEVD-FMK, a specific and irreversible cell permeable inhibitor of caspase-3, prevented BzATP-induced apoptosis in rPCNs. In addition, a specific caspase-8 inhibitor, Ac-IETD-CHO, significantly attenuated BzATP-induced caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, suggesting that P2X<sub>7</sub>R-mediated apoptosis in rPCNs occurs primarily through an intrinsic caspase-8/9/3 activation pathway. BzATP also induced the activation of C-jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in rPCNs, and pharmacological inhibition of either JNK1 or ERK1/2 significantly reduced caspase activation by BzATP. Taken together, these data indicate that extracellular nucleotides mediate neuronal apoptosis through activation of P2X<sub>7</sub>Rs and their downstream signaling pathways involving JNK1, ERK and caspases 8/9/3.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>ATP</kwd><kwd>BzATP</kwd><kwd>caspase</kwd><kwd>P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer 2005</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>ATP is an important extracellular messenger generated from various sources including release from presynaptic vesicles upon nerve stimulation in the peripheral and central nervous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Extracellular ATP functions as a neuromodulator by activation of cell surface P2 nucleotide receptors that are widely expressed in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Based on their distinct structure, P2 nucleotide receptors are classified into two families: G protein-coupled P2Y receptors (P2YR<sub>1,2,4,6,11&#x02013;14</sub>; 4) and ligand-gated ion channels (P2XR<sub>1&#x02013;7</sub>; 5). Functional responses to activation of these P2 receptor subtypes in cells of the nervous system under normal and pathological conditions include cell apoptosis, proliferation and migration, inflammation, ion transport, and neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, P2 receptors in the nervous system may prove to be useful pharmaceutical targets in the treatment of neurological disorders.</p><p>The seven subtypes of the ionotropic ATP-gated P2XR family, ranging from 379 to 595 amino acids in length, regulate the intracellular calcium concentration through ligand-stimulated increases in the cell membrane permeability to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In contrast to other P2XRs, the P2X<sub>7</sub>R subtype functions exclusively as a homomeric receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The P2X<sub>7</sub>R is a 595-amino acid polypeptide containing two membrane-spanning domains, a large extracellular loop, and intracellular N- and C-terminal domains including a C-terminal tail that is the longest among the cloned P2XRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. P2X<sub>7</sub>Rs have been reported in microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] where they play a role in cytokine release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These receptors are also found in cultured astrocytes and Schwann cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], spinal cord neurons and in other regions of the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Brief stimulation of the P2X<sub>7</sub>R with ATP results in formation of a non-selective cationic channel that promotes the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the equilibration of the transmembrane sodium and potassium gradients leading to membrane depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Subsequent responses to P2X<sub>7</sub>R activation include the formation of a nonselective pore for molecules up to 900 Da [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], extensive membrane blebbing, and eventual cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Activation of the P2X<sub>7</sub>R was reported to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in cerebrocortical nerve terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and hippocampal glutamate release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which has been confirmed by studies with P2X<sub>7</sub>R knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In an <italic>ex vivo</italic> model of organotypic hippocampal cultures, P2X<sub>7</sub>R activation was shown to directly participate in cell damage induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It has been shown that a Pro-451 to Leu polymorphism within the C-terminal tail of the P2X<sub>7</sub>R interferes with the ability of the receptor to induce cell death in murine thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The P2X<sub>7</sub>R also has been shown to mediate ATP-induced cell death in human embryonic kidney cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and human cervical epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that spinal cord injury was associated with prolonged P2X<sub>7</sub>R activation of spinal cord neurons by extracellular ATP, which resulted in high-frequency spiking, increases in cytosolic calcium levels and neuronal degeneration, responses that were reversed by P2X<sub>7</sub>R inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrate that the P2X<sub>7</sub>R agonists BzATP or ATP induce nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation in rat primary cortical neurons (rPCNs). These apoptotic responses in rPCNs were dependent on the functional expression of P2X<sub>7</sub>Rs that mediate the ERK1/2- and JNK1-dependent activation of caspases-8/9/3.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Hyclone (Logan, UT, USA).

In the mitochondrial-initiated pathway of apoptosis, caspase activation is triggered by the formation of a multimeric Apaf-1/cytochrome c complex that is fully functional in recruiting and activating procaspase-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Activated caspase-9 will then cleave and activate downstream caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7. In rPCNs, it was not surprising that activation of caspase-3 was significantly inhibited by the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK (data not shown), since caspase-9 is known to activate caspase-3. We also found that in rat PCNs, the caspase-8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO partially inhibited caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation (Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>) indicating that caspase-8 cleavage may be an early event in this neuronal apoptosis pathway.

Truncated Bid translocates from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria, where it appears to antagonize the actions of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, thereby causing an efflux of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and downstream caspase-9/3 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

Recent studies indicate that activation of ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways caused inhibition of caspase-3 and cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. It also has been reported that inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling is required for the induction of apoptosis by Sulindac metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Nonetheless, our data support the hypothesis that ERK1/2 and JNK1 activation can promote P2X<sub>7</sub>R-mediated apoptosis in rPCNs, although the mechanism involved requires further investigation.</p><p>P2X<sub>7</sub>Rs can promote neuronal cell death by mediating the release of glutamate and inflammatory factors from cells including astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Moreover, glutamate can induce ATP release from astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], suggesting that ATP and glutamate have reciprocal roles that contribute to the propagation of an apoptotic signal. It also has been reported that the P2X<sub>7</sub>R modulates macrophage production of TNF-ga, IL-1&#x003b2; and nitric oxide (NO) following LPS exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], consistent with a role for the P2X<sub>7</sub>R in inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In addition to these factors, structural features within the P2X<sub>7</sub>R indicate that the mechanism whereby it regulates apoptosis is likely to be complex. There are several functional domains located in the P2X<sub>7</sub>R C-terminal tail including an LPS-binding domain, a SH3-binding domain, and an overlapping Fcelldeath_ domain, which appear to be important for receptor trafficking and various physiological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and the role of these domains in P2X<sub>7</sub>R-mediated apoptosis of neurons warrants further investigation. Our studies with the membrane impermeant fluorescent dye YO-PRO-1 (molecular weight: 375 Da) indicate that BzATP causes pore formation (YO-PRO-1 uptake) in rPCNs (data not shown), consistent with the report that apoptosis in the retinal microvasculature is associated with P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor-mediated pore formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p>A recent study indicated that spinal cord neurons expressed an abundance of P2X<sub>7</sub>Rs, and exposure of freshly prepared spinal cord slices to ATP or BzATP evoked highfrequency firing and irreversible increases in the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Significant cell death occurred 24 h after spinal cord injury in areas of high ATP release surrounding the epicenter of the injury, while local injection of oATP in the peritraumatic zone strongly reduced both apoptotic cell number and the severity of histological injury, suggesting the involvement of a P2X<sub>7</sub>R. Other studies indicate that the P2X<sub>7</sub>R is up-regulated in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Thus, the P2X<sub>7</sub>R may represent a promising therapeutic target to inhibit neurodegeneration due to injury or disease.</p><p>In summary, the data presented indicate that BzATP and ATP can stimulate P2X<sub>7</sub>Rs in embryonic rat primary cortical neurons leading to the activation of the caspases-8/9/3 and the induction of DNA degradation and nuclear condensation and fragmentation, apoptotic responses that appear to be regulated by ERK1/2 and JNK1. Since neuronal apoptosis occurs in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, a better understanding of the mechanisms of P2X<sub>7</sub>R-mediated apoptosis may lead to novel therapies to prevent apoptosis-related brain injuries.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We sincerely thank Xiaolin Zhang, Jennifer Aufder Heide, and the University of Missouri-Columbia Molecular Cytology Core Facility for excellent technical assistance.
