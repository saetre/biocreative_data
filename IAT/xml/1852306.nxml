Only about 17% of the homozygous connexin43 knock-in connexin26 mice instead of 25% expected according to Mendelian inheritance, were born and only 6% survived to day 21 post partum and longer. Neonatal and adult connexin43 knock-in connexin26 mice exhibited slowed ventricular conduction in their hearts, i.e. similar but delayed electrophysiological abnormalities as connexin43 deficient mice. Furthermore, connexin43 knock-in connexin26 male and female mice were infertile and exhibited hypotrophic gonads. In testes, tubuli seminiferi were developed and spermatogonia as well as some primary spermatocytes were present, but further differentiated stages of spermatogenesis were absent. Ovaries of female connexin43 knock-in connexin26 mice revealed only few follicles and the maturation of follicles was completely impaired.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The impaired gametogenesis of homozygous males and females can explain their infertility.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Connexins form intercellular conduits permitting diffusional exchange of ions, secondary messenger molecules and metabolites up to 1000 Dalton. These exchange properties regulate and coordinate several cell biological functions such as cell growth, differentiation and developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Six connexin protein subunits form a hemichannel, also called connexon. Two docking connexons, contributed by two adjacent cells, form a gap junctional channel. To date, 20 different connexin genes have been identified in the mouse genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Connexins can assemble into homomeric or heteromeric hemichannels, which in turn can dock to hemichannels of the same or different connexin composition in the plasma membrane of contacting cells to form homotypic or heterotypic channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Gap junction channels composed of different connexin isoforms differ from each other in unitary conductance and permeability to second messenger molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This raised the question to which extent the different connexin isoforms limit or support functional specialization of different cell types.</p><p>Of the known connexin (Cx) genes, Cx43 is most abundantly expressed in many cell types. In mouse heart, Cx43 protein is found in the working myocardium and in Purkinje fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Cx43 deficient mice die shortly after birth due to obstruction of right ventricular outflow tract of the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In reproductive organs Cx43 has been shown to control proliferation of granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the testis, Cx43 containing gap junction channels connect the Leydig as well as the Sertoli cells and loss of Cx43 seems to impair spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It was described that postnatal lethality of Cx43 deficient mice could be rescued by Cx32 or Cx40, indicating that Cx43, Cx40 and Cx32 share some common functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, Cx43 knock-in Cx32 (Cx43KI32) and Cx43 knock-in Cx40 (Cx43KI40) mice showed functional and morphological differences, compared to wild-type mice.</p><p>Cx26 is one of the two major gap junction proteins expressed in hepatocytes. It was also found in placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], in the epidermis, and in several other organs, including support cells of the inner ear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and in the uterine epithelium during pregnancy in response to embryo recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In mammary tissue, Cx26 and Cx32 are present in the secretory epithelium and Cx43 is localized in the myoepithelium of the mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] as well as in several cell lines suggesting that these connexins might be important for development during pregnancy and function during lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Cx26 and Cx32 have been co-localized in gap junctions of mouse mammary epithelium during lactation and both homomeric and heteromeric connexins have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The unique expression patterns of Cx26 and Cx32 suggest distinct and overlapping roles in mammary development and function. Cx26 mRNA and protein were first detected in mouse mammary tissue on day 4 of pregnancy which was followed by a steady increase and maximal expression during lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast, a significant induction of Cx32 expression occurred within a few hours after parturition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The analysis of connexin knock-in mice is a useful strategy to identify unique features of different connexins and to distinguish them from properties shared by several connexin channels. Especially the Cx43 locus was used several times for the generation of knock-in mice. The phenotypes of Cx43KI32, Cx43KI40 and Cx43KI31 mice have been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The regulatory consequences of Cx43 phosphorylation were investigated in several laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Here we have replaced the coding region of Cx43 by that of Cx26. The non-phosphorylated Cx26 protein is of special interest, since it is possible to gain insights into the function of connexin channels independent of the regulation by phosphorylation.</p><p>Furthermore, we wanted to clarify whether the replacement of Cx43 by Cx26 causes a similar phenotype as observed with homozygous Cx43KI32 mice, i.e. severe impairment of spermatogenesis. In addition, heterozygous Cx43KI32 females exhibited problems with lactation. It had been hypothesized that this phenotype could be due to defects in cooperation between myoepithelial and glandular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation and transgenic expression analysis of Cx43KI26neo mice</title><p>In order to generate Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice, we replaced the Cx43 coding DNA by Cx26 coding DNA followed by a neomycin resistance cassette in HM-1 embryonic stem (ES) cells. The coding region of Cx26 was cloned behind the translational start codon of Cx43. For this purpose an additional NcoI restriction site was created by insertion of an additional cytosine residue using modified primers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Three correctly recombined ES cell clones gave rise to chimeras that transmitted the mutant allele through the germ line when injected into blastocysts. Heterozygous, male Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>mice were crossed with female Flp recombinase expressing mice. The Flp-mediated recombination led to excision of the PGK-neomycin cassette. The heterozygous mice gave birth to homozygous mutant offspring (i.e. Cx43<sup>26/26</sup>) when intercrossed, as demonstrated by Southern blot and PCR analyses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;C</xref>). A multiplex PCR was established for genotyping using a common reverse primer directed to the 3' UTR of Cx43. A forward primer directed to the coding region of Cx43 and another one to the coding region of Cx26 were employed. A 381 amplicon was derived from the wild-type allele and a 529 bp amplicon was derived from the Cx43 knock-in Cx26 allele (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In the Southern blot hybridization, the Cx43 external probe recognized a 8 kb wild-type fragment and a 3.5 kb knock-in fragment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Generation and characterization of Cx43KI26 mice. (A) pCx43KI26 vector DNA was transfected into HM-1 embryonic stem cells. Homologous recombination was tested by PCR and Southern blot analyses. Homozygously recombined clones were injected into blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice, in order to generate first chimeras and in the next generation of mice carrying the Cx43KI26neo allele. By means of Flp activity, the frt-flanked selection cassette was deleted, resulting in the Cx43KI26 allele. In mice carrying this allele, Cx26 is expressed under control of Cx43 regulatory elements. (B) Multiplex PCR of different genotypes using primer 1 (Cx43-RO4), primer 2 (Ki26Cx26) and primer 3 (Cx43-HO2).

The mRNA from brain, heart, liver and testis was transcribed in cDNA, and the PCRs were carried out with different primers for Cx43, Cx26 and &#x003b2;-actin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). As expected, the primers yielded an amplicon of 293 bp for Cx43, an amplicon of 364 bp for Cx26 and an amplicon of 243 bp for &#x003b2;-actin (control). The Cx43 amplicon was found in brain, heart and testis of wild-type and heterozygous mice (Cx43<sup>43/26</sup>), but only weakly in liver where Ito cells and cholangiocytes but not hepatocytes express Cx43. Cx26 was expressed in brain, liver as well as testis of all mice due to endogenous expression and in particular in hearts of heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>as well as homozygous Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice. As expected, wild-type mice Cx43<sup>43/43 </sup>did not express Cx26 mRNA in their hearts.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>A.

Preferential loss of homozygous Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>animals coincided with general high mortality in the offspring of heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>parents (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This high mortality correlated with the maternal heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>phenotype. The surviving heterozygous adult mice (&#x0003e;10 weeks) were indistinguishable in their appearance from wild type litter mates, whereas homozygous males and females weighed about 30% less.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Postnatal survival frequency of pups in litters after crossing of heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>mice.

Maternal behaviour of heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>mothers did not differ from controls. When newborn litters of Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>mothers were raised by wild type Cx43<sup>43/43 </sup>foster mothers, survival of the pups was highly improved. This procedure had to be carried out, in order to expand the Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>mouse colony but it was not quantitated due to occasional loss of pups not accepted by the foster mothers.</p><p>These observations suggested an insufficient nutrition due to an impaired mammary gland function during lactation. In comparison to wild-type mice, histological analysis of heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>mothers (9 dpc, 8 pups) revealed that the glandular alveoli were less dilated and the ductuli were obviously less branched resulting in lower amount of secretory alveoli. Instead, extended areas of adipose tissue were observed between the glandular units (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Higher magnification confirmed secretory transformation of alveolar epithelium with dilated alveoli and the typical apocrine protrusions as well as milk droplets in the alveoli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B&#x02013;D</xref>). Both the presence of milk droplets found in alveoli and the histological features suggested that reduced development of the glands rather than milk production was impaired in heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>mothers.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Histological section of the lactating mammary gland of wild-type (A, B) and heterozygous Cx26 knock-in (C, D). The. In contrast to the wild-type mammary glands, heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>glands show a dramatically reduced branching of the ductuli. As a consequence, less alveoli surrounded by adipocytic tissue were seen (compare A with C). The alveoli were mostly smaller in diameter but did show apocrine secretion and milk droplets in the lumen (arrow) (D).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-7-26-4"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Infertility of homozygous Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice</title><p>Histological analysis of lung, thymus, pancreas, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney and brain did not reveal any pathological differences between heterozygotes and homozygotes when compared to wild-type controls (data not shown). However, the testes of homozygous Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice weighed only about one fourth of those from wild-type males (100%) and Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>male as well as female mice were infertile as demonstrated by mating them with wild-type animals. Histological investigations revealed that, compared to the wild-type controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), the differentiated stages of spermatogenesis were absent in knock-in mice, although tubuli seminiferi were developed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Spermatogonia were still present, and sporadically primary spermatocytes were observed but neither spermatozoa nor other stages of spermatogenesis were found (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). As a consequence, no sperms were detected in the lumen of the ductuli epididymidis (Compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, with Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). Since it was shown that the Leydig cells are connected by Cx43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and impaired spermatogenesis could be due to a decreased number of testosterone producing cells and the presence of the androgen receptor. Immunolabeling of the androgen receptor revealed that specifically stained Leydig cells were present in a similar amount as in the controls (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B,E</xref>). Most of the seminiferous tubules were only lined by Sertoli cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D,E</xref>) but like in the wild-type controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), Sertoli cells of the Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>testes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>) expressed the androgen receptor.

In Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice, the seminiferous tubules demonstrated absence of mature sperms but a germinal epithelium. The loss of spermiogenesis was indicated by an empty epididymis with less densely packed tubules. Like in controls (B) immunolabeling of the testosterone receptor revealed the presence of Sertoli (arrows) and Leydig cells in testes of Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice (E).

The full range of follicle stages was missing and corpora lutea were absent.

No further significant differences were found regarding surface-ECG and invasive intracardiac electrophysiological parameters. In 4 Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice we found peripheral low voltage ECGs, and 2 of them died due to hemodynamical detrimental ventricular fibrillation induced by ventricular stimulation protocols.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that Cx26 can at least in part functionally replace Cx43 in the mouse genome because heterozygous Cx43KI26 mice were viable and gave birth to viable, homozygous mutant offspring when crossed with each other.</p><p>However, only 17% of homozygous Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mutants instead of 25%, according to Mendelian inheritance, were born and only 6% survived to day 21 post partum or longer. After interbreeding of heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>mice, about 50% of the progeny died during the first three weeks. This phenomenon was not observed when wild-type mothers were crossed with Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>males under the same conditions, suggesting a milk delivery problem of the mothers. Histological analysis of heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>mothers confirmed the secretory transformation of alveolar epithelium indicative of normal milk production, but revealed a less arborated ductal system on which secretory terminal end buds could develop. This could be the cause for reduced milk production in heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>mothers. The endocrine control of lactation is one of the most complex physiological mechanisms. Estrogen, progesterone, placental lactogen, prolactin, and oxytocin act directly on the mammary gland to regulate developmental changes or coordinate milk delivery to the offspring. Prolactin is the key hormone of lactation and seems to be the single most important galactopoietic hormone, whereas oxytocin is the most powerful galactokinetic hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Moreover, the pituitary growth hormone (GH) binds to growth hormone receptors in the stromal compartment of the mammary gland and stimulates Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) mRNA expression. GH-induced IGF-I is of major importance in ductal morphogenesis, and seems to be necessary for later stages of mammary development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The sparse branching of the milk ductuli could be due to missing prolactin or growth hormone from the anterior pituitary gland which was shown to express Cx43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Anterior pituitary Cx43 levels were at maximal level during periods of high prolactin secretion. However, reduced estrogen or progesterone levels in heterozygous females cannot be excluded as a reason for impaired ductal morphogenesis. An impaired cooperation between myoepihelial and glandular cells, as it has been proposed for the heterozygous Cx43<sup>43/32 </sup>mice which revealed only milk ejection problems but no dysmorphogenesis of the mammary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], could not be confirmed with Cx43<sup>43/26 </sup>mice. Thus, the replacement of one allele by Cx26 in the Cx43 locus seems to play a different role for mammary development during lactation as it has been shown for Cx43<sup>43/32 </sup>mice. Further analyses will be needed to pinpoint the defect in lactating mammary glands of Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice.</p><p>Decreased levels of growth hormone could also explain our observation that homozygous animals showed a reduced body size without pathological phenotype, even if nourished by foster mothers. The gonads of both male and female homozygous Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice, however, were hypotrophic compared to other organs. Neither in testes nor in ovaries, complete gametogenesis was found. Due to the smaller gonads and impaired gametogenesis we investigated whether these animals suffer from a defective release of the follicle stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland which regulates both follicle maturation and spermatogenesis. However, our measurements of FSH did not confirm this hypothesis. The presence of the androgen receptor in both Leydig and Sertoli cells is not consistent with impaired spermatogenesis leading to a kind of "Sertoli-cell-only" syndrome. Our results indicate that Cx26, similar to Cx32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], cannot functionally replace Cx43 which is abundantly expressed between Sertoli cells. Since spermatogonia are present and even start to enter spermatogenesis, this indicates a direct nourishing role for Cx43 in Sertoli cells in this differentiation process. The finding that functional expression of Cx43 gap junction channels is necessary for spermatogenesis confirms the investigations of Roscoe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These authors recognized a "Sertoli-cell-only" syndrome in testes which lacked Cx43 and were cultivated under the kidney capsule, although the production of testosterone was similar to wild-type testes.</p><p>Replacing Cx43 with Cx26 in ovarian follicles led to an arrested growth of less follicles up to the secondary stage and a cystic transformation. Like in the Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice, the ovaries of Cx43 deficient mice, when grafted under the kidney capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] did not develop beyond the primary stage and revealed less follicles. Thus, Cx26 channels between granulosa cells were not able to maintain folliculogenesis, and its expression led to a similar defect as shown in Cx43 null mouse mutants. Again, this is different from the observation in Cx43<sup>32/32 </sup>mice which showed normal ovarian histology and could become pregnant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, in contrast to Cx26 which cannot replace the function of Cx43 in folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis, the Cx32 protein is able to take over the function of Cx43 in granulosa cells for oocyte maturation.</p><p>Although replacement of Cx43 by Cx26 leads to gonadal dysfunction in male and female, Cx26 can apparently partially replace Cx43 in working myocardium, at least in short-term function during several postnatal weeks, similar as previously described for Cx43KI32 and Cx43KI40 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice seemed to develop similar electrophysiological abnormalities, although slower than Cx43<sup>-/- </sup>mice. We noticed a prolonged QRS complex as a marker for possible bundle branch blocks or longer depolarization phase and a tendency towards ventricular arrhythmia as described in Cx43 deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, the QTc interval was shorter in the present mouse model. Thus, the repolarization phase did not seem to be affected in a similar way. Repolarization characteristics should therefore be further investigated using optical or electrical mapping systems. Despite this, in vivo electrophysiological investigation showed that Cx26 cannot completely compensate for Cx43 missing in conductive and working myocardium. The strongly decreased survival of Cx43<sup>26/26 </sup>mice suggests that the long-term function of the myocardium is impaired.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Finally, we found differences in the ability of Cx32 and Cx26 to functionally replace Cx43 in the lactating mammary gland. Both heterozygous knock-in mice demonstrated impairment of mammary function but in a different way. Replacement of Cx43 by Cx32 disturbed milk ejection, whereas replacement of Cx43 by Cx26 led to a dysmorphogenesis of gland arboration. These results extend previous observations with Cx43 knock-in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] that the different connexin isoforms fulfill individual roles in certain cell types but can at least partially replace each other in other cell types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Generation of mice</title><p>A fragment of genomic 129/Sv mouse DNA spanning about 12 kb of the Cx43 locus was isolated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] from a recombinant lambda phage library (Stratagene La Jolla, USA).
