In molecular terms, stimulation by Wnt ligands leads to the stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin, its translocation to the nucleus, and stimulation of TCF (T-cell factor)-dependent transcription of target genes. This process is controlled at various stages by a number of regulatory proteins, including transcriptional activators and repressors. Here we demonstrate that the endosomal proteins APPL1 and APPL2 are novel activators of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription. APPL proteins are multifunctional adaptors and effectors of the small GTPase Rab5, which localize to a subpopulation of early endosomes but are also capable of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Overexpression of APPL1 or APPL2 protein stimulates the activity of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent reporter construct, whereas silencing of APPL1 reduces it. Both APPL proteins interact directly with Reptin, a transcriptional repressor binding to &#x003b2;-catenin and HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1), and this interaction was mapped to the pleckstrin homology domain of APPL1. Moreover, APPL proteins are present in an endogenous complex containing Reptin, &#x003b2;-catenin, HDAC1, and HDAC2. Overexpression of either APPL protein relieves Reptin-dependent transcriptional repression and correlates with the reduced amounts of HDACs and &#x003b2;-catenin associated with Reptin as well as with the lower levels of Reptin and HDAC1 on the promoters of &#x003b2;-catenin target genes. We propose that APPL proteins exert their stimulatory effects on &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription by decreasing the activity of a Reptin-containing repressive complex.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling is implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The principle regulatory mechanism that controls nuclear accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin is its escape from the proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In unstimulated cells, &#x003b2;-catenin is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and targeted for degradation in a process mediated by a destruction complex containing GSK3&#x003b2; (glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x003b2;), casein kinase 1&#x003f5;, Axin, and the tumor suppressor APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Upon binding of Wnt ligands to their cognate receptors Frizzled and LRP5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), the destruction complex is inactivated, which leads to the accumulation of cytosolic &#x003b2;-catenin and its relocation to the nucleus. The nuclear bipartite complex between &#x003b2;-catenin and TCF/Lef (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor) proteins, in which TCF/Lef proteins provide a DNA-binding domain and &#x003b2;-catenin presents a transactivation domain, plays a key role as a transcription factor for the target genes of the wingless/Wnt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The function of &#x003b2;-catenin in transcriptional regulation is modulated by various protein complexes and reflects the fact that &#x003b2;-catenin itself interacts with several proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Among them, Pontin (also known as RuvBL1, Rvb1, TIP49a, and TIP49) and Reptin (also known as RuvBL2, TIP49b, and TIP48) constitute a pair of antagonistic regulators, with Pontin acting as activator and Reptin as repressor of &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Pontin and Reptin are highly conserved proteins related to the helicase subset of the AAA+ family of ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) with a broad range of functions in DNA replication, DNA repair, transcription, and chromatin remodeling, thus controlling cell growth, proliferation, and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Pontin and Reptin are constituents of several chromatin-remodeling or transcriptional complexes and can form hexamers or double hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), although they also function independently and even antagonistically with respect to each other. For example, when bound to the promoter of the metastasis suppressor gene KAI1, Reptin in complex with &#x003b2;-catenin acts as a repressor due to the concomitant recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) via its direct interactions with Reptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In contrast, Pontin associated with the Tip60 complex on the KAI1 promoter acts as a transcriptional activator. Moreover, Reptin was shown to act in a complex with the corepressor TLE1 (Groucho), HDAC1, HDAC2, and &#x003b2;-catenin to silence the expression of &#x003b2;-catenin target genes Hesx1 and Pit1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), thus further underscoring the role of Reptin in mediating &#x003b2;-catenin-dependent transcriptional repression via interactions with HDACs.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>Recently, an increasing number of proteins with their primary roles in endocytosis have been reported to undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and participate in transcriptional regulation or chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Among them are the two homologous adaptor proteins, APPL1 and APPL2 (adaptor proteins containing pleckstrin homology domain, phosphotyrosine binding domain, and leucine zipper motif), which are effectors of the small GTPase Rab5, a key regulator of early steps of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). We have previously shown that APPL proteins localize predominantly in the cytoplasm on the surface of a distinct subpopulation of early endosomes and to a lower degree in the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). They interact with a number of transmembrane receptors (TrkA, DCC, and receptors for follicle-stimulating hormone and adiponectin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), signaling molecules (Akt, GIPC, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and OCRL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), and nuclear proteins (NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Consequently, APPL proteins not only participate in endosomal transport but appear also to be located at the crossroads of various signaling pathways regulating cell metabolism, proliferation, survival, or apoptosis.</p><p>Here we report that APPL1 and APPL2 proteins are novel positive regulators of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription.

APPL proteins are known to colocalize with each other on a distinct subpopulation of early endosomes, bearing the small GTPase Rab5 but largely devoid of other markers of canonical early endosomes, such as EEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In addition to the membrane-bound endosomal pool, a fraction of APPL proteins is also found soluble in the cytosol or in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Similarly, both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization have been reported for Reptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Since available commercial antibodies do not detect endogenous Reptin in immunofluorescence applications, we therefore analyzed the distribution of Myc-tagged overexpressed Reptin with respect to the localization of APPL1 in HeLa cells (similarly to HEK293 cells, APPL2 is expressed at low levels in HeLa cells used in this study). Immunostaining of cells revealed that overexpressed Myc-Reptin is mainly detected both in the cell nuclei and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). However, we could not detect any enrichment of Reptin on endosomes marked by APPL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic>). In order to visualize better the endosomal compartments, cells were cotransfected with Myc-Reptin and the Rab5-Q79L constitutively active mutant, which causes increased fusion and thus enlarged endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). No recruitment of Myc-Reptin was observed on endosomes that were mildly enlarged by expressing low levels of GFP-Rab5-Q79L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>D&#x02013;F</italic>). In cells overexpressing high amounts of Rab5-Q79L and thus exhibiting giant endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>G&#x02013;I</italic>), Myc-Reptin was occasionally detected on the confined domains of endosomal membranes, which were also highly enriched in APPL1. These data suggest that a small pool of Reptin might be localized to endosomes, although normally the colocalization with APPL1 in this compartment is undetectable.

Based on the evidence that Reptin binds to &#x003b2;-catenin in protein complexes that regulate the transcription of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF target genes, luciferase reporter assays were performed to test whether APPL1 and APPL2 proteins affect &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding APPL1 or APPL2 in different amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). The luciferase activities derived from the cotransfected TCF-responsive reporter (SuperTOPflash, which contains optimal TCF-binding sites upstream of a minimal promoter element) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) or the control reporter construct (SuperFOPflash having mutated TCF-binding sites) were assayed 48 h after transfection. As shown previously, ectopic expression of &#x003b2;-catenin activated TCF-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). Importantly, overexpression of either APPL1 or APPL2 increased the levels of &#x003b2;-catenin-stimulated reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). No modulation of the SuperFOPflash reporter activity by either APPL protein was detected. A similar dose-dependent increase in the reporter activity was observed upon APPL overexpression when Wnt3a-conditioned medium was used for stimulation of cells instead of &#x003b2;-catenin co-transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>). In both cases, however, the stimulatory effect of APPL2 was consistently lower than that of APPL1. Moreover, silencing of APPL1 in HEK293 cells by two independent esiRNAs targeting different regions of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>E</italic>) resulted in the inhibition of the reporter activity, both in &#x003b2;-catenin- and Wnt3a-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic>).

Reptin overexpression inhibited the activity of the &#x003b2;-catenin-stimulated reporter, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and this repression was relieved in a dose-dependent manner by adding increasing amounts of APPL1 or APPL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). In order to further examine the interplay between Reptin and APPL proteins in the regulation of transcription, we decided to reduce the levels of Reptin by esiRNA transfection and to measure the effects of APPL1 or APPL2 overexpression under such conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>, esiRNA against Reptin (esi-Reptin) transfected in HEK293 cells reduced the levels of the protein as compared with the control (esi-EGFP). As expected, the knockdown of Reptin stimulated reporter activity above basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>). Introduction of nonspecific esiRNA against EGFP together with increasing amounts of APPL1 protein resulted in dose-dependent stimulation of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription identical to that of the APPL1 proteins alone (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6</xref><italic>A</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref><italic>C</italic>). This control demonstrated that the transfection with esiRNA <italic>per se</italic> did not affect the activity of the &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF reporter. The addition of lower amounts of APPL1 plasmid (either 0.25 or 0.5 &#x003bc;g) on top of esi-Reptin (0.25 &#x003bc;g) did not stimulate transcription above levels observed for esi-Reptin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>). Surprisingly, upon higher overexpression of APPL1 (1 &#x003bc;g of plasmid), &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF reporter activity was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>). These data point out that a balance between the amounts of Reptin and APPL proteins appears to be important for regulating &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription. We further verified this conclusion in the experiments in which we simultaneously overexpressed high doses of APPL1 (1 &#x003bc;g) together with decreasing amounts of esi-Reptin (0.25&#x02013;0.1 &#x003bc;g). Cotransfection of 1 &#x003bc;g of APPL1 together with 0.25 &#x003bc;g of esi-Reptin caused the maximal 3-fold increase in the activity of the &#x003b2;-catenin-stimulated reporter, which was decreased dose-dependently upon lowering the amounts of esi-Reptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>). Taken together, these data establish thatAPPL proteins modulate &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription along with Reptin. As positive regulators of the pathway, APPL proteins can relieve Reptin-mediated repression of transcription, and the relative abundance of both Reptin and APPL proteins determines the final level of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of either APPL protein reduces Reptin-mediated repression of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity.</bold> Luciferase reporter assays were performed in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the different combinations of plasmids, as indicated.

We hypothesized that in view of their direct physical interactions with Reptin, APPL proteins could modulate the composition and thus repressive activity of the Reptin-containing complex. Considering that APPL1 is also present in a Reptin-independent complex containing HDACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>), overexpression of APPL proteins (which relieved Reptin-mediated transcriptional repression) could potentially interfere with the binding of HDACs to the Reptin-repressive complex. To investigate such a possibility, we assessed the composition of Reptin-containing complexes upon APPL1 or APPL2 overexpression. We performed immunoprecipitation of endogenous Reptin from lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with APPL1-Myc- or APPL2-Myc-expressing plasmids in comparison with cells transfected with empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>). Interestingly, overexpression of either APPL protein clearly reduced the levels of HDAC1 and HDAC2 associated with Reptin. We further verified this effect in a converse experiment in which we analyzed immunoprecipitates of endogenous HDAC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>). Although endogenous Reptin is found in complex with HDAC2 in mock-transfected cells, its levels are reduced in the complex isolated from cells overexpressing YFP-APPL1. These results indicate that one potential mechanism underlying the observed transcriptional stimulation by APPL proteins, both without and upon Reptin overexpression, could involve the reduction of HDAC1/2 binding with Reptin. Intriguingly, &#x003b2;-catenin was also decreased in the Reptin immunoprecipitates of lysates containing overexpressed APPL1 or APPL2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>), although the total levels of &#x003b2;-catenin in cells were not changed. This indicates that an increase of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription via APPL proteins probably depends also on the relative abundance of &#x003b2;-catenin as well as HDAC1/2 in the Reptin complex.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of APPL proteins reduces the amounts of HDACs bound to Reptin.</bold><italic>A</italic>, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with APPL1-Myc and APPL2-Myc.

Compared with basal levels in mock-transfected cells, overexpressed APPL proteins reduced the levels of Reptin-associated HDAC activity.

Both APPL proteins exhibit direct interactions with the transcriptional repressor Reptin and can counter its inhibitory effects on transcription. Furthermore, APPL proteins are components of a complex containing Reptin, HDAC1, HDAC2, and &#x003b2;-catenin. Upon overproduction, APPL proteins affect the composition of this complex, reducing the amounts of HDACs and &#x003b2;-catenin associated with Reptin. Moreover, they increase the recruitment of &#x003b2;-catenin and reduce the amounts of Reptin and HDAC1 at the promoter of Wnt target genes. We propose that APPL proteins exert their stimulatory effects on &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription by decreasing the activity of Reptin-containing repressive complexes.</p><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>APPL Proteins as Activators of &#x003b2;-Catenin/TCF-dependent Transcription</title><p>APPL proteins are multifunctional adaptors primarily localized to a subpopulation of early endosomes. However, a pool of APPL proteins is also capable of undergoing nuclear translocation. In this respect, they resemble several components of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway, which, although initially characterized for their cytoplasmic functions, do undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. This is the case for Dishevelled, Dapper1, APC, Axin, GSK3&#x003b2;, Bcl-9/Legless, and &#x003b2;TrCP in addition to &#x003b2;-catenin itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). It has long been known that the levels of nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin are pivotal for its effects on transcription. However, more recent data argue that the ratios between the amounts of &#x003b2;-catenin-interacting proteins and regulators in the nucleus may be of equal importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate that APPL proteins interact directly with Reptin, a transcriptional repressor in the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway. Reptin is known to bind &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and the latter interaction is crucial for providing the repressive activity of the Reptin-containing complex, as shown for the KAI1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). We present evidence that APPL proteins are present in a complex containing Reptin, &#x003b2;-catenin, HDAC1, and HDAC2. Moreover, they are capable of modulating the composition and thus probably the activity of this complex. Based on our data, we envisage that increased levels of either APPL protein sequester Reptin and HDACs away from &#x003b2;-catenin-containing transcriptional complexes. Further studies are required to delineate the exact order of events and the possible interactions of APPL proteins within this complex. They may be of intricate nature, particularly because APPL proteins also bind the NuRD corepressor complex containing class I HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and our data indicate that APPL1 may weakly interact <italic>in vitro</italic> with HDAC1 and HDAC2.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>4</sup></xref> Taking into account a large number of interactions exhibited by Reptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), it is likely that the Reptin-associated repressive complex could involve additional components, which may contribute to its activity via interactions with other key regulatory proteins. Importantly, in a recent genome-wide RNA interference screen for the regulators of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway, APPL2 scored as a positive regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). This result, based on SuperTOPflash reporter activity in response to Wnt3a stimulation, represents an independent confirmation of our data that identify APPL proteins as activators of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription.</p><p>In general, the mechanisms of regulating the activity of transcriptional repressors by modulating the amounts of associated HDACs, as we propose for APPL proteins, appear to be common in the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway. Dapper1, originally identified as a protein binding to Dishevelled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), can associate with HDAC1 and enhance the interaction of Lef1 with HDAC1 (at the expense of Lef1 binding to &#x003b2;-catenin), thus maintaining Lef1 in the repressive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). A transcriptional corepressor TIS7 inhibits the expression of &#x003b2;-catenin target genes, such as c-<italic>myc</italic> or osteopontin, by inducing the interaction of &#x003b2;-catenin with enzymatically active HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). These reports indicate that the balance between the stimulatory and inhibitory transcriptional activities of complexes containing &#x003b2;-catenin can be modulated by changing the amounts of associated repressive HDACs. This could be achieved by altering the local concentration and/or availability of &#x003b2;-catenin or HDAC-interacting partners and could result from the activity of various signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>APPL Proteins as Dual Function Adaptors Acting in Endocytosis and Signaling</title><p>It is becoming clear that endocytic proteins may affect signal transduction processes at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). Endocytosis has long been known to regulate the levels of plasma membrane receptors and to contribute to the down-regulation of signaling. More recently, however, it has become evident that in several cases signaling initiated at the plasma membrane can continue intracellularly from receptors internalized into the endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Endosomes can thus serve as platforms for active signal propagation, and many endocytic proteins appear to be bifunctional, providing a coordinated control between membrane transport and signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). Intriguingly, several endocytic proteins, including APPL1/2, &#x003b2;-arrestins, HIP1, Dab1/2, Eps15, Epsin1, CALM, and the components of ESCRTs (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) shuttle to the nucleus, where they may interact with nuclear partners and modulate the levels and specificity of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In most cases, it is not clear whether these proteins act as messengers transmitting signals from the cytoplasm into the nucleus or whether they &#x0201c;moonlight&#x0201d; and perform independent functions.</p><p>APPL proteins are effectors of the small GTPase Rab5, which is a master regulator of early steps in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Interestingly, Rab5 itself seems to affect &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription, although the results of two reports on this issue are conflicting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). Here we tested whether APPL1 localized to endosomes might be involved in binding to Reptin; however, the observed lack of significant recruitment of Reptin to APPL-positive early endosomes argues against this possibility. We have previously shown that the binding of APPL1 to the endosomal membranes is strictly dependent on its interaction with Rab5, which occurs via the BAR and PH domains of APPL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In the present study, the association between APPL1 and Reptin has been mapped to the PH domain of APPL1. Interestingly, a majority of the known proteins interact with APPL1 at its C-terminal PTB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), and so far, only Rab5 and Reptin appear to bind via its PH domain. This may imply that the association of APPL proteins with Reptin and Rab5 could be mutually exclusive. It is thus possible that the functions of APPL proteins in Wnt signaling and in endocytosis are independent of each other; however, finding out whether the proper distribution of APPL proteins between endosomes and the nucleus is important for Wnt signaling will await more detailed studies. Moreover, a precise determination of internalization routes and transport kinetics of the Wnt/Frizzled/LRP5/6 ligand-receptor complex, as well as the identification of molecules governing these endocytic processes will be instrumental in understanding the relationship between endocytosis, endocytic proteins, and Wnt signaling.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported in part by an International Research Scholar Grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship 076469/Z/05/Z, European Union Grant LSHG-CT-2006-019050 (EndoTrack), Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education Grant 2P04A03828 and the Mobilitas.pl network, and the Max Planck Society (Partner Group Program).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="FN4"><p><sup>4</sup> M.
