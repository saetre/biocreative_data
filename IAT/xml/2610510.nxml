LKB1 contains a conserved serine residue near the C terminus (Ser-431 in mouse LKB1) that is phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and p90-RSK. Although some studies suggest that LKB1 is constitutively active and is not rate-limiting for activation of AMPK, others have suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-431 is necessary to allow LKB1 to phosphorylate and activate AMPK and other downstream kinases. Prompted by our discovery of an LKB1 splice variant (LKB1<sub>S</sub>) that lacks Ser-431, we have reinvestigated this question. In HeLa cells (which lack endogenous LKB1), co-expression with STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; of wild type LKB1, the S431A or S431E mutants of LKB1, or LKB1<sub>S</sub> gave equal levels of activation of endogenous AMPK. Similarly, recombinant STRAD&#x003b1;&#x000b7;MO25&#x003b1; complexes containing these LKB1 variants were equally effective at phosphorylating and activating AMPK, BRSK1, and BRSK2 in cell-free assays. Finally, all four LKB1 variants and a truncated LKB1 lacking the C-terminal region altogether were equally effective at causing cell cycle arrest when co-expressed with STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; in the G361 melanoma cell line. Our results do not support the idea that phosphorylation of Ser-431 increases the ability of LKB1 to phosphorylate downstream targets.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was also supported by a <grant-sponsor>Wellcome Trust Programme</grant-sponsor> Grant, by <grant-sponsor>EXGENESIS Integrated Project</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>LSHM-CT-2004-005272</grant-num> of the <grant-sponsor>European Commission</grant-sponsor>, and by the <grant-sponsor>pharmaceutical companies</grant-sponsor> supporting the <grant-sponsor>Division of Signal Transduction Therapy at Dundee</grant-sponsor> (AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck &#x00026; Co.

It exists as heterotrimeric complexes composed of a catalytic &#x003b1; subunit and regulatory &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits. Metabolic stresses that inhibit ATP synthesis (<italic>e.g.</italic> hypoxia, hypoglycemia) or that stimulate ATP consumption (<italic>e.g.</italic> muscle contraction) cause an increase in the cellular ADP:ATP ratio that is amplified by adenylate kinase into a much larger increase in the AMP:ATP ratio. AMP and ATP bind antagonistically to two sites formed by the four tandem cystathionine &#x003b2;-synthase motifs on the &#x003b3; subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). AMPK is only active after phosphorylation of a critical threonine residue (Thr-172) within the kinase domain by upstream kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), the major upstream kinase being a complex between the tumor suppressor LKB1 and two accessory subunits, STRAD and MO25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). The calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases, especially calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase &#x003b2;, can act as alternate upstream kinases phosphorylating Thr-172 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). This latter effect is triggered by a rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> without requiring any increase in AMP.</p><p>The sequence around Thr-172 is highly conserved in a family of kinases whose catalytic domains are closely related to those of AMPK. These AMPK-related kinases (ARKs) also require phosphorylation at the threonine residue equivalent to Thr-172 before they become active. They include the brain-specific kinases BRSK1/2 (also known as SAD-A/-B), SIK1/2/3 (SIK/QIK/QSK), NUAK1/2 (ARK5/SNARK), MARK1/2/3/4, and the testis-specific kinase SNRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). In LKB1<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts those ARKs that are expressed are dephosphorylated and inactive, whereas they are phosphorylated and active in wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).</p><p>Although LKB1 is required for the activity of AMPK and the ARKs in most cells, several lines of evidence suggest that it is constitutively active. Thus, in wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts that are stimulated with phenformin or AICAR, the activities of LKB1 and the ARKs are constant, despite increased phosphorylation and activation of AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Similarly, the activities of LKB1 and the ARKs are unchanged in muscle during contraction, although the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). These results suggest that LKB1 is constitutively active and continually phosphorylates AMPK. The effects of AICAR, phenformin, or contraction to promote Thr-172 phosphorylation appear to be due instead to the ability of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside monophosphate (which increases in response to AICAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>)) or AMP (which increases in response to phenformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), or contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>)) to inhibit its dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>).</p><p>Other experiments suggest that the activity of LKB1 is not rate-limiting for AMPK activation, at least in striated muscles. In hypomorphic mouse mutants with <italic>loxP</italic> sites in the Lkb1 gene, the expression of the protein in skeletal muscle is reduced by &#x02248;50% in the heterozygote and &#x0003e;90% in the homozygote. However, activation of the &#x003b1;2 isoform of AMPK by electrically stimulated contraction was unaffected in the heterozygote and only moderately reduced, by &#x0223c;50%, in the homozygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Similar results were obtained for the effect of ischemia in cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). It was only when LKB1 expression was totally eliminated, by crossing with a strain expressing Cre recombinase from a muscle-specific promoter, that activation of AMPK-&#x003b1;2 by contraction or ischemia was abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). These results suggest that LKB1 is not normally rate-limiting for AMPK activation in muscle and that further activation of LKB1 would have little effect.</p><p>Contrasting with this view are reports suggesting that the C-terminal region of LKB1, distal to the kinase domain, might serve a regulatory function. This region is phosphorylated in intact cells at Ser-431 in mouse LKB1 by both cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and p90-RSK, and an S431A mutation was reported to prevent the ability of LKB1 to reduce proliferation of G361 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Glucagon caused phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser-431 in perfused rat liver, and this correlated with increased phosphorylation of AMPK at the activating site, Thr-172 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Phosphorylation of Ser-431 by protein kinase C&#x003b6; was reported to be required for phosphorylation of Thr-172 on AMPK in response to metformin treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Phosphorylation of Ser-431 on LKB1 appears to be required for axon specification in the developing nervous system in response to agents such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, by promoting the ability of LKB1 to activate BRSK1/BRSK2 (SAD-B/SAD-A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Finally, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> the residue equivalent to Ser-431 (Ser-535) can also be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>lkb1</italic> gene caused defects in polarity of the oocyte, and this could be rescued by low level expression in the germ line of wild type LKB1 or the potentially phosphomimetic S535E mutant, but not by the nonphosphorylatable S535A mutant, although the latter was effective if overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>).</p><p>In view of the conflicting evidence as to whether LKB1 exerts a regulatory role <italic>in vivo</italic>, we felt that it was important to re-examine the role of Ser-431 phosphorylation. This study was also prompted by our recent findings that variants of LKB1 exist because of alternate splicing at the 3&#x02032; end of the mRNA. The newly described short variant (LKB1<sub>S</sub>) contains an unique 38-residue sequence at the C terminus and lacks the Ser-431 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Reagents and Proteins</italic>&#x02014;All of the reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich, unless stated otherwise.

HeLa cells stably expressing wild type LKB1<sub>L</sub> or an S431A mutant of LKB1<sub>L</sub> have been previously generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). As expected, the cells expressing wild type LKB1<sub>L</sub> exhibited an increased AMPK activity compared with untransfected control cells, and this was associated with a large increase in phosphorylation of the downstream target of AMPK, ACC, at the AMPK site (Ser-79). However, there were identical increases in AMPK activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) and ACC phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>) in the cells expressing the S431A mutant. The addition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore A23187 to activate calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase &#x003b2;, either to control cells or cells stably expressing wild type LKB1<sub>L</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>) or to normal HeLa cells transiently transfected with DNAs encoding wild type LKB1<sub>L</sub>, STRAD&#x003b1;, and MO25&#x003b1; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>), caused a larger increase in AMPK activity that was not additive with the effect of LKB1<sub>L</sub> expression. Next, we transiently transfected normal HeLa cells with DNAs encoding STRAD&#x003b1;, MO25&#x003b1;, and wild type LKB1<sub>L</sub>, or several variants of it, including a kinase-inactive mutant (D194A), a nonphosphorylatable mutant (S431A), and a potentially phospho-mimetic mutant (S431E), as well as the short splice variant, LKB1<sub>S</sub>, that lacks the Ser-431 site. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref> shows that, by Western blotting using an antibody (anti-LKB1(N)) that recognizes an N-terminal epitope common to all variants, LKB1<sub>L</sub> and all mutants of it expressed at approximately equal levels, whereas LKB1<sub>S</sub> expressed at a significantly lower level. It also shows that all active variants, but not the D194A mutant, increased the activity of endogenous AMPK, and its phosphorylation at Thr-172, to an equal extent compared with untransfected control cells. LKB1<sub>S</sub> was just as effective as the three active LKB1<sub>L</sub> variants, even though its level of expression was much lower. These experiments were repeated with or without forskolin to activate endogenous cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, which is known to phosphorylate Ser-431 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). As expected, Ser-431 was phosphorylated (assessed using a phosphospecific antibody) in response to forskolin only when LKB1<sub>L</sub> (or the kinase-inactive D194A mutant) and not when the S431A or S431E mutants of LKB1<sub>L</sub>, or LKB1<sub>S</sub>, were expressed. Even though Ser-431 phosphorylation was stimulated by forskolin using wild type LKB1<sub>L</sub>, the activation of endogenous AMPK, or its phosphorylation on Thr-172, was not significantly increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>F</italic></xref>).</p><p><italic>Phosphorylation of Ser-431 Does Not Stimulate Phosphorylation of AMPK, BRSK1, or BRSK2 in Cell-free Assays</italic>&#x02014;Because it has been proposed that phosphorylation of Ser-431 on LKB1<sub>L</sub> promotes its ability to phosphorylate and activate BRSK1/2 and hence axon specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), we also examined the role of this phosphorylation in the activation and phosphorylation of BRSK1 and BRSK2.

After 36 h there was relatively uniform expression of all variants in the cells, assessed using anti-GFP antibody, and there was increased phosphorylation (compared with cells expressing GFP alone) of the AMPK target ACC at Ser-79 in cells expressing active LKB1 variants (wild type, S431A, S431E, or LKB1<sub>S</sub>) but not in cells expressing the kinase-inactive D194A mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).

The use of GFP-tagged LKB1 variants had the advantage that we could restrict analysis to cells expressing GFP, so we could be certain that all cells analyzed for their DNA content by propidium iodide staining were expressing the variants.

The evidence in favor of this view may be summarized as follows: 1) Co-expression of wild type LKB1<sub>L</sub> with STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; in HeLa cells, which lack endogenous LKB1, caused an increase in phosphorylation at Thr-172 and activity of AMPK, and this was unaffected by mutation of Ser-431 to an nonphosphorylatable alanine residue (S431A) or a potentially phospho-mimetic glutamate residue (S431E). Phosphorylation and activation of AMPK was also the same when the short splice variant LKB1<sub>S</sub> was expressed, even though this lacks the Ser-431 site, and expression occurred at a lower level. The effect did, however, require the kinase activity of LKB1, because no increase in phosphorylation and activation of AMPK was observed when a kinase-inactive (D194A) mutant of LKB1<sub>L</sub> was expressed. 2) The results were not altered when the cells were treated with forskolin to activate cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. As expected, a strong signal was obtained using a phosphospecific antibody against Ser-431 in response to forskolin treatment when wild type LKB1<sub>L</sub> or the inactive D194A mutant of LKB1<sub>L</sub> had been expressed, but not when the S431A or S431E mutants of LKB1<sub>L</sub>, or LKB1<sub>S</sub> (which lacks the Ser-431 site) had been expressed. 3) When variants of GST-LKB1, including the wild type and S431A and S431E mutants of LKB1<sub>L</sub> and LKB1<sub>S</sub> were co-expressed with FLAG-STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; in HEK-293 cells and purified on glutathione-Sepharose, they all formed heterotrimeric complexes and in cell-free assays phosphorylated and activated the AMPK-&#x003b1;1 kinase domain, BRSK1, and BRSK2 equally well. Wild type GST-LKB1<sub>L</sub>&#x000b7;FLAG-STRAD&#x003b1;&#x000b7;<italic>myc</italic>-MO25&#x003b1; complexes also phosphorylated and activated the AMPK-&#x003b1;1 kinase domain, BRSK1, and BRSK2 equally well, irrespective of whether they were phosphorylated at Ser-431 by prior treatment of the HEK-293 cells with forskolin.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of Ser-431 phosphorylation on the activation of AMPK, BRSK1 and BRSK2 by LKB1 variants in cell-free assays.</bold> LKB1&#x000b7;STRAD&#x003b1;&#x000b7; MO25&#x003b1; complexes were expressed in HEK-293 cells as for <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, except that some dishes of cells were treated with 20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> forskolin for 20 min prior to lysis. <italic>A</italic>, a GST fusion of the AMPK-&#x003b1;1 kinase domain was incubated with MgATP and various concentrations of wild type LKB1<sub>L</sub>&#x000b7;STRAD&#x003b1;&#x000b7;MO25&#x003b1; complex isolated from cells treated with or without forskolin for 15 min, and AMPK activity was determined. <italic>B</italic>, GST fusions of the AMPK-&#x003b1;1 kinase domain, BRSK1, and BRSK2 were incubated with MgATP and complexes containing STRAD&#x003b1;, MO25&#x003b1;, and the indicated variant of LKB1 (80 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) for 15 min, and AMPK, BRSK1, and BRSK2 activities determined. <italic>C</italic>, samples of the purified LKB1<sub>L</sub>&#x000b7;STRAD&#x003b1;&#x000b7;MO25&#x003b1; complexes from control and forskolin-treated cells were analyzed by Western blotting to assess the phosphorylation of Ser-431 and the total content of the GST-LKB1 fusion.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0020959730003"></graphic></fig></p><p>Sapkota <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) found that phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser-431 did not directly affect its kinase activity, although at that time a physiological substrate had not been identified, so its activity was monitored either by autophosphorylation or by using an artificial substrate, p53. We have now confirmed that phosphorylation at Ser-431 does not alter LKB1 activity using three physiological targets, <italic>i.e.</italic> the kinase domain of AMPK-&#x003b1;1, BRSK1, and BRSK2. Sapkota <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) did report that the S431A and S431D mutants of LKB1 were much less effective than the wild type at suppressing cell growth in G361 cells, a melanoma cell line that does not express endogenous LKB1. Their approach was to co-transfect plasmids encoding LKB1 variants with a vector that provided resistance to the antibiotic G418. Four days after transfection, the expression of wild type LKB1 (LKB1<sub>L</sub>) and the D194A, S431A, and S431D mutants was similar. The cells were then grown in G418 for 16 days, and the number of colonies formed was counted. By this approach, all three mutants seemed to be much less effective than the wild type in suppressing colony formation. We adopted a different approach in which GFP-tagged LKB1 variants were co-expressed with STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; (which had not been identified as accessory subunits for LKB1 at the time of the study by Sapkota <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>)). We added nocodazole to arrest cells passing through the G<sub>2</sub>-M boundary and analyzed the DNA content of GFP-expressing cells 18 h later by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining. The advantage of this method is that we could be certain that the cells in which we conducted cell cycle analysis were expressing LKB1 and also that we were studying short term effects on the cell cycle rather than much longer term (16 day) effects on cell growth and proliferation, where secondary effects could have occurred. Our results do not support the idea that the S431A or S431E mutation or the phosphorylation of Ser-431 in the wild type had any effect on progress through the cell cycle.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of expression of LKB1 variants on progress through the cell cycle in G361 melanoma cells.</bold><italic>A</italic>, expression of LKB1 in HEK-293, G361, and HeLa cells, and in HeLa transiently transfected with LKB1<sub>L</sub> (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) using anti-LKB1 antibody.

They appear to have assumed that the phosphorylation of LKB1 on Ser-431 and the associated activation of AMPK were causally related but in fact never showed that there was any change in LKB1 activity. Other studies have used genetic approaches to show that substitution of the residue equivalent to Ser-431 by alanine reduces the ability of LKB1 to rescue defects in cell polarity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>) and to promote development of axons rather than dendrites in cultured embryonic hippocampal neurones, an effect that appears to require its phosphorylation of BRSK1/BRSK2 (SAD-B/-A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). However, in none of these studies was the activity of LKB1 or of any of it downstream targets measured. Our results clearly demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser-431 does not alter the intrinsic ability of LKB1&#x000b7;STRAD&#x000b7;MO25 complexes to phosphorylate and activate AMPK, BRSK1, or BRSK2, either in cell-free assays or, in the case of AMPK, in intact HeLa cells. They do not rule out more complex mechanisms; phosphorylation of the residue equivalent to Ser-431 could, for example, alter the localization of LKB1 and therefore affect its ability to phosphorylate downstream targets such as BRSK1 and BRSK2 in specific subcellular locations. Indeed, evidence that Ser-428 phosphorylation causes a change in the localization of human LKB1<sub>L</sub> has already been provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Kahn, B.
