This sequence is both polymorphic and genetically unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c4">4</xref>). Normal alleles, which contain &#x0003c;32 triplets, are classified as being either short normal (SN; &#x0003c;12 triplets) or long normal (LN; &#x02265;12 triplets). Disease-causing expanded (E) alleles, containing 66&#x02013;1700 triplets, interfere with gene transcription at the <italic>FRDA</italic> locus, thereby resulting in frataxin deficiency and Friedreich ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c9">9</xref>). SN and LN alleles are stably transmitted from parent to offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c4">4</xref>). However, E alleles display intergenerational instability, usually contracting by 20&#x02013;30% upon paternal transmission, and showing equal tendencies for expansion and contraction during maternal transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c11">11</xref>). Rare, intermediate-sized alleles, containing 33&#x02013;65 uninterrupted GAA triplets, are termed premutation (PM) alleles because they may undergo hyperexpansion upon intergenerational transmission, expanding by &#x0003e;5- to 10-fold to generate E alleles in offspring [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c13">13</xref>); unpublished data]. PM alleles and those at the long end of the LN spectrum may be interrupted by (GAGGAA)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> hexanucleotides, which are believed to result in their stabilization during germline transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c3">3</xref>). By analyzing individual somatic genomes from peripheral blood leukocytes using small-pool PCR (SP-PCR), we previously showed that E alleles are extremely unstable <italic>in vivo</italic> and show a marked predilection for large contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Unstable triplet repeats are known to cause at least 15 inherited diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c16">16</xref>). So far, only three of the ten possible triplet repeat motifs are known to be associated with disease: (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>, (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>, and (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>. Instability of (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> and (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat sequences in bacteria and yeast is dependent upon both repeat length and the orientation of the repeat relative to the origin of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c26">26</xref>). For example, the (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat tract is more unstable, with a significant tendency for contractions, when CTG is the template for lagging strand synthesis. Either strand of the (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> or (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat sequence (i.e. the CNG triplet motif) has a tendency to form hairpin structures. The relative thermodynamic stability of the hairpin formed by single-stranded CTG versus CAG on the lagging strand template is thought to be the basis for the contraction bias in both bacterial and yeast systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c17">17</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidence suggests the possibility that GAA and TTC single-stranded sequences may form hairpin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c27">27</xref>), which is a well-known property of both the CNG triplet repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c28">28</xref>). However, the polypurine&#x02022;polypyrimidine (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat differs from the two unstable CNG triplet repeats in its ability to adopt triplex structures in supercoiled templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c32">32</xref>). Although a triplex structure formed by the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat is believed to be the molecular basis for the transcriptional interference afforded by expanded <italic>FRDA</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c33">33</xref>), its role in mediating genetic instability is less clear. We proposed that errors during lagging strand synthesis could be the basis for the genetic instability of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat based on our previous observation of large, spontaneous GAA contractions in somatic cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c14">14</xref>), the known disparity in the relative affinities of replication protein A (RPA) for polypurine versus polypyrimidine sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c34">34</xref>) and the propensity of single-stranded (GAA)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> sequence to adopt altered structural conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c36">36</xref>). Furthermore, Ohshima <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c6">6</xref>) had previously reported orientation-dependent instability of (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats, noting increased smearing of their cloned inserts after restriction digest, indicative of a contraction bias in plasmids when GAA was the template for lagging strand synthesis.</p><p>Therefore, in this study we conducted a more detailed investigation of the effect of orientation of DNA replication on the instability of repeats, cloned from human carriers of several <italic>FRDA</italic> alleles, in plasmids propagated in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We also evaluated the instability of similar repeat lengths in peripheral blood leukocytes from human donors using SP-PCR. Here, we show that while small slippage-type events occurred in both orientations, large contractions of (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> sequences occurred primarily when GAA was the template for lagging strand synthesis. DNA replication was significantly impeded in this orientation, and the incremental accumulation of large contractions was coincident with the phase of maximal plasmid replication. We also observed the same spectrum of mutations in peripheral leukocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> in human subjects carrying <italic>FRDA</italic> alleles of similar length, including complete reversions to the normal&#x0002f;premutation length. During the preparation of this manuscript, similar findings were reported using (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> containing plasmids in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c37">37</xref>). This indicates that the mechanism of the strand-specific differential instability of (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats appears to be conserved among prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and the contraction bias is seen not only in prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes, but in human somatic cells as well. The threshold length for the initiation of somatic instability <italic>in vivo</italic> coincided with the length of a eukaryotic Okazaki fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c39">39</xref>).

The fragments containing (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats along with minimal flanking sequence (38 bp 5&#x02032; and 35 bp 3&#x02032; to the repeat) were ligated into the PstI and XbaI sites of pUC19. The pUC19 vector used contains the ColE1 origin and a portion of the ROP gene making it a low copy number plasmid. The primer pairs determined the orientation of the repeat tract: &#x02018;GAA&#x02019; orientation (gaapst1-F&#x0002f;gaaxba1-R) or &#x02018;TTC&#x02019; orientation (ttcpst1-F&#x0002f;ttcxba1-R) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f1">1</xref>). The following recombinant plasmids were selected for mutation analysis: 9, 21, 48, 82, 105 and 111 repeats in the &#x02018;GAA&#x02019; orientation, and 8, 21, 48, 79, 105 and 108 repeats in the &#x02018;TTC&#x02019; orientation.

A control, non-repeat containing plasmid with a 289 bp insert of random sequence (51% G&#x0002f;C content) was created by amplifying exon 5 of the <italic>APTX</italic> (aprataxin) gene using primers: aptx5pst1-F (5&#x02032;-GCTCCGCTGCAGGTCTGTTTCCTTCTCTTGT-3&#x02032;) and aptx5xba1-R (5&#x02032;-GATGCGTCTAGAGGAGCCAGCAGCACTACC-3&#x02032;), which was similarly digested and inserted into the PstI and XbaI sites in pUC19.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat instability</title><p>Individual bacterial (DH5&#x003b1;) colonies obtained by plating glycerol stocks of sequence verified plasmids were grown in liquid culture (Luria&#x02013;Bertani &#x0002b; 100 &#x003bc;g&#x0002f;ml ampicillin) at 30&#x000b0;C for 12&#x02013;24 h. PCR of individual colonies was performed to confirm that the inserts were full-length repeat tracts immediately prior to initiation of cultures. Colonies representing each repeat length and orientation of replication were cultured in triplicate, so that at each hour (between 12&#x02013;24 h) three separate 5 ml cultures could be harvested for each construct. Detailed studies were carried out for GAA-82, TTC-79 and a random sequence insert, in triplicate. Each culture was treated as follows: 1 ml was used to estimate the OD<sub>600</sub> as a measure of cell density (to plot bacterial growth curves), 1 ml was used to set up a glycerol stock (for mutation studies, see below) and the rest was used for plasmid DNA isolation (to measure the amount of plasmid replication). Plasmid DNA was applied to a Zeta-Probe&#x000ae; membrane using a Bio-Dot&#x000ae; microfiltration apparatus (BioRad), probed with &#x003b3;-ATP<sup>32</sup>-labeled pUC19-R oligonucleotide and quantified by densitometry. Bacterial growth curves and plasmid replication results were used to determine the time points for detailed mutation analysis: 12, 16, 20 h (log phase), and 24 h (stationary phase) of culture. We specifically avoided multiple sub-culturing of <italic>E.coli</italic> and only analyzed the mutational profile over a single log phase, which resulted in low mutation frequencies (&#x0003e;80% of final inserts were full-length), thus minimizing the bias for contractions and multiple mutations involving the same repeat tract.</p><p>Previous reports indicate that transformation of triplet repeat-containing plasmids <italic>per se</italic> increases the instability of the repeat tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c41">41</xref>). Therefore, glycerol stocks for GAA-82 and TTC-79 at 12, 16, 20 and 24 h time points were plated and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 16 h. PCR of individual colonies was performed to assess (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat instability using primers: GS-F &#x0003d; (5&#x02032;-CCCAGTATCTACTAAAAAATAC-3&#x02032;) and GS-R (5&#x02032;-ACACCACGCCCGGCTAACTTTTC-3&#x02032;). Relative sizes of PCR products were determined by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gels, coupled with direct sequencing of selected products. Approximately 100 colonies were analyzed for each orientation and time point, in triplicate, and instability was defined as the percentage of the total number of PCR products amplified whose length was altered after replication in <italic>E.coli</italic>. Large contractions were defined as products that lost &#x0003e;50% of their initial repeat length.</p><p>To compare <italic>E.coli</italic> growth curves and instability of pure versus interrupted (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat tracts, 5 ml cultures were inoculated with colonies containing plasmids with either the pure or interrupted repeat tract inserted in both orientations. Cultures were grown at 30&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02013;24 h, in triplicate, such that three cultures for each construct were harvested every hour. Growth curves were generated as described above. Repeat tract instability was analyzed after 22 h of growth, as described previously. Approximately 75 colonies were analyzed for each of the four constructs, in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>SP-PCR analysis</title><p>The SP-PCR analysis was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c42">42</xref>). Briefly, serial dilutions of human genomic DNA, ranging from 6&#x02013;600 pg, were prepared in siliconized microfuge tubes. PCR was performed using GAA-104F and GAA-629R, which allowed accurate sizing of alleles used in the present study. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1&#x02013;2% agarose gels (2% gels were used for the calculation of threshold length for the initiation of instability), and bands detected by Southern blotting using an end-labeled (TTC)<sub>9</sub> oligonucleotide probe. The calculation of the average number of individual <italic>FRDA</italic> molecules per reaction (the &#x02018;gene equivalent&#x02019;) was performed by Poisson analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c43">43</xref>). The average quantity of genomic DNA required for the amplification of one <italic>FRDA</italic> molecule was 13.4 pg (95% CI 10.6&#x02013;16.1 pg).

The same orientation-dependent instability was also noted when (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats were cloned in plasmids pBluescript II (Stratagene), pCR2.1 and pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) and replicated in DH5&#x003b1; and TOP10 (Invitrogen) strains of <italic>E.coli</italic> (data not shown).</p><p>To further examine the role of replication in GAA triplet repeat instability, we analyzed the mutational frequencies and spectra during the entire period of active replication of plasmids in <italic>E.coli</italic>. Throughout the log phase of <italic>E.coli</italic> growth, both bacterial growth and plasmid DNA replication were significantly slower when GAA was the template for lagging strand synthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f2">2</xref>B and C). A random sequence insert of the same size showed the same profile as when TTC was the lagging strand template (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f2">2</xref>B and C). Even when cultures were grown for 40 h, well into the stationary phase, bacterial density was significantly lower for GAA-82 than for either TTC-79 or the random sequence control (data not shown). These data indicate that DNA replication is significantly slower when GAA is the template for lagging strand synthesis.</p><p>Repeat instability was analyzed for GAA-82 and TTC-79 after 12, 16, 20 (log phase), and 24 h (stationary phase) of culture. Instability was significantly greater in the &#x02018;GAA&#x02019; orientation, and it increased throughout the exponential phase of plasmid replication (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f2">2</xref>D). Contractions were much more prevalent than expansions in both orientations. However, analysis of all contraction events from 12&#x02013;24 h revealed that large contractions, involving &#x0003e;50% of the original length, were observed primarily when GAA was the template for lagging strand synthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f2">2</xref>A and E). Large contractions in the &#x02018;TTC&#x02019; orientation were significantly less frequent (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), and of lesser magnitude [median size of contractions &#x0003d; 25.5 versus 49.5 triplets (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001)]. Furthermore, despite the relatively blunted exponential replication phase, there was an incremental accumulation of large contractions throughout the log phase in the GAA orientation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f2">2</xref>F), and indeed, most of the observed instability was due to these large contractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f2">2</xref>D and F).</p><p>We did not observe large expansions in either orientation of replication. Small contractions and expansions (involving &#x0003c;10% of the original tract length) were equally frequent in the GAA or TTC orientations (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.41 and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.37, respectively). Large contractions were far more prevalent than small contractions only in the &#x02018;GAA&#x02019; orientation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f2">2</xref>E). In summary, we noted large contractions predominantly when GAA is the lagging strand template, and this was coincident with plasmid DNA replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Similar mutational spectrum is observed at the <italic>FRDA</italic> locus in human somatic cells <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To test the physiological relevance of our observations, we performed SP-PCR analysis of individual <italic>FRDA</italic> molecules containing repeat lengths similar to those tested in <italic>E.coli</italic>, derived from genomic DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes of human subjects.

Of the 2520 molecules analyzed, we observed 283 variant bands (mutation load &#x0003d; 11.2%), with a significant contraction bias [55 (2.2%) expansions versus 228 (9%) contractions, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f3">3</xref>B]. In contrast to replication in <italic>E.coli</italic>, somatic instability in leukocytes resulted in far more small versus large contractions. However, the extent of the large contractions was similar in the two systems, with most large contractions resulting in almost complete reversion to the normal size, and very few intermediate-sized contractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f3">3</xref>B). It should be noted that the frequency of large contractions is most likely underestimated in our SP-PCR assay since all four carriers used in this study also have a normal allele, which makes it nearly impossible to detect &#x02018;complete&#x02019; reversion events of individual <italic>FRDA</italic> molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f3">3</xref>A).</p></sec><sec><title>The threshold length for the initiation of somatic instability at the <italic>FRDA</italic> locus coincides with the length of a eukaryotic Okazaki fragment</title><p>Using SP-PCR, we previously showed that the threshold length for the initiation of somatic instability <italic>in vivo</italic> is between 26 and 44 uninterrupted GAA triplet repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c14">14</xref>). Here, using the same technique, we analyzed a total of 5593 individual <italic>FRDA</italic> molecules with constitutional allele sizes ranging from 8 to 66 uninterrupted GAA triplet repeats to more precisely define the threshold length.

One carrier had a pure (GAA)<sub>107</sub> allele, and another a (GAA)<sub>114<sup>&#x0002a;</sup></sub> allele interrupted with a (GAGGAA)<sub>5</sub> hexanucleotide sequence close to the 3&#x02032; end of the repeat tract [(GAA)<sub>76</sub>(GAGGGA)(GAA)<sub>18</sub>(<underline>GAGGAA</underline>)<sub>5</sub>(GAA)<sub>8</sub>]. SP-PCR of 1316 individual <italic>FRDA</italic> molecules from the carrier of the pure (GAA)<sub>107</sub> allele revealed 294 variant bands (mutation load &#x0003d; 22.3%), ranging in size from 63 to 136 triplets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f5">5</xref>A). In contrast, SP-PCR analysis of 1294 individual <italic>FRDA</italic> molecules from the carrier of the interrupted (GAA)<sub>114<sup>&#x0002a;</sup></sub> allele showed no somatic variability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f5">5</xref>B).

This is an interesting result since the hexanucleotide interruption maps close to the 3&#x02032; end of the (GAA)<sub>114<sup>&#x0002a;</sup></sub> allele, leaving a tract of 76 uninterrupted GAA triplets, which is greater than the threshold length for the initiation of somatic instability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>(GAGGAA)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> hexanucleotide interruptions stabilize the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> triplet repeat when propagated in plasmids in <italic>E.coli</italic></title><p>In order to test whether the (GAGGAA)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> interruption also stabilizes (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats in <italic>E.coli</italic>, we cloned PCR products obtained from leukocytic DNA of the two individuals mentioned above, one having a pure (GAA)<sub>107</sub> allele, and another having an interrupted (GAA)<sub>114<sup>&#x0002a;</sup></sub> allele. The resulting PCR products were inserted into pUC19 in both orientations relative to the ColE1 origin of replication, generating the following constructs: (GAA)<sub>111</sub>, (GAA)<sub>101<sup>&#x0002a;</sup></sub>, (TTC)<sub>108</sub> and (TTC)<sub>95<sup>&#x0002a;</sup></sub> (see Materials and Methods for exact sequences). Bacterial growth curves were determined for each of the four constructs as an indication of plasmid replication (as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f2">2</xref>). The pure (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat resulted in slower growth when GAA was the template for lagging strand synthesis [compare (GAA)<sub>111</sub> with (TTC)<sub>108</sub>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f6">6</xref>A], as was previously observed with shorter repeat tracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f2">2</xref>B). However, comparison of (GAA)<sub>111</sub> versus (GAA)<sub>101<sup>&#x0002a;</sup></sub> revealed similar growth patterns, indicating that plasmid replication was similarly impeded by the interrupted GAA tract. Despite the similar patterns of bacterial growth observed for pure and interrupted GAA constructs, the pure repeat sequence was found to be significantly more unstable than the interrupted repeat sequence in both the GAA (92 versus 31.9%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and TTC (29.6 versus 7.6%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.004) orientations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f6">6</xref>C), and this instability was composed almost entirely of contractions (data not shown). Interestingly, the stabilizing effect of the hexanucleotide interruption was more pronounced in the GAA orientation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f6">6</xref>C). In the TTC orientation, the (GAGGAA)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> interrupted repeat tract was very stable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f6">6</xref>C), similar to the result we observed for this sequence in human somatic cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f5">5</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Friedreich ataxia is a recessive disease and asymptomatic heterozygotes, i.e. individuals who have one <italic>FRDA</italic> allele containing a fully expanded repeat, represent 0.5&#x02013;1% of the Indo&#x02013;European population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c4">4</xref>). Consequently, most Friedreich ataxia patients inherit fully expanded alleles (typically containing 600&#x02013;1200 triplets). Hyperexpansion of PM alleles as a means of inheriting the <italic>FRDA</italic> mutation occurs very rarely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c13">13</xref>). This is in contrast to all the other triplet repeat diseases, which are dominantly inherited, wherein <italic>de novo</italic> expansions are much more frequent. We therefore believe that the reversal of a fully expanded allele to the normal size in somatic cells, rather than prevention of germline hyperexpansion, represents an appropriate strategy for the treatment of Friedreich ataxia. We have previously shown that, unlike the expansion bias of CTG repeat in myotonic dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c50">50</xref>), fully expanded GAA triplet repeat alleles at the <italic>FRDA</italic> locus have a marked tendency to contract in somatic cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, in some cases even reverting to the normal&#x0002f;premutation size range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c14">14</xref>). Our goal is to understand the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the apparently spontaneous reversion of the <italic>FRDA</italic> mutation, and to devise methods to accelerate this process in somatic cells.</p><p>Here, we show that (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats are more unstable when GAA is the template for lagging strand synthesis during plasmid replication in <italic>E.coli</italic>, with a marked contraction bias. Ohshima <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c6">6</xref>) had previously noted increased smearing of their cloned inserts upon multiple rounds of replication, indicative of a contraction bias in plasmids propagated in <italic>E.coli</italic> when GAA was the template for lagging strand synthesis. During the preparation of this manuscript, a paper was published reporting similar results in a yeast model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c37">37</xref>). The instability of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> sequence was orientation-dependent, with increased instability and a contraction bias when GAA was the template for lagging strand synthesis. These data support our conclusion that (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat instability is replication-mediated, and also indicate that the mechanism of the strand-specific, differential instability is conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as is seen for instability of CNG repeats in bacteria and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c26">26</xref>). Our present analysis of individual replication events using the colony PCR method allowed us to precisely measure the degree and type of instability in the <italic>E.coli</italic> model system. Furthermore, it allowed us to accurately visualize the spectrum of mutations that occur after individual replication events. Our analysis revealed that it is mainly large contractions that increase in frequency when GAA is the template for lagging strand synthesis. Large contractions frequently resulted in complete reversion to the normal size range. Moreover, in peripheral leukocytes derived from human carriers of similar sized alleles, we identified the same spectrum of mutations. Somatic mutations <italic>in vivo</italic> consisted mainly of small slippage events and large contractions into the non-disease size range. The similarity of the mutational spectra observed in multiple independent systems, especially the observation of large contractions, suggests that a common mechanism may underlie the instability of (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats.</p><p>The mechanism(s) responsible for GAA triplet repeat instability are poorly understood. We propose that at least two distinct mechanisms underlie the mutations we observed. Small length changes of the repeat tract (&#x0003c;10% variation) may occur as a result of slippage and mispairing during replication of the triplet repeat. The equal frequency and magnitude of small length changes in both &#x02018;GAA&#x02019; and &#x02018;TTC&#x02019; orientations is consistent with the expectation that slippage is equally likely to occur during leading or lagging strand synthesis, and with the observation that GAA and TTC strands undergo approximately the same degree of slippage during rolling circle replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c51">51</xref>). However, our results implicate erroneous lagging strand synthesis, when GAA is the template strand, as the likely mechanism for the generation of large contractions of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f7">7</xref>). The incremental accumulation of large contractions was associated with DNA replication when GAA was the template for lagging strand synthesis. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data show that the threshold length for the initiation of somatic instability is between 40 and 44 uninterrupted triplets. Therefore, somatic instability <italic>in vivo</italic> may initiate when the length of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat exceeds the length of a eukaryotic Okazaki fragment. If the single-stranded lagging strand template were to adopt a stable or metastable secondary structure(s), the replication machinery could bypass a variable number of repeats in the nascent strand, resulting in contraction of the repeat (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh933f7">7</xref>). The 50-fold lower affinity of RPA for polypurine sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c34">34</xref>) and the selective ability of GAA sequences to adopt intrastrand structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c36">36</xref>) lend further support to this mechanism. The frequent observation of large contractions and paucity of intermediate-sized contractions could stem from a minimum length requirement for GAA repeats to maintain a stable structure in order to be bypassed in the nascent strand. These data have important implications for understanding the molecular basis of somatic instability at the <italic>FRDA</italic> locus.</p><p>It is likely that a structural transition may underlie the initiation of somatic instability <italic>in vivo</italic>. The minimum length for the formation of sticky DNA (59 triplets) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c30">30</xref>) is greater than the 40&#x02013;44 triplet repeat threshold for the initiation of somatic instability. However, Potaman <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c32">32</xref>) showed that the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat undergoes a structural transition from a stable intramolecular triplex at 9&#x02013;23 triplets to an intramolecular bi-triplex structure at 42 triplets, coinciding in length with the threshold for the initiation of somatic instability in human cells. Interestingly, the (GAA)<sub>114<sup>&#x0002a;</sup></sub> hexanucleotide interrupted allele was stable in somatic cells, despite containing a pure repeat tract of 76 triplets. Pure (GAA)<sub>111</sub> and (TTC)<sub>108</sub> sequences were also significantly more unstable than interrupted (GAA)<sub>101<sup>&#x0002a;</sup></sub> and (TTC)<sub>95<sup>&#x0002a;</sup></sub> sequences, respectively, when propagated in <italic>E.coli</italic>. However, the interruption appeared to have no effect on the slowed bacterial growth. The mechanism by which the hexanucleotide interruption confers stability is unknown, but it may be due to the inability of the impure GAA template strand to adopt a stable secondary structure. Previous work has shown that a repeat tract comprised entirely of (GAGGAA)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repetitive sequence (50% non-GAA) does not form sticky DNA, unlike pure (GAA)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c44">44</xref>). Interestingly, in the plasmid replication model the hexanucleotide interruption resulted in significantly enhanced stability of the adjacent repeat when GAA was the lagging strand template, despite interfering with efficient plasmid replication. This dissociation of replication blockade and repeat instability suggests that while bacterial growth and replication may be slowed by the homopurine&#x02022;homopyrimidine nature of the sequence, purity of the triplet repeat tract is required for GAA instability.</p><p>Furthermore, it seems that (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats are quantitatively more unstable than (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> and (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats in somatic cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. SP-PCR analysis of similar-sized alleles of the other triplet repeats in leukocytes revealed very low mutation frequencies compared with the mutation loads we observed with (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c52">52</xref>). The reason for these differences is not known, but it is interesting to note that during the evolution of the human genome, (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats have undergone significant instability as reflected by the development of a wide range of allele lengths in comparison with (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> and (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c53">53</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeat that causes Friedreich ataxia is destabilized during DNA replication, undergoing large contractions when GAA serves as the lagging strand template.

Pol&#x003b4; (large rectangle) replicates the leading strand at the advancing fork. Pol&#x003b1;&#x0002f;primase (gray filled circle) initiates Okazaki fragment synthesis, and pol&#x003b4; elongates the nascent Okazaki fragment during lagging strand synthesis. The single-stranded lagging strand template is bound by RPA). Non-repeat sequence and the complementary TTC repeat sequence are shown as solid black lines, and the GAA triplet repeat is shown as a dotted line. When the GAA triplet repeat sequence expands beyond the length of an Okazaki fragment (the threshold length of 40&#x02013;44 triplets at the <italic>FRDA</italic> locus), individual fragments would have to be initiated, elongated and ligated within the length of the repeat tract. We propose that the 50-fold reduced affinity of RPA for purine-rich sequences [compared with pyrimidine-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh933c34">34</xref>)] would allow the single-stranded GAA strand to adopt stable&#x0002f;metastable secondary structures (&#x02018;?&#x02019;), which would result in bypassing of a variable number of GAA repeats in the nascent Okazaki fragment, thus resulting in the experimentally observed contractions. Large contractions (and the under-representation of intermediate sized contractions) <italic>in vivo</italic> involving alleles with 78&#x02013;105 repeats could stem from the minimum length required for the secondary structure(s) to be stable.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkh933f7"/></fig></sec><ack><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to the patients and their families for participating in this study.
