Conceptually, efficient migration requires both effective stabilization of membrane protrusions at the leading edge via nascent adhesions and their successful persistence during retraction of the trailing side via disruption of focal adhesions. As nascent adhesions are much smaller in size than focal adhesions, they are expected to exhibit a stronger adhesivity in order to achieve the coordination between cell front and back. Here, we show that Nudel knockdown by interference RNA (RNAi) resulted in cell edge shrinkage due to poor adhesions of membrane protrusions. Nudel bound to paxillin, a scaffold protein of focal contacts, and colocalized with it in areas of active membrane protrusions, presumably at nascent adhesions. The Nudel-paxillin interaction was disrupted by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in a paxillin-binding&#x02013;dependent manner. Forced localization of Nudel in all focal contacts by fusing it to paxillin markedly strengthened their adhesivity, whereas overexpression of structurally activated FAK or any paxillin-binding FAK mutant lacking the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain caused cell edge shrinkage. These results suggest a novel mechanism for selective reinforcement of nascent adhesions via interplays of Nudel and FAK with paxillin to facilitate cell migration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cell migration is an essential process in both single-cell and multicellular organisms. In higher animals, cell migration is important for many biological processes, including embryonic development, the immune response, and wound healing. Cancer cell invasion into healthy tissues occurs as a result of inappropriate cell migration. As can be easily visualized when cultured in the lab, mammalian cells attach to surfaces through focal adhesions, cellular structures characterized by complexes of the transmembrane protein integrin and intracellular proteins including paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In order for cells to move, they must coordinate two processes: extension of the front edge of the cell and retraction of the back edge. To accomplish this, a cell first protrudes membranous structures from the front edge and then establishes adhesion structures known as nascent adhesions to hold the extensions in place. At the same time, the focal adhesions that hold a cell in place must be disrupted in order for the back edge of the cell to retract. Here, we show that a protein called Nudel is enriched at the front edge of moving cells, where it interacts with paxillin but is not detected in focal adhesions. We further show that the focal adhesion protein FAK is able to abolish the Nudel-paxillin interaction, leading to repression of the formation of nascent adhesions and to the loss of cell extensions. We therefore propose a model in which modulation of paxillin interactions in nascent adhesions and in focal adhesions is critical for coordinated cell movement: the Nudel-paxillin interaction enhances the strength of nascent adhesions to promote the attachment of membrane protrusions at the front edge of the cell, whereas FAK prevents the Nudel-paxillin interaction in focal adhesions in order to facilitate retraction of the back edge of the cell.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In order to achieve efficient migration, cell adhesion and detachment must be properly coordinated. Cells attach to the substratum via punctate focal contacts (FCs).

Nascent adhesions can mature into focal complexes (FXs), which are located mainly at the base of lamellipodium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000116-Choi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000116-ZaidelBar1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. FXs associate with branched F-actin and are thought to facilitate the propulsive effect of the lamellipodium. Some FXs then further evolve into the largest form of FC, namely focal adhesion (FA). FAs associate with the termini of F-actin bundles, or stress fibers, which provide cells with contractile forces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000116-Geiger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000116-ZaidelBar1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000116-Pollard1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is known that only moderate concentrations of the ECM are associated with maximal cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000116-Gupton1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000116-Lauffenburger1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

These two requirements could be satisfied if nascent adhesion sites exhibit stronger ECM-binding strengths than adhesion sites in FXs as well as FAs. Stronger adhesions at nascent sites would both promote the stabilization of membrane protrusions and facilitate persistency of the leading edge during cell retraction to allow efficient forward movement. In fact, tension on each contact site within FAs, which are caps of stress fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000116-Geiger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000116-Kaverina1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, is relatively constant in a cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000116-Balaban1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, smaller FAs can only transmit weaker traction forces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000116-Balaban1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

This would physically require a stronger integrin-ECM interaction at nascent adhesion sites than at adhesion sites of FXs and FAs. Whether mechanical strengths of different adhesion sites are indeed modulated and the underlying molecular mechanism(s), however, remain unclear.</p><p>FCs are dynamic structures.
