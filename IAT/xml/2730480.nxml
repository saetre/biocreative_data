However, the extent and timing of cell death during &#x00394;F1L virus infection suggest that additional viral effectors cooperate with F1L to limit apoptosis. Here we report that vaccinia growth factor (VGF), a secreted virulence factor, promotes cell survival independently of its role in virus multiplication. Analysis of single and double knockout viruses reveals that VGF acts synergistically with F1L to protect against cell death during infection. Cell survival in the absence of F1L is dependent on VGF activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Furthermore, signalling through MEK kinases is necessary and sufficient for VGF-dependent survival. We conclude that VGF stimulates an epidermal growth factor receptor-MEK-dependent pro-survival pathway that synergizes with F1L to counteract an infection-induced apoptotic pathway that predominantly involves the BH3-only protein Bad.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Upon virus infection most cells attempt to undergo cell death as a means to limit viral spread. To circumvent this, viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms to inhibit apoptosis, thereby prolonging the survival of infected cells to facilitate productive replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Roulston <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Consequently, many viruses encode sequence homologues of anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Cuconati and White, 2002</xref>). Like their cellular counterparts, these viral proteins inhibit the pro-apoptotic Bak and Bax from executing mitochondrial-dependent cell death. Bcl-2 sequence homologues are noticeably absent from most poxvirus genomes. However, the Lepripox virus myxoma encodes a protein, M11L, which prevents apoptosis by inhibiting Bak and Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Similarly, vaccinia virus encodes a mitochondrially targeted protein, F1L, which is able to inhibit apoptosis by binding and preventing activation of Bak and Bim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Wasilenko <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Postigo <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). This anti-apoptotic activity is dependent on a BH3-like, Bak-binding domain, suggesting that F1L acts as a functional Bcl-2 homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Postigo <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of F1L cells succumb to cell death much earlier than during infection with Western Reserve (WR), even though replication and spread appear unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Wasilenko <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Postigo <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that infection triggers a cellular suicide response shortly after virus entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Ramsey-Ewing and Moss, 1998</xref>) and before F1L is detected at 2&#x02013;3 h after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Postigo <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Given this, we wondered whether an additional early viral protein cooperates with F1L to prevent cell death. One possible candidate expressed early during infection is the highly conserved vaccinia growth factor (VGF), an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 1985</xref>). EGF belongs to a family of ligands that is conserved from invertebrates to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001</xref>). All these ligands induce ligand-induced homo- and heterodimerization of the ErbB1-4 receptor tyrosine kinases leading to activation of Ras-MEK-ERK, phospholipase C and STAT pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001</xref>). EGF receptor (EGFR) (ErbB1)-mediated signalling stimulates cell proliferation and differentiation, but it can also act to inhibit apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Sibilia <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Jost <italic>et al</italic>., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Vaccinia growth factor is secreted early during infection. It binds EGFR homodimers with reduced affinity, a feature that enhances signalling by attenuating receptor inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Tzahar <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Deletion of VGF from the vaccinia genome (&#x00394;VGF) leads to reduced plaque size <italic>in vitro</italic> and reduced virulence <italic>in vivo</italic>, consistent with a role in virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3 b4">Buller <italic>et al</italic>., 1988a; b</xref>). Furthermore, secreted VGF acts as a mitogen that primes non-infected cells for subsequent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Buller <italic>et al</italic>., 1988a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">b</xref>). In addition to this non-cell autonomous effect, VGF activates ERK in infected cells, which is required for efficient viral replication and multiplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Andrade <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In this study we report that VGF promotes survival of vaccinia-infected cells by inducing an EGFR-MEK-dependent pathway that mimics host survival signals in epithelial cells. Furthermore, by using the &#x00394;F1L-sensitized genetic background we show that VGF and F1L act synergistically to counteract a cell death pathway predominantly dependent on the BH3-only protein Bad.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>VGF and F1L act synergistically to prevent infection-induced cell death</title><p>In order to test whether growth factor signalling by VGF contributes to cell survival during infection, we deleted the F1L gene from the &#x00394;VGF virus. Infection with the resulting double mutant virus (&#x00394;F1L/VGF) leads to inhibition of phosphorylation of the EGFR, indicating that the virus, like &#x00394;VGF, was unable to induce growth factor signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous observations using the single-deletion strains, we found that WR and &#x00394;F1L infection produces large plaques, while both the &#x00394;VGF and &#x00394;F1L/VGF viruses form small plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). Re-infection assays with WR, &#x00394;VGF, &#x00394;F1L or &#x00394;F1L/VGF viruses confirmed that the absence of VGF results in a reduction in infectious particle production consistent with the plaque phenotype and the replication defect caused by the absence of VGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). Thus, absence of F1L in the double mutant does not exacerbate the replication defect reported for the &#x00394;VGF virus.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Loss of F1L does not reduce &#x00394;VGF plaque size or virus production.

All three assays revealed a small but significant increase in apoptosis after &#x00394;VGF infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). A more pronounced level of cell death was observed in &#x00394;F1L infection cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). Moreover, infection with the &#x00394;F1L/VGF virus resulted in a synergistic increase in cell death in all three assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). The increase in cell death in the absence of VGF or F1L also correlated with classical biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>). Infection with the WR did not induce poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage or activation of caspase-3. Loss of VGF resulted in a small but detectable cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 activation, while deletion of F1L induced pronounced PARP cleavage and activation of caspase-3. Cleavage of these apoptotic markers was significantly enhanced in the absence of both F1L and VGF during &#x00394;F1L/VGF infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>).

To establish whether VGF stimulates cell survival solely via the EGFR receptor, we examined the effect of AG1478, a specific EGFR inhibitor, and DAPH, an inhibitor of ErbB1/2, on the survival of HeLa cells infected with WR, &#x00394;VGF, &#x00394;F1L and &#x00394;F1L/VGF viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A and B</xref>).

To exclude whether this is the case, we infected cells with the four different viruses in the presence of cytosine arabinoside (AraC), an inhibitor of DNA replication and late gene expression. AraC would be expected to exacerbate cell death if VGF survival depends on late gene expression. However, Western blot analysis of infected cell lysates treated with AraC showed no further increase in PARP cleavage or caspase-3 processing in any of the virus strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>).

Our data now clearly show that vaccinia virus stimulates the EGF signalling pathway to enhance cell survival during infection.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that VGF, which is secreted early during infection, induces continuous activation of the EGFR signalling throughout the virus infection cycle as a consequence of its lower affinity for the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Tzahar <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). This prolonged EGFR activation and signalling would ensure that the infected cell receives a sustained survival signal that antagonizes infection-induced cell death. In accordance with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Andrade <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), we have shown that triggering signalling pathways by VGF involves a sustained activation of the ERK pathway during infection. Furthermore, our data indicate that activation of the EGFR/MEK pathway is the downstream signalling cascade stimulated by VGF sufficient to elicit a cell survival signal during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figs 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>). Survival pathways stimulated by growth factors in many biological systems are frequently PI3K-Akt-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Cantley, 2002</xref>). However, phosphorylation of EGFR is known to only weakly activate the PI3K-Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Soltoff <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). Consistent with this we did not observe any changes in activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway during vaccinia infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>). This is in contrast to the situation observed with several RNA viruses, as well as herpes viruses, which stimulate PI3K-Akt signalling to inhibit apoptosis via intracellular adaptors and decoys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Cooray, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The role of MEK in EGFR-dependent cell survival has previously been described in keratinocytes, with inhibition of MEK resulting in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Jost <italic>et al</italic>., 2001b</xref>). In these cells, survival in the absence of matrix-derived signals is dependent on EGFR signalling, which is required to maintain a high-level expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Jost <italic>et al</italic>., 2001a</xref>). In other epithelial cell types, EGFR-dependent ERK activation is thought to promote cell survival by preventing upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Reginato <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our data reveal that VGF, in concert with F1L, inhibits apoptosis by activating the EGFR/MEK pathway to counteract a cell death pathway principally through the BH3-only protein Bad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). It has been previously reported that during vaccinia infection Bim is a significant inducer of cell death in the absence of F1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). We found that Bim plays only a modest or redundant role in the induction of cell death by &#x00394;F1L/VGF infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). Whether these results are attributable to assay/cell type differences or caused by differences between acute siRNA-mediated knockdown versus knockout cells, which may have adapted, is unclear. Therefore, we cannot formally exclude that incomplete Bim knockdown allowed apoptosis to progress as normal, although our findings are consistent with the observation that cell death induced by MVA-&#x00394;F1L infection is not reduced in Bim<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> MEF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to Bim, loss of Bad significantly reduced infection-induced cell death by all our virus strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). It is thought that vaccinia induces apoptosis via several routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Taylor and Barry, 2006</xref>). For instance, vaccinia dsRNA-induced apoptosis depends exclusively on the BH3-only protein Noxa and is blocked by E3L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Notably, in the context of &#x00394;E3L infection cell death is not inhibited by the presence of F1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Our data indicate that Vaccinia infection, in addition, triggers a Bad-dependent cell death pathway that is antagonized by VGF and F1L. It would be of interest whether VGF and F1L directly inhibit Bad or at some point downstream of Bad to inhibit cell death. Interestingly, no role for Bad in vaccinia-induced cell death has so far been reported. Bad binds to the pro-survival proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-w and Bcl-xL, thus preventing their inhibition of Bak and/or Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). F1L may inhibit Bad by direct sequestration as observed for Bim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), yet no Bad binding to F1L has been reported thus far. Alternatively, F1L could represent a Bcl-xL-like molecule that retains a high Bak-binding affinity, but unlike host Bcl-xL, does not interact with BH3-only proteins, including Bad. Thus, while activated Bad could sequester Bcl-2 pro-survival proteins to prevent them from neutralizing Bak, F1L would ensure the continued inactivation of Bak. A similar mechanism has been proposed for the myxoma virus protein M11L based on its structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kvansakul <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, M11L binding to Bak and Bax is required for its survival promoting activity, yet despite its interaction with Bim, the latter is not involved in the anti-apoptotic function of M11L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kvansakul <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). While the structure of F1L has been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kvansakul <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), it remains to be established whether a similar mechanism is operating during vaccinia infection. In contrast to M11L, F1L binds Bak but not Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Wasilenko <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Postigo <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). It was recently reported that vaccinia N1L, which structurally resembles Bcl-2 proteins, can interact with Bax and Bad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cooray <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). It is an intriguing possibility that N1L and F1L target complimentary sets of Bcl-2 proteins, although functionally N1L is not sufficient to inhibit the extensive Bad-dependent cell death induced by the &#x00394;F1L/VGF virus.</p><p>Our study has revealed VGF to be an important inhibitor of cell death during infection. It will be interesting to test what targets of the VGF pathway promote survival, including potential phosphorylation of viral proteins required for survival, although our work suggests these would need to be early proteins. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that a virus is capable of using two cooperative strategies to suppress a Bad-dependent cell death pathway: VGF stimulates EGFR/MEK kinase survival signalling, while F1L inhibits mitochondrial-dependent cell death.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Viruses and cells</title><p>We deleted the F1L locus in the &#x00394;VGF WR strain that lacks both copies of VGF (open reading frames WR009 and WR210) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Buller <italic>et al</italic>., 1988a</xref>) using the guanine phosphoribosyl transferase cassette replacement strategy previously used to generate the &#x00394;F1L virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Postigo <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).
