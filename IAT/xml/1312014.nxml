Indeed, there is a rough correlation between the apparent complexity of the environment and the number of alternative &#x003c3; factors, e.g., <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> sp., which are obligate intracellular pathogens, contain only the housekeeping &#x003c3; and no alternative &#x003c3;'s; <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> which inhabits the relatively constant environment of its host organisms but can also survive in vitro, has six alternative &#x003c3;'s; and <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor,</italic> which inhabits a hostile and changing soil environment, has 62 alternative &#x003c3;'s. Therefore, the ability to predict promoters recognized by alternative &#x003c3;'s would significantly improve our capacity for understanding how bacteria adapt to stress.</p><p>It is challenging to predict bacterial promoters, which are composed of two conserved sequences centered at about &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 from the start point of transcription. Some promoters also have an &#x0201c;upstream element&#x0201d; (UP) upstream of the &#x02212;35 sequence and/or an &#x0201c;extended &#x02212;10&#x0201d; element immediately upstream of the &#x02212;10. The fact that these promoters are composed of multiple, weakly conserved elements separated by less conserved, variable length spacer sequences makes their prediction a difficult bioinformatics problem. Such attempts have a long history, mostly directed at predicting promoters recognized by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (b3067), the housekeeping &#x003c3; in <italic>E. coli,</italic> using hidden Markov models, neural networks &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, and position weight matrices (PWMs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. While these methods detect promoters with a moderate degree of success, they suffer from high false-positive rates (FPRs) in genomic sequences. In addition, promoter consensus and mismatch searches have also been employed to identify promoters for the Group IV factor, &#x003c3;<sup>W</sup> (Bsu0173), in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. However, these approaches are not as effective as using PWMs that better describe the natural variability of target sites. Here, we consider only PWMs because their success is comparable to more complex models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Staden &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; used three matrices (describing the &#x02212;35, &#x02212;10, and +1 promoter motifs) and one spacer penalty (for the &#x02212;35 to &#x02212;10) to predict &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters; variations of this approach were later explored by Hertz and Stormo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Huerta and Collado-Vides describe the most accurate prediction method to date for &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters using multiple matrices for the &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 motifs, with one spacer penalty for the intervening spacer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Although this method successfully identifies known promoters with high sensitivity (86&#x00025;; true positives/total promoters), it suffers from many false predictions resulting in low precision (20&#x00025;; true positives/total predictions), reducing its utility as a prediction tool to identify new promoters.</p><p>Alternative &#x003c3; factors usually turn on a group of genes synchronously in response to a particular stress, and hence use very few activators. As a consequence, promoters recognized by alternative &#x003c3; factors are somewhat less variable and might have higher information content than those recognized by the housekeeping &#x003c3; factor, making them more amenable to bioinformatic analysis. We chose to test this proposition by determining the feasibility of predicting promoters of <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> (b2573), both in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 and in related bacteria. &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, a Group IV (extracytoplasmic, ECF) &#x003c3; factor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, mediates the envelope stress response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, is essential in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, and is important for virulence in related bacteria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. We first identified &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon members and their promoters using genome-wide expression analysis and transcript start site mapping in the <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 genome. We derived a model for these &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters by building upon approaches pioneered for &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters, and used this model to make predictions in related genomes. By comparing promoter predictions from the actual genome with those from &#x0201c;randomized&#x0201d; genomes, we were able to identify those promoters that are unlikely to occur by chance alone. In addition, we adapted cross-genome approaches utilized for transcription factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; as an additional way of predicting promoters in <italic>E. coli</italic> and related pathogenic genomes. We tested all predictions in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and unique predictions in <italic>E. coli</italic> CFT073. These tests demonstrated that the model works with high precision.</p><p>Our studies reveal that the extended regulon of 89 predicted transcription units (TUs) is predicted to consist of a core set of genes conserved in most organisms and another group of more poorly conserved genes. Remarkably, each of these gene sets has a coherent function. The core genes coordinate the assembly and maintenance of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and outer membrane porins (OMPs), the two key structures of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, in response to environmental change. A majority of the variable &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon members perform functions known to be important for a pathogenic lifestyle. We suggest that induction of such determinants at the first sign of stress facilitates bacterial adaptation to the host environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identifying &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-Dependent Genes by Transcription Profiling</title><p>&#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent genes were initially identified using genome-wide transcription profiling, comparing a wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain that has a low level of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, with a strain overexpressing &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> (following induction of its gene, <italic>rpoE,</italic> from an inducible promoter by IPTG). This strategy is preferable to comparison with an <italic>rpoE<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> strain because: (1) many &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-transcribed genes have multiple promoters, so that the change in transcriptional signal upon loss of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is often small; and (2) <italic>rpoE<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> strains (which require an uncharacterized suppressor for viability &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;) grow slowly, invalidating the direct comparison between <italic>rpoE<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup></italic> strains. We monitored changes in gene expression in four separate time-courses after induction and used statistical analysis of microarrays (SAM) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; to identify 75 significantly induced and eight significantly repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g001">Figure 1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Some of these genes are part of operons in which other gene members were clearly induced but were not marked as significant in our strict selection criteria. Therefore, to fully describe the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon we expanded this set by using the statistics from SAM to analyze the reproducibility and significance of the expression ratios of all the genes adjacent to and in the same orientation as the highly significant genes. This gave 96 genes organized in 50 &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent TUs, of which 42 were induced and eight were repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identification of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> Promoter Motifs Upstream of Induced TUs</title><p>To determine which of our induced genes might have &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters, we used rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5&#x02032; RACE; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) to identify start points of each TU, comparing mRNAs from <italic>rpoE</italic> overexpressed versus <italic>rpoE<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells. This analysis indicated that 28 of the 42 induced TUs contained &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent transcription start sites (unpublished data). The remaining promoterless TUs identified in transcriptional profiling may be indirectly regulated by &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, especially since most were only weakly induced.</p><p>Bacterial promoters are located immediately upstream of their start sites. We therefore searched small blocks of sequences directly upstream of the 5&#x02032; RACE determined transcription starts for conserved &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> motifs using the algorithm WCONSENSUS (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). By testing several different search-window positions and widths, we found that a 16-nt search window (&#x02212;1 to &#x02212;16) was optimal for identifying the conserved &#x02212;10 motif (T/ CGGTCAAAA), and that a 16-nt search window starting 9 nt upstream of the &#x02212;10 element was optimal for locating the &#x02212;35 motif ( GGAACTTTT). Although there were no other highly significant motifs, we found a 30-nt window of generally A/T-rich sequences directly upstream of the &#x02212;35 motif with two conserved A/T-rich elements at positions &#x02212;48/&#x02212;49 and &#x02212;57/&#x02212;58. These correspond closely to the two information peaks in the SELEX-derived consensus sequences for the UP element of the <italic>rrnB</italic> P1 promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, the initiation nucleotide of the 28 promoters exhibited a strong preference for a purine (A/G) and weak conservation of sequences directly upstream. </p><p>The sequence logos of the conserved sequence motifs upstream of the 28 &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent transcription start sites, together with their information content, are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. The fact that all of the sequences contained good &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 promoter motifs indicated that we had successfully mapped &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent transcription initiation sites. Note that most of the total information content of the promoter motifs (22.8 bits) was contributed by the well-conserved &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 motifs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g002">Figure 2</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g002">2</xref>D displays histograms of the distance distributions of the promoter elements from each other: most promoters preferred a 5/6-nt discriminator region between the &#x02212;10 and +1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g002">Figure 2</xref>D), while the spacing between the &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 varied from 15&#x02013;19 nt, with 16 nt strongly preferred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Interestingly, individual promoters displayed an inverse correlation between the length of these two spacers: promoters with a long &#x02212;10/&#x02212;35 spacer tended to have a short discriminator, and vice versa. Consequently, the range of distances between the &#x02212;35 and +1 for all the promoters is quite small: 25&#x02013;28 nt, with most promoters preferring a 26/27-nt spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

High-scoring promoters were composed of more highly conserved promoter elements at optimal spacings, and low-scoring promoters contained less well-conserved elements at suboptimal spacings.</p><p>We searched the <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 sequence for &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters in which each individual PWM scored &#x02265;&#x003bc;&#x02212;2&#x003c3;, and where the distance between motifs was within the range observed for the 28 RACE-identified promoters. These constraints allow potential promoters to have a combination of weak and strong motifs and the variable spacings characteristic of known <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters. Genome-wide predictions with PWM<sub>-35</sub> identified 98,113 sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t002">Table 2</xref>). Sequences flanking these sites were then searched for UP, &#x02212;10, and +1 motifs within the spacing range of our validated promoters to create a library of candidate promoters (note that the order of the searches does not affect the final library). The total promoter score of each candidate was calculated using the same procedure described above for the known promoters and then converted to a z-score (the number of standard deviations &#x0005b;<italic>&#x003c3;<sub>k</sub></italic>&#x0005d; of the candidate score from the mean score of the known promoters &#x0005b;<italic>&#x003bc;<sub>k</sub></italic>&#x0005d;). In cases where promoters overlapped such that the +1 motifs were within 4 nt of each other, only the highest scoring promoter was selected.

To identify significant (i.e., functional) promoters from our library, we compared predictions from the actual genomic sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) with those from 100 randomized genomes generated in silico (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). The randomized genomes maintain the location of all open reading frames (ORFs), average codon, and nucleotide content, but now contain only nonspecific sequences. Hence, predictions from these genomes indicate the number of predictions occurring by chance alone. This allows us to determine both a FPR and a probability score that the prediction arose by chance (<italic>p</italic>-value) for every prediction in the actual K-12 genome. Using a cutoff of FPR &#x0003c;0.5 and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for each <italic>bin</italic> (a <italic>bin</italic> describes a group of promoters with similar scores and positions relative to the gene) and an additional distance and z-score constraint to remove spurious predictions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we generated 39 highly significant predictions. Their combined FPR is 0.22, which means that 8.6 of 39 predictions would be expected by chance alone. Of the 39 significant predictions, 24 were of previously validated promoters located upstream of genes that were induced in transcriptional profiling. The remaining 15 predicted promoters were not upstream of genes that were induced in transcriptional profiling. Interestingly, one promoter is upstream of <italic>ompX</italic> (b0814), which is repressed in the transcription profiling, but is oriented away from the gene. Thirteen of 15 promoters (including <italic>ompX</italic>) were confirmed either by in vitro transcription or in vivo promoter assays (sections A and C in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t101">Table 1</xref>), giving a total of 37 of 39 verified significant predictions.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>How Well Does Our &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> Promoter Model Perform in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12?</title><p>To determine the performance of our model in identifying significant promoters, we need to know the total number of validated &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12.

Given the variety of reasons that they failed, this suggests that they were outliers rather than a fault with a particular predictive step of the model.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Predictions of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> Promoters in Closely Related Genomes</title><p>Given the success of our promoter model in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, we extended it to eight genomes of closely related organisms in which the DNA binding determinants of the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> orthologs are identical or very similar to those in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

Significant promoters were identified as described above for <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 by comparison to predictions from random genomes (constructed specifically for each real genome to account for their structure, average codon, and nucleotide contents). To prevent spurious results in some genomes, significant promoters (FPR &#x0003c; 0.5; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) were also filtered for z-score &#x0003e; &#x02212;2 and distance &#x0003c; 1,100 nt upstream of genes.</p><p>As a second method, a significant prediction in any one genome was used to search the relevant promoter library for promoters upstream of conserved orthologs in the other species (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The matching promoter did not have to satisfy a minimum <italic>p</italic>-value or FPR, enabling the detection of less well-conserved orthologous promoters. However, to prevent spurious results, predicted &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters were required to have a z-score &#x0003e; &#x02212;2 and to be within 1,100 nt upstream of the orthologous gene or TU. For each significant prediction upstream of a conserved ortholog, the probability of identifying a matching promoter in each genome by random chance from the promoter libraries is approximately 0.03, suggesting that the matches we identified were highly significant. In addition, we found that the vast majority of matching promoters were at similar distances upstream of the orthologs as the original search promoter, further increasing the significance of the matches. The results of these procedures are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t004">Table 4</xref> and are presented in a database of conserved predicted &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters and regulon members across all nine genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>These two computational approaches, together with experimentally identified promoters in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, generated an &#x0201c;extended &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon&#x0201d; across nine genomes, which consisted of 89 unique TUs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t004">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, there are no TUs predicted to be regulated by &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> in all nine genomes; however, a core of 19 TUs is present in at least six genomes. The conserved members of the regulon predominantly carry out related functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t005">Table 5</xref>) involving the outer membrane and the regulatory strategy to maintain the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> response. The majority of the remaining &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-controlled TUs are not highly conserved, but most control cell envelope functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t005">Table 5</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref> for a list of all the extended regulon members in each functional category).</p><p>Among the nine organisms, <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 has the most predictions (49) and <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> the least (nine) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t004">Table 4</xref>). Genomes may have fewer significant &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> predictions because they have a reduced &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon. Alternatively, the promoter model may not perform well in that organism. We believe that <italic>Yersinia</italic> is an example of an organism with a reduced &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon, making it difficult to detect its promoters with the random genome approach that relies on identifying overrepresented sequences. In support of this idea, the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> DNA&#x02013;binding determinants in both organisms are essentially conserved (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>), and eight of nine <italic>Yersinia</italic> promoters with reasonable promoter scores were identified using the conserved ortholog approach (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t004">Table 4</xref>). This may also be true for <italic>Erwinia</italic> and <italic>Photorhabdus,</italic> which also have only a few significant promoter predictions (one and eight, respectively). However, they also contain four and six amino acid changes, respectively, near the DNA-binding determinants of regions 2.4 and 4 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>), so there is a possibility that there is a slight deviation of the optimal promoter sequence that is not captured by the <italic>E. coli</italic> promoter prediction model. We note, though, that these genomes still share many highly conserved &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon members, indicating that many of our predictions in these genomes should be functional. In more divergent genomes, where &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> orthologs had amino acid changes at critical DNA-binding positions (<italic>Shewanella oneidensis, Vibrio cholerae,</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa;</italic> unpublished data), our model was unsuccessful.

Although both of these assays used <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 RNA polymerase and &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, we do not think there are any functional differences from the <italic>E. coli</italic> CFT073 and <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> holoenzymes since their subunits are virtually identical and differ only in a few nonessential positions, with at least 99.72&#x00025; and 98.58&#x00025; sequence identity, respectively, with the <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 subunits. These assays revealed a high success rate.

Sixteen of 22 (73&#x00025;) of the significant predictions and four of seven (59&#x00025;) of the conserved orthologs were validated, for an overall success rate of 69&#x00025;. For CFT073, of the 40 predictions, we have validated 29 of 38 (76&#x00025;) significant predictions and two of two conserved ortholog predictions, for an overall success rate of 78&#x00025;. We note that unconfirmed predictions may still be functional in vivo, as they might require a coregulator not present in our assay conditions or in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12. These results suggest that our promoter prediction strategies provide a reasonably accurate picture of the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon in organisms closely related to <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The goal of this work was to follow the responses mediated by alternative &#x003c3;'s across organisms to determine whether these responses have changed. This required us to develop methods that accurately predict promoters recognized by alternative &#x003c3;'s. We have developed a successful strategy to predict the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 and related organisms and have validated predictions in three organisms. We report the first comprehensive analysis of the conservation and variation of a &#x003c3; factor regulon across genomes, identifying an &#x0201c;extended&#x0201d; &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon in nine genomes comprised of 89 unique TUs. Of these, only 19 are highly conserved. The highly conserved TUs maintain appropriate cellular levels of LPS and OMPs, two unique constituents of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, thereby identifying the core function of the regulon. The less-conserved regulon members perform multiple pathogenesis-associated functions, suggesting that the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon has been co-opted to provide organism-specific functions necessary for optimal interaction with the host.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Promoter Predictions</title><p>We chose to employ de novo promoter prediction as our primary method for cross-genome analysis because it can identify promoters unique to a particular genome. This is an important attribute, given the variability of bacterial genomes. For example, the three sequenced <italic>E. coli</italic> genomes share only 40&#x00025; of their coding sequence. As a secondary approach, we searched for weakly conserved predictions upstream of orthologous genes, thereby identifying additional promoters too weak to pass the first filter (e.g., the latter method identified seven new <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> promoters, four of which were validated in vitro, and eight new <italic>Yersinia</italic> promoters). Our &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoter model performed considerably better (precision = 95&#x00025;; accuracy = 85&#x00025;; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t002">Table 2</xref>) than the housekeeping &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoter model (precision = 20&#x00025;) upon which it is based &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, primarily because the combined information content for &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is much higher than that for &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (<italic>I</italic><sub>seq</sub> = 22.8 bits versus 12.56 bits). In addition, performance was improved by comparison to a random genome to reduce false positives and our secondary approach of searching for conserved orthologs. Interestingly, &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters, but not &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters, were often embedded in predicted clusters of overlapping sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. This distinction may result from the differences in specificity of the two models or reflect a fundamental distinction in promoter recognition mechanisms of housekeeping and alternative &#x003c3;'s. We note that a simple prediction model having a single-weight matrix and a fixed-length spacer suffices to predict promoters of another family of &#x003c3; factors (&#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>; RpoN) unrelated to the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> family &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b034">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, our promoter prediction model should be applicable for the prediction of promoters elements for the many alternative &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> family members that bind to promoter elements separated by variable spacers, and especially Group IV &#x003c3;'s that tend to bind to more highly conserved promoter sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Many &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoter predictions were limited to particular subgroups. In some cases, the orthologs themselves had limited distribution. This particularly interesting case suggests that the ortholog has an organism or species-specific role. For example, the highly related <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> genomes contained three predictions upstream of orthologs exclusive to at least three of four of these genomes, and the two <italic>Salmonella</italic> species contained two predictions upstream of orthologs unique to <italic>Salmonella</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). In other cases, the orthologs themselves were widely distributed, but &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters were identified for only some orthologs. For example, ten predicted &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters are found only upstream of genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Shigella,</italic> and five &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters are found only upstream of genes in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). These cases may identify examples of regulon evolution, where &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters are created or lost in response to the requirements of the organism. Alternatively, we may have failed to detect &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters because one or more of their motifs failed our cutoff criteria. Finally, when &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters regulate long polycistronic TUs, some downstream TUs may no longer be classified as &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulated in related genomes, either because of gene shuffling or because their intergenic distance was &#x0003e;50 nt (our cut-off for genes in an operon). In this latter case, &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> might still regulate the downstream genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The Core &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> Regulon</title><p>The core &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon consists of 19 TUs and 23 proteins, of which 20 have known functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t005">Table 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

However, the other two lipoproteins may also turn out to be part of the conserved regulon as YfgL is predicted to be driven by a &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoter in five organisms and, at least in K-12, NlpB (b2477) is induced by overexpression of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> through an unknown mechanism. The complex assembly pathways of LPS and porins are not completely known, but it is clear that the two are mutually dependent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b047">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;.

Two notable features of the transcriptional circuit encoded by the core regulon ensure a rapid and sensitive response to imbalances in OMP assembly. First, the <italic>rpoErseABC</italic> operon has two highly conserved &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters, one upstream of the entire operon and the second upstream of <italic>rseA</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). As a consequence of this arrangement, &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> positively autoregulates itself, thereby ensuring a rapid increase in proteins required for OMP/LPS homeostasis, and up-regulates RseA to set up a negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t005">Table 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The fact that RseA synthesis is driven from two promoters is likely to dampen the response, reduce oscillation, and provide a sufficient excess of RseA to ensure rapid down-regulation following a decrease in unassembled OMPs. A second important feature of the response is a homeostatic loop that prevents further buildup of unassembled OMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g005">Figure 5</xref>). At least in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, OmpA (b0957), OmpC (b2215), OmpF (b0929), and OmpX are down-regulated upon induction of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, thereby decreasing the flow of OMPs to the envelope. Down-regulation may be accomplished by production of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-regulated antisense small RNAs transcribed divergently from their negatively regulated OMPs (V. Rhodius, unpublished data). Intriguingly, the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoter divergent from <italic>ompX</italic> is a member of the core regulon (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t005">Table 5</xref>), raising the possibility that OMP down-regulation is a conserved feature of the response.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The Extended &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> Regulon</title><p>More than 60 of the unique &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-controlled TUs we have predicted are present in fewer than six of the nine genomes we have scanned; many are present in only a small subset of these genomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t004">Table 4</xref>). However, the majority of those with known functions carry out a coherent theme: adaptation of the organism to the conditions encountered when the bacterium interacts with its eukaryotic host (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t006">Table 6</xref>). This idea is presaged by two functions in the core regulon: an iron acquisition system (YecI) to facilitate growth in the iron-deficient host environment and a component of alkyl reductase (AhpF) to detoxify lipid hydroperoxides that may be generated during exposure to macrophages.</p><p>The predicted extended regulon encodes multiple functions related to pathogenesis. Among these, several have already been validated in at least one organism. These include synthesis of capsule, a viscous polysaccharide layer that facilitates adhesion and protects against macrophage ingestion; recombination functions to resolve DNA lesions that could be generated by the respiratory burst (RecJ/O/R); and metabolic components for nitrate/nitrite respiration (NarW/V) that facilitate adaptation to the anaerobic/microaerophilic host environment. In addition, the regulon is predicted to encode components that produce colanic acid and chorismate and that modify the core and O-antigen portion of LPS, although no predictions in these classes have yet been validated. That the extended &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon encodes many pathogenesis-related functions explains why cells lacking &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> are defective in pathogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, and suggests that the extended &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon may serve as an early adaptation system to facilitate survival in vivo. In addition, although the bacteria discussed here occupy diverse hosts, many pathogenic determinants apply broadly, even across the plant&#x02013;animal divide &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b061">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Why is a response devoted to monitoring the status of OMPs and LPS also used for pathogenesis-related functions? Possibly, interaction with host cells alters the status of these &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulators, thereby triggering the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> response. Using the core regulon as a base, organisms might then add additional members to the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon that improve their viability in their hosts. This would explain why many of the pathogenesis functions are unrelated either to the core function of the regulon or even to the envelope itself. The variability of the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon suggests that it may be easier to adapt the function of an existing regulator by changing the location of its binding sites than to evolve new regulators. Because environmental change is likely to generate envelope stress, it may be generally true that regulators sensing the envelope will contain organism-specific regulon members that facilitate the response for the particular ecological niche of the bacterium. Interestingly, &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is a member of the Group IV &#x003c3; family, many of which also respond to stress in the envelope. It will be interesting to determine whether organism-specific variation in regulon function is characteristic of other Group IV &#x003c3;'s.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Media, strains, and plasmids</title><p>M9 complete minimal media was prepared as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;, supplemented with 0.2&#x00025; glucose, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, vitamins, and all amino acids (40 &#x003bc;g/ml).

One hundred picomoles RNA oligo (5&#x02032;- GAGGACU CGAGCU CAAGC-3&#x02032;; MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) was then ligated onto the 5&#x02032; ends of the TAP-treated RNA using 5 U T4 RNA Ligase (Epicentre Technologies), and the samples again cleaned by organic extraction and ethanol precipitation. The oligo-ligated RNA was then used as template for reverse transcription reactions using 200 U SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States). In each series of experiments, 20 ng each of up to 40 gene-specific primers (GSP1; sequences available on request) were used in the same reaction to generate a library of cDNAs corresponding to the mRNAs of up to 40 putative &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-regulated genes.

Reporter strains were generated by transforming the plasmids constructs into strains CAG25196 and CAG25197 carrying the p<italic>Trc</italic>99a vector and the <italic>rpoE</italic> expression plasmid, pLC245, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040002-t007">Table 7</xref>). Promoter assays were performed by direct inoculation of Luria broth supplemented with appropriate antibiotics from frozen glycerol stocks. One hundred fifty&#x02013;microliter cultures were grown in covered 96-well U-bottom tissue culture plates overnight at 30 &#x000b0;C with shaking at 400 rpm. The cultures were then diluted 1:50 into fresh 96-well plates containing Luria broth supplemented with appropriate antibiotics and 1 mM IPTG. Cultures were grown as before for up to 23 h and fluorescence measured in a Spectra Max Gemini XS 96-well fluorometer and OD<sub>600</sub> measured in a Spectra Max 340 96-well spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, United States). &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent promoter activity was determined by first subtracting the background fluorescence/OD<sub>600</sub> readings of CAG25196 and CAG25197 cells bearing a promoterless GFP vector from the readings of CAG25196 and CAG25197 cells carrying the same promoter construct, and then subtracting the CAG25196 from the CAG25197 readings for each promoter. Four independent assays were performed for each promoter construct. A promoter was judged to be &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> dependent if the standard deviation of the four assays did not overlap with those of the promoterless GFP vector; this translated to a &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent signal at least three times greater than background. This approach was validated by confirming &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent activity of 42 of 49 verified <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoters.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>&#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> promoter predictions in related genomes</title><p>Promoter predictions were made in genomes as described for <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 using genome sequence files (&#x0002a;.fna) and annotation files (&#x0002a;.ptt) downloaded from the NCBI FTP database (<ext-link xlink:href="ftp://ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/" ext-link-type="uri">ftp://ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/</ext-link>) on 6 August 2004. For each genome promoter predictions were plotted as a function of promoter z-score versus distance upstream of the nearest ORF in the same direction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). A topographic plot of promoter z-score versus distance upstream was then constructed in which the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> axes were divided into 200-nt and 1 unit <italic>bins</italic>, respectively, and the number of predictions falling within each <italic>bin (P<sub>A</sub>)</italic> determined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Significant predictions were identified by comparing against predictions made in genomes containing randomized sequences. Randomized genomes were constructed to mimic the structures of real genomes but in which the nucleotide sequence of each structure was randomized. For each genome, the percentage nucleotide content was determined for all divergent IGs, convergent IGs, IGs less than 50 nt in the same direction as adjacent ORFs (short IGs), and IGs greater than 50 nt in the same direction as adjacent ORFs (long IGs). Finally, for each genome the average codon usage was determined for all ORFs. Randomized genomes of identical sizes were then constructed in which the size, orientation, and location of all the genomic structures were maintained but in which the nucleotide sequences were randomized while maintaining the average codon usage for all ORFs and the average nucleotide content for all dIGs, cIGs, long IGs, and short IGs. For each genome, promoter predictions were made from 100 randomized genomes, and, using the same bins as for the actual genomes, an averaged topographic plot was constructed that recorded the average number of predictions within each <italic>bin</italic> (&#x00050;&#x00304;<sub>R</sub>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040002-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). For each bin of the actual genome topographic plot, a FPR was calculated that compared the average number of predictions in the 100 randomized genomes (&#x00050;&#x00304;<sub>R</sub>) with the number of predictions in the actual genome <italic>(P<sub>A</sub>):</italic></p><p><disp-formula id="pbio-0040002-e006"><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040002.e006.jpg" position="float" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula></p><p>In addition, for each <italic>bin</italic>, the significance of obtaining the observed number of predictions from the actual genome <italic>(P<sub>A</sub>)</italic> given the average number of prediction from the randomized genomes (&#x00050;&#x00304;<sub>R</sub>) was calculated based on Poisson distribution to derive a <italic>p</italic>-value.

Promoter predictions for an actual genome were determined significant if, in general, FPR &#x0003c; 0.5 and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, with the FPR cutoff being the stricter filter.

Orthologs were defined as the highest scoring hit in a target genome, which, when the matching sequence was used to search the original genome, identified the same search sequence as the highest scoring match. All coding sequences in the genomes were organized into putative TUs defined as all adjacent ORFs in the same orientation separated by less than 50 nt &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040002-b084">84</xref>&#x0005d;. Using the protein ortholog database, conserved TUs across genomes were identified by containing at least one protein ortholog. In some instances, a TU in one genome may match more than one TU in other genomes due to the location of constituent ORFs becoming separated. Conserved promoter predictions were defined as predictions from the promoter prediction libraries less than 1,100 nt upstream of all orthologous TUs and scored in general promoter z-score &#x0003e; &#x02212;2, distances upstream &#x0003c; &#x02212;1,100 nt, FPR &#x0003c;0.5, and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 in at least one genome.
