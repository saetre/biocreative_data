Afflicted patients experience difficulty in walking and have a distinctive gait. Degeneration of the lateral corticospinal tracts, which contain the axons of cortical neurons that innervate primary limb motoneurons, is observed in the lumbar regions of the spinal cord in patients with AD-HSP. The distal segments of long dorsal root ganglion axons also display degeneration. No evidence is seen for cell death or for primary myelination defects, and the axons of primary motor neurons do not degenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Maia1">Maia and Behan 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Wharton1">Wharton et al. 2003</xref>). AD-HSP thus appears to selectively affect the distal regions of the longest axons within the spinal cord.</p><p>Because pathology is usually confined to long spinal cord axons, it has been suggested that the primary defect in pure AD-HSP is in axonal transport or some other process required for maintenance of axon terminals. Perturbation of anterograde or retrograde axonal transport might selectively affect the longest axons, because they would be most vulnerable to a reduction in efficiency of transport of material to or from their terminals.</p><p>About 40&#x00025; of cases of pure AD-HSP are caused by mutations in the <italic>SPG4</italic> gene, which encodes an AAA ATPase called Spastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Hazan1">Hazan et al. 1999</xref>). AAA ATPases are a large and diverse set of proteins that include an approximately 250&#x02013;amino acid (aa) conserved domain containing Walker A and B ATP-binding motif sequences (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Confalonieri1">Confalonieri and Duguet 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Patel3">Patel and Latterich 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Neuwald1">Neuwald et al. 1999</xref>). They use energy obtained from ATP hydrolysis to catalyze assembly or disassembly of a variety of protein complexes. AAA proteins are involved in many cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, protein degradation, and microtubule dynamics. Many AAA ATPases form hexameric rings, and it is thought that the ring structures are required for catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Vale1">Vale 2000</xref>).</p><p>Spastin is a member of the &#x0201c;meiotic&#x0201d; subgroup of AAA ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Frohlich1">Frohlich 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Frickey1">Frickey and Lupas 2004</xref>), which contains proteins involved in vesicle trafficking and microtubule dynamics. The only member of the subgroup whose activities have been biochemically characterized is Katanin-60, which is the catalytic subunit of a microtubule-severing protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-McNally1">McNally and Vale 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Hartman1">Hartman et al. 1998</xref>). Katanin-60 and Spastin are homologous only within their AAA domains. However, cell culture studies have provided evidence that Spastin is also involved in microtubule dynamics. Expression of wild-type human Spastin in transfected cell lines and cortical neurons caused disassembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton, while a mutant Spastin lacking catalytic activity colocalized with tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Errico1">Errico et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-McDermott1">McDermott et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms by which <italic>spastin</italic> mutations produce dominant spasticity phenotypes in humans are controversial. A wide variety of nonsense and missense mutations, but no complete gene deletions, have been found in families with AD-HSP. It has been suggested that dominance arises from haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Charvin1">Charvin et al. 2003</xref>). This model, however, would require that the processes in which Spastin participates are vulnerable to a 50&#x00025; decrease in its enzymatic activity. Another possibility is that truncated or missense mutant Spastins function as dominant negatives. Hexameric AAA ATPase ring complexes might be especially vulnerable to the presence of nonfunctional (&#x0201c;poison&#x0201d;) subunits that assemble into rings but lack catalytic activity. Consistent with this idea, expression of a mutant Spastin that associates with microtubules but cannot catalyze severing altered organelle distribution in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-McDermott1">McDermott et al. 2003</xref>). In the dominant negative model, AD-HSP might only occur when Spastin activity is eliminated or greatly reduced.</p><p>In this study, we describe the phenotypes arising from mutation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of human <italic>spastin</italic>. We initially identified this gene in a gain-of-function screen, in which we found that its overexpression in neurons causes axons in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) to converge onto the midline (Sun 2000). Overexpression of Spastin in muscles erases their microtubule networks, consistent with the idea that Spastin is a microtubule-severing protein.</p><p>We made loss-of-function (LOF) <italic>spastin</italic> mutations, and found that they produce recessive phenotypes affecting the larval neuromuscular system. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) uses glutamate as its neurotransmitter and employs ionotropic glutamate receptors homologous to vertebrate AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Schuster1">Schuster et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Petersen1">Petersen et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Marrus1">Marrus et al. 2004</xref>). It is organized into presynaptic boutons that are surrounded by a postsynaptic scaffold, and its synapses exhibit plastic behavior during development. These properties make the fly NMJ a useful genetic model system for the study of glutamatergic synapses in the mammalian brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Keshishian1">Keshishian et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Koh2">Koh et al. 2000</xref>).</p><p>During the period from larval hatching through the third instar stage, the number of boutons at each NMJ increases by up to 10-fold in order to keep pace with the growth of its muscle target. New boutons are added by a process of budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Zito1">Zito et al. 1999</xref>). As these boutons mature, their microtubule cytoskeleton is thought to progress through a regulated series of alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Roos1">Roos et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Pennetta1">Pennetta et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we show that synaptic growth and function are altered in <italic>spastin</italic> mutant larval NMJs. Boutons are more numerous than in wild-type larvae, and synaptic transmission is impaired. These changes could result from alterations in synaptic microtubule dynamics, because we find that microtubule bundles are depleted from the distal boutons of NMJs in <italic>spastin</italic>-null mutants. This is surprising, because the fact that Spastin overexpression destroys microtubule networks might lead one to expect that its removal would increase the number of microtubules. Morphological and microtubule phenotypes are seen only for a total gene deletion, indicating that complete loss of Spastin function is required to alter synaptic microtubules in the fly system. The phenotypes we see are quite different from those described in a recently published study of perturbation of <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>spastin</italic> using RNAi methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Trotta1">Trotta et al. 2004</xref>). In particular, the changes in synaptic microtubules that occur in <italic>spastin</italic> LOF mutants are opposite to those reported in the RNAi perturbation paper.</p><p><italic>spastin</italic> is not an essential gene, but mutant adults have severely compromised motor behavior. Null mutants cannot fly or jump, they climb slowly, and they often drag their hind legs. While it is intriguing that <italic>spastin</italic> mutant flies display such movement phenotypes, further work will be required to determine whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> can provide a useful organismal model system for human AD-HSP. Nevertheless, insights into the cellular functions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spastin obtained from our work should be relevant to an understanding of Spastin's functions in human neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila spastin</named-content> Gene</title><p>We identified <italic>spastin</italic> in an <italic>&#x0201c;EP&#x0201d;</italic> screen for genes involved in embryonic CNS development. <italic>EPs</italic> are <italic>P</italic> element derivatives with a block of &#x0201c;UAS&#x0201d; sites recognized by the yeast transcription factor GAL4 near one end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Rorth1">Rorth 1996</xref>).

Mammalian Spastins are the only proteins that are homologous to both the C-terminal AAA domain and the N-terminal region of fly Spastin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Spastin exhibits homology to all other AAA proteins only within its AAA domain (approximately aa 460&#x02013;754 of fly Spastin).

Spartin is not an AAA ATPase. The AAA protein with a known biochemical function that is most closely related to Spastin (41&#x00025; identity in the AAA domain) is Katanin-60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g001">1</xref>C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-McNally1">McNally and Vale 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Hartman1">Hartman et al. 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Spastin Localizes to the Cytoplasm</title><p>Human Spastin is thought to be a cytoplasmic protein expressed in many cell types, based on localization of epitope-tagged proteins expressed in transfected cells, and antibody staining of human tissue and neuronal cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Errico1">Errico et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Errico2">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-McDermott1">McDermott et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Wharton1">Wharton et al. 2003</xref>).

At 29 &#x000b0;C, this hypomorphic allele behaves as a null with respect to NMJ electrophysiology. Finally, we examined escaper larvae (<italic>Elav-GAL4/&#x0002b;; T32/&#x0002b;</italic>) overexpressing Spastin in neurons, and found that synaptic transmission in these larvae was not significantly different from wild-type (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title><italic>spastin</italic> Mutant Adults Have Severe Behavioral Phenotypes</title><p>We observed that only approximately 20&#x00025; of homozygous <italic>spastin<sup>5.75</sup></italic> pupae were able to eclose at room temperature compared to 94&#x00025; of heterozygotes, and the adults that emerged had severe movement defects (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>). They could not fly at all, and did not even appear to move their wings, although the wings inflated and straightened in a normal manner immediately after eclosion. They also did not jump spontaneously, but would jump if persistently prodded in the abdomen. Their legs were weak: when standing, the metathoracic legs often slipped out from underneath them, and during walking they often dragged these legs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>). They also had difficulty holding on to surfaces when they were upside down. These phenotypes were temperature dependent.

The flight assay could only be used for hypomorphs since null mutants were flightless. In this assay, flies were released into the top of a vertical cylinder that had been coated on the inside with oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Benzer1">Benzer 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Atkinson1">Atkinson et al. 2000</xref>). Poor fliers who took longer to fly fell to the bottom or collided with the lower walls of the cylinder, while good fliers who responded rapidly to being dropped collided with the upper walls. A histogram of the distribution of oil-trapped flies along the height of the cylinder showed that more than half of the <italic>spastin</italic> hypomorphs did not fly in time to avoid falling to the bottom of the cylinder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).

Interestingly, for those hypomorphs that did fly out to the sides, their distribution paralleled that of the controls, suggesting that flight responses in the column were relatively normal in this subpopulation of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g006">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><p>In the climbing assay, flies were tested for their ability to climb up the side of a vial within a limited time period.

This difference did not reflect a loss of geotactic behavior, since <italic>spastin<sup>5.75</sup></italic> flies were typically found at the tops of their vials after several minutes. Overall, mean climbing velocity was approximately 9-fold slower for <italic>spastin</italic>-null mutants than for wild-type flies, while the hypomorphs were about 2-fold slower than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g006">Figure 6</xref>D).</p><p>We also measured the lifespan of the flies. Under our conditions, <italic>WCS</italic> flies lived an average of 46 d at 25 &#x000b0;C<italic>. spastin<sup>10-12</sup></italic> and <italic>spastin<sup>17-7</sup></italic> flies had somewhat shorter lifetimes, surviving an average of 35 d.

Examination of mortality curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g006">Figure 6</xref>E), however, revealed that, as in the case of flight ability in the hypomorphs, these flies had a bimodal lifespan distribution. Only 55&#x00025; of flies were still alive at 4 d post-eclosion, but most of these (37&#x00025; of the total) then remained alive until about 25 d post-eclosion.

These flies were still very slow, and it is clear that <italic>spin-GAL4</italic>-driven Spastin expression did not restore behavior to the levels characteristic of control flies such as <italic>WCS</italic>. However, genetic background effects made the precise efficacy of rescue achieved in this experiment difficult to determine (the non-rescued <italic>spastin<sup>5.75</sup></italic> sibling flies bearing the driver and balancer chromosomes used in the rescue cross were much more unhealthy and slow-moving than <italic>spastin<sup>5.75</sup></italic> flies without these chromosomes).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Spastin Overexpression Erases Microtubule Networks In Vivo</title><p>To investigate whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spastin affects microtubule networks, we overexpressed it in embryonic muscles using the <italic>G14</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> or <italic>24B-GAL4</italic> drivers, and then visualized muscle microtubules in late stage 16 embryos with an anti-&#x003b2;3-tubulin antibody that preferentially stains polymerized tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Buttgereit1">Buttgereit et al. 1996</xref>). In wild-type embryos, a complex network of microtubules aligned along the muscle axes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">Figure 7</xref>A; two segments are shown). This was clearly seen in both vertically oriented (18 and 21&#x02013;24) and diagonally oriented (5,11, and 19) muscles.</p><p>When Spastin was overexpressed in muscles, the muscle microtubule network completely disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). The muscles themselves appeared rounded, and were partially or totally detached from their insertion sites. This detachment may have been a consequence of the dissolution of the microtubule network. Oriented microtubule networks could still be seen within the cap cells of the chordotonal organs in each segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">Figure 7</xref>B, brackets); these cells did not express the <italic>GAL4</italic> driver and therefore did not overexpress Spastin. Dissolution of the microtubule network was therefore specific to cells in which Spastin was overexpressed.</p><p>We also overexpressed Spastin in larval muscles by crossing the muscle-specific <italic>MHC-GS-GAL4</italic> driver line to <italic>UAS-spastin</italic> flies. <italic>MHC-GS-GAL4</italic> is RU486-inducible, but we could not feed the larvae with RU486 as this was lethal. However, <italic>MHC-GS-GAL4</italic> also confers late RU486-independent expression in third instar larvae, and we were able to obtain escaper larvae from the cross and double-stain these for Spastin and &#x003b1;-tubulin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">Figure 7</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">7</xref>E, larvae that lacked detectable Spastin expression had a dense network of muscle microtubules. In contrast, <italic>MHC-GS-GAL4/UAS-spastin</italic> larvae that had high levels of muscle Spastin displayed a dramatic reduction in microtubules, so that only faint and sparse microtubules were observed in the muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">Figure 7</xref>F&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">7</xref>H). The strongly staining microtubules still visible in these larvae are those of the neurons and tracheae, which do not overexpress Spastin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">Figure 7</xref>G&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">7</xref>H). These results also show that this &#x003b1;-tubulin antibody preferentially recognizes polymerized tubulin, since the total amount of tubulin dimers would be the same in both sets of muscles (tubulin dimers are very stable proteins and are unlikely to be proteolyzed after severing).</p><p>Interestingly, when we overexpressed Spastin in the embryonic or larval CNS, we did not observe an obvious alteration of the axonal microtubule architecture (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This suggests that Spastin may be unable to disassemble stable axonal microtubule bundles. Nevertheless, the dramatic effects of Spastin overexpression on muscle microtubules suggest that the embryonic CNS collapse phenotype conferred by neuronal overexpression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g003">Figure 3</xref>) may also arise from breakdown of key neuronal microtubules during the axonal growth phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Microtubule Bundles Are Depleted in Distal NMJ Boutons of <italic>spastin</italic> LOF Mutants</title><p>The finding that Spastin overexpression erases the microtubule network in muscles suggested that the <italic>spastin</italic> LOF NMJ phenotypes could arise from alterations in microtubule networks. To investigate this, we first examined the distribution of Futsch, a microtubule-associated protein related to vertebrate MAP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Hummel1">Hummel et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Roos1">Roos et al. 2000</xref>). Futsch staining is restricted to stable neuronal microtubule bundles. Because Futsch is not expressed in the underlying muscle, Futsch antibody staining provides the optimal method for quantitatively evaluating stable microtubules within NMJ boutons.</p><p>At muscle 4 NMJs in wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g008">Figure 8</xref>A) we observed continuous microtubule bundles stained by anti-Futsch (mAb 22C10; green) within axons and along the axis of each branch of the NMJ (delineated by anti-HRP, which labels neuronal membranes; magenta). The intensity of Futsch staining weakens in the distal portions of the branches. Consistent with earlier findings, we also observed distinctive &#x0201c;loops&#x0201d; of Futsch staining within some boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Roos1">Roos et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Packard1">Packard et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Pennetta1">Pennetta et al. 2002</xref>). Loops were typically observed in terminal boutons at the ends of branches. In some terminal boutons, however, we detected only punctate staining or no staining at all. This last case may reflect the limits of detection rather than the complete absence of Futsch protein in a bouton.</p><p>We quantified Futsch distribution by dividing the patterns of Futsch staining in boutons into three classes: continuous (bundles or splayed bundles), looped, and diffuse or undetectable. In <italic>spastin<sup>5.75</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g008">Figure 8</xref>B), there was a shift in the Futsch pattern toward less organized morphologies (i.e., diffuse/undetectable).

These results show that the reduction in stable synaptic microtubules seen in <italic>spastin</italic> LOF mutants is due to loss of Spastin from neurons during larval development. We also examined Futsch staining in <italic>Elav-GS-GAL4/UAS-spastin</italic> larvae grown on RU486 food, but saw no difference from the pattern in wild-type controls. Thus, stable microtubules at the NMJ do not break down when Spastin is overexpressed at the levels induced by this driver.</p><p>Having demonstrated statistically significant differences in Futsch localization between control and <italic>spastin</italic> mutant NMJs, we then directly examined tubulin in muscle 4 NMJ boutons using fixation conditions that reduce muscle microtubule staining (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The pattern of NMJ microtubules is complex, and is difficult to quantitatively analyze because of residual signal from microtubules in the underlying muscle. However, using the &#x003b1;-tubulin antibody described above, we were able to clearly visualize looped microtubule structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g009">Figure 9</xref>A, green) within anti-HRP-labeled boutons (magenta).

Looped microtubule structures could be seen in some boutons in mutants. However, boutons at the ends of NMJ branches or at the outer edges of the bouton clumps that are characteristic of <italic>spastin</italic> NMJs often lacked any tubulin staining (inset). Thus, our results indicate that microtubule bundles are selectively depleted from the distal boutons of NMJs in larvae lacking Spastin protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mutations in the human <italic>spastin</italic> gene, which encodes an AAA ATPase, are the most common cause of pure AD-HSP. We identified the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spastin ortholog (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g001">Figure 1</xref>) in a gain-of-function screen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g003">Figure 3</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spastin is a cytoplasmic protein that can also localize to axons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g002">Figure 2</xref>). <italic>spastin</italic>-null larvae have altered NMJs in which presynaptic boutons are more numerous and smaller than in wild-type, and are organized in dense clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These changes in bouton number and organization are rescued by expression of Spastin in neurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">S1</xref>). QC, a measure of the number of vesicles of neurotransmitter released in response to an action potential, is reduced at NMJs in both null and hypomorphic <italic>spastin</italic> mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>spastin</italic>-null flies have severe movement defects. They cannot fly at all, and do not jump. They climb and walk very slowly, often drag their hind legs when walking (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>), and have greatly reduced lifespans. <italic>spastin</italic> hypomorphs have milder phenotypes, displaying flying defects and a decrease in climbing speed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Regulation of Synaptic Microtubule Networks by Spastin</title><p>The AAA domain of Spastin is quite similar to that of Katanin-60, which is a microtubule-severing protein. To determine whether Spastin might also sever or otherwise alter microtubules in vivo, we overexpressed the protein in embryonic and larval muscles. Strikingly, this overexpression erases or greatly reduces the microtubule network (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These data are consistent with the finding that overexpression of human Spastin in transfected mammalian cells causes microtubule disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Errico1">Errico et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-McDermott1">McDermott et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Having demonstrated that Spastin can cause disassembly of microtubules in vivo, we then examined how its absence affects the synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton. Based on the overexpression phenotype, one might have expected that microtubules would be more stable or more numerous in <italic>spastin</italic> LOF mutants. However, our observations indicate the opposite: microtubule bundles are depleted in NMJ boutons when Spastin is absent.</p><p>At the wild-type muscle 4 NMJ, boutons are arranged along linear axes. Continuous microtubule bundles run along the axes and connect to larger bundles within the innervating axon. Microtubules within boutons are typically arranged in loops and swirls. In <italic>spastin</italic>-null mutants, boutons are arranged in clumps, and the distal boutons of these clumps often lack any detectable tubulin staining (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Looped microtubule structures are present within some proximal boutons, however, and the bundles connecting the NMJ to the axon are still present. These results suggest that the absence of Spastin selectively affects the construction of the presynaptic microtubule cytoskeleton, and that the severity of the microtubule defects in a bouton are correlated with its distance from the NMJ's axonal branchpoint.</p><p>We quantitated these defects using an antibody against the microtubule-associated Futsch protein, which defines a subpopulation of stable neuronal microtubule bundles. In wild-type larvae, Futsch staining forms continuous lines along the main branches of the NMJ. Some individual boutons have Futsch loops, while others display only diffuse staining. A comparison of wild-type and <italic>spastin</italic>-null larvae shows that the distribution of Futsch within boutons shifts from organized structures (bundles and loops) toward diffuse patterns or the absence of detectable staining. This effect is most pronounced at terminal boutons, and is rescued by neuronal expression of Spastin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>If Spastin's function in vivo is to disassemble microtubules, as suggested by our overexpression experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">Figure 7</xref>), why does its absence produce a paradoxical reduction in microtubules within the NMJ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g009">9</xref>)? One possibility is that microtubule severing is required for movement of microtubules into or within the presynaptic region. Some evidence for this idea has been published. In one study, injection of function-blocking anti-Katanin-60 antibody into cultured sympathetic neurons reduced process outgrowth, and microtubules were 4- to 5-fold longer in antibody-injected neurons than in control cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Ahmad1">Ahmad et al. 1999</xref>). More recent work demonstrated that expression of dominant-negative Katanin-60 reduces axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Karabay1">Karabay et al. 2004</xref>). These results were interpreted as indicating that Katanin is required for severing microtubules to a length that allows their transport along the axon to its growing tip. When Katanin is inhibited, microtubule segments may be too long to be efficiently transported, and this results in a reduction in axon outgrowth.</p><p>Based on these findings, we suggest that the depletion of microtubules in the distal boutons of <italic>spastin</italic> mutant NMJs arises because severing of axonal microtubules by Spastin is necessary to generate microtubule polymers that are short enough to be efficiently moved into and through the presynaptic terminals. Perhaps Spastin normally excises sections of microtubules at branchpoints where NMJ branches leave the axon trunk, and these severed microtubule segments (or individual tubulin dimers) are then moved distally into the boutons of the NMJ as it grows.</p><p>Is Spastin also involved in axon outgrowth or guidance, as suggested by its embryonic gain-of-function phenotype (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g003">Figure 3</xref>)? Clearly loss of Spastin activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not strongly affect outgrowth, since the embryonic CNS axon ladder develops in a normal manner and motor axons reach their appropriate targets in <italic>spastin</italic> mutants. Furthermore, axonal and muscle microtubules are not detectably altered in <italic>spastin</italic>-null embryos. Severing of microtubules in vivo, however, may usually involve the actions of multiple severing proteins. In addition to Spastin, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes three AAA ATPases whose AAA domains are closely related to that of vertebrate Katanin-60. These are Katanin-60, CG1193, and an ortholog of mammalian Fidgetins, CG3326 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). None of these proteins have been genetically characterized. Of these four proteins, Spastin is most distant from vertebrate Katanin-60, yet we have shown that Spastin overexpression causes microtubule disassembly in vivo (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that all four fly proteins are microtubule-severing enzymes or proteins that otherwise facilitate disassembly of microtubule networks. Perhaps each is dedicated to severing microtubules in particular cellular and subcellular contexts, and their functions may be partially redundant. If so, generation of severe phenotypes in which microtubule networks are disrupted might require loss of two or more of these AAA ATPases. In mammals, Katanin and Spastin are both expressed in CNS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Wharton1">Wharton et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Karabay1">Karabay et al. 2004</xref>), consistent with the idea that they could have overlapping functions.</p><p>After this manuscript was submitted for initial review, a paper appeared on perturbation of <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>spastin</italic> using transgenic RNAi techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Trotta1">Trotta et al. 2004</xref>).

Our results show that <italic>spastin</italic> is not an essential gene: even <italic>spastin</italic>-null flies can eclose and live for several days, and <italic>spastin</italic> hypomorphs, which would be expected to more closely resemble most RNAi-perturbed flies, eclose at normal rates and have lifespans and behavior that do not greatly differ from wild-type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We also determined that the <italic>17-7</italic> mutation, which removes more than one-third of the coding region, produces no detectable alterations in bouton number or NMJ microtubules and slightly decreases synaptic transmission, while <italic>spastin</italic>-null mutants have more boutons than wild-type larvae, a reduction in NMJ microtubule bundles, and more severely reduced transmission (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g008">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020429-g009">9</xref>).</p><p>In most transgenic RNAi work in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> different transgenic lines yield phenotypes that range from hypomorphic to near-null, and transgenic RNAi does not completely eliminate expression of the target protein (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Billuart1">Billuart et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Kalidas1">Kalidas and Smith 2002</xref>). In the Trotta et al. paper, it is unclear whether more than one transgenic RNAi line was analyzed, but RNAi is described as reducing the level of Spastin protein expression by less than 4-fold. Our findings on Spastin hypomorphic phenotypes imply that such RNAi larvae would not have morphological or microtubule bouton phenotypes and that adult flies would be relatively healthy.

These results suggest that microtubules within the terminals of neurons in the human spinal cord could also be disordered or absent in patients with AD-HSP. The terminals of these neurons might eventually degenerate as a consequence of these microtubule defects, leading to a selective loss of distal axon segments within the spinal cord.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Genetics and molecular biology</title><p>For the overexpression screen, approximately 6,000 new <italic>EP</italic> insertion lines were generated by crossing an X chromosome <italic>EP</italic> line, <italic>EP55,</italic> to a <italic>Sb&#x00394;2-3</italic> transposase line. <italic>EP</italic> insertions on Chromosome II or III were crossed to the pan-neuronal driver line <italic>Elav<sup>C155</sup>-GAL4</italic> and the muscle driver line <italic>24B-GAL4.</italic> Embryos from <italic>EP</italic> lines that exhibited less than 20&#x00025; viability in combination with either driver were immunostained with mAb 1D4.

Mean EJP amplitude was determined by averaging all single EJPs with Axon Instruments Clampfit 8.2, and corrected for nonlinear summation according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-McLachlan1">McLachlan and Martin (1981)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Feeney1">Feeney et al. (1998)</xref>. mEJPs were measured using Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft, Decatur, Georgia, United States). mEJPs with a slow time course arising from neighboring electrically coupled muscle cells were excluded from analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020429-Zhang1">Zhang et al. 1998</xref>). QC for a given NMJ was estimated by dividing the average EJP amplitude by the average mEJP amplitude. Statistics were calculated using one-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4a5"><title>Adult phenotypes</title><p>Eclosion rates were determined by counting numbers of empty versus full (dead) pupae on the sides of bottles in which flies had been allowed to lay for comparable time periods. The flight test assay was performed at room temperature using an opaque cylinder (a 52-cm-tall pipette washer, 18 cm in diameter) coated on the inside with fresh mineral oil. Flies of a given genotype were dumped through a hole in the center of a lid at the top. The cylinder was divided into bins along its height, and the number of flies per bin counted. Flies of different genotypes were age-matched; more than 200 flies were counted for each. The climbing assay was performed on 4&#x02013;5 d old flies maintained individually in vials. Climbing velocity for each fly was measured by transferring it to an empty vial, banging it to the bottom, and then measuring either the time required to reach the top of the vial or the maximum distance it climbed in 30 s, whichever came first. Three trials were performed, and the best speed was used. For lifespan tests, flies were maintained at 25 &#x000b0;C, transferred every 3 d to fresh food vials, and their lifespan noted.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Spastin Expression in Neurons Rescues the <italic>spastin</italic> Mutant Morphology</title><p>Representative muscle 4 NMJs stained with antibodies against Dlg (green) and Syt (magenta) are shown for (A) <italic>spastin<sup>5.75</sup></italic> mutant (genotype &#x0002b;/<italic>CyOKr-GFP; Elav</italic>-<italic>GS</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic>,<italic>spastin<sup>5.75</sup></italic>/<italic>spastin<sup>5.75</sup></italic>), (B) neuronally rescued <italic>(UAS-spastin</italic> /<italic>CyOKr-GFP; Elav-GS-GAL4</italic>,<italic>spastin<sup>5.75</sup></italic>/<italic>spastin<sup>5.75</sup>),</italic> and (C) neuronally overexpressing <italic>(UAS-spastin</italic> /&#x0002b;<italic>; Elav-GS-GAL4</italic>,<italic>spastin<sup>5.75</sup></italic>/<italic>TM3Ser-ActGFP)</italic> larvae.
