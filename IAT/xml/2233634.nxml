The GM-CSF receptor is a heterodimer of the GM-CSF receptor &#x003b1; subunit and the &#x003b2; subunit which is not directly involved in binding GM-CSF. GM-CSF is used clinically in the field of oncology and hematology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Recently we have identified GM-CSF as a neuronal growth factor in the brain which counteracts apoptosis, and reduces infarct size in stroke models in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. GM-CSF has also been identified as a factor involved in arteriogenesis after brain ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. GM-CSF is therefore the third hematopoietic factor after EPO and G-CSF that has functions in the brain.</p><p>GM-CSF has very similar characteristics to G-CSF in the brain in terms of patterns of expression, anti-apoptotic functions, and neuroprotective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. G-CSF has a prominent effect on the neuronal differentiation of adult neural stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We therefore determined whether GM-CSF might have a similar role also on the differentiation of stem cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The GM-CSF receptor alpha is expressed on adult neural stem cells</title><p>The GM-CSF receptor is expressed in a broad variety of brain regions, with a preferentially neuronal expression pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We also detected expression in regions where neural stem cells persist in the adult brain, such as the dentate gyrus. GM-CSFR &#x003b1; was expressed by cells in the subgranular zone, and in cells of the granular layer that are reminiscent of migrating stem cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). We also detected expression of the receptor on adult neural stem cells from the hippocampus, that also stained positive for the stem cell marker nestin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;E</xref>).

To determine if GM-CSF potentially influenced the generation of mature neural cell types we assayed the expression of the neuronal marker genes &#x003b2;-III-tubulin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), the oligodendrocytic marker proteolipid protein (PLP), and the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in adult neural stem cells (NSCs). 3 days after GM-CSF treatment (10 ng/ml) of adult neural stem cells we detected a significant induction of &#x003b2; III-tubulin, and a non-significant elevation of NSE, whereas regulation of PLP or GFAP was not detectable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>GM-CSF induces neuronal differentiation of adult neural stem cells</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, Expression of neural markers in stem cells. 3d after GM-CSF treatment of adult neural stem cells, the upregulation of the neuronal markers &#x003b2; III-tubulin and NSE (neuron specific enolase) was measured by qPCR.

Adult neural stem cells were transfected with the pGL3-p-&#x003b2;III-tubulin reporter vector and stimulated with increasing concentrations of GM-CSF (0.5 &#x02013; 10 ng/ml). We detected a concentration-dependent activation of the &#x003b2; III-tubulin promoter after 48 h of GM-CSF exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

The percentage of MAP-2-positive cells doubled under GM-CSF treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In summary, GM-CSF promoted neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells in vitro.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Recently we uncovered that the hematopoietic factor GM-CSF is also a neuronal growth factor with strong anti-apoptotic actions on neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This characteristic is shared with two other important hematopoietic factors, EPO and G-CSF. On top of these anti-apoptotic properties, both hematopoietic factors also display neurogenic activities. EPO enhances neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], EPO-receptor deficient mice display reduced embryonic neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], mice with a brain-specific knock-down of the EPO receptor show a decrease in stroke-induced neurogenesis and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and exogenously added EPO enhances neurogenesis and behavioural outcome after injury models in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Likewise, the G-CSF receptor is expressed on neural stem cells in the brain and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], G-CSF stimulates neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and treatment of animal injury models with G-CSF enhances neurogenesis and functional recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Positive effects of G-CSF on neurogenesis in an animal model for Alzheimer's disease have also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The multimodal efficacy of these factors, combined with their established safety in other indications, has led to a number of clinical trials in stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. GM-CSF is a likewise attractive candidate for clinical development, because it is clinically in use for a number of years in hematological indications, is anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective in vivo, passes the intact blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and also has a neurogenic potential, likely beneficial for long-term stroke recovery. Further studies need to address issues of functional recovery and neurogenesis in rodent stroke models.</p><p>Presence of the GM-CSF receptor has also been identified on neuroepithelial cells from embryonic mouse brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Addition of GM-CSF at concentrations of 0.05 to 5 &#x003bc;g/ml for 48 h inhibited staurosporine-induced apoptosis, and increased the number and diameter of stem cell colonies. With addition of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml GM-CSF for 48 h the authors report a diminished number of MAP-2 and GFAP-positive cells, indicating a potential negative impact of GM-CSF on (neuronal) differentiation. In general these data from the embryo support our findings on adult neural stem cells, with regard to presence of the receptor on neural stem cells, and anti-apoptotic actions of GM-CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, there is an apparent discrepancy in the role of GM-CSF in differentiation. While it is possible that there is a principle switch in the function of GM-CSF from a more proliferation-enhancing growth factor at the embryonic stage to a differentiation-enhancing factor in adult life, there are a number of important differences between both studies that make final conclusions difficult. The most prominent relate to the concentrations of GM-CSF employed by Kim et al., that appear unphysiologically high for a growth factor (500 ng/ml by Kim et al. vs. 10 ng/ml used in the above experiments). At least for EPO, similar functions on embryonic and adult stem cells have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we have shown that the GM-CSF receptor is expressed on adult neural stem cells, and that GM-CSF induces dose-dependent neuronal differentiation of these cells. This property places GM-CSF together with other hematopoietic factors that have recently been shown to function also as growth factors in the brain. On hematopoietic stem cells, GM-CSF induces the generation and maturation of neutrophilic granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages. A similar role of GM-CSF in hematopoietic and neural differentiation underlines the similarities that exist between the two stem cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It appears that the hematopoietic factors EPO, G-CSF, and GM-CSF have all evolved to serve basic cellular functions such as anti-apoptosis and differentiation in two different body compartments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cultivation of adult neural stem cells (NSCs)</title><p>Neural stem cells were obtained from the hippocampus or subventricular zone of 4&#x02013;6 week old male Wistar rats as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].
