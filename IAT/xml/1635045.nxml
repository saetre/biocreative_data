The interaction of host and pathogen required defense responses in the host, which resulted in the development of the innate immune system. Due to this high selection pressure, pathogens developed strategies to escape or manipulate the host immune defense. <italic>Poxviridae </italic>in particular, evolved several mechanisms for immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The best known members of this family are variola and vaccinia virus. Variola virus is the causative agent of smallpox, and although eradicated in the early 70s, it still represents a serious threat as a possible agent for bioterrorism. Vaccinia virus (VACV) is the prototype poxvirus and is frequently used as a vector for vaccine development. The large double-stranded DNA genome of poxviruses is 130 to 300 kb in size, and although most genomes are completely sequenced, the function of many genes necessary for viral infection, replication and immune evasion are not known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>APOBEC3G is a recently discovered defense mechanism against retroviral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The protein becomes encapsidated into retroviral particles and is transported into the infected cell, where it facilitates deamination of cytosine residues in the single stranded cDNA intermediate during early steps of infection. APOBEC3G has been shown to be an exclusive DNA mutator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The replacement of C with U in the DNA minus strand during reverse transcription leads to G to A transitions in the plus strand. APOBEC3G, therefore, triggers G to A hypermutations in the newly synthesized viral DNA. The inhibition of viral replication is due either to degradation of the cDNA by the DNA repair machinery or to the lethality of the hypermutations.</p><p>In addition to its anti-retroviral function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], APOBEC3G is also able to restrict hepadnaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and its gene family member APOBEC3A inhibits parvovirus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. APOBEC3G is located in the cytoplasm of the cell where it performs its function. VACV undergoes its complete viral life cycle in the cytoplasm, and most poxvirus genomes are relatively A/T-rich, which could be caused by APOBEC3G-induced mutational pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We were, therefore, interested to determine whether APOBEC3G is also a restricting factor for this virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>To assess the impact of APOBEC3G on the VACV life cycle, we used HeLa-APOBEC3G cells which were stably transfected with an APOBEC3GmycHis expression plasmid encoding a Myc- and 6-His-tagged protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Intracellular APOBEC3G expression was confirmed by flow cytometry after staining the cells with a mouse anti-Myc antibody. About 90% of the HeLa-APOBEC3G cells expressed APOBEC3G (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). HeLa-APOBEC3G cells were infected with VACV of the strain Western Reserve (VACV-WR) at an MOI of 0.05. This ensured continuous viral replication and viral spread throughout the cell culture. Cells were harvested and viral titers were determined 0, 24 and 48 h post infection on RK13 cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, there were no differences in viral replication in HeLa-APOBEC3G cells compared to the parental HeLa cells, which do not express APOBEC3G. Titers from VACV-infected HeLa-APOBEC3G cells were even slightly higher at 48 h post infection. This indicates that APOBEC3G has no negative effect on VACV replication. To confirm the results obtained with HeLa cells, we also investigated viral replication in APOBEC3G-expressing 293T cells. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the APOBEC3GmycHis expression plasmid. The transfection efficiency was determined by intracellular APOBEC3G staining with a mouse anti-Myc antibody and flow cytometry. This demonstrated that 59% of the transfected 293T cells expressed APOBEC3GmycHis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). To investigate the replication of VACV, 293T cells and 293T APOBEC3G cells were infected at an MOI of 0.05 and viral titers were measured 0 and 24 h post infections by titration on RK13 cells. Again, the replication of VACV in APOBEC3G-transfected 293T cells was not altered compared to parental 293T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). As a control, to validate the experimental settings, co-transfection of APOBEC3G was used to study its inhibitory effect on retroviral and lentiviral vector transduction. Murine leukemia virus (MLV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-based vector particles were generated by transient transfections of 293T cells. Vector titers were determined by transduction of the green fluorescence protein (GFP)-encoding vector sequences into NIH3T3 cells and the number of GFP-positive cells was monitored by flow cytometry. Vector titers obtained by co-transfection of the empty expression vector were set to 100% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Co-expression of APOBEC3G drastically reduced retroviral and lentiviral vector titers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and validates the co-transfection system as a useful tool to study the effect of APOBEC3 proteins on viral infectivity.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>VACV replication in APOBEC3G-expressing HeLa cells</bold>.

We tested the influence of APOBEC3G, -F and -H, and mouse APOBEC3 on VACV replication by transient transfection of expression plasmids into BHK cells, followed by infection with VACV-WR at an MOI of 0.05. Viral titers were measured 0, 24 and 48 h after infection by titration on RK13 cells. Although the transfection rate was usually around 50%, expression of the APOBEC3 proteins in BHK cells had no influence on VACV replication (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>VACV replication in APOBEC3-transfected BHK cells</bold>.

Therefore, APOBEC3G only restricts Vif-deleted HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Consequently, we asked whether VACV has developed a similar strategy to evade APOBEC3G. To address this issue, we infected HeLa-APOBEC3G cells with VACV at an MOI of 2 to ensure infection of all cells. Cell lysates were obtained 0, 24 and 48 h post infection and analyzed by Western blot with an antibody directed against the 6xHis-tag. VACV infection did not alter APOBEC3G protein levels, nor did it cause a degradation of the protein, which might have resulted in the appearance of smaller bands during the Western blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Equal loading was confirmed by detection of &#x003b2;-actin, and infection was proven by detection of the VACV early protein E3 after stripping the blot. The E3 protein is very stable and can still be detected at late time points of infection. These data suggest that VACV has not developed mechanisms to degrade APOBEC3G and suggests that interference with this protein is not required for VACV replication.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>APOBEC3G protein level is not altered by infection with VACV</bold>. HeLa-APOBEC3G cells were infected with VACV strain WR at an MOI of 2. Cell lysates of infected and uninfected cells were obtained 0, 24 and 48 h post infection. APOBEC3GmycHis expression was analyzed by Western blot with a mouse anti-6xHis antibody (Acris, Hiddenhausen, Germany). After stripping the blot, infection was confirmed with an anti-E3L antibody (generous gift of B. Jacobs) and equal loading with an anti-&#x003b2;-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-3-86-5"/></fig><p>Poxviruses are large cytoplasmic DNA viruses and infection of a cell initiates drastic responses that aim to eliminate virus-infected cells. This innate immune response is able to restrict a multitude of viruses by various strategies. The APOBEC3 gene family contains recently discovered factors that are able to restrict retroviruses, hepadna viruses and parvoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The recently described inhibition of a parvovirus by human APOBEC3A shows that APOBEC proteins also target DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus without passing through an RNA intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The G and F members of the human APOBEC3 family have two highly conserved zinc-binding domains, characteristic of the catalytic domain (CD) of all cytidine deaminases, and trigger G-to-A hypermutations in the newly synthesized viral DNA. The APOBEC3H cytidine deaminases domain, however, is evolutionary distinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In contrast to primates, rodents encode only one APOBEC3 protein. This protein cannot inhibit the murine leukemia virus (MLV) but, like APOBEC3G and -F, it is able to restrict HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Human APOBEC3H is poorly expressed and has no apparent antiretroviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>APOBEC3G, -F and -H, and mouse APOBEC3 are located in the cytoplasm of the cell, the location of poxviral replication. Most poxvirus genomes are relatively A/T-rich which could be a consequence of APOBEC3-induced mutational pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It was, therefore, of interest to analyze whether VACV replication is affected by APOBEC3G. However, we could show that APOBEC3G, -F or -H, or mouse APOBEC3 expression has no effect on VACV replication. A limitation of our experiments might be the lack of a positive control, showing that APOBEC3 still confers an inhibitory function on retroviruses in the context of a VACV infection. However, the experiment is not doable. VACV infection leads to a shut down of cellular protein synthesis, which also inhibits retroviral particle formation. But we were able to show the inhibitory effect of APOBEC3G on retroviral and lentiviral vectors using the same experimental setup which did not result in an inhibition of VACV replication, confirming the significance of the study.</p><p>VACV has a very broad host range <italic>in vitro </italic>and is able to infect virtually all cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Surprisingly, it has been shown recently that VACV tropism in hematopoietic cells is very restricted. Only poor infection of T lymphocytes, which express APOBEC3G, has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, activated T-cells are permissive to VACV and our data support the concept that a receptor that permits VACV entry is missing from resting T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Poxviruses have developed several strategies to evade the innate immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Like HIV, which encodes Vif that induces degradation of APOBEC3G, VACV could encode a protein to overcome APOBEC3G. We investigated the protein levels of APOBEC3G during VACV infection and our results show that infection does not lead to a degradation of the protein. However, it cannot be excluded that VACV has evolved another mechanism to escape inhibition by APOBEC3G.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using transient transfections, we could show that APOBEC3G, -F or -H, or mouse APOBEC3 expression has no effect on VACV replication and VACV infection does not lead to a degradation of the APOBEC3G protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids and transfections</title><p>The following plasmids were used for transfections: pcDNA-APOBEC3G-MycHis encoding a C-terminally Myc-tagged human APOBEC3G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], human APOBEC3F or -H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], or mouse APOBEC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and the empty expression vector pRC-CMV.
