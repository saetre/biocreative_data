The immune system, which plays an important role of immune surveillance in finding and eliminating cancer cells, can influence the development and growth of breast cancer. The central regulator of anti-tumor immune response is mediated by T lymphocyte, whose activation is regulated by co-stimulatory molecules, especially the receptors and ligands in B7-CD28 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>B7-H4 is a recently identified member of B7 family, and conducts a co-inhibitory signal to T cell activation, which can restrain T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion and the development of cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Experiments in vitro show that B7-H4 inhibits T cell activation through restraining IL-2 production and arresting cell cycles of both CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cell, and experiments in vivo also support the function of B7-H4 as an inhibitor to T cell mediated immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. <italic>B7-H4 </italic>mRNA transcriptions are detected extensively in spleen, lung, thymus and other normal tissues, but the proteins are not detectable in these tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In contrast, high levels of B7-H4 protein are expressed in most kinds of tumors, such as breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] showed that the high expression of B7-H4 protein in breast cancer decreased the number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and prevented tumor cells from apoptosis. Therefore, the B7-H4 protein is a negative regulator of the anti-tumor immune response and may play an important role in breast cancer. And in our research, we investigated the association between <italic>B7-H4 </italic>gene polymorphisms and the risk of breast cancer.</p><p>The human <italic>B7-H4 </italic>gene is located on chromosome 1p11.1, and consists of six exons and five introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. There are two types of <italic>B7-H4 </italic>mRNA transcriptions which are ~2.0 kb and ~800 bp. The larger transcription is dominant, and differs from the small one that has part of 3'-untranslating region (UTR) spliced. It is likely that the difference of 3'-UTR between the two transcripts affects the efficiency of B7-H4 protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, <italic>B7-H4 </italic>mRNA transcription is inconsistent with its protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], indicating that B7-H4 expression is tightly controlled at the translational level in peripheral tissues. It has been pointed out that UTRs and introns, especially intron1, can modulate gene expression at many levels, such as the production of stable mRNA, the translational efficiency, the rate of mRNA decay, and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In our study, we detected three polymorphic sites in UTRs and intron1, and established the association between <italic>B7-H4 </italic>gene polymorphisms and the risk of breast cancer in a Chinese Han population of Northeast China.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The blood samples of the cases in our study were provided by the Department of Abdominal Surgery (The Third Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University).

Recently, the determination of genetic polymorphisms provided a new approach to investigate the etiology of such complex genetic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Reports indicate that breast cancer susceptibility and prediction can be influenced by the polymorphism of <italic>cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 </italic>(<italic>CTLA-4</italic>) gene, which encodes a classic molecule offering a co-inhibitory signal to T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Additionally, some other genes encoding novel co-inhibitors, such as <italic>PD-1 </italic>and <italic>B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA)</italic>, are attractive in case-control studies, as candidate genes between the gene polymorphisms and the risk of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. As another co-inhibitory molecule investigated more recently, B7-H4 has shown a potential effect on tumors, by which tumors may escape from an anti-tumor immune response. To elaborate, B7-H4 protein is over expressed in several malignant tumors while is little expressed in normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and its high expression in breast cancer decreased the number of TILs and prevented tumor cells from undergoing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In our case-control study, we chose three potentially functional polymorphisms of <italic>B7-H4</italic>, rs10754339, rs10801935 and re3738414, and firstly detected their association with the risk and prognosis of breast cancer in Chinese Han women. The results indicate that some of the alleles, genotypes and haplotypes of these three SNPs are associated with the risk and prognosis of breast cancer, which will be discussed below respectively. According to our results, in rs10754339, women with the AG genotype and G allele are likely to have an increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.455, 95% CI 1.119-1.892; OR = 1.325, 95%CI 1.073-1.637, respectively), indicating that the rs10754339 G allele maybe plays a risk role in breast cancer. It has been suggested that <italic>B7-H4 </italic>mRNA is widely distributed in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. However, the protein is rarely expressed in normal tissues but highly expressed in many kinds of tumor tissues including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Also, 3'-UTR can regulate gene expression at many different levels, and cis-acting elements of 3'-UTR mediate the stability, degradation, and subcellular localization of mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, rs10754339 located on ESE may regulate the production of mRNA molecules through above mechanism, and G allele may be associated with an increased expression of B7-H4 and then influence the susceptibility of breast cancer. In addition, most tissues contain two types of <italic>B7-H4 </italic>transcriptions which are ~2.0 kb and ~800 bp. The larger one is major and their difference is that the small one has 3'-UTR spliced out partly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Rs10754339 may also be involved in the formation and expression of different types of <italic>B7-H4 </italic>transcriptions.</p><p>In rs10801935, women with the CC genotype are likely to have a decreased risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.328, 95% CI 0.145-0.739), indicating that the rs10801935 CC genotype in intron 1 may be a protective factor in breast cancer. As we know, human gene expression requires transcription controls mediated by the presence of intron sequences, especially, the first intron, which contains various regulatory elements and splicing control elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Mutations occurring in introns can induce the aberrant splicing due to the disruption of the splice site, the splicing enhancers and silencers, or the alteration of the pre-mRNA secondary structure, which results in translational prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Supposed to change the secondary structure of pre-mRNA, rs10801935 can possibly influence B7-H4 translational efficiency by causing deviant splicing, and CC genotype may down-regulate the B7-H4 expression and decrease the breast cancer risk.</p><p>Our research also suggests that women with the AA genotype and the A allele in rs3738414 are less likely to have breast cancer (OR = 0.412, 95% CI 0.203-0.835; OR = 0.698, 95% CI 0.564-0.864, respectively), indicating that the A allele of rs3738414 may have a potentially protective effect on breast cancer. 5'-UTR, upon which a number of DNA binding sites of regulatory factors exist, is important for post-transcriptional modification and translation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Using Pupasview software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the rs3738414 is supposed to be located on ESE, and the mutation of rs3738414 perhaps changes the protein binding pattern, and further affects the B7-H4 expression. Consequently, rs3738414 A allele may reduce the B7-H4 expression and decrease the susceptibility of breast cancer.</p><p>In addition, according to the analysis for the association between <italic>B7-H4 </italic>gene polymorphisms and clinical presentations, we found that the rs10754339 GG genotype was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and PR status, and the G allele and the AG genotype were respectively associated with lymph node metastasis and ER status. However, the other two SNPs in our study were found to be irrelevant to clinicopathologic features. Lymph node involvement, ER and PR status are important in predicting the long-term survival of breast cancer cases. Lymph node metastasis positive cases have higher mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and steroid hormone receptors are valuable as predictive markers of endocrine therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore, rs10754339 may be significant to forecast the prognosis of breast cancer.</p><p>The association between <italic>B7-H4 </italic>gene and breast cancer was further confirmed by the analysis of haplotype. Results suggested that the AAA haplotype showed a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer, whereas GAG haplotype had a contrary outcome (OR = 0.689, 95% CI 0.539-0.881; OR = 1.511, 95% CI 1.125-2.031). To elaborate, the AAA haplotype appears to be a protective factor in breast cancer, but the GAG haplotype may be a risk factor in breast cancer. Furthermore, we found that both AAA and GCG haplotypes had significantly correlations with the clinical presentations. These haplotypes may also be the valuable prognostic factors for survival of breast cancer cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It was observed in our study that polymorphisms of the <italic>B7-H4 </italic>gene may affect the individual breast cancer risk and prognosis in Chinese Han women, which provides the first evidence for the involvement of the human <italic>B7-H4 </italic>gene in breast cancer. The variants of rs10754339, rs10801935 and rs3738414 are probably involved in the risk of breast cancer. Furthermore, rs10754339 may participate in the prognosis of breast cancer. AAA and GAG haplotypes probably influence on the breast cancer risk, and AAA and GCG may participate in the progression of breast cancer. However, studies focusing on new polymorphisms with more samples from other populations as well as the investigation of the basic functions of <italic>B7-H4 </italic>gene mutations remain to be further conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Jie Zhang performed the primer design and wrote the drafts.
