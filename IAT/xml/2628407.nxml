To date, two RNA motifs have been found to mediate FMRP/RNA interaction, the G-quartet and the &#x0201c;kissing complex,&#x0201d; which both induce translational repression in the presence of FMRP. We show here a new role for FMRP as a positive modulator of translation. FMRP specifically binds <italic>Superoxide Dismutase 1</italic> (<italic>Sod1</italic>) mRNA with high affinity through a novel RNA motif, SoSLIP (<italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA Stem Loops Interacting with FMRP), which is folded as three independent stem-loop structures. FMRP induces a structural modification of the SoSLIP motif upon its interaction with it. SoSLIP also behaves as a translational activator whose action is potentiated by the interaction with FMRP. The absence of FMRP results in decreased expression of <italic>Sod1.</italic> Because it has been observed that brain metabolism of <italic>FMR1</italic> null mice is more sensitive to oxidative stress, we propose that the deregulation of <italic>Sod1</italic> expression may be at the basis of several traits of the physiopathology of the Fragile X syndrome, such as anxiety, sleep troubles, and autism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The most common form of inherited mental retardation, Fragile X syndrome, is caused by the absence of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), which can bind mRNA. In mice devoid of FMRP, several hundreds of mRNAs with altered expression and localization have been reported. The impact of these abnormalities is particularly important in the brain, where the absence of FMRP affects the structure and function of connections between neurons, resulting in reduced cognitive abilities. In recent years, scientists studying Fragile X syndrome have focused on identifying the RNAs that are specifically bound by FMRP. We and others have identified two specific RNA structures bound by FMRP/RNA. Importantly, when FMRP binds these structures, the translation of the RNA into its protein product is inhibited. In this new study we have identified a third FMRP-binding RNA structure that is found in the mRNA that encodes superoxide dismutase, an oxidative-stress-mitigating enzyme. Most significantly, FMRP enhances translation of the superoxide dismutase mRNA when it interacts with the structure. These findings suggest that absence of FMRP might result in reduced levels of superoxide dismutase, which in turn leads to increased oxidative stress in the brain. Interestingly, oxidative stress in the brain has already been linked to anxiety, sleeping difficulties, and autism, all of which typically affect individuals with Fragile X syndrome.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein mostly involved in translational repression, may also act as a translational activator of<italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA, suggesting that increased oxidative stress may be involved in the pathophysiology of Fragile X syndrome..</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Bechara EG, Didiot MC, Melko M, Davidovic L, Bensaid M, et al.

An increasing body of evidence suggests that FMRP has a complex function, reflecting its involvement in the control of hundreds of mRNA targets via its different RNA-binding domains. Indeed, FMRP contains two heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K-homology (KH) domains and one arginine-glycine-glycine domain (RGG box) that can mediate protein/RNA interaction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Although specificity of binding for the KH1 domain was not proved, the KH2 domain was shown to specifically bind a category of synthetic aptamers (&#x0201c;kissing complex&#x0201d;), a sequence-specific element within a complex tertiary structure stabilized by Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

Moreover, the ability of FMRP to stabilize the <italic>Post Synaptic Density 95</italic> (<italic>PSD95</italic>) mRNA, by interacting with its 3&#x02032; UTR, was recently reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we show that FMRP interacts with the <italic>Superoxide Dismutase 1</italic> (<italic>Sod1</italic>) mRNA with high specificity and affinity via a novel RNA structure that we named SoSLIP (<italic><underline>So</underline>d1</italic><underline>S</underline>tem <underline>L</underline>oop <underline>I</underline>nteracting with FMR<underline>P</underline>). SoSLIP is organized in a triple stem-loop structure and acts as an FMRP-dependent translational enhancer and as a mild internal ribosome binding site (IRES) in an FMRP-independent manner. The characterization of this novel RNA motif interacting with FMRP sheds new light on the ability of this protein to bind RNA and to improve the translation of SoSLIP-containing mRNAs. Our results, taken together with other recent findings &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, suggest that the deregulation of <italic>Sod1</italic> expression may have an important role in the pathogenetic mechanism of Fragile X syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>FMRP Binds <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA with High Affinity via Its C-Terminal Domain</title><p>With the goal to find novel mRNA structures specifically recognized by FMRP, we performed a systematic analysis of known FMRP mRNA targets, focusing on those that have been shown to interact in vivo with FMRP by the antibody-positioned RNA amplification (APRA) technique &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. First, we excluded the presence of already known structures bound by FMRP in these mRNA targets by screening their capacity to bind a recombinant FMRP in the presence of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, or Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Indeed, K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions stabilize the G-quartet RNA structure, leading to a robust interaction with FMRP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> favors FMRP/kissing complex RNA interaction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. This analysis resulted in the characterization of FMRP/<italic>Sod1</italic> interaction, which takes place in the presence of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) and is not affected by the presence of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), whereas, as expected, Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> affects the binding of FMRP to the N19 sequence that contains the G-quartet present in <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA (nucleotide (nt) 1470&#x02013;1496) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, to definitely exclude the presence of a G-quartet structure in <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA, we performed a reverse transcriptase (RT) elongation reaction assay, as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. In the presence of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, G-quartet RNA is very stable, blocking RT progression at its 3&#x02032; edge and resulting in a truncated transcription product. Conversely, in the presence of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, G-quartet structures are destabilized, and the RT can proceed to the end of the RNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d; . The RT elongation test on <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA did not reveal any K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent stop of the polymerase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000016-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), demonstrating that <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA is not able to form a G-quartet structure. Moreover, FMRP/<italic>Sod1</italic> interaction was not dependent on the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, which is necessary to stabilize the &#x0201c;kissing complex&#x0201d; RNA structure (unpublished data) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together, these findings suggest that FMRP binds to <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA via a novel sequence/structure. We continued the characterization of the FMRP/<italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA interaction by testing the ability of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA to compete for the binding of the FMRP/G-quartet RNA structure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, 5 nM unlabeled <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA competed very efficiently (65&#x00025;) with the previously identified N19 FMRP binding site in a gel-shift assay, whereas a negative control, N8 RNA (corresponding to nt 1&#x02013;654 of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA that does not contain the G-quartet), was not able to compete for the same interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). To precisely define the region of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA interacting with FMRP, we generated three different constructs from <italic>Sod1</italic> encompassing its full-length cDNA: its 5&#x02032; UTR and a portion of its coding region (<italic>Sod1&#x02013;5&#x02032;</italic> region), a central part of the coding region (<italic>Sod1-mid</italic> region), and a fragment overlapping the end of the coding region and the 3&#x02032; UTR (<italic>Sod1&#x02013;3&#x02032;</italic> region) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). RNA sequences corresponding to each fragment were produced and tested for their ability to interact with FMRP. Only the <italic>Sod1&#x02013;5&#x02032;</italic> region (spanning nt &#x02212;70 to &#x0002b;148 of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA) competed with N19 binding to FMRP with the same affinity as the full-length <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA (3 nM concentrations of both cold probes compete for 50&#x00025; of FMRP/N19 binding) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). To identify the sequence of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA that is recognized and bound by FMRP, we employed a site boundary determination method &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. In this experiment, the 3&#x02032;- or 5&#x02032;-end-labeled <italic>Sod1&#x02013;5&#x02032;</italic> RNA was treated by mild alkaline hydrolysis in order to generate a pool of smaller fragments. The RNA fragments retaining the capacity to bind FMRP were selected on immobilized glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-FMRP, as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Bound RNAs were analyzed by electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (not shown). The border positions were at &#x02212;30 and &#x0002b;34 for 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-end-labeled fragments, respectively. This technique allowed us to define a 64-base region spanning both sides of the <italic>Sod1</italic> AUG start codon that is protected by FMRP. We subcloned this sequence, and we synthesized its corresponding RNA, generating the <italic>Sod1&#x02013;64</italic> RNA. This RNA was bound specifically by FMRP, because it was able to compete for the FMRP/<italic>Sod1</italic> full-length mRNA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Interestingly, the FMRP/<italic>Sod1&#x02013;64</italic> interaction is competed for by the N19 G-quartet-containing RNA to the same extent (unpublished data).</p><fig id="pbio-1000016-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>FMRP Specifically Binds <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA</title><p>FMRP binding to <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA is not dependent on K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>.

To determine the secondary structure of <italic>Sod1&#x02013;64</italic> RNA, we probed the structure of this 64-base region in solution, using a panel of chemical and enzymatic modifications, as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000016-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. This technique is based on the reactivity of RNA molecules toward chemicals or enzymes that modify or cleave specific atomic positions in RNA. The probing experiments were performed using unlabeled or radioactively end-labeled in vitro transcribed RNAs (<italic>Sod1&#x02013;5&#x02032;</italic> region), which were subjected to random digestion with RNases T1, T2, and V1 or chemical modifications with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and a carbodiimide derivative (CMCT). RNase T1 cuts after guanine residues in single-stranded regions, RNase T2 cleaves after all single-stranded residues, but preferentially after adenines, whereas RNase V1 cuts at double-stranded or stacked bases. DMS alkylates the N1 position of adenines and the N3 position of cytosines, whereas CMCT modifies the N1 position of guanines and the N3 position of uridines. The sites of cleavage or modification were then identified by primer extension with reverse transcriptase, using a radiolabeled primer complementary to the <italic>Sod1</italic>-5&#x02032; region. Analysis of the resulting cDNAs was performed on sequencing polyacrylamide gels that were run together with the corresponding RNA sequencing ladder to allow identification of the modified residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000016-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).

Interestingly, lead, a probe specific for unpaired nucleotides, flexible regions, and protein binding sites, with no base specificity, revealed protections over this whole area. Because of their extent, these protections indicate a combination of both direct protection from the protein and strengthening of the structure. Noticeably, the hyperreactive positions &#x0002b;26 and &#x0002b;27 in L3 were particularly protected by the protein. A modification of the SoSLIP structure is further indicated by the increases of reactivity observed with V1 cleavages (for example, the (A) base of <italic>Sod1</italic> starting codon AUG and its preceding base (C), as well as the second stem and the more 3' part) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).

Conversely, when SoSLIP is placed upstream of eGFP cDNA, green fluorescence becomes readily detectable. However, in this case, the mean eGFP fluorescence intensity was 5.4-fold less than that when using the strong viral IRES in pPRIG-HA (250 and 1,400 arbitrary units (AUs), respectively)<italic>.</italic> The same result was observed following transfection of the neuroblastoma NG108 cell line, neurons, COS cells, and STEK cells expressing <italic>FMR1</italic> (unpublished data). No differences were observed in the intensity level of GFP fluorescence from the SoSLI-PRIG vector in cells expressing or not expressing FMRP, suggesting that this protein is not required for the mild IRES-like activity of SoSLIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g008">Figure 8</xref>C). Even if FMRP cannot be considered as an IRES translational activating factor, the observation that SoSLIP may act as an IRES-like sequence is important to understand the role of SoSLIP in translational control. To confirm this result, we produced mRNAs encoding luciferase and SoSLIP-Luc carrying or not carrying the cap modification, and we translated in vitro equal amounts of each mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) and in wheat germ extract (WGE).

Here we show that FMRP recognizes <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA via a novel motif, the SoSLIP, organized in three stem loops separated by short sequences. In the absence of FMRP, <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA present in polyribosomes is reduced, and Sod1 protein is less expressed in brains and cell lines from <italic>FMR1</italic> knockout mice, suggesting that Sod1 expression is positively modulated by the interaction between SoSLIP and FMRP. We have shown that the presence of FMRP protects the L2 and L3 loops of the SoSLIP structure. It is clear from our analyses that this interaction promotes structural modifications around the AUG start codon of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA and the more 3&#x02032; end portion of SoSLIP. These structural modifications apparently favor translation. SoSLIP is able to positively modulate the expression of a reporter gene, whose translation is also significantly increased by the presence of FMRP. We generated three mutants, each one impairing the formation of the three stem loops, respectively. All three mutants have a negative impact on the translational effect of SoSLIP. In addition, the absence of FMRP reduces the translational efficiency of the SL2 and SL3 mutants. These findings suggest that when SL2 is mutated the activities of SL1 and SL3 are probably still present, with SL3 activity being abolished in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> null cells. In a similar way, when SL3 is mutated, the activities of SL1 and SL2 are still observable in wild-type cells. These data are consistent with the in vitro binding results, showing an interaction of FMRP with the L2 and L3 loops, and with the finding that in both mutants the FMRP/SoSLIP interaction is reduced but not completely abolished. Interestingly enough, the SL1 mutation does not impair the binding of FMRP to SoSLIP but blocks its activity as a translational enhancer. We propose that the structural alteration due to the disruption of the SL1 stem prevents the conformational changes in SoSLIP structure upon interaction with FMRP that should promote translational activation. In this case, even if FMRP can recognize and bind SL2 and SL3 via the two loop structures, its function is abolished. Alternatively, FMRP needs the interaction with a factor(s) (probably binding to SL1) to carry out its function as an enhancer of translation. Due to the conformational changes of L2 and L3 stems induced by FMRP, we therefore propose that FMRP would facilitate ribosome scanning by participating in the remodelling of the SoSLIP structure, promoting in particular the exposure of the AUG of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA. This function is possibly cooperating with factor(s) binding the SL1 stem loop. Furthermore, our data suggest that the mechanism of action of FMRP is dependent on the type of RNA structure to which it binds. FMRP binds both G-quartet and SoSLIP RNAs through its C-terminal region containing the RGG box, even if in different ion concentrations. For this reason, it is tempting to speculate that in vivo the local ionic environment modulates the RNA binding properties for FMRP and favors the binding of either G-quartet or SoSLIP-containing mRNAs. This possibility might be particularly relevant in the synaptic compartment, because the binding of FMRP to its different mRNA targets might be directly modulated by depolarization.</p><p>In conclusion, SoSLIP can be considered as a &#x0201c;bipartite&#x0201d; translational activator: one domain (SL2 and SL3) acts in an FMRP-dependent-manner; the other (SL1) is independent of the presence of the Fragile X protein. Moreover, we also observed that SoSLIP may act as an IRES-like sequence. We observe that FMRP does not promote and/or influence this additional function of SoSLIP, suggesting that a specific mechanism of translational regulation is probably activated to translate SoSLIP-containing uncapped RNA. These data confirm the complexity of the translational regulation mediated by SoSLIP, and further studies will be necessary to fully understand its mechanism of action. Most important for our study, in this context, the function of FMRP is relevant to positively modulate SoSLIP-containing mRNA synergizing with other factor(s).</p><p>Sod1 is a well-known protein with antioxidant properties.
