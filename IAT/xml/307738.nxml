The human DNA repair gene XPAC corrects this defect in cells isolated from Xeroderma Pigmentosum complementation group A (XP-A) patients. To enable the development of a transgenic mouse model for XP-A by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, we cloned and characterized the mouse homologue of the XPAC gene. The mouse XPAC gene was found to consist of 6 exons, spanning approximately 21 kb. The nucleotide sequence of the exons is identical to that of the also cloned the mouse XPAC cDNA. Furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence of the XPAC protein is the same as the one published previously by Tanaka et al. From CAT assay analysis, the promoter of the XPAC gene appeared to be located within 313 bp upstream of the assumed transcriptional start site. Like the promoters of other eukaryotic DNA repair genes (i.e. ERCC-1 and XPBC/ERCC-3), the mouse XPAC promoter region lacks classical promoter elements like TATA-, GC- and CAAT boxes. However, it contains an unique polypyrimidine-rich box, which is so far only found in genes encoding DNA repair enzymes. The function of this box in the regulation of transcription is still unclear.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0025.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0026.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="12"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0027.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="13"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0028.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="14"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
