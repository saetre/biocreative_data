We have shown previously that inactivation of the hepatic cytochrome P450 system through conditional deletion of POR (P450 oxidoreductase) induces hepatic steatosis, liver growth and P450 expression. We have exploited a new conditional model of POR deletion to investigate the mechanism underlying these changes. We demonstrate that P450 induction, liver growth and hepatic triacylglycerol (triglyceride) homoeostasis are intimately linked and provide evidence that the observed phenotypes result from hepatic accumulation of unsaturated fatty acids, which mediate these phenotypes by activation of the nuclear receptor CAR (constitutive androstane receptor) and, to a lesser degree, PXR (pregnane X receptor). To our knowledge this is the first direct evidence that P450s play a major role in controlling unsaturated fatty acid homoeostasis via CAR. The regulation of P450s involved in xenobiotic metabolism by this mechanism has potentially significant implications for individual responses to drugs and environmental chemicals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)</kwd><kwd>cytochrome P450</kwd><kwd>linoleic acid</kwd><kwd>P450 oxidoreductase (POR)</kwd><kwd>pregnane X receptor (PXR)</kwd><kwd>steatosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor</kwd><kwd>CAR, constitutive androstane receptor</kwd><kwd>Cpt1a, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a</kwd><kwd>CYP, cytochrome P450</kwd><kwd>FAS, fatty acid synthase</kwd><kwd>HRN, hepatic reductase-null</kwd><kwd>i.p., intraperitoneal</kwd><kwd>3MC, 3-methylcholanthrene</kwd><kwd>P450, cytochrome P450</kwd><kwd>PB, phenobarbital</kwd><kwd>POR, P450 oxidoreductase</kwd><kwd>PPAR, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor</kwd><kwd>PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid</kwd><kwd>PXR, pregnane X receptor</kwd><kwd>TCPOBOP, 1,4-bis-[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) play a major role in the metabolism and disposition of chemicals and their activities are critical in determining the efficacy or side effects of drugs. These enzymes also have additional functions in adrenal steroid hormone biosynthesis and the hepatic synthesis of cholesterol and its degradation to bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The P450s involved in these different pathways are distinct and their regulation has conventionally been considered to be by different mechanisms. This is manifest in that many of the hepatic enzymes involved in foreign compound metabolism are expressed constitutively at low levels, but become highly induced on exogenous chemical exposure, resulting in an increased rate of excretion of the compound(s). Significant advances have been made in our understanding of this adaptive response through the identification of transcription factors, such as AhR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor), PXR (pregnane X receptor) and CAR (constitutive androstane receptor), which have the capacity to bind drugs and exogenous chemicals, resulting in transcriptional activation of genes that mediate their detoxification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although distinct classes of compounds bind to each receptor, owing to the diversity of these compounds' chemical structures, promiscuity exists in their specificity, particularly in the case of PXR and CAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>We, and the group of Ding, have reported a mouse model where hepatic P450 activity has been reduced by &#x0003e;95% by the conditional deletion of the <italic>Por</italic> (P450 oxidoreductase) gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This was achieved by crossing mice carrying the <italic>Por</italic> gene flanked by loxP sites with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the rat albumin promoter. This resulted in the specific hepatic deletion of POR neonatally with a concomitant reduction in P450 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although HRN (hepatic reductase-null) mice developed normally and were fertile, there were a number of intriguing phenotypic changes, including an enlarged liver and hepatic steatosis. Also, there was a profound increase in the expression of a range of P450s, with the most marked changes being in the expression of CYP2B10 (CYP is cytochrome P450) and CYP3A11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These enzymes, which are expressed at low levels in untreated animals, are highly inducible by exogenous chemicals such as barbiturates and synthetic glucocorticoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These data show that the P450 system is a key regulator of hepatic lipid homoeostasis and liver growth and that this metabolic homoeostasis can have a profound effect on the control of P450 gene expression and, as a consequence, on the metabolism/deposition of drugs. The HRN mouse therefore provides a model for investigating the endogenous factors involved in regulating P450 genes and the role of the P450 system in controlling hepatic steatosis and liver growth.</p><p>Studies of the temporal events that lead to the hepatic phenotype are, however, not possible in the HRN mice because the deletion of the <italic>Por</italic> gene occurs neonatally. To overcome this, we have created a model where the HRN genotype is regulated conditionally and in an inducible manner. This was achieved by crossing <italic>Por</italic>-floxed mice with mice where Cre recombinase is conditionally regulated by the rat <italic>Cyp1a1</italic> promoter. This promoter is activated through the AhR, and administration of a single dose of 3MC (3-methlycholanthrene) at 40&#x000a0;mg/kg results in a specific, time-dependent, hepatic deletion of POR and a phenotype identical with that observed in HRN mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we have used the new model to study the temporal biochemical changes that control lipid accumulation and P450 overexpression. We provide evidence that dietary unsaturated fatty acids play a key role in both lipid accumulation and P450 induction. Also, using nuclear receptor/HRN double- and triple-knockout mice, we show that P450 overexpression occurs predominantly through the activation of CAR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>All chemicals were purchased from Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich, except where indicated.</p></sec><sec><title>Production of transgenic mice</title><p><italic>Por</italic><sup><italic>lox</italic>/<italic>lox</italic></sup>/<italic>Cre</italic><sup><italic>Alb</italic></sup> (HRN) and <italic>Por</italic><sup><italic>lox</italic>/<italic>lox</italic></sup>/<italic>Cre</italic><sup><italic>CYP1A1</italic></sup> mice on a C57/BL6 genetic background were generated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Treatment with a single dose of 3MC (40&#x000a0;mg/kg) led to a time-dependent complete deletion of the hepatic POR and the development of a phenotype that was identical with that of the original HRN model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We therefore used this model to study the sequential development of the HRN phenotypic traits over a 28&#x000a0;day period following 3MC treatment.</p><p>At 6&#x000a0;days after 3MC administration a &#x0003e;85% reduction in the expression of POR protein, determined both by immunoblotting and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> activity, had occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B, i), increasing to approx. 96% by day 14. These data were confirmed by immunohistochemistry where staining was reduced in all hepatocytes by day 3 and undetectable on day 14 and remained absent for at least 28&#x000a0;days (results not shown). Treatment with 3MC resulted in the anticipated induction of CYP1A1 as a consequence of the activation of the AhR. By days 7&#x02013;9, CYP1A1 levels, presumably due to the metabolism and elimination of 3MC, were undetectable, indicating that the level of CYP1A1 was not induced by the POR deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The transient changes observed in CYP1A1 expression imply that Cre recombinase expression would follow the same pattern and suggest that the deletion of POR is reversible. Cre recombinase is indeed expressed transiently, similarly to CYP1A1; however, return of POR is dependent on cell turnover, which, in the case of hepatocytes, takes several weeks. In <italic>Por</italic><sup><italic>lox</italic>/<italic>lox</italic></sup>/<italic>Cre</italic><sup><italic>CYP1A1</italic></sup> mice, no return of POR was observed for 60&#x000a0;days after 3MC treatment (results not shown). In contrast, very marked increases in the expression of other P450s were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP3A and CYP7A1 levels increased profoundly as a function of time and in association with the decrease in POR expression.

Interestingly, a stepwise increase in the level of CYP2B proteins occurred between days 9 and 11, whereas the increase in CYP2C and CYP3A proteins appeared to occur more gradually.

The increases in CYP2B10 protein and mRNA were not correlated with the decrease in POR activity (Supplementary Figure S1A, i and ii, at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170043add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170043add.htm</ext-link>) and therefore did not appear to be due to changes in the metabolism of an endogenous inducing agent. However, CYP2B10 protein and mRNA levels were correlated with each other, indicating that the induction of the <italic>Cyp2b10</italic> gene occurs mainly at a transcriptional level (Supplementary Figure S1A, iii). In addition, <italic>Cyp2b10</italic> mRNA levels were correlated with hepatic triacylglycerol concentration (Supplementary Figure S1A, iv). Similar analysis for CYP3A11 indicated that the increased protein expression occurred more rapidly than for CYP2B10, steadily increasing from day 2, reaching a maximum by day 21, but also did not directly correlate with changes in POR activity (Figure S1B). Although <italic>Cyp3a11</italic> mRNA levels were increased in POR mice, this did not correlate with the level of CYP3A11 protein, indicating a more complex mechanism of regulation of this gene (Supplementary Figure S1B, iii), possibly involving both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. Unlike <italic>Cyp2b10</italic>, only a weak correlation between the increases in <italic>Cyp3a11</italic> mRNA levels and hepatic triacylglycerol levels was observed (Supplementary Figure S1B, iv). Thus differences observed in the induction kinetics of CYP2B10 and CYP3A11, at both the protein and the mRNA level, suggests that the mechanisms regulating their overexpression are, at least in part, distinguishable.</p><p>To determine the contributions of lipid uptake, oxidation and synthesis to the development of the fatty liver phenotype and the induction of P450s, changes in the expression levels of CD36, FAS and Cpt1a were determined in 3MC-treated <italic>Por</italic><sup><italic>lox</italic>/<italic>lox</italic></sup>/<italic>Cre</italic><sup><italic>CYP1A1</italic></sup> mice compared with <italic>Por</italic><sup><italic>lox</italic>/<italic>lox</italic></sup> mice (Supplementary Figure S2 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170043add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170043add.htm</ext-link>). No significant changes in the expression levels of these genes were observed, except for in Cpt1a on day 28 which showed a minor, but significant, increase and may possibly be an attempt to reverse lipid accumulation by increasing &#x003b2;-oxidation.

They therefore do not appear to contribute to the lipid accumulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Dietary fatty acids mediate P450 induction in HRN mice</title><p>In view of the finding that changes in hepatic fatty acid homoeostasis correlated with the increases in P450 expression, detailed fatty acid analysis was carried out on livers from HRN and <italic>Por</italic><sup><italic>lox</italic>/<italic>lox</italic></sup> (control) mice (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170043add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/417/bj4170043add.htm</ext-link>). Changes in all fatty acid classes occurred; however, the most significant changes were in mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (Supplementary Table S5), with C<sub>16:1</sub>, C<sub>18:1</sub> and C<sub>20:3</sub> increasing 6.78-, 14.06- and 6.19-fold respectively (Supplementary Table S4). These data are in close agreement with the report of Weng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], who, for their HRN model, reported additional fold changes of 7.3 and 14.9 for C<sub>18:3</sub> and C<sub>20:1</sub> unsaturated fatty acids respectively. Together, these findings suggest that the accumulated hepatic triacylglycerols preferentially contain unsaturated fatty acid chains and that these fatty acid classes may mediate the P450 induction.</p><p>In the light of this possibility, <italic>Por</italic><sup><italic>lox</italic>/<italic>lox</italic></sup>/<italic>Cre</italic><sup><italic>CYP1A1</italic></sup> mice were placed on a fat-deficient diet for 4&#x000a0;weeks before 3MC administration.

Maintenance of control <italic>Por</italic><sup><italic>lox</italic>/<italic>lox</italic></sup> mice on a fat-deficient diet caused slight reductions in the constitutive expression of CYP7A and CYP2C protein, and did not affect the levels of the other P450s (results not shown).

These data indicate that hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation in POR mice originates from the diet and that as a consequence of the inactivation of the P450 system an inability to maintain hepatic lipid homoeostasis occurs which triggers increased P450 expression (possibly in an attempt to restore normal hepatic lipid levels). It is worth noting that the fat-deficient diet also prevented the liver enlargement seen on POR deletion, thus providing a metabolic link to all three phenomena.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Development of phenotypic changes in conditional HRN mice on restricted fatty acid diets</title><p><italic>Por</italic><sup><italic>lox</italic>/<italic>lox</italic></sup>/<italic>Cre</italic><sup><italic>CYP1A1</italic></sup> mice were maintained on a control diet until 8&#x000a0;weeks of age, and then either placed on a fat-deficient or fatty-acid-supplemented diet, or continued on the control diet, for a further 6&#x000a0;weeks.

In addition, no significant increases in liver/body weight ratio were observed for the diets used, except that containing sunflower oils (Supplementary Figure S3C). These data indicate that lipid accumulation alone was not the cause of liver enlargement, but that unsaturated fatty acids had the capacity to induce the effect. Comparison of the fatty acid composition of the diets (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3), identified C<sub>18:2</sub> (linoleic acid), an <italic>n</italic>&#x02212;6 PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid), as a candidate fatty acid mediator of both P450 induction and liver growth as it was the only fatty acid present in the diets that correlated with the effects observed.

It is also the major tissue responsible for drug and dietary chemical detoxification through the actions of phase I and phase II drug metabolism in which the P450 system plays a pivotal role. Although it has been known for some time that alterations in diet and disease states such as diabetes affect the P450 system, there has been little evidence that P450s can play a direct role in metabolic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, there is a growing body of evidence, as demonstrated in the present paper, that these pathways are intimately linked. This has a wide range of implications not only for how alterations in P450 function may influence the pathogenesis of disease, but also for how diet and disease states may influence the metabolism and disposition of drugs and environmental agents; for example, obesity in rats has been shown to reduce expression levels of CAR and impaired CYP2B induction by PB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The metabolic dialogue between the pathways of detoxification and metabolic homoeostasis are manifest in the findings that, when the P450 system is inactivated, profound changes in lipid homoeostasis and liver size occur which are paralleled by the marked induction of P450s associated with drug metabolism in the absence of an exogenous inducing agent. We have demonstrated that P450s from a range of gene families are induced and that this induction parallels the accumulation of hepatic triacylglycerols. We have also shown that the regulation of different P450s is, in part, distinguishable, as exemplified by CYP2B10 and CYP3A11. CYP2B10 induction is almost entirely controlled at the transcriptional level and occurs at a time point when there is a stepwise increase in triacylglycerol accumulation, whereas, in the case of CYP3A11, there is only a poor correlation between mRNA induction and protein levels, indicating that both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms are involved. The latter mechanism could possibly occur via phosphorylation or ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This may also be the case for CYP2C proteins. Evidence for distinct pathways of regulation is also reflected in the finding that the overexpression of these proteins is, at least in part, mediated by different transcription factors (see below). We have also demonstrated that hepatic steatosis is not sufficient to induce the hepatic P450 expression, but this effect is mediated by dietary unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, which we have found is sufficient on its own to reverse the fat-deficient phenotype.</p><p>P450s of the CYP2B family are the major enzymes induced in the liver by barbiturate drugs such as PB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and have the capacity to metabolize fatty acids such as arachidonic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Interestingly, Fulco and co-workers demonstrated over 20&#x000a0;years ago that a fatty acid mono-oxygenase involved in fatty acid oxidation in <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic> is highly inducible by PB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In fact, studies on this pathway have demonstrated that its induction provides an adaptive response against unsaturated fatty acid toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Whether the induction of enzymes such as CYP2B10 and CYP3A11 in mammals are part of a similar detoxification pathway against dietary unsaturated fatty acids which are not produced endogenously, such as linoleic acid, remains to be determined. However the data in the present study do raise the possibility that, under certain circumstances, diets containing unsaturated fatty acids may influence hepatic detoxification systems.</p><p>A wide range of transcription factors have now been discovered which control fatty acid homoeostasis and liver growth, including PPAR&#x003b1;, CAR, PXR, LXR (liver X receptor) and HNF4&#x003b1; (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. For example, it has been demonstrated that PPAR&#x003b1; mediates liver growth induced by perturbations in fatty acid homoeostasis as a consequence of peroxisome proliferation and that PXR plays a role in controlling hepatic triacylglycerol homoeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. It was therefore intriguing that the majority of the phenotypes resulting from inactivation of the hepatic P450 system and the downstream effects on fatty acid homoeostasis were mediated by the transcription factor CAR. It has been postulated for some time that CAR function is regulated by both endogenous and exogenous inducing agents including metabolic control through AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], interaction with the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 (forkhead box O1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and activation during fasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. It has also been postulated that CAR function can be modulated by the fatty-acid-sensitive transcription factor PPAR&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, this mechanism of CAR activation would not appear to explain the hepatic phenotype, as no changes in CAR expression were found and also linoleic acid activated CAR directly. However, to our knowledge, the finding that CAR may play a role in linking the control of hepatic lipid homoeostasis and endogenous P450 expression has not been reported previously. We provide additional evidence that, for one group of enzymes in the <italic>Cyp3a</italic> gene family, PXR may also play a role in defining the response to unsaturated fatty acids. The finding that feeding conditional HRN mice a fat-deficient diet prevents the induction of CYP3A11 suggests that fatty acids, as well as bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], can influence PXR function.</p><p>A possible pathway linking P450 function to the findings observed in the present study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. As described in this model, dietary unsaturated fatty acids enter the liver via fatty acid transporters, where, in wild-type mice, they are oxidized for energy purposes or detoxified by P450s. Inactivation of the P450 system as a result of <italic>Por</italic> deletion leads to hepatic accumulation of unsaturated fatty acids initially via increase import due to the induction of lipid transporters such as CD36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and a reduction of plasma lipid levels. Hepatic lipid accumulation triggers the activation of the nuclear receptor CAR (and possibly PXR), leading to P450 induction and liver growth through the activation of other downstream growth/transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The overexpression of P450s is aimed at re-establishing hepatic lipid homoeostasis and the prevention of toxicity via increased metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids. Inactivation of POR prevents this increased metabolism and ultimately leads to hepatic steatosis, which establishes a cyclical process that promotes further hepatic lipid accumulation and growth. The ability to control the hepatic deletion of POR conditionally using the CYP1A1&#x02013;Cre system has allowed us to provide evidence in support of this pathway. Activation of Cre through the administration of 3MC resulted in the rapid deletion of POR, in that over 85% of hepatocytes did not express the protein after 6&#x000a0;days. Although accumulation of lipid was already occurring at this time point, there appears to be a threshold at which point the CAR pathway becomes activated. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that it was only after 9&#x02013;11&#x000a0;days that a marked change in triacylglycerol accumulation occurred which was linked directly to changes in plasma lipids, liver growth and P450 induction. Loss of P450 activity itself was not responsible for its auto-induction (although the corresponding accumulation of a metabolite produced, e.g. a bile acid precursor, which binds to CYP3A11 could explain the stabilization of this protein). Whether the inactivation of the P450 system causes the triacylglycerol accumulation and liver growth and whether their induction is to attenuate the phenotypic changes produced remains uncertain; however, it is quite clear that the accumulation of hepatic triacylglycerols activates CAR. The demonstration of cross-talk between drugs and lipids on CAR implies that there will be drug&#x02013;lipid interactions associated with effects on this receptor and evidence for this is provided by the work of Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], who showed that PUFAs could influence the induction of P450 genes by PB. Why the HRN phenotype results in the reduction in circulating triacylglycerols and cholesterol remains to be established. It is interesting to note, however, that the cholesterol 7&#x003b1;-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP7A1) involved in bile acid homoeostasis also appears to be affected by unsaturated fatty acid levels in a CAR-dependent manner and possibly a PXR-dependent manner, as suggested by the opposing effects on this protein's expression observed in <italic>Car</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Pxr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/<italic>Car</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/HRN mice. The effect observed here on this enzyme's expression is intriguing as a previous report suggested that CAR activation represses CYP7A1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The contrasting results may be a consequence of the fact that fasted, as opposed to non-fasted, animals were used in the study of Miao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Despite this, these data suggest the existence of a new pathway for the dietary regulation of CYP7A1 by unsaturated fatty acids.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the phenotypic changes that occur in HRN mouse models</title><p>Dietary unsaturated fatty acids enter the liver via fatty acid transporters where they are oxidized for energy purposes or detoxified by P450s.

Inactivation of POR prevents this increased metabolism and ultimately leads to hepatic steatosis. The development of steatosis establishes a cyclical process that potentiates hepatic lipid accumulation and growth. The adverse effect of P450 induction is altered drug metabolism and environmental chemical detoxification, but, in addition, the increased production of oxidized lipids could result in development of oxidative stress.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bic221i007"/></fig><p>In summary, we have used a novel conditional HRN model to investigate the sequential development of the phenotypic changes observed in mice on deletion of POR. POR deletion and the associated inactivation of hepatic P450 function leads to accumulation of dietary fatty acids in the liver, in the form of triacylglycerols of unsaturated fatty acids, leading to organ enlargement and increased P450 expression, in the case of CYP2B, CYP2C and CYP7A1 via a CAR-dependent signalling pathway. The molecular mechanism underlying CYP3A11 expression appears to involve CAR, PXR and protein stabilization. Induction of the P450 system appears to be mediated by the accumulation of PUFAs, such as linoleic acid (C<sub>18:2,<italic>n</italic>&#x02212;6</sub>) and suggests that this may be part of an adaptive response to prevent the deleterious effects of PUFA accumulation. The finding that the major P450s that are inducible by exogenous chemicals are also regulated by changes in fatty acid homoeostasis has potentially significant implications for the variability observed in drug responses in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Online data</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" content-type="local-data" position="float" xlink:type="simple"><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bj4170043add.pdf" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Steven Kliewer for his gift of <italic>Pxr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Car</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and Dr Alexander Hill for carrying out the hepatic fatty acid analysis.
