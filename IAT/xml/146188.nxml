The loop region of this mRNA hairpin has been shown to bind to the special elongation factor SELB, which also forms a complex with selenocysteinyl-tRNA(Sec) and GTP. We designed seven different mRNA constructs derived from the fdhF mRNA which contain a translation initiation region including an AUG initiation codon followed by no, one, two, three, four, five or six UUC phenylalanine codon(s) and the UGA selenocysteine codon 5' adjacent to the fdhF mRNA hairpin. By binding these different mRNA constructs to 30S ribosomal subunits in vitro we attempted to mimic intermediate steps of elongation of a structured mRNA approaching the ribosome by one codon at a time. Toeprint analysis of the mRNA-ribosome complexes showed that the presence of the fdhF mRNA hairpin strongly interferes with binding of the fdhF mRNA to 30S ribosomal subunits as soon as the hairpin is placed closer than 16 bases to the ribosomal P-site. Binding is reduced up to 25-fold compared with mRNA constructs where the hairpin is located outside the ribosomal mRNA track. Surprisingly, no toeprint signals were observed in any of our mRNA constructs when tRNA(Sec) was used instead of tRNA(fMet). Lack of binding of selenocysteinyl-tRNA(Sec) to the UGA codon was attributed to steric hindrance by the fdhF mRNA hairpin. By chemical probing of the shortest mRNA construct (AUG-UGA-fdhF hairpin) bound to 30S ribosomal subunits we demonstrate that the hairpin structure is not unfolded in the presence of ribosomes in vitro; also, this mRNA is not translated in vivo when fused in-frame 5' of the lacZ gene. Therefore, our data indicate that the fdhF mRNA hairpin has to be unfolded during elongation prior to entering the ribosomal mRNA track and we propose that the SELB binding domain within the fdhF mRNA is located outside the ribosomal mRNA track during decoding of the UGA selenocysteine codon by the SELB-selenocysteinyl-tRNA(Sec)-GTP complex.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
