This protein is involved in various aspects of ribosome biogenesis from transcription regulation to the assembly of pre-ribosomal particles; however, many reports suggest that it could also play an important role in non nucleolar functions. To explore nucleolin function in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation we used siRNA to down regulate the expression of nucleolin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that, in addition to the expected effects on pre-ribosomal RNA accumulation and nucleolar structure, the absence of nucleolin results in a cell growth arrest, accumulation in G2, and an increase of apoptosis. Numerous nuclear alterations, including the presence of micronuclei, multiple nuclei or large nuclei are also observed. In addition, a large number of mitotic cells showed a defect in the control of centrosome duplication, as indicated by the presence of more than 2 centrosomes per cell associated with a multipolar spindle structure in the absence of nucleolin. This phenotype is very similar to that obtained with the inactivation of another nucleolar protein, B23.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings uncovered a new role for nucleolin in cell division, and highlight the importance of nucleolar proteins for centrosome duplication.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>There is increasing evidence that nucleoli play important roles in the regulation of many fundamental cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, telomerase production, RNA processing, monitoring and response to cellular stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These multiple functions can be achieved by the transient localization of several hundred proteins within the nucleolar structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, several well known nucleolar proteins seem to have multiple functions. Amongst them, the abundant nucleolar proteins nucleophosmin (B23) and nucleolin (C23) have been the subject of numerous studies.</p><p>Although nucleophosmin and nucleolin do not share any structural homology, they seem to have numerous functions in common. The predominant location of these proteins in the nucleolus strongly suggested that they could be involved in ribosome biogenesis. Both proteins interact with nucleic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and could be viewed as ribosome assembly factors. Despite the fact that endoribonuclease and molecular chaperone activities have been reported for nucleophosmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], its contribution to ribosome biogenesis is still unclear. The function of nucleolin in ribosome biogenesis has been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Its interaction with ribosomal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and with specific pre-rRNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and its implication in the first step of pre-rRNA maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], also suggest that nucleolin could be an important ribosome assembly factor. In addition, nucleolin seems to be involved in the control of pre-rRNA accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Several observations suggest that nucleolin is also a major actor in promoting cell proliferation. Nucleolin levels are higher in tumours and actively dividing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and are widely used as a marker of cell proliferation. Furthermore, overexpression of nucleolin cooperates with oncogenic mutant Ras in a rat embryonic fibroblast transformation assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Nucleolin seems to be able to affect ribosomal RNA gene expression in different ways. A strong link between nucleolin phosphorylation, proteolysis and the production of ribosomal RNA has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The inhibition of nucleolin proteolysis leads to lower rRNA transcription in an <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], while the injection of nucleolin antiserum leads to 2&#x02013;3.5 fold stimulation of pre-rRNA synthesis in <italic>Chironomus tentans </italic>salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Injection of a 2&#x02013;4 fold excess of nucleolin in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>stage IV oocytes also leads to a significant reduction in the accumulation of 40 S pre-RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that nucleolin phosphorylation can be triggered by a variety of stimuli such as androgens and growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and that this phosphorylation is invariably accompanied by increased rRNA transcription and cell proliferation.</p><p>In addition to nucleolar functions, nucleophosmin and nucleolin seems to share additional functions. Both proteins are histone chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and appear to be involved in different aspects of DNA metabolism and chromatin regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Nucleophosmin is also directly implicated in cancer pathogenesis, as the NPM1 gene is found mutated and rearranged in a number of haematological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Nucleophosmin is essential for mouse embryonic development, as the inactivation of the Npm1 gene leads to unrestricted centrosome duplication and genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. It has been proposed that during mitosis, nucleophosmin associates with duplicated centrosomes and prevents their reduplication until the G1/S phase, when it dissociates from them after phosphorylation by Cdk2/E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Wang et al. further showed that the centrosomal association of nucleophosmin relies on the Ran-Crm1 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Although nucleolin has not previously been shown to be involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication, it is interesting to note that nucleophosmin interacts directly with nucleolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and that a nucleolin-like protein, together with other nucleolar proteins, has been found associated with centrosomal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>To determine the function of nucleolin in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation we used siRNA to knock down nucleolin expression. We found that nucleolin is not only required for cell proliferation, but that its down regulation also leads to unrestricted centrosome duplication, as described for the inactivation of nucleophosmin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Nucleolin is required for nucleolar structure formation</title><p>Nucleolin is highly expressed in proliferating cells, and is believed to be important for cell growth. In order to study the role of nucleolin in cell proliferation, we tested different siRNA for their ability to significantly decrease the amount of nucleolin in human cells. Preliminary experiments with 4 different siRNA sequences directed against distinct domains of nucleolin and 2 siRNA controls (See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) were performed and allowed us to select the best siRNA duplexes able to induce a significant decrease of nucleolin expression. Of these 4 siRNA, two significantly reduced nucleolin protein levels (#2 and #4, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Neither one of the 2 control siRNA was able to significantly reduce the level of nucleolin protein. A mixture of siRNA #2 and #4 were transfected in HeLa cells or in a primary culture of human fibroblast, followed by time course kinetics of nucleolin expression inhibition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). In both HeLa cells and human primary fibroblasts, the level of nucleolin protein started to decrease 2 days after siRNA transfection to reach a minimum after 4&#x02013;5 days, corresponding to a decrease of about 80% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Interestingly, the level of B23 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and fibrillarin (data not shown), other abundant nucleolar proteins, was not affected by the decreased nucleolin expression. This lower level of protein expression was perfectly correlated with a decrease in nucleolin coding mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Nucleolin mRNA levels remained low for at least 4 days. The decrease in nucleolin protein levels was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells transfected with nucleolin siRNA (mix of #2 and #4) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, panel B) compared to control cells transfected with the scrambled siRNA (#1). In addition, these microscopic observations also indicated an important morphological modification of nuclei that expressed low levels of nucleolin. These nuclei appeared bigger and more rounded with a single large nucleolar body (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, panels B1 to B3) compared to cells transfected with the siRNA control #1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, panel A).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>siRNA &#x02013; mediated down regulation of nucleolin</bold>. A. Western blots of nucleolin protein in untransfected control cells, mock (transfected with siRNA control #1) and siRNA against nucleolin (mix siRNA #2 and #4) treated cells. At the indicated times, HeLa and human primary fibroblast cells were harvested and protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-nucleolin antibody. Equal loading was verified using anti-tubulin antibodies. The amount of B23 protein was also analyzed using anti-B23 antibodies. B. Quantification of the Western blots. Data were normalized to the tubulin protein. The normalized nucleolin protein level was set to 100% in control cells. Data are from three independent experiments. C. Quantitative RT-PCR. At indicated times after transfection, HeLa and human primary fibroblast cells were harvested, total RNA was isolated and used for cDNA synthesis and quantitative PCR with nucleolin or cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-actin specific primers. Data were normalized to the amount of &#x003b2;-actin mRNA. Untransfected control and scrambled (transfected with scrambled siRNA) cells were also used and all data were normalized to the amount of nucleolin mRNA in control cells. Data are from three independent experiments. D. Immunofluorescence analysis. Four days after siRNA transfection (control scrambled siRNA #1, panels A, or mix of siRNA #2 and #4 panels B), HeLa cells were examined by immunofluorescence using anti-nucleolin antibody in green. DNA was counterstained with DAPI (Blue).

As seen by electron microcopy, the nucleolus consists of three main components, designated fibrillar centers (FC), dense fibrillar components (DFC), and granular components (GC). Ribosomal RNA genes are localized in the FC, pre-rRNA resides in the DFC, while late processing steps of ribosome biogenesis are found in GC. In untransfected control and in scrambled siRNA transfected cells, FC is found in the center of the nucleolar structure, surrounded by the DFC. The DFC is in turn surrounded by GC, which fills out the peripheral parts of the nucleolus (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, a-untransfected control). Nucleolin is usually found in the DFC and GC of nucleoli, UBF (Upstream Binding Factor) in the FC, and fibrillarin in the DFC. Electron microscopy analysis of control and siRNA transfected cells revealed a profound modification of the different nucleolar compartments in absence of nucleolin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, panels c and d), associated with an apparent increase of the nucleolar volume. Fibrillar centers and dense fibrillar centers were observed at the periphery of the granular component, and a complete segregation of these compartments could even be observed at later time points following transfection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, panel d). This reorganization of the nucleolar compartment was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of nucleolin, UBF and fibrillarin in cells transfected with a control scrambled siRNA, and in nucleolin depleted cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>). In interphase control cells, UBF was mainly present in foci that probably correspond to the internally localized FC, whereas nucleolin labeled nucleolar peripheric structures corresponding to DFC and GC. Interestingly, in nucleolin depleted cells, UBF no longer appeared as foci, but as ring-like structures surrounding the DAPI depleted regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This staining could correspond to the delocalized FC observed by electron microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, c&#x02013;d</xref>). In contrast, the localization of fibrillarin does not seem to be affected in nucleolin depleted HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This segregation of nucleolar compartments was also found when cells were treated with low amounts of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of polymerase I transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. To determine if the lower expression of nucleolin led to a lower accumulation of pre-ribosomal RNA, cells were collected at different times after siRNA transfection, and the 45S pre-rRNA analyzed by northern blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) or quantitative RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Using these two techniques, we found that nucleolin depletion leads to a 5&#x02013;6 fold reduction of 45S accumulation, as expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The nucleolar structure is disrupted in nucleolin depleted cells</bold>.

Total RNA was extracted at different days after transfection and used for northern blot analysis (D) or quantitative RT-PCR (E). For the northen blot, an oligonucleotide complementary to the 5'ETS was used as a probe. The blot was also hybridized with a probe specific for &#x003b2; actin to normalize the data. Ethidium bromide staining (18S-EtBr) of the gel before transfer is also shown to show RNA integrity and equal loading of RNA (E). The normalized data of the northern blots are shown, together with the data of the quantitative RT-PCR, and with the amount of nucleolin protein present in these cells as determined by nucleolin western blot (not shown).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-8-66-2"/></fig><p>Nucleolin has been implicated <italic>in vitro </italic>in the first processing step of pre-rRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It was therefore interesting to determine if down-regulation of nucleolin was able to modify the efficiency of this processing step <italic>in vivo</italic>. Analysis of the efficacy of this first processing step in HeLa cells did not allow us to detect significant changes in the level of cleavage within the 5'ETS upon nucleolin depletion (data not shown). In addition, the general pattern of pre-rRNA processing did not seem to be altered. The low level of remaining nucleolin might be sufficient to allow for correct processing. Furthermore, since this primary processing step within the 5'ETS cleavage is not complete in these cells, and it is not known how it is regulated when polymerase I transcription is inhibited, it might be difficult in this experimental system, to detect the effect of nucleolin depletion on this cleavage.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleolin regulates cell proliferation and cell cycle progression</title><p>To determine if nucleolin depletion affects cell proliferation, the growth rate of these cells was measured and compared to that of cells transfected with scrambled siRNA and untransfected control cells. This was achieved by counting cells at different time points after transfection of siRNA #2 and #4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). As soon as the level of nucleolin protein decreased (second day after transfection, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), the number of cells increased more slowly and was almost steady compared to untransfected cells or to cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA, suggesting that cell growth was affected by low nucleolin amount. To determine if cell growth was blocked at a specific phase of the cell cycle, flow cytometry analysis (FACS) was performed on siRNA transfected and control HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Transfection of control siRNA did not change the cell cycle profile of HeLa cells (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), whereas transfection of the mix of siRNA #2 and #4 significantly altered the cell cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). During nucleolin time-course depletion, cell cycle analysis showed a progressive and significant decrease in the cell population with a 2n DNA content (G1: 53% in untranfected population to 37.9% in population transfected for 3 days to 23% in population tranfected for 5 days, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), whereas a progressive and significant increase was observed in the population with a 4n DNA content (G2/M: 7% in untranfected population to 16.2% in population transfected for 3 days to 19% in population tranfected for 5 days, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Based on this cell cycle analysis, the number of cells in S phase was approximately unchanged (36.5% to 35.4% to 34.7%, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The stability of the S-phase population upon nucleolin depletion was confirmed by manually counting cells exhibiting a positive BrdU staining under the microscope (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Similar trends were observed when cell cycle progression was analyzed on primary fibroblast cultures transfected with control siRNA or with a mix of siRNA #2 and 4 directed against nucleolin (data not shown). siRNA duplexes that have no effect on nucleolin protein levels (#1 and #3) also have no effect on cell cycle progression (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), further showing that the observed cell cycle effects are the consequence of the specific depletion of nucleolin.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Nucleolin depletion leads to decreased cell growth and G2/M accumulation</bold>.

Mitotic index of HeLa cells and human primary fibroblasts transfected with control siRNA or the siRNA mix #2 and #4. After 4 days of transfection, cell populations were stained with an anti phospho S<sup>28</sup>-H3 antibody and cyclin B1 to detect mitotic cells. Positive cells were scored by microscopic observation. This graph represents the average of the different experiments (DAPI, PH3S28 and cyclin B1) shown in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-8-66-3"/></fig><p>To determine if the absence of nucleolin was able to affect mitotic progression, we measured the effect of nucleolin depletion on the number of cells in mitosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). HeLa and fibroblast cells were transfected with control or anti-nucleolin siRNA, and cultured for 4 days before fixation and staining with DAPI, and immuno-detection of either phosphorylated serine 28 of histone H3 (PH3-S28), or cyclin B1, to identify mitotic cells. PH3-S28 labeling and DAPI staining showed a significant decrease in mitotic cells (about 65% decrease in HeLa and 90% decrease in fibroblast, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). The decrease in the mitotic index upon nucleolin depletion was further confirmed by an increase in cyclin B1 staining of chromatin, observed concomitantly with nuclear envelope break down at the beginning of mitosis (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Altogether these results are indicative of a mitotic index reduction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Therefore, the overall increase in the G2/M population observed by flow cytometry upon nucleolin depletion is not due to an increase in the mitotic population, but is likely to represent an increase in the G2 population. To confirm this hypothesis, immunofluorescence with an antibody against phosphorylated serine 10 of histone H3 (PH3-S10), a G2 marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], was performed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The data show an about 2-fold increase in cells labeled with PH3-S10 upon nucleolin depletion. Therefore, the net gain in cells exhibiting a G2 marker contributes largely to the increased population exhibiting the G2/M DNA content observed upon nucleolin depletion.</p><p>As a small number of cells showed polyploidy upon nucleolin depletion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, 5 days), we wanted to ask whether tetraploid cells with a 2n DNA content contribute to the increase in the population size exhibiting a the G2/M DNA content. In situ hybridization performed with a probe specific to the centromere of chromosome 10 on cells transfected with siRNA against nucleolin revealed only very few nuclei with twice the number of hybridization signals observed in control cells (data not shown). This result suggests that tetraploid cells do not significantly contribute to the observed increase in the population exhibiting a G2/M DNA content observed upon nucleolin depletion. Therefore the increase in G2/M population upon nucleolin depletion can be mainly explained by an increase in diploid G2 cells.</p><p>Five days after transfection, about 20% of HeLa cells had a sub-2N DNA content (Sub G1) compared to 3.2% in untransfected control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Consistent with that, tunnel assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B</xref>) revealed about 22% of apoptotic cells 5 days after transfection. Thus, depletion of nucleolin in HeLa cells triggers apoptosis. Nucleolar disruption in response to cellular stress has been found to stabilize p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Indeed, we observed a marked increase in p53 protein levels after depletion of nucleolin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). This increase may be the consequence of p53 protein stabilization. However, a 2-fold increase of p53 mRNA could also be observed in both HeLa and fibroblast transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). To determine if apoptosis was responsible for the large reduction in cell growth, observed upon nucleolin depletion (see above) we performed a simulation to remove the contribution of cell death by apoptosis on measured growth curves (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The growth curve obtained for cells transfected with control siRNA was used as a starting point to calculate the estimated curve (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). The percentage of apoptotic cells measured during a 4 day time course (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) was subtracted from the total cell population at each time point to remove the apoptotic population from the growing cell population. The reevaluating growth curve was, as expected, below the growth curve obtained for cells transfected with control siRNA, but significantly much higher than the growth curve measured for cells transfected with siRNA against nucleolin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, compare dash curve to plain curves). Our result indicates that in addition to apoptosis induction, nucleolin depletion reduces cell proliferation. Therefore, apoptosis and cell proliferation reduction both act synergistically and ultimately lead to cell growth arrest.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Nucleolin depletion activates apoptotic pathways</bold>.

In particular, the presence of cells with micronuclei or multiple nuclei was drastically increased in transfected cells. Compared to HeLa cells, this increase was even more pronounced in human primary fibroblasts, which exhibit almost no micronuclei or multinuclei in the population of cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. The presence of these defects could be the consequence of abnormal mitosis caused by amplified centrosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. To test the hypothesis that the depletion of nucleolin could lead to abnormalities in centrosome duplication, cells transfected with siRNA against nucleolin or control siRNA were stained with an anti-&#x003b3;-tubulin antibody to detect the centrosomal structures, an anti-&#x003b1;-tubulin antibody to detect microtubules, a CREST serum (CEN) for the centromeres, and DAPI for DNA. As observed on 3D reconstructions of mitotic cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), more than 2 signals were consistently observed for &#x003b3;-tubulin in siRNA transfected HeLa cells compared to 2 signals in control cells.

Nucleolin is highly expressed in tumors and actively dividing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], and is often used as a marker for cell proliferation. Its ability to cooperate with Ras in a rat embryonic transformation assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], to repress translation of p53 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and to act as the target of the anti-proliferative GROs (G-rich oligonucleotides) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], suggests that nucleolin could directly affect cell proliferation independently of its action in ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>To explore the role of nucleolin in cell proliferation, we used siRNA to repress the expression of nucleolin protein in HeLa cells and in cultured human primary fibroblasts. As soon as a significant decrease in the levels of nucleolin protein could be observed (2 fold decrease, 2 days after transfection), cells stopped proliferating (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and a significant number of cells entered apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The slower growth of cells depleted in nucleolin is probably not the consequence of widespread alteration in gene expression. We performed protein labelling experiments in nucleolin depleted cells and did not observed major alterations in protein synthesis in these cells (data not shown). In addition, we have performed transcriptome analysis of HeLa and human fibroblast cells depleted in nucleolin. Surprisingly, only a limited number of genes (~0.1% of the genes present on the microarray) seem significantly affected (data not shown), suggesting that the slow growth of nucleolin depleted cells is not the result of a global effect of nucleolin on gene expression. Instead, changes in the expression of specific genes, such as p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) might be responsible for slow growth and apoptosis. Future experiments will explore the different pathways that are activated upon nucleolin depletion.</p><p>One of the most drastic modifications of the ultra structure of the cell was the rearrangement of the nucleolar compartment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Fibrillar centers and dense fibrillar centers were delocalized to the periphery of the granular component, and a complete segregation of these compartments was also observed at later time points after siRNA transfection. This nucleolar reorganization had some resemblance to that obtained after the inhibition of rDNA transcription with low amount of actinomycin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], with injection of anti-UBF antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], or TIF-IA inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Indeed, we also observed that in nucleolin depleted cells, rDNA transcription was lower than in control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, E</xref>). However, unlike these earlier studies, we failed to observe a release of the major nucleolar proteins fibrillarin, UBF (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) or B23 (data not shown) in the nucleoplasm. Instead, UBF remained associated with the reorganized fibrillar component in interphase cells.</p><p>As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] this nucleolar disruption is accompanied by elevated levels of p53 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The increase in p53 levels was likely the consequence of the increased translation of p53 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and/or stabilization of p53 mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As we have not directly tested if the interaction of HDM2 (mouse Double Minute 2 Human homolog) with p53 was altered in nucleolin deficient cells, we cannot exclude the possibility that the elevated level of p53 was also due to inhibition of HDM2, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>One of the most remarkable consequences of nucleolin inactivation is the apparent blockage of cells in the G2 phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and the significant increase in multinuclear cells and cells with micronuclei (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). By contrast, the number of cells in mitosis was drastically reduced in nucleolin depleted cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Furthermore, in situ hybridization with a probe specific to the pericentromeres of chromosome 10 did not detect any significant increase in tetraploid cells, suggesting that cells are probably arrested in G2. This phenotype is quite different from that obtained upon inactivation of TIF-IA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], but similar to that obtained upon inactivation of B23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, as with the inactivation of B23, we also observed an alteration in the control of centrosome number in cells expressing low levels of nucleolin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Interestingly, it was also recently reported that nucleolin was required for chromosome congression and the maintenance of mitotic spindle integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], suggesting that nucleolin may have a more general role during mitosis.</p><p>It is also striking that nucleolin and B23 share numerous homologous functions, despite the fact that they have different structures. Both interact with nucleic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], and are involved in different aspects of ribosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and in chromatin regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This report highlights other possible common properties of nucleolin and B23 in cell proliferation control and centrosome duplication.</p><p>It has been proposed that during mitosis, when the nuclear envelope breaks down, some B23 is delocalized from the nucleolus to centrosomes where it remains bound until it is phosphorylated by CDK2/cyclin E at mid-late G1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Some B23 phosphorylated on Thr<sup>199 </sup>remained at the centrosome and seemed to be important for the interaction of the ROCK II kinase that also regulated centrosome duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. The regulated localization of B23 at the centrosomes could represent one of the licensing systems for centrosome duplication ensuring only one duplication per cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Although nucleolin has been found associated with centrosomal structures in the proteomic analysis of human centrosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], we have not been able to detect nucleolin in these structures by immunofluorescence using different antibodies. However, localization of B23 protein at the centrosomes is not easily detectable. Only a few B23 antibodies were able to detect B23 protein at the centrosomal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], while conflicting data were obtained with GFP-B23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. This may reflect an inaccessibility of the antibody to the protein, post-translational modifications or an alteration of the B23 structure when it was present at the centrosomes. Interestingly, nucleolin interacts with B23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], and several nucleolar proteins have been found associated with centrosomal structures in the proteomic characterization of the human centrosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This could suggest that a nucleolar protein complex could participate in the regulation of centrosome duplication. Future experiments should further explore this link between nucleolin and the regulation of centrosome duplication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this report we uncovered a new role for nucleolin in cell proliferation and cell division.

This simulated dashed curve is obtained by subtracting the number of apoptotic cells determined by tunnel assay (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) to the total number of cells for each time point, followed by a reevaluation of cell growth with this apoptotic-corrected cell number.
