Individual pure protamine cDNA components were isolated by cloning this family of protamine ds cDNAs in a plasmid vector (pMB9). Clones containing protamine sequences were characterized by restriction mapping and by a positive hybrid-selected translation assay, which allowed us to correlate particular cDNAs with particular protein components. To allow more detailed comparisons, complete nucleotide sequences were determined for selected protamine clones. We have detected at least 5 distinctly different coding sequences, which nevertheless show at least 82% homology, and which have probably arisen by repeated gene duplication. These very highly conserved coding sequences do however contain a distinctly variable region near the 5'-end of the mRNA (N-terminus of the protein), corresponding to the major sites of serine phosphorylation. Since the amino acid sequences predicted by our DNA sequences were slightly different from those previously published (1), we have independently determined the amino acid sequences of protamine components CI, CII, CIII from our own source of trout testis. These new peptide sequences are completely consistent with those predicted by our nucleotide sequences. The 3'-untranslated regions of the protamine mRNAs are, surprisingly almost as highly conserved as the coding regions. Both coding and 3'-noncoding portions appear to be under a similar degree of selective pressure and evolutionary constraint to remain constant.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1463"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1464"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1465"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1466"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1467"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1468"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1469"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1470"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1471"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1472"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1473"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1474"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1475"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1476"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1477"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1478"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1479"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1480"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0210.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1481"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00399-0211.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1482"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
