Here, we identify the <italic>Yersinia</italic> virulence regulator RovA as a protein thermometer. Thermal shifts encountered upon host entry lead to a reversible conformational change of the autoactivator, which reduces its DNA-binding functions and renders it more susceptible for proteolysis. Cooperative binding of RovA to its target promoters is significantly reduced at 37&#x000b0;C, indicating that temperature control of <italic>rovA</italic> transcription is primarily based on the autoregulatory loop. Thermally induced reduction of DNA-binding is accompanied by an enhanced degradation of RovA, primarily by the Lon protease. This process is also subject to growth phase control. Studies with modified/chimeric RovA proteins indicate that amino acid residues in the vicinity of the central DNA-binding domain are important for proteolytic susceptibility. Our results establish RovA as an intrinsic temperature-sensing protein in which thermally induced conformational changes interfere with DNA-binding capacity, and secondarily render RovA susceptible to proteolytic degradation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Temperature is one of the most crucial environmental signals sensed by pathogens to adjust expression of their virulence factors and host survival programs after entry from a cold external environment into a warm-blooded host. Thermo-induced structural changes in bent or supercoiled DNA or mRNA secondary structures are frequently used to modulate virulence gene transcription or translation. Here we introduce a unique alternative mechanism, in which a central regulator of <italic>Yersinia</italic> virulence (RovA) uses an in-built thermosensor to control its activity in order to modulate virulence gene expression. According to our results, small thermo-induced structural alterations reduce the DNA-binding capacity of the virulence regulator and render the protein more susceptible to proteolytic degradation by ATP-dependent proteases. Amino acids in the vicinity of the DNA-binding region appear to comprise the information required for proteolysis. We therefore postulate a model in which proteolytic degradation is in direct competition with the thermo-sensitive DNA-binding function of the regulator. This regulatory concept constitutes a new example of how microbial pathogens are able to rapidly adjust virulence-associated processes in the course of an infection.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most microbial pathogens occupy different ecological niches inside and outside their mammalian hosts.

Past studies addressing thermo-dependent changes in pathogenic yersiniae revealed that shifts between moderate temperatures and 37&#x000b0;C result in a global transition of gene expression, including multiple metabolic and stress adaptation genes, and most <italic>Yersinia</italic> virulence factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Marceau1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Motin1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Among the virulence properties that are strongly expressed at environmental temperatures but weakly at 37&#x000b0;C are the heat-stable <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> specific enterotoxin Yst, iron-scavenging systems, smooth lipopolysaccharides, and the production of the primary internalization factor invasin in the enteropathogenic <italic>Yersinia</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Straley1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Marceau1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These characteristics seem to support initial colonization, penetration and survival in host tissues that are encountered during the very early stages of infection. While these properties are repressed at 37&#x000b0;C, expression of the virulence plasmid-encoded type III secretion system, the antiphagocytic Yop proteins and the adhesin YadA are induced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Bolin1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Rohde1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This ensures that the bacteria remain cell adherent, become serum-resistant and are prepared for contact with phagocytic cells of the host immune system during ongoing infections. Although most <italic>Yersinia</italic> pathogenicity factors are thermally regulated, the devices for sensing temperature alterations and the molecular mechanisms how this sensory event is transmitted to globally regulate pathogenicity-associated pathways are not fully understood.

Furthermore, a thermo-responsive hairpin structure (&#x0201c;thermoswitch&#x0201d;) has been postulated within the transcript of the transcriptional regulator VirF. Both, YmoA and VirF, control the expression of the type III secretion machinery, translocating the antiphagocytic Yop effector proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Jackson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Hoe1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this report, we analyze the thermoregulation of the global <italic>Yersinia</italic> virulence regulator RovA.

We therefore hypothesized that RovA might act as a protein thermometer, which is able to sense temperature of its environment directly through alteration in protein conformation without involvement of other cellular components. To test this, we first performed RovA DNA-binding experiments at 25&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C with different <italic>inv</italic> or <italic>rovA</italic> promoter fragments, harbouring one or more RovA binding sites. To demonstrate specificity of RovA binding, a control fragment encoding the <italic>csiD</italic> gene of <italic>E. coli</italic> was also introduced into the assay. The DNA-binding behaviour of RovA is significantly different at both temperatures, in such that the RovA protein binds DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> more avidly at low temperature. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000435-g002">Figure <bold>2A</bold></xref>, significantly more of the same protein sample was required to cause the disappearance of free <italic>inv</italic> promoter fragments and the appearance of higher molecular RovA-DNA complexes at 37&#x000b0;C. To quantify these effects, we carried out band shift assays with a wide range of RovA concentrations, which allowed us to determine the apparent dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>). We found that at 25&#x000b0;C the RovA protein interacts with a K<sub>d</sub> of about 32&#x000b1;5 nM and 45&#x000b1;4 nM with the binding sites I and II of the <italic>inv</italic> promoter, but it exhibits a considerably lower affinity (K<sub>d</sub> of about 183&#x000b1;24 nM and 190&#x000b1;23 nM) to the same binding sites at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000435-g002">Figure <bold>2B</bold></xref>).

A pH shift from 7.3 to 7.8, covering the small temperature-induced increase in the band shift buffer system also had no effect on RovA DNA-binding at 25&#x000b0;C (data not shown). This strongly indicated that observed thermo-dependent changes of RovA DNA-binding are not simply the result of thermo-dynamic effects or thermo-related changes in the pH. We also analyzed the DNA-binding capability of RovA after it was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for more than 1 h, and allowed to cool down to 25&#x000b0;C. RovA was not affected by this treatment and exhibited similar DNA-binding properties as the protein which was only incubated at 25&#x000b0;C (data not shown). Hence, incubation at higher temperatures does not irreversibly damage the function of RovA. Furthermore, we found, that loss and gain of function upon temperature up- and downshifts occurred very rapidly (data not shown), suggesting that variations of the temperature between 25&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C induce conformational changes in RovA, that affect its DNA-binding capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Temperature-induced conformational changes of RovA</title><p>Structural modelling of RovA based on mutant analysis and homologies with other crystallized MarR-type proteins predicted a highly &#x003b1;-helical dimeric protein, in which the first &#x003b1;-helix of one RovA subunit inserts between the last two &#x003b1;-helices of the other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Tran1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000435.s001">Figure <bold>S1</bold></xref>).

Consequently, loss of RovA DNA-binding functions at 37&#x000b0;C could be the result of thermo-induced conformational changes within the RovA protein. To test this possibility, the temperature effect on the overall conformation of RovA was investigated by using Circular Dicroism (CD) spectroscopy. CD spectroscopy was performed with highly purified RovA between 200nm and 250nm at 25&#x000b0;C and after heating the samples to 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000435-g004">Figure <bold>4A</bold></xref>). The CD spectrum confirmed RovA being a highly &#x003b1;-helical protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000435-t001">Table <bold>1</bold></xref>). It also showed that a temperature increase to 37&#x000b0;C led to a profound change of the profile, indicating that &#x003b1;-helical structures were lost, whereas the content of &#x003b2;-sheets increased. The CD spectrum stabilized within 10 minutes following the shift to 37&#x000b0;C, indicating that major changes to the structure were complete by this time (data not shown). In contrast, CD spectroscopy of control proteins (RovM <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000435-g004">Figure <bold>4B</bold></xref>, lysozyme <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000435.s002">Figure <bold>S2</bold></xref>) did not lead to detectable conformational changes under identical conditions. Furthermore, the overall shape of the CD spectrum of RovA did not change radically, indicating that the overall structure was only partially altered. In fact, reversibility of the thermal unfolding transitions could be demonstrated by the recovery of the initial secondary structure profile. After recooling to 25&#x000b0;C, the spectrum was similar to the original spectrum recorded at 25&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000435-t001">Table <bold>1</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000435-g004">Figure <bold>4A</bold></xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-1000435-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000435.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Conformational analysis of RovA and RovM using CD spectroscopy.</title><p>CS spectra, &#x00394;&#x003b5; (M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) versus wavelength of RovA (0.16 mg/ml) (A) or RovM (0.4 mg/ml) (B) as function of temperature (25&#x000b0;C, solid line; 37&#x000b0;C broken line; 37&#x000b0;C and cooling to 25&#x000b0;C dotted line).

The coiled-coil structure is a versatile and rather flexible motif in mediating protein-protein interactions, and it has been shown that TlpA undergoes a reversible conformational switch in response to temperature changes, leading to alterations between the unfolded monomeric form and the folded DNA-binding coiled-coil oligomeric structure. Also the RheA protein acts as a protein thermometer with shorter coiled-coil domains, and a thermo-induced change in the repressor leads either to an active or inactive form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Servant1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. The structure of the MarR-type regulator RovA is significantly different from TlpA and RheA. Its internal region contains the DNA-binding domain that is predicted to adopt a winged-helix fold. The first N- and the last two C-terminal &#x003b1;-helices appear to form an extensive and well-packed dimer interface, similar to that seen in the structure of other MarR-type regulators. These help to stabilize the formation of dimers with properly positioned DNA-binding segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Tran1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This type of dimer formation makes it very unlikely that thermo-sensing of RovA is based on a monomer-to-dimer conversion. In fact, we found no evidence to suggest dissociation of the dimers into monomers at 37&#x000b0;C; in contrast, RovA dimers are still detectable after heating to 95&#x000b0;C in the presence of SDS (H. Tran-Winkler, unpublished results). However, our previous structural-functional analysis showed that even small changes, i.e. single amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal region (L12A, W16A), which have no detectable effect on RovA dimer formation, cause a severe defect in DNA-binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Tran1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that temperature-dependent structural changes within thermo-sensitive elements of the RovA dimer might effect the proper positioning of the DNA-binding segments.</p><p>Our studies further demonstrate that the level of RovA in the bacterial cell is not only determined by transcription, but is also subject to growth phase- and temperature-regulated proteolysis. The RovA protein is stable during stationary phase and/or at moderate temperatures (20&#x000b0;C&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C), but becomes highly unstable during exponential growth at 37&#x000b0;C. Degradation of RovA under these conditions is primarily mediated through the Lon protease, albeit the Clp proteases also appear to participate to a very small extent in the degradation process. Both types of proteases are ATP-dependent and assigned to the AAA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> superfamily of ATPases. Lon and ClpP proteases share two common features: (i) access to the proteolytic chamber of the enzyme is usually prohibited to globular proteins, most likely to prevent unrestrained protein degradation, and (ii) they require ATP hydrolysis to unfold and translocate the substrates into the protease chamber. Degradation within the chamber is processive, including sequential rounds of substrate binding, release and rebinding to the proteolytic site, and generates 10&#x02013;15 amino acid peptides without generation of partially digested protein intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Gottesman1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Tsilibaris1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The ClpP and Lon proteases usually degrade improperly folded or damaged proteins. However, undamaged proteins, in particular short-lived regulatory factors which are implicated in developmental processes, stress resistance and bacterial fitness can also serve as substrates for proteolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000435-Gottesman1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>According to our results, RovA degradation by the Lon protease is clearly temperature-dependent, but alterations of the DNA-binding activity due to thermo-induced conformational changes seems much more critical for thermo-dependent <italic>rovA</italic> expression than the change of RovA stability.

This raises the question of why is RovA also rapidly degraded at 37&#x000b0;C. Thermo-induced structural alterations led to a strong reduction, but did not cause a complete inactivation of the DNA-binding function of RovA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000435-g002">Figures <bold>2</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000435-g003"><bold>3</bold></xref>).

Also introduction of a mutation abolishing the DNA-binding function of RovA rendered the protein more susceptible to Lon, whereas presence of a multi-copy plasmid harbouring RovA-binding sites reduced degradation of the protein. This suggests that amino acid residues in the vicinity of the central winged-helix DNA-binding domain comprise the information necessary for Lon binding and/or provides the foundation for degradation by Lon. This finding raises the intriguing possibility that Lon recognition and degradation of RovA is in direct competition with the DNA-binding function of the regulator.
