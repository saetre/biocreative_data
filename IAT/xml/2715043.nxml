In vitro, AID has been shown to target single-stranded DNA, relaxed double-stranded DNA, when transcribed, or supercoiled DNA. To simulate the in vivo situation more closely, we have introduced two copies of a nucleosome positioning sequence, MP2, into a supercoiled AID target plasmid to determine where around the positioned nucleosomes (in the vicinity of an ampicillin resistance gene) cytidine deaminations occur in the absence or presence of transcription. We found that without transcription nucleosomes prevented cytidine deamination by AID. However, with transcription AID readily accessed DNA in nucleosomes on both DNA strands. The experiments also showed that AID targeting any DNA molecule was the limiting step, and they support the conclusion that once targeted to DNA, AID acts processively in naked DNA and DNA organized within transcribed nucleosomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The somatic hypermutation (SHM) of <italic>Ig</italic> genes requires that the <italic>Ig</italic> genes are transcribed (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). The track of mutations coincides roughly with that of the transcribed 1&#x02013;2 kb after the start site of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The SHM process is initiated by the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which targets deoxycytidines (Cs) in cell-free assays in single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) and mainly in the nontranscribed strand during transcription of linear double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) but targets Cs on both DNA strands when they are flipped out in supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). In vivo, AID targets both DNA strands, as shown in germinal center B cells of mice with deficiencies in the uracil (U) glycosylase Ung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) or double-deficient in Ung, and mismatch repair proteins Msh2 or Msh6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In these DNA repair-deficient mice, a large proportion or all of the Us created by AID are converted to thymines (Ts) as a result of direct replication of the U-containing DNA strand. Both DNA strands show very similar ratios of C to T, thus agreeing with the in vitro findings that AID can equally target both DNA strands in supercoiled DNA. This finding has implications for the mechanism by which AID accesses double-stranded DNA in vivo. We have hypothesized that AID may target negative supercoils, as they arise in the wake of the transcription complex during transcript elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Another possibility is that AID targets both DNA strands in the very short interval of single-stranded DNA at the upstream end of the transcription bubble, where nascent RNA has dissociated from the transcribed strand but the two DNA strands have not yet reannealed. A third possibility can be suggested from the finding that the single-strand binding protein RPA is associated with AID in extracts of mutating B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Perhaps the transcription bubble remains open for an extended length because the two DNA strands are held apart by RPA.</p><p>Considering the situation during SHM in vivo, AID has to negotiate not only supercoiled DNA but also DNA that is organized into chromatin. Recent whole genome analyses have shown that although transcriptional promoters generally have greatly reduced concentrations of nucleosomes, there is a stable nucleosome positioned at the start of transcription, and the genome, including transcribed genes, is overall constrained in nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). During transcript elongation, nucleosomes are partially or completely removed and reassembled with the DNA after passage of the RNA polymerase (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Relating these findings to SHM, it was possible that AID would only target DNA sequences that are not engaged in nucleosomes, such as the spacers between nucleosomes or DNA sequences that are temporarily vacated by nucleosomes during transcription. Alternatively, the conformational changes DNA undergoes when wrapped around the histone core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) may actually flip out cytosines and make them accessible to AID even without transcription. The latter possibility was suggested by the finding of mutation clusters of approximately nucleosome size interspersed with unmutated regions of approximately spacer size in an Ig transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>A special case of nucleosome topology is the stable positioning of a nucleosome over the region where transcription starts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Perhaps a nucleosome at the start, in the context of SHM, may be responsible for the lack of mutations at the start of the transcribed region. In general, the first &#x0223c;100 bp of <italic>Ig</italic> genes are not mutated, increasing mutation frequencies are seen in the next &#x0223c;100 bp to a plateau of mutation frequencies that is reached &#x0223c;200 bp from the start of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). It is thus important to determine whether AID can deaminate cytosines in nucleosomal DNA. To answer this question, we have created a plasmid, <italic>pKMP2</italic>, with two 147-bp nucleosome positioning sequences, MP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), placed between a T7 promoter and the start of an ampicillin resistance (<italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Histone octamers preferentially bind these positioning sequences, leaving a nucleosome-free spacer of 76 bp between them. The <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> gene was inactivated by changing the translational initiation ATG codon to ACG, thus requiring cytosine deamination by AID for activation. The <italic>pKMP2</italic> plasmid also has a kanamycin resistance (<italic>Kan</italic><sup>r</sup>) gene so that plasmid-carrying <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> can be selected in kanamycin whether or not the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> gene has been activated by AID. This allows assessing mutations in and near the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> gene independent of Amp<sup>r</sup> function.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The <italic>pKMP2</italic> plasmid and its charging with nucleosomes.</bold> (A) Mutation substrate <italic>pKMP2</italic> was used to determine AID-induced cytosine deaminations in the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> gene.

The MP2 sequence causes precise binding of histone octamers as shown by exonuclease digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). This is not seen when naked DNA is treated with exonuclease, confirming that none of the positions observed with nucleosomal DNA are caused by exonuclease pause sites that occur on naked DNA (unpublished data). We created 247-bp DNA molecules with a central MP2 positioning sequence and 50-bp arms. These molecules were reconstituted with histone octamer and purified on a sucrose gradient. Exonuclease III mapping was performed and the digested fragments compared with a sequencing ladder that was prepared with the same 247-bp DNA fragment. There is a single exo-resistant fragment within this DNA construct, which proves that the MP2 sequence positions nucleosomes extremely accurately. Nucleosome-free DNA digested separately showed that exonuclease III does not stall at the position observed for nucleosomes (unpublished data). Each MP2 sequence contains a BamHI site that is not accessible to the restriction enzyme when the DNA is positioned on core histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Exonuclease tests for nucleosome positioning on the MP2 sequence.</bold> (A) Map of the nucleosome and flanking DNA.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3 are plasmid <italic>pKMP2</italic> DNA without histones and without (lane 2) or with (lane 3) BamHI digestion. BamHI creates two DNA fragments: one of 223 bp corresponding to the distance between the two BamHI sites in the positioning sequences and one of 3,675 bp corresponding to the rest of the plasmid. Lanes 4&#x02013;6 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> show BamHI-digested plasmids with increasing amounts of histone octamers (the plasmid DNAs were repurified after BamHI digestion). In lane 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, essentially all the DNA is cut with BamHI, resulting in a small and a large fragment as with naked DNA. In lane 5 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, completely undigested DNA becomes apparent, but plasmids without any positioned nucleosome are still present (small fragment), as are plasmids with a single positioned nucleosome (the large fragment is of greater intensity and presumably is a doublet of 3675 and 3898 bp). Finally, in lane 6 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, all plasmids have at least one positioned nucleosome,resulting in the absence of the small fragment. About 50% of the DNA is undigested, thus containing two positioned nucleosomes. However, at this concentration of histones, the plasmids are not saturated with positioned nucleosomes, as shown by the presence of the large 3,898-bp fragment, representing DNA with one positioned nucleosome cut with BamHI in the other positioning sequence. Lanes 7&#x02013;10 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> confirm the increasing loading of nucleosomes. The DNAs were digested with EcoRI and SspI and were run directly on the gel without removing proteins. EcoRI and SspI digestion releases two fragments of 548 and 3,350 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The histone-containing DNA samples in lanes 8&#x02013;10 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> show the small and large fragments as naked DNA (lane 7), indicating that they do not contain histones. At the highest concentration of histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, lane 10), &#x0003e;50% of the molecules do not contain nucleosomes on the large fragment (E/S large). The E/S large band is only somewhat reduced in intensity. However, the small fragment in lane 10 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> is reduced to &#x0223c;30% of the amount in naked DNA (lane 7) and includes considerably less DNA relative to the large fragment in naked DNA, showing that the MP2 sequences are preferred binding sites for histone cores, compared with the rest of the plasmid. The small fragment is shifted to positions indicating loading with one or two nucleosomes, respectively, as indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Most important are the E-o-o-S fragments showing the presence of two nucleosomes. Because they are flanked with both EcoRI and SspI sites, the short 548-bp DNA fragment clearly contains two nucleosomes and is flanked by naked DNA that permits digestion by EcoRI and SspI.</p><p>The DNA in the well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1 B</xref>, lanes 8&#x02013;10) is uncut circular plasmid that does not enter this polyacrylamide gel, presumably molecules with nucleosomes occupying the EcoRI and/or SspI sites. We did not attempt to inhibit histone octamer binding to the sequences outside of the MP2 sequences. However, they are expected to be random and rare compared with binding at the MP2 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, lane 10). There are 129 and 50 bp between the MP2 positioning sequence and the EcoRI and SspI sites, respectively. Because spacers between nucleosomes can be as short as 30 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), it is likely that in the DNA molecules trapped in the well the MP2 sequences are also positioned within nucleosomes. Thus, digestion with EcoRI and SspI supports the conclusion with BamHI digestion that &#x0223c;50% of the DNA in lane 10 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> contains two positioned nucleosomes.</p><p>To further confirm that dinucleosome DNA was formed, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to visualize nucleosome DNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref> shows two adjacent nucleosomes in the supercoiled plasmid. By volume and surface topography (illustrated in this study with light reflection), two nucleosomes are distinguished from a single one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). The single-line traces confirm the nucleosome numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). These analyses show that supercoiled DNA can be charged with histone octamers. Large numbers of plasmids with two positioned nucleosomes can be obtained as useful substrates for potential AID targeting.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>AFM of <italic>pKMP2</italic> plasmids with nucleosomes.</bold> (A) Full-length plasmid (DNA contour length measured to be &#x0223c;1.1 &#x000b5;m or &#x0223c;3.2 kB).

To analyze the interaction of AID with DNA in nucleosomes, we used the highest histone octamer to DNA ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, lanes 6 and 10). To exclude DNA molecules that did not have two positioned nucleosomes, the DNA was treated with BamHI for 1 h before addition of AID or of AID and T7 RNA polymerase. BamHI continued to be present throughout the subsequent incubation with AID. BamHI treatment of naked DNA completely eliminated all viable plasmids, as no Kan<sup>r</sup> colonies were obtained after transformation into U DNA glycosylase-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic> (unpublished data). When nucleosomal DNA was pretreated with BamHI and further treated continuously for 2 h together with AID, 10% viable plasmids were retained under kanamycin selection. This is lower than the 50% estimate from the restriction enzyme analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, presumably because in those tests 5&#x000d7; less BamHI and a 4.5&#x000d7; shorter time of incubation with the restriction enzymes were used. During prolonged incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, nucleosome &#x0201c;breathing&#x0201d; allows access to restriction enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). For mutation analysis of nucleosome-containing plasmids with AID in the presence of BamHI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), two positioned nucleosomes must have been constantly present. As shown by Poirier et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), nucleosomes are resistant to cleavage with certain restriction enzymes contained within their sequences. Thus, plasmids cut by BamHI will not be sampled in our experiments because only intact circular plasmids are able to provide ampicillin or kanamycin resistance to <italic>E. coli</italic> (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Experimental procedure to test AID activity in plasmid pKMP2.</bold> (A) Flowchart.

To obtain statistics, we tested the null hypothesis that the proportion of clones with mutations in the MP2 sequences in different conditions are equal, using a Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for numbers of clones with mutations in MP2 over total mutated clones in the same condition. 5C&#x02192;5A, P = 0.016 (thus, 5C has significantly more MP2 mutations than 5A); 5H&#x02192;5G, P = 0.027 (thus, 5H has significantly more MP2 mutations than 5G); 5K&#x02192;5G, P = 0.021 (thus, 5K has significantly more MP2 mutations than 5G).

It also shows that the nucleosome positioning sequence in the absence of nucleosomes is targeted by AID in this cell-free assay. Efficient mutability may have been expected because the content of AID hotspots in the MP2 sequence (10 WRC and 11 GYW for &#x0223c;25% of the total Cs and Gs in hotspots) was the same as in an Ig transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and slightly higher than the 22% in a related supercoiled AID test plasmid that did not contain nucleosome positioning sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).

Thus, the nucleosome positioning sequence was a qualified AID target.</p><p>After digestion with BamHI, essentially no Amp<sup>r</sup> colonies were obtained from nucleosome-containing plasmids without transcription. In multiple experiments of AID- and BamHI-treated nucleosome-containing plasmids without transcription, in which a total of 3.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> colonies were obtained in kanamycin, only a single Amp<sup>r</sup> colony was seen that had some mutations in the nucleosome positioning sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Possibly this one plasmid providing ampicillin resistance contained no nucleosomes over its MP2 sequences but was somehow sequestered from BamHI access. As shown in subsequent sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>), plasmids with two positioned nucleosomes selected in kanamycin have no mutations in the MP2 sequences, indicating that AID does not access DNA in nucleosomes. <italic>pKMP2</italic> plasmids that had been incubated with histones and not digested with BamHI readily acquired large numbers of mutations induced by AID and conferred ampicillin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). These clones present additional support that DNA in nucleosomes is not accessible to AID without transcription. The plasmids in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> were treated with histone octamers and AID without transcription but not treated with BamHI. All of them have mutations that are not seen in kanamycin selection when nucleosomal pKMP2 is treated with AID and BamHI without transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> clones have either created a TATA box or ACG&#x02192;ATG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082678/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Thus, all of the Amp<sup>r</sup> clones in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> must have been from naked DNA or DNA with a single nucleosome. Plasmids that had been charged with two nucleosomes did not acquire ampicillin resistance because the mutations required for overcoming the inefficient ACG start codon did not occur in the presence of nucleosomes.</p><p>Thus, the pattern of mutations for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> (sequences in Fig. S1) is similar to clones in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, which are naked DNA treated with AID without transcription (sequences in Fig. S3). However, most clones from naked DNA with no transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>) had mutations in the ACG initiation codon (Fig. S3), but only one from histone octamer-treated clones with no transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>) had an ACG mutation (Fig. S1). Furthermore, within the MP2 regions, clones in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref> had significantly more mutations than clones in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> (P = 0.016). This suggests that most of the 5A clones had only one nucleosome positioned on the second MP2 sequence, disallowing access of AID to the ACG but permitting creation of a novel TATA box upstream of the first naked MP2 sequence.</p><p>Incubation of BamHI-treated nucleosomal plasmid DNA with AID during transcription with T7 RNA polymerase restored ampicillin-resistant colonies to &#x0223c;11% of the numbers seen in kanamycin. Cytosine deamination was seen in the DNA of both positioned nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>), indicating that DNA constrained in nucleosomes is readily accessible to AID when it is transcribed. Every C in nucleosome 1, the first of which is downstream of the T7 transcriptional promoter, was mutated in some of the 29 sequences obtained from Amp<sup>r</sup> bacterial colonies, although no sequence had mutations in all 43 Cs in this nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Because there was no C that was deaminated in nucleosome 1 in all 29 sequences and there was no C that was unmutated in all 29 sequences, it appears that within the nucleosome there were no strong topology-dependent hot or cold subregions. Overall, there was a steady decline of mutability from a peak just before the start of the first nucleosome throughout that nucleosome, the spacer between the nucleosomes, and nucleosome 2. None of the 29 sequences had mutations within the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). This diminishing mutation profile is apparently a result of the need for expression of ampicillin resistance, as it is not observed when the <italic>E. coli</italic> transformed with AID-treated plasmids was selected in kanamycin (see Nucleosomal DNA is accessible to AID&#x02026;).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Sequences of <italic>pKMP2</italic> plasmids treated with AID during transcription and amplified in <italic>E. coli</italic> in the presence of ampicillin.</bold> The WT sequence is shown on the top lines.

It was possible that mutations had created a new start codon of the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> gene that allowed the gene product to form a fusion protein conferring Amp<sup>r</sup> activity. Indeed, AID deamination activity created some new ATGs, which are potential start codons to form a fusion protein with the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> gene product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, four in-frame ACG triplets in italics and underlined were mutated to ATGs). However, downstream of these start codons are five stop codons, including all three types of stops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, underlined triplets, not in italics). Thus, the new ATGs cannot initiate a protein to resist ampicillin.</p><p>Another possibility was that the C&#x02192;T mutations generated multiple A/T-rich promoters that significantly enhanced transcription. To investigate whether multiple promoters existed, we performed 5&#x02032; rapid amplification of complementary DNA (cDNA) ends with RNA from <italic>E. coli</italic> transformed with unmutated and two mutated <italic>pKMP2</italic> plasmids that conferred ampicillin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, numbers 1 and 7) to determine transcription start sites. Indeed a unique start was seen with the unmutated <italic>pKMP2</italic> transcripts, but the mutated plasmids had additional start sites (unpublished data). Sequences of the plasmid transcripts showed that in the nonmutant <italic>pKMP2</italic> plasmid the transcription start site was uniformly 45 bp upstream of the mutant Amp<sup>r</sup> start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, underlined purple at position 2996). This apparently weak promoter does not have a recognizable TATA box at &#x02212;10 bp upstream. In the two mutant <italic>pKMP2</italic> plasmids, a new TATA box (TAATAT) is created starting at position 2580 that is also present in every one of the other 27 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). This, and presumably other newly created promoters, must have significantly enhanced transcription activity in the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> region. Indeed, transcription activity in the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> region in the two mutant plasmids was &#x0223c;50&#x000d7; higher than that in the nonmutant <italic>pKMP2</italic> plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>).

Of 35 sequences, five appeared likely to confer resistance to ampicillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). One had an ATG start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>, number 3d) and four had potentially efficient promoters for transcription in <italic>E. coli</italic> and no mutations within the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>, numbers 7, 17, 7e, and 2a).

Both DNA strands in nucleosomes were found to be targeted by AID when there was no selection for the function of the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). Within the MP2 regions, of 35 sequences 6 had mutations at C (top strand) and 4 at G (bottom strand), totaling 62 C to T and 48 G to A transitions (mean C&#x02192;T in different experiments in the MP2 sequences, 15.5 &#x000b1; 16.9; mean G&#x02192;A in MP2, 12 &#x000b1; 13.3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>, nt 2604&#x02013;2750 and 2827&#x02013;2973). Thus, single-stranded DNA allowing AID access is created in both DNA strands in nucleosomes when they are transcribed. Both strands are also accessible outside of the nucleosomes. In the sequenced regions outside of the MP2 sequences, of the 35 plasmids with mutations 18 had C to T, 10 had G to A, and 3 had both types of mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). It thus appears that AID rarely changes the strand of engagement. In one of the three sequences with both C and G mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>, number 3), these were separated by 669 bp and, thus, presumably independent targetings. In the other two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>, numbers 9 and 10), the C and G mutations were interspersed, perhaps as a result of the rare occasion of AID acting on both strands in the same event. There were no mutations at both C and G within nucleosomes, but the numbers are not high enough to determine whether AID can switch strands within a nucleosome. The <italic>pKMP2</italic> plasmids selected in kanamycin show that core histones prevent AID induction of C deamination in an otherwise highly susceptible target and that both DNA strands become AID targets when the nucleosomes are transcribed.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Sequences of <italic>pKMP2</italic> plasmids treated with AID during transcription and amplified in <italic>E. coli</italic> in the presence of kanamycin.</bold> 35 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 K</xref>) are shown.

This suggests that the limiting step in the AID action was access to any DNA molecule and that, once engaged, AID acted either processively or cooperatively (see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>For this study, we used circular supercoiled plasmids that efficiently interacted with histone octamers and resulted in high numbers of kanamycin-resistant bacterial colonies. The <italic>Kan<sup>r</sup></italic> gene was transcribed from a lac promoter requiring <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA polymerase for its function. Because this polymerase was not present in the AID assays and because mutations by AID in the <italic>Kan<sup>r</sup></italic> gene in the absence of transcription were low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), almost all AID-treated plasmids were likely unmutated in the <italic>Kan<sup>r</sup></italic> gene.

Thus, the number of plasmids selected in ampicillin over those selected in kanamycin gave a reasonable estimate of beneficial mutations in and near the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> gene.</p><p>DNA sequences wrapped around nucleosomes without transcription are not targets for AID. This is especially apparent when the <italic>E. coli</italic> are grown without selection in ampicillin. Comparing naked DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082678/DC1">Fig. S6</ext-link>) with nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>) shows mutations in the nucleosome positioning sequences only when no nucleosomes are present. A putative TATA box at position 2580 seen in transcribed nucleosomal DNA is not mutated in any of the 14 clones of nontranscribed nucleosomal DNA selected in kanamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Thus, the nucleosome appears to prevent access to AID not only in the wrapped DNA but also in the nucleosome&#x02019;s vicinity to at least 19 nt, 5&#x02032; from where the TATA box would be created when the nucleosome was transcribed (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Perhaps the nucleosome prevents flipping out of cytosines that negative supercoils induce near the nucleosome positioning sequence in naked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><p>The inefficient access by AID to DNA in nucleosomes parallels the lack of access by the Rag1 and Rag 2 proteins in V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Similarly, restriction enzymes are sterically occluded from their target sites when wrapped into nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), reducing the rate of DNA digestion by 10<sup>2</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>6</sup>-fold as compared with naked double-stranded DNA. It is for this reason that the MP2 sequence used in our experiments is refractory to BamHI when associated with a nucleosome. AID requires single-stranded C as a target, and the contortions of nucleosomal DNA apparently do not suffice for AID access. Despite targeting of outside regions, nucleosomes cannot be accessed by AID without transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). Processivity of AID (discussed in the fourth subsequent paragraph) must include unraveling double-stranded DNA in our system. However, association with nucleosomes appears to stop that unwinding process. This would mean that when AID gains access to transcribed DNA in vivo, and if there is no RNA polymerase removing a nucleosome 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; of a catalytically active AID molecule, deamination must stop outside of that nucleosome. The histones used here came from chicken red blood cells, which are transcriptionally inactive and whose histones are minimally acetylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Recent in vitro analysis of the accessibility of restriction enzymes to chromatin would suggest, however, that acetylation alone would have only a modest effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).</p><p>AID access was efficient when the DNA in nucleosomes was transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, K vs. G</xref>). The requirement for transcription for SHM in vivo may therefore, at least in part, be a result of the need for accessing nucleosomal DNA. In the experiments in this paper, presumably the octamer would be knocked off or temporarily shifted by the passage of the T7 RNA polymerase. This is based on experiments with phage polymerase which displaced the complete octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). It had been concluded that with eukaryotic pol II, only one H2A/H2B heterodimer would be removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). It appears now that this finding was caused by the very high salt concentrations in the experiment and that eukaryotic pol II also displaces the whole nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>; for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Thus, as concerns the displacement of nucleosomes, the cell-free experiments are related to the situation of SHM in vivo.</p><p>With low levels of AID and short incubation time, the numbers of Amp<sup>r</sup> colonies were drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>). However, the mutation frequencies overall in plasmids with any mutations were very similar in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>). Thus, AID engagement with any DNA molecule is the limiting step. Once engaged, mutations apparently accumulate relatively independently of the AID concentration. Because Amp<sup>r</sup> required significant mutations, we cloned low-AID/short-time plasmids in kanamycin to determine whether a higher proportion had small numbers of mutations. Confirming the findings in Amp<sup>r</sup> clones, of 47 Kan<sup>r</sup> clones only one was mutated but with large numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) of mutations (unpublished data). Because the binding of AID to single-stranded DNA is apparently independent of the presence of cytosines and independent of the concentration of AID hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), the mode of catalysis by AID must be the reason for the rapid multiple cytosine deaminations once initiation has occurred.</p><p>The summary in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref> raises the question of how AID tracks its target. Apparently, AID creates mutations for relatively short stretches of DNA. The longest stretch is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref> (number 1h), from position 2688 to 2911 (224 nt). The shortest comprises only a single C&#x02192;T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, 5f) or G&#x02192;A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, 2). Six sequences have more than one cluster of mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, numbers 3, 7, 8, 18, 10e&#x02032;, and 5). Possibly, these sequences were targeted by two independent encounters with AID. In a given cluster, not every C is mutated. This was also observed by Bransteitter et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), who suggest that &#x0201c;AID can access distal target C residues&#x02026;while remaining bound to a single ssDNA substrate.&#x0201d; The facts that with short exposure to AID the number of mutated clones is drastically reduced but that the mutation frequency in mutated clones is almost the same as with longer exposure and that jumps between stretches of mutations occur support a jumping tracking process.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Compilation of mutations in transcribed nucleosomal DNA selected in kanamycin.</bold> The 11 groups represent the 11 stretches of 80 nt of sequences per line, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>.

The data were compiled from four experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20082678_RGB_Fig10"/></fig><p>Perhaps the U/G mismatch created by the first cytosine deamination aids cooperative access of independent AID molecules to other cytosines. However, one may expect that both DNA strands would benefit from the unannealed U/G gap or tilt in DNA topology if it resulted in the consecutive assembly of multiple AID molecules. In our experiments, very few individual plasmids had mutations on both DNA strands but most had multiple mutations, often in consecutive Cs, on the same strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082678/DC1">S1&#x02013;S11</ext-link>). Also, because the reactions with 40 ng AID had only approximately one AID molecule per 100 cytosines, a cooperative mode is difficult to envision (Figs. S9&#x02013;S11). Furthermore, it was found by AFM that most AID/DNA interactions comprised only an AID monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Thus, our findings support previous suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) and reasonably convincing evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>) that AID may act processively.</p><p>How can the first &#x0223c;100 nt of Ig genes disallow C deamination by AID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>)? May a positioned nucleosome be responsible for the lack of mutations in the first 100 or so bp of Ig genes? As we have shown in this paper, nucleosomes can be targeted by AID in vitro when transcribed, and it is expected that this will be confirmed in vivo. The positioning sequence we used is not expected to result in a nucleosome structure that differs vastly from the average nucleosome, as it exhibits the same sequence features found in natural nucleosomes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), is close in nucleosome affinity to those of natural sequences in the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), and is not evidently deleterious when integrated into the yeast genome in vivo (unpublished data). However, the first transcribed nucleosome may have an unusual structure; for example, genome wide, nucleosomes at the start of transcription are greatly enriched in H2A.Z at the expense of conventional H2A histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). The role of H2A.Z is controversial and there may be other as yet unknown modifications of the first nucleosome. Indeed, the first nucleosome comprises the region where abortive transcripts are frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). It remains, thus, to further investigate the intriguing lack of SHMs at the start of AID target genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Plasmid construction.</title><p>A BglII site and a KpnI site were inserted into plasmid <italic>pKMT7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) between 2595 and 2596 and between 2655 and 2656, respectively, to produce plasmid <italic>pBK</italic>.

To test quenching efficiency, EDTA was added before addition of the nucleosomes to separately generate the zero time point. At each time point, a 10-&#x000b5;l aliquot of the reaction was quenched with EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mM EDTA. A final concentration of 1 mg/ml of proteinase K and 0.02% SDS was added to each time point to remove the histone octamer from the DNA. The samples were run on denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels with 7 M urea in TBE. The sequencing ladders were prepared with a SequiTherm Excel II DNA sequencing kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies). The sequencing reactions were done with the cy3- or cy5-labeled primers used to prepare the mp2-50 DNA molecule described in the previous sections and the unlabeled mp2 DNA molecule itself. Ladders were prepared separately with ddATP and ddTTP. This allowed the direct comparison of the exonuclease III&#x02013;digested nucleosomal DNA to the different lengths of the same MP2-247 DNA. After denaturing PAGE, the gel was imaged by a Typhoon 8600 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare), which detects cy3 and cy5 separately. This allowed us to detect the two DNA strands within the same gel and, therefore, did not require separate exonuclease III reactions for each of the DNA strands. In addition, the cy3 and cy5 ladders could be loaded in the same lanes to increase accuracy of the mapping gel readout.</p></sec><sec><title>AID purification.</title><p>The baculovirus GST-AID plasmid vector was a gift from M.
