At postnatal day 21, we find that P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor in addition to Purkinje neurons, is abundant on neuronal specializations identified as noradrenergic by anatomical, morphological and biochemical features. P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor immunoreactivity colocalizes with dopamine &#x003b2;-hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, neurofilament light chain, synaptophysin and flotillin, but not with glial fibrillary acidic protein for astrocytes. P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is found enriched in membrane microdomains such as lipid rafts, in cerebellar synaptic vesicles, and is moreover visualized on synaptic varicosities by electron microscopy analysis. When examined at postnatal day 7, P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor immunoreactivity is instead predominantly expressed only on Bergmann and astroglial cells, as shown by colocalization with glial fibrillary acidic protein rather then neuronal markers. At this age, we moreover identify that P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor-positive Bergmann fibers wrap up doublecortin-positive granule cells stretching along them, while migrating through the cerebellar layers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Membrane components including purinergic receptors are already known to mediate cellular contact and aggregation in platelets.

Because of their heterogeneous faculty of responding to several diverse nucleotides, interest is growing on discovering the exact localization of the various P2 receptor subunits in selected organs, tissues and cellular phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. To date, seven different ionotropic P2X (P2X<sub>1&#x02013;7</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and eight distinct metabotropic P2Y (P2Y<sub>1,2,4,6,11,12,13,14</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] receptors were cloned from mammalian species. In contrast to P2X ion channels, P2Y proteins hold the general feature of G protein-coupled receptors with seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. Since activation of P2Y subtypes leads to second messenger cascades, their response is slower than that mediated by P2X subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Among P2Y receptors, an elevated expression particularly of the P2Y<sub>1 </sub>subtype was detected in both human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and rat brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In human tissue, expression of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>protein is reported exclusively on neuronal cells in cerebral and cerebellar cortex, in hippocampus, caudate-putamen nuclei, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus and midbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover, P2Y<sub>1 </sub>protein appears associated to neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in postmortem brain of Alzheimer's disease patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. On the contrary, P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor in rat is detected not only on grey matter, particularly cerebellar, cortical and hippocampal neurons, but also on white matter of corpus callosum and optic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Many studies have already highlighted a general role for purinergic signaling in brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and in neuron and/or glia function and communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For instance, activation particularly of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is suggested to regulate oligodendrocyte progenitor functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], whereas reduced levels of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>protein apparently affect proliferation and migration, but not differentiation of neural progenitor cells during early CNS development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. With the present work, we further study P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor and compare protein distribution in juvenile versus neonatal rat cerebellum. We show that during postnatal growth, the phenotypic appearance of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>protein undergoes a drastic switch from glial to neuronal localization, therefore suggesting this receptor as a novel marker of cerebellar development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is present on tyrosine hydroxylase- and dopamine &#x003b2;-hydroxylase-positive neurons in juvenile rat cerebellum</title><p>We describe in this work the topographic cellular and subcellular in vivo distribution of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor protein in the cerebellum of juvenile rat at postnatal day 21 (P21). We show by confocal microscopy that P2Y<sub>1 </sub>protein immunoreactivity is uniformly distributed throughout specific zones of cerebellar cortex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Confirming what was previously depicted by immunohistochemical observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], our immunofluorescence studies indicate that P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is limited to Purkinje cell (pc) bodies and ramifications, to neuropil of molecular layer (ml), and to axons of white matter irradiating into granule (gl) and Purkinje (pl) layers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In addition, we show that specific P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor staining is absent from NeuN-positive granule cell bodies, but present on the conspicuous array of fibers irradiating into the cerebellum and spreading out their projections to granular, Purkinje and molecular layers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In sagital cerebellar sections, we see by confocal analysis that P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor immunoreactivity colocalizes with thick, straight and bundled neurofilament light chain (NFL) fluorescence, specific for neuronal processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), and with dopamine &#x003b2;-hydroxylase (D&#x003b2;H), specific for noradrenergic neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We find that, differently from NFL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), nerve fibers immunoreactive for both TH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) or D&#x003b2;H (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor can be much thinner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, arrows), sparse, unbundled and winding and, moreover, display abundant varicosities and beaded appearance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, inset c; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, arrow head and inset). Although P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor labeling is not uniformly distributed along the entire fiber, and not all D&#x003b2;H ramifications are P2Y<sub>1 </sub>positive, P2Y<sub>1 </sub>fibers are densely detected in the white matter of each cerebellar folium without distinction among lobules, sometimes in contact with perikarya (data not shown). At higher magnification and by triple immunofluorescence confocal analysis, we observe that a blue Calbindin-positive Purkinje axon is surrounded by yellow colocalizing signals of red P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor and green D&#x003b2;H (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In this particular fiber, the P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is absent from the Purkinje axon, but enriched on noradrenergic terminals on the same axon. Moreover, the numerous and large varicosities (1&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;m diameter) of TH-positive fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] directly express P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, inset c) and are, therefore, likely responsible for the beaded appearance of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor immunostaining. By triple immunofluorescence and confocal analysis on histological sections, we further prove that the P2Y<sub>1</sub>receptor-positive varicosities (red immunofluorescence) are enriched in synaptophysin (specific marker of synaptic structures, green immunofluorescence), and flotillin (a lipid rafts-associated integral membrane protein, blue immunofluorescence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], therefore providing a completely overlapping P2Y<sub>1</sub>-synaptophysin-flotillin immunoreactive signal (white immunofluorescence, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The large oval/cuboid staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> insets), as well as the fine punctate staining, further demonstrate the presence of synaptophysin and P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor labeling on synaptic glomeruli.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Map of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor protein in juvenile rat cerebellar cortex</bold>.

We confirm the presence of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor immunoreactive profiles in all cortical layers of juvenile rat cerebellar cortex, although more abundantly in gl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), rather than pl or ml (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor immunoreactivity is moreover present on both dendrites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, asterisks) and fine, beaded axons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, white circle, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, arrows) that travel along the cerebellar cortical layers. P2Y<sub>1 </sub>immunoreactive axons are un-myelinated and consist of P2Y<sub>1</sub>-positive small axonal enlargements or varicosities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, black arrow) connected by narrower P2Y<sub>1</sub>-positive inter-varicose segments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, white arrow).

Intervaricose segments do not contain vesicles. The most remarkable feature of the electron microscopy analysis is the absence of visible synaptic specializations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;C</xref>). The P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor-positive varicosities are in fact adjacent to cerebellar elements like granule dendrites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;C</xref>) and cell bodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>), without formation of conventional synaptic junctions (see arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). In addition, specific immunolabelling is observed also in proximal dendrites of Purkinje neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>), and very rarely in cell bodies of granule cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).

Whereas in total cerebellar extracts the P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is recognized as a major protein band of approximately 120 kDa and a minor band of about 42 kDa (molecular mass expected from aminoacid sequence analysis) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), the specific form recognized in the absence of the antigenic peptide by the P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor antiserum in the low density fractions of the sucrose gradient (together with the lipid rafts marker flotillin-2) corresponds not to the monomeric, but to the oligomeric protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). This is not surprising, since SDS-resistant oligomeric forms of this receptor are frequently reported, for instance in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, and suggested to be the functional forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Consistently, when the receptor antiserum used to identify P2Y<sub>1 </sub>protein is pre-incubated with the immunizing peptide, the reactivity not only to the monomeric, but also to the oligomeric band is completely abolished (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref>), therefore confirming the specificity of the antigen-antiserum interactions. This is further proved by the result that the P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor polyclonal antiserum used in this study is able to efficiently immunoprecipitate the recombinant Myc-P2Y<sub>1 </sub>human receptor transiently transfected in SH-SY5Y cells and detected by the anti-myc 9E10 antibody (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor localizes in lipid rafts</bold>.

With the only exception of calbindin-positive pc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>), we find that P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor localization is completely different from that observed at P21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>, inset). At P7, P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor immunoreactivity is indeed absent from noradrenergic fibers of white matter, but predominantly shown: a) on fibers irradiating the thin ml (above the pl) and the external granule (or germinal) layers (egl) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>); b) on cell bodies aligned at the interface between the pc and ml (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>, upper-left inset); c) on isolated cells located in the igl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor immunostaining is thus totally absent from NFL-positive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>) and TH- or D&#x003b2;H-positive fibers (data not shown), which already span into the gl at this age of development. By means of distinctive morphology of cerebellar astrocytes and positive colocalization between P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor and GFAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>), at P7 we do identify P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor on both Bergmann cell bodies/fibers and astroglial cells scattered among granule neurons. This is confirmed for postnatal day one (data not shown), but is the opposite of what was shown at P21, when P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is totally absent from GFAP-positive structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>, lower-right inset) and present only on neuronal fibers (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Conversely, the enrichment of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor in lipid rafts, but not synaptosomal fractions, is confirmed also at P7 (data not shown), therefore appearing as a conserved feature of this receptor.</p><p>It's well known that, during development, Bergmann fibers are associated with migrating granule cells, from which is derived the concept of glia-guided neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and that DCX is a distinctive marker of granule cells only during the period of radial descent into the deep cerebellar layers, when it directs neuronal movement through the organization and stability of microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Therefore, we used DCX immunoreactivity to observe the potential relationship between Bergmann glia (P2Y<sub>1</sub>-positive only at neonatal ages P1&#x02013;P7) and granule neurons. We find that at P7, the DCX-positive signal appears as a diffuse labeling on both the entire igl and the thin ml enriched in radially migrating granule cells, but is excluded by the pre-migratory P2Y<sub>1</sub>-expressing egl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>). Given the high density, amoeboid shape and lack of defined neuronal contour of migrating granule cells at this neonatal age, the DCX-positive staining appears contiguous to P2Y<sub>1</sub>-GFAP fibers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref> inset), providing an almost overlapping signal when observed at low magnification (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>, yellow fluorescence). Nevertheless, at higher resolution it is possible to distinguish that DCX-positive granule cells are wrapped up and stretched along P2Y<sub>1</sub>-GFAP-positive Bergmann fibers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref> inset). On the opposite, when at P21 the egl almost disappears after complete proliferation and migration of granule neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the DCX immunostaining is confined to a very narrow zone below the pc (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>, inset) and P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is no longer detected on Bergmann glia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref> lower-right inset and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Map of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor protein in neonatal versus juvenile rat cerebellar cortex</bold>.

To this purpose, we analyzed P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression at P21, when the major structural changes already took place in the developing cerebellum, and compared it with expression at P7, when migration of granule neurons from the molecular to the granular layer is still occurring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and when the neuronal bodies in the locus coeruleus of origin for the dorsal bundle of noradrenergic neurons innervating the cerebellum are spreading out their projections to the granular, Purkinje and molecular layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In juvenile rat cerebellum we find that, in addition to Purkinje cell bodies and ramifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is abundant on neuronal specializations identified as noradrenergic by anatomical (the fibers travel in linear, sparse and different thickness profiles through the gl, and branch into radially and longitudinally oriented chains), ultrastructural (abundance of synaptic varicosities and winding, beaded appearance) and biochemical features (immunoreactivity with noradrenergic-specific D&#x003b2;H absent from Purkinje neurons in rat) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Moreover, we observe that P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is preferentially localized on synaptic varicosities of the noradrenergic fibers and synaptic glomeruli, which can be recognized by the presence of synaptophysin. The ultrastructural analysis confirms the localization of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor on varicosities of axon terminals, moreover showing features indicative of a particular modality of transmitter release. As generally reported for noradrenergic fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the absence of conventional synaptic junctions led us to suppose that in the cerebellum also extracellular nucleotides might exert their modulatory action through paracrine release or simple diffusion in the extracellular space. This modality has the advantage to extend the potential effects of extracellular nucleotides, and neurotransmitters in general, to structures equipped with adequate receptors (extra-synaptic receptors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], but distant from the source of release (volume transmission) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The enrichment in these P2Y<sub>1</sub>-positive varicosities of both synaptophysin and the lipid rafts marker flotillin-2 (together with the biochemical observation that P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is indeed a lipid rafts-resident protein in total cerebellar tissue and cerebellar synaptosomes) furthermore suggests that the role of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is likely mediated by lipid microdomains. In this regard, it is already well-known that lipid rafts display a key part in the targeting and functional organization of proteins at both synapses and spines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Since a further specification of the central noradrenergic system consists in the frequency of co-transmission phenomena, the presence in the cerebellum of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor on noradrenergic neurons in addition to Purkinje cells might signify that extracellular nucleotides such as the natural agonists ATP and ADP could contribute in this brain region to the physiological role of noradrenaline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In this regard, ATP is already well known to be co-released with noradrenaline in various PNS and CNS neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Thus, if co-release and synergism occur at cerebellar synapses as well, nucleotide-dependent increase of cerebellar noradrenergic signaling could be achieved. Homologous recombination techniques have shown that complete removal of either the enzymes responsible for noradrenaline metabolism or the vesicular monoamine transporter has deleterious consequences for foetal survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Moreover, blockade of postsynaptic noradrenergic receptors decreases the rate of learning in several cerebellar-dependent motor tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The possibility of integrating and complementing noradrenergic with purinergic mechanisms to increase the strength of synaptic connections through activation of both noradrenergic and P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptors might therefore constitute also a novel powerful approach against neuronal degeneration and/or malfunctioning in the cerebellum.</p><p>The presence of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor in postnatal rat cerebellum was then analyzed before the formation of noradrenergic synaptic connections takes place. Surprisingly, we have shown here that P2Y<sub>1 </sub>undergoes a drastic switch during development, with a phenotypic expression resembling that of Bergmann glia at P7, rather then noradrenergic neurons at P21. In this regard, it is well established that a number of neuronal and glial receptor systems and/or diffusible factors act to induce and maintain Bergmann glia process extension at an early stage of postnatal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], when Bergmann cells specialize in supporting the migration of granule neurons and migration of granule cells seems to be largely dependent on their interaction with glial processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In particular, the ErbB4 tyrosine kinase receptor present on Bergmann glia appears to have a distinct role in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], interacting with neoregulin expressed on migrating granule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. On the other hand, in vitro studies on the migration of granule neurons demonstrated that the glycoprotein astrotactin provides a neuronal receptor system for migration along glial processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Thus, P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression only on Bergmann glia at an early stage of development might sustain a role for purinergic receptors in signaling events needed for interaction and migration of neurons. This is strongly supported by the result that ADP, preferential ligand for P2Y<sub>1</sub>receptor, induces Ca<sup>2+ </sup>mobilization in Bergman glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The factors produced by granule neurons to induce the glial scaffold might thus comprise the purinergic ligands ATP and ADP directly targeting P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptors. To support this hypothesis, we have both shown here that P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is localized at the interface between Bergmann glia and DCX-positive migrating granule cells, and previously demonstrated that, at least in vitro, granule neurons can release ATP, which is easily degraded to ADP in the extracellular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. It is finally well known that, once migration across the glia scaffold is completed and cells change their repertoire of adhesive molecules and switch into a static asset: a) the Bergmann glia loses the apposition with granule neurons; b) the granule cells are locked in position by the formation of new specific axon-target interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In parallel, we have demonstrated here that in juvenile rat cerebellum: a) the Bergmann glia lose P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptors; b) P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptors appear on Purkinje and noradrenergic neurons forming new specific axon-target interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Since membrane components of the cell surface are largely known to mediate the close apposition between two cells during all phases of development, our results suggest a novel role for P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor in the CNS, specifically in cell junction/communication. This already occurs on platelets, where P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor is well known to mediate cell contact and aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Considering the glia-neuron switch of P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor a novel biological mechanism of development, aim of further studies will be to investigate the potential impact of this receptor on Bergman glia-guided migration of granule neurons; on alteration/reorganization of noradrenergic fibers in the cerebellar cortex in response to the degeneration of their major target, granule and Purkinje neurons; and finally to investigate if the presence of purinergic ligands in the environment surrounding noradrenergic fibers can influence their anatomical integrity and development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Histological procedures</title><p>Wistar rats (Harlan, Udine, Italy) of different ages were deeply anesthetized by i.p. injections of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg), and transcardially perfused with saline (0.9% NaCl) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, in phosphate buffer (PB, 0.1 M pH 7.4).

Rabbit anti-P2Y<sub>1 </sub>(1:500, Alomone, Jerusalem-Israel) was used in combination with either mouse anti-Calbindin-D-28K (1:200, Sigma, Mi-Italy), mouse anti-Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH, 1:500, Sigma), mouse anti-Dopamine &#x003b2;-Hydroxylase (D&#x003b2;H, 1:500, Chemicon International, Inc.

To allow the use of a second mouse antibody in the same immunolabeling protocol, the unlabeled monoclonal anti-NeuN (Neuronal Nuclei, mouse IgG<sub>1 </sub>isotype or anti-Calbindin-D-28K (mouse IgG<sub>1 </sub>isotype)) or Flotillin-2 (mouse IgG<sub>1 </sub>isotype) were labeled with Zenon technology (Molecular Probes, Oregon, USA). Briefly, mouse anti-NeuN (1:100, Chemicon International), mouse anti-Flotillin-2 (1:100, BD Biosciences, San Jos&#x000e9;, CA) and mouse anti-Calbindin-D-28K (1:200, Sigma) were separately incubated with Zenon Alexa Fluor 647 mouse IgG<sub>1 </sub>labeling reagent (molar ratio 6:1), which contains a fluorophore-labeled (Ex/Em 650/668) anti-mouse Fab fragments. The labeled Fab fragments bind to the Fc portion of the monoclonal antibodies and excess Fab fragments are neutralized by the addition of a nonspecific IgG (Zenon blocking reagent-mouse IgG). The addition of non-specific IgG prevents cross-labeling of the Fab fragment, in experiments where multiple primary antibodies of the same type are present. After rehydration in PBS, the sections were incubated with the staining solution in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBT) in a humidified chamber for 2 hs at room temperature. The sections were washed twice in PBT and for 5 min in PBS at room temperature.

Immunoreactivity for P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor was detected by means of the avidin-biotin peroxidase method.

Then, sections were incubated in a solution containing primary antibody against P2Y<sub>1 </sub>receptor (rabbit anti-P2Y<sub>1</sub>diluted 1:200) in PB for 24 hs at 4&#x000b0;C. After several washes in PBS, sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit diluted 1:100 Vectastain Elite, Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) in PB for 3 hs at room temperature. They were then incubated in avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (diluted 1:100 in PB; Vectastain Elite, Vector Labs.) for 1 h. After washing, immunolabeling was revealed by incubation of the sections in 0.05% 3,3'-diaminobenzidine solution (DAB-Sigma) diluted in Tris-HCl buffer, in the presence of 0.01% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The reaction was stopped by several washes in Tris-HCl buffer followed by PBS.

The labelled profiles were examined in thirty-two ultra-thin sections from three separate rats, in four sections each taken from the vermis, the cerebellar hemispheres and the cerebellar nuclei. Electron micrographs of immunoreactive structures were taken at magnifications of 7000&#x02013;30000 X, then printed and used as the sampling region of each block. The classification of neuronal elements was made according to the description of Peters et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Neuronal somata were identified by the nucleus, Golgi apparatus, and rough endoplasmic reticulum; un-myelinated axons were distinguished from dendrites by their larger diameter and/or the abundance of uniformly distributed microtubules and synaptic inputs from axon terminals. Neuronal profiles were classified as un-myelinated axons if they were 0.1&#x02013;0.25 &#x003bc;m in cross sectional diameter and contained microtubules and/or small vescicles. Axon terminals were defined as elements 0.25 &#x003bc;m or larger in diameter containing numerous small synaptic vescicles. Synapses formed by axon terminals were defined as asymmetric, when their post-synaptic density was thicker that the pre-synaptic one, and as symmetric, when both membranes showed equal electron density.
