In the present study, we investigated the expression and regulation of uterine and placental TRPV6 during gestation in rodents. Uterine TRPV6 peaked at pregnancy day (P) 0.5, P5.5 and, P13.5 and was detected in uterine epithelium and glands of rats, while placental TRPV6 mRNA levels increased in mid-gestation. Uterine and placental TRPV6 mRNA levels in rats appear to cyclically change during pregnancy, suggesting that TRPV6 may participate in the implantation process. In addition, uterine TRPV6 mRNA is only expressed in placenta-unattached areas of the uterus, and uterine TRPV6 immunoreactivity was observed in luminal and glandular epithelial cells. In the placenta, TRPV6 was detected in the labyrinth and spongy zone. These results may indicate that TRPV6 has at least two functions: implantation of the embryo and maintenance of pregnancy. To investigate the pathway(s) mediating TRPV6 expression in rodents, anti-steroid hormone antagonists were injected prior to maximal TRPV6 expression. In rats, TRPV6 expression was reduced by RU486 (an anti-progesterone) through progesterone receptors, and ICI 182,780 (an anti-estrogen) blocked TRPV6 expression via estrogen receptors in mice. The juxtaposition of uterine and placental TRPV6 expressed in these tissues supports the notion that TRPV6 participates in transferring calcium ions between the maternal and fetal compartments. Taken together, TRPV6 gene may function as a key element in controlling calcium transport in the uterus between the embryo and the placenta during pregnancy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Uterine calcium ions are considered to be a critical factor for smooth muscle contraction and embryo implantation. At the implantation stage, these ions may help in secreting uterine extra-cellular matrix components at the site of implantation, and during pregnancy and labor calcium ions may regulate uterine tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Despite these critical roles of calcium, the regulation of uterine calcium levels is not yet fully understood. In calcium absorbing organs, i.e., intestine and kidney which express several calcium processing proteins, the regulation and function of calcium ions and the associated genes are relatively well understood. Calcium ions are processed via entering, transporting, and extruding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member (TRPV) 5 and 6 were found in apical membranes of intestinal and renal epithelial cells, and are proposed as mediators for calcium uptake during trans-cellular transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Cytosolic calbindin-D9k and -28 k transport calcium ions from apical to basolateral layers, and theses ions are finally extruded from the cell membrane via plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ATPase and sodium-calcium exchanger 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the past decade, uterine calcium-binding proteins have been studied to elucidate the function of uterine calcium ions, however their regulation and mechanisms of action are not completely resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In female reproductive organs, <italic>TRPV6 </italic>is expressed in the uterus as well as in the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In calcium absorbing organs, TRPV6 expression is regulated by vitamin D, estrogen and dietary calcium. An active form of vitamin D increases duodenal calcium absorption, and abnormally low calcium absorption has been observed in vitamin D receptor-knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Dietary calcium can also induce duodenal and renal <italic>TRPV6 </italic>mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and estrogen therapy in menopausal women induces duodenal <italic>TRPV6 </italic>mRNA, suggesting that this hormone independently modulates TRPV6 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. TRPV6 of the female reproductive organs is robustly expressed; however its exact role is reproduction is not clearly understood. In the previous study, we reported that rat <italic>TRPV6 </italic>is expressed in the uterine endometrium and glandular endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and is up-regulated at diestrus in matured animals and by progesterone supplementation in immature or ovariectomized animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, the physiological significance of TRPV6/Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channel in maternal-fetal Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transport was investigated using TRPV6 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], demonstrating that Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration in fetal blood and amniotic fluid was significantly lower and the transport activity of radioactive Ca<sup>2+ </sup>from mother to fetuses was 40% lower in TRPV6 KO fetuses than in WTs. Progesterone appears to be a dominant regulator of <italic>TRPV6 </italic>via progesterone receptor activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In a mouse model, uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression varied during estrous cycles, however it was dominantly observed at the estrous stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, estrogen seemed to be a major factor in the regulation of uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>transcription via estrogen receptor &#x003b1; pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the role of TRPV6 in the implantation process during pregnancy is not yet determined.</p><p>Thus, in the present study, we employed a rat model to examine the expression of <italic>TRPV6 </italic>mRNA in the uterus and placenta during pregnancy. In addition, we investigated whether sex hormones regulate uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression in rats and mice during pregnancy, using antagonists for estrogen and progesterone. Finally, we further determined the localization of TRPV6 protein in the uterus and placenta to elucidate the role of this protein during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and treatments</title><p>Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 12-week-old; female, 10-week-old) and pregnant ICR mice (12 to 15-week-old) were obtained from KOATECH (Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, Korea).

In the previous study, steroid hormone-induced regulation of murine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>transcription was shown by using ICI or RU at P10, a point in gestation when <italic>TRPV6 </italic>was previously reported to be highly expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, treatment with ICI significantly reduced uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression, whereas RU did not affect uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>transcription levels in the mouse uterus. In addition, <italic>TRPV6 </italic>gene was significantly down-regulated by ICI, while RU did not alter its mRNA levels in the mouse placenta (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that uterine and placental <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression may be primarily regulated by estrogen during non-pregnancy and pregnancy in mice. This regulation of <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression by estrogen in mice is in contrast to progesterone-mediated regulation in rats.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Several uterine calcium-regulating genes are alternatively expressed during estrous cycle and pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the implantation period, calcium-binding proteins appear to play a central role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Calbindins are required during the early phase of embryo implantation, implying that the regulation of calcium availability in the vicinity of the implanting embryo is critical for successful implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although the importance of calbindins in implantation has been established, the precise role of calcium ions during implantation remains unclear. Other calcium processing genes have recently been identified in female reproductive organs, and TRPV6 is an interesting protein in elucidating uterine process of calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Uterine expression of <italic>TRPV6 </italic>varies during the estrous cycle in rodents. For instance, rat <italic>TRPV6 </italic>transcripts in the uterus were highly expressed at diestrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], while mouse <italic>TRPV6 </italic>mRNA was highly expressed at estrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Distinct their expression patterns indicate that uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>is differentially regulated during the estrous cycle in rats and mice. During pregnancy, mouse <italic>TRPV6 </italic>mRNA is actively expressed with maximal expression observed in the middle of gestation, followed by a reduction in the late period. Immediately prior to birth, another high level of <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression is observed, which disappears during lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the present study, rat uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>was modestly expressed at P0.5, which corroborates previous reports; and this gene was up-regulated by progesterone at the diestrous stage in a rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In days after P0.5, <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression gradually decreased and was undetected at P4.5. However, at P5.5 a substantial increase and peak in <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression was observed. This time point coincides with the earliest sign of the implantation attachment reaction which occurs around P4 or P5 in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Therefore, the maximal expression of <italic>TRPV6 </italic>gene at P5.5 may be related to the regulation of uterine calcium ion concentration required for successful implantation. Calbindin-D9k, another uterine calcium associated protein, gradually increases at pregnancy day 16.5, peaks at day 18.5, and declines at birth and the beginning of lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A comparison of uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>and <italic>calbindin-D9k </italic>time-dependent expressions in pregnant rats suggests that these proteins may share in the function for maintaining uterine calcium concentrations during pregnancy.</p><p>In mice, uterine calbindin-D9k showed a gradual increase in mRNA expression during late pregnancy (from day 12.5 to 18.5), followed by a decline at birth and during lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It has also been reported that serum estrogen levels increase at the end of pregnancy and decline sharply following birth and during lactation, whereas serum progesterone levels remain constant throughout late gestation and lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. With regard to these studies, it is possible that increased serum estrogen levels induce uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>transcription at birth and during pregnancy, and that TRPV6 ceases during lactation when secreted estrogen is no longer present. It was previously shown that mouse <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression in the placenta initially follows the pattern of uterine expression, with an induction in the middle of gestation (P10.5 and P14.5) but not at the end of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>TRPV6 </italic>seems to have a positive influence on transplacental calcium ion concentrations and to be a crucial factor in fetal development, because it is highly expressed in human placenta as compared to levels in other organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In the present study, placental expression of <italic>TRPV6 </italic>gene steadily increased from P12.5 to P20.5 before labor in rats. Taken together, these results imply that constitutive expressions of TRPV6 and/or other calcium processing genes may play a crucial role in transporting calcium ions from maternal to fetal compartment during pregnancy. In addition, the changes in the uterine transcript levels of TRPV6 as a function of pregnancy may be largely a reflection of myometrial changes in its expression in both rats and mice.</p><p>Rat TRPV6 protein was detected in the endometrial layer, glandular epithelium and implantation site of the gestating uterus. This spatial pattern of TRPV6 expression between uterus and placenta was previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In parallel with TRPV6, rodent calbindin-D9k was detected predominantly in luminal epithelial cells of the uterus of pregnant rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The similar spatial distribution of these gene products further supports the concept of a complementary function for TRPV6 and calbindin-D9k in the control of calcium ions during pregnancy. In rodent models, placental localization of TRPV6 protein in the labyrinth and spongy zone implies that this protein may take part in transporting calcium ions between fetus and dam. In regard to its expression levels during pregnancy, the expression of TRPV6 protein would be highest in the myometrium as shown in this study.</p><p>Progesterone has been implicated as a major regulator in the expression of <italic>TRPV6 </italic>during the rat estrous cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The progesterone receptor antagonist (RU) significantly blocked progesterone-induced <italic>TRPV6 </italic>gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The expression of uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>mRNA at P5.5 was completely inhibited by RU treatment, and partially inhibited by treatments with ICI. Partial inhibition of <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression by ICI may be attributed to the action of estrogen receptor at estrogen response elements (EREs) found in the promoter region of the progesterone receptor gene. Although ICI partially down-regulated <italic>TRPV6 </italic>gene in the rat uterus, progesterone and its receptor appear to primarily control uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>transcripts in this tissue during pregnancy.</p><p>A recent study provides the first in vivo evidence that TRPV6 is involved in maternal-fetal Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transport, proposing that TRPV6 functions as a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>entry pathway, which is critical for fetal Ca<sup>2+ </sup>homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, a phenotype of mice with targeted disruption of <italic>TRPV6 </italic>gene was reported. <italic>TRPV6 </italic>knockout (KO) mice showed disordered Ca<sup>2+ </sup>homeostasis and reduced fertility, and deficient maternal-fetal transfer of calcium ions caused abnormal calcium ion deficiency during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In this study, placental TRPV6 expression is expected to enhance the rate of maternal transfer of calcium ions to the fetus during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the present study, the expression of placental <italic>TRPV6 </italic>mRNA in rats was blocked by RU treatment, but no significant inhibitory effect was observed for ICI treatments, suggesting that placental <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression is under the sole control of progesterone via a progesterone receptor-mediated pathway. However we cannot rule out the possibility that the difference in their doses may account for the observed difference between rats and mice.</p><p>In contrast to rats, it was previously reported that murine uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>transcription at normal estrous cycles was totally dependent on estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>mRNA levels increased at mid and late pregnancy, and were strongly induced at mid-pregnancy in the labyrinth and spongy zones of the placenta, and in the fetal membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To examine an expression pattern of TRPV6 transcripts by steroids compared to its level in rats during pregnancy, we treated the mice with steroids, E2 and P4, and isolated the identical tissues from them to measure TRPV6 levels. In the present study, sex steroids controlled uterine and placental <italic>TRPV6 </italic>expression during pregnancy. The expression of uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>mRNA at P10 was blocked by ICI, and placental <italic>TRPV6 </italic>transcription was blocked by ICI, suggesting that the expression of <italic>TRPV6 </italic>was primarily regulated by estrogen in gestating uteri and placenta during pregnancy in mice. These results suggest that <italic>TRPV6 </italic>may be distinctly regulated by different sex steroids, progesterone in rats and estrogen in mice, in spite of shared similarities in their chromosomal make-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>These results show that uterine and placental <italic>TRPV6 </italic>mRNA levels in rats appear to cyclically change during pregnancy, suggesting that TRPV6 protein may participate in the implantation process. It was of interest to note that uterine <italic>TRPV6 </italic>mRNA is only expressed in placenta-unattached areas of the uterus, indicating that <italic>TRPV6 </italic>has at least two functions: implantation of the embryo and maintenance of pregnancy. In rats, <italic>TRPV6 </italic>transcription appeared to be solely controlled by P4 through PRs, while its level was regulated by E2 via ERs in mice. In both rodents, uterine TRPV6 immunoreactivity was observed in luminal and glandular epithelial cells, and in the placenta TRPV6 was detected in the labyrinth and spongy zone. The juxtaposition of uterine and placental TRPV6 expressed in these tissues can support a novel concept that TRPV6 participates in transporting calcium ions between the maternal and fetal compartments. In conclusion, TRPV6 gene may function as a key element in controlling calcium transport in the uterus between the embryo and the placenta during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BL carried out the overall experiments including animal treatments and molecular experiments.
