The processes leading to airway remodeling are poorly understood, and there is increasing evidence that even aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy does not completely prevent this process. We sought to investigate whether TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>stimulates bronchial epithelial cells to undergo transition to a mesenchymal phenotype, and whether this transition can be abrogated by corticosteroid treatment or enhanced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>BEAS-2B and primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells were stimulated with TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence microscopy and zymography.

Persistent asthma is characterized by structural changes termed airway remodeling. This ongoing remodeling and reconstruction of the asthmatic lung includes subepithelial fibrosis, myofibroblast hyperplasia, myocyte hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy, thickening of the lamina reticularis, and increased smooth muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The more rapid decline in lung function over time in asthmatics is considered to be at least partly caused by this remodeling process. While the impact of corticosteroid treatment on airway remodeling is controversial, even aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy with corticosteroids does not appear to fully prevent remodeling and these long term effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is important, therefore, to understand both the processes that contribute to remodeling in asthma as well as the impact of corticosteroids on these processes.</p><p>Myofibroblasts are considered a hallmark feature of the remodeling process in asthma. They are a morphological intermediate between fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, and display increased synthetic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Histologic examination of human asthmatic airways has revealed the presence of myofibroblasts in the proximity of both the smooth muscle layer and the lamina reticularis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Due to their highly synthetic nature they are thought to contribute significantly to the thickening of the airway basement membrane. Myofibroblasts also express alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;SMA), and therefore possess contractile properties similar to smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, myofibroblasts have been proposed to be capable of fully differentiating into smooth muscle cells thereby contributing to the increased smooth muscle mass observed in chronic asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The origin of lung myofibroblasts has remained ill defined. Classically, myofibroblasts were thought to arise from the underlying fibroblast tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Blood-circulating fibrocytes, which can home to the site of fibrotic tissue, have also been proposed as a source of lung myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recently, the hypothesis that myofibroblasts arise from epithelial cells through epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. EMT is a process in which epithelial cells may revert to synthetically active mesenchymal fibroblast-like cells, and is recognized as a crucial component of normal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In recent years it has been recognized, initially in epithelial cancer, that mature epithelial cells can undergo a second round of EMT, leading to a hyperactive and invasive, motile cell type.</p><p>In tubular epithelial cells in the kidney, EMT can be induced by TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, leading to increased collagen deposition and disruption of the epithelial integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>is known to be expressed by a variety of inflammatory and structural lung cells in asthma, and is also recognized to be involved in lung fibrosis. Recent publications in the field of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) also point to the alveolar epithelium as a major contributor to fibrosis by undergoing EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Studies employing the cancer derived human alveolar epithelial cell line, A549, have confirmed the ability of alveolar epithelial cells to undergo EMT <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Less is known, however, regarding the ability of human bronchial epithelial cells to undergo EMT. In a recent study of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) in chronic rejection of lung allografts, Ward et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] showed compelling evidence for EMT occurring in bronchial airway epithelial cells in vivo, suggesting a link between injury and remodeling. While there has been no clear evidence that EMT occurs in patients with asthma, Hackett et al. demonstrated that TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>induces EMT in both normal and asthmatic primary bronchial epithelial cells <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Although, the regulation of TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>in asthma remains incompletely understood, many investigators have reported increased TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>levels in asthma. Compared to normal subjects, asthmatic subjects were found to have elevated TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and bronchial biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The increase in TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>was shown to persist despite oral corticosteroid treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and to correlate with basement membrane thickness and fibroblast number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that bronchial epithelial cells may also undergo EMT during chronic asthmatic inflammation, thereby providing an additional source for myofibroblasts, and contributing to the remodeling process observed in the asthmatic lung. Here we report evidence, that TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>induces EMT in the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B as well as in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). We further demonstrate that IL-1&#x003b2; may assist in EMT by initiating crucial changes in protein expression pattern. Pre-treatment with corticosteroids inhibited some of the EMT changes but had no impact on the majority of changes. Our findings suggest that bronchial epithelial cells do undergo TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-induced EMT and synthesize matrix proteins, and that corticosteroid treatment does not completely prevent this process. Bronchial epithelial cell EMT may thus be a significant contributor to the contractile and fibrotic remodeling process that accompanies chronic asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary NHBE (Lonza, Wakersville, MD) and transformed human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B (CRL-9609; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown as monolayers in 100% humidity and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C in serum-free defined growth media (BEGM, Lonza) or keratinocyte media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

These clinical observations have been linked to structural changes in the asthmatic lung termed airway remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The pathogenesis of airway remodeling has been previously attributed to reactivation of the epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit in which increased levels of TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>contribute to a state where hypo-proliferative but activated epithelial cells induce activation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

The origin of the lung myofibroblast, however, is still unclear.

In addition, there is emerging evidence in kidney fibrosis and IPF that TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-driven EMT of tubular interstitial epithelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells may represent a significant source of tissue myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].

We hypothesized that exposure of normal bronchial epithelial cells to chronic TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>stimulation would cause them to undergo EMT, potentially representing another source of myofibroblasts involved in airway remodeling in asthma. Here we report that BEAS-2B as well as primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells show evidence of EMT upon prolonged <italic>in vitro </italic>stimulation with TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-induced downregulation of the epithelial cell specific adherence junction protein E-cadherin at both the mRNA and protein levels was the earliest effect we observed, reaching near-maximal effect within 24 hours of stimulation in BEAS-2B cells. The loss of cell-cell contact has been shown to be a crucial first event in the remodeling process in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Masszi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] et al. further reported that the disruption of cell-cell contact is a critical regulator for TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>induced EMT in kidney cells. They suggest a two-hit mechanism in which both TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>stimulation as well as initial epithelial injury are required for the induction of EMT. This correlates with the observation that in the asthmatic airway the integrity of the epithelial layer is disrupted, which might therefore facilitate the fibrogenic action of TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>. Further it has been demonstrated that &#x003b2;-catenin, released from the cytosolic portion of E-cadherin, can function as a transcription factor in concert with the lymphoid enhancing factor 1 (LEF1) and induces EMT in epithelial cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Myofibroblasts release a variety of ECM proteins contributing to the thickening of the lamina reticularis, a key feature in the remodeling process of the lung. We found that TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>stimulates increased expression of extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, collagen I and tenascin C) in BEAS-2B cells. Stable expression of a myofibroblast phenotype in renal epithelial cells has been shown to depend on both TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and adherence signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In this regard, TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>induced expression of fibronectin and integrins appeared to be necessary for the subsequent induction of the expression of &#x003b1;SMA in renal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>Because EMT results in an increase in cell migration and invasiveness, we assessed the migratory and invasive capacity of TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>exposed BEAS-2B cells. We observed both increased migration and enhanced invasiveness in BEAS-2B cells subjected to chronic exposure to TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, similar to the results reported by Borthwick et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] of epithelial cells undergoing EMT in the context of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) following lung transplantation. The acquisition of a more motile phenotype of bronchial epithelial cells undergoing EMT might facilitate invasion of the sub-epithelial layer with enhanced contribution to the deposition of excess matrix proteins. Accompanying the increased migratory and invasive phenotype, we also observed elevated production and secretion of MMP-9 and MMP-2. MMP-2 and MMP-9 not only promote a motile cell phenotype through matrix degradation but can also activate latent TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>. Induction of MMP-2 expression has been reported to be an important step in kidney fibrosis by disrupting the basement membrane thereby facilitating the migration of epithelial derived myofibroblasts into the interstitium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Further, asthmatic patients have increased immunoreactivity for MMP-9 in their airway epithelium and submucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Overexpression of MMP-proteins could further contribute to airway remodeling in asthma by feeding into the cycle of excess production and turn-over of matrix proteins. A correlation between fibrosis in asthma and MMP-9 expression has recently been demonstrated in a mouse model of chronic asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. MMP-9 knockout mice showed a modest reduction in fibrosis, although no effect on mucus production or smooth muscle thickness was observed, suggesting a restricted role of MMP-9 in airway remodeling.</p><p>Alpha smooth muscle actin is characteristically expressed in myofibroblasts, enabling contractibility and an overall more invasive motile cell type. We detected upregulation of &#x003b1;SMA on the mRNA as well as protein level in BEAS-2B by days 3 to 4. In a recent clinical study Larsen et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] showed evidence for activated mobile fibroblasts in the BAL fluid of mild asthmatics, which upon stimulation with TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>produced more ECM proteins. These <italic>in vivo </italic>data are consistent with our hypothesis that epithelial cells undergo transition into myofibroblasts in the context of asthma.</p><p>Our results using BEAS-2B cells show that TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>clearly induces EMT in the transformed bronchial epithelial cell line. Importantly, we also observed an almost identical pattern of EMT following stimulation with TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). These results establish that TGF&#x003b2;-induced EMT is not limited to alveolar epithelial cells but can also be induced in normal human bronchial epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is important to note, however, that our experiments utilized normal rather than asthmatic cells. Wound healing is part of the normal response of the epithelium to injury. In asthma the chronic cycle of injury and repair is thought to lead to the deregulation of factors involved, resulting in airway remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Our observations further highlight the possible functional consequences of EMT in both physiologic wound healing as well as pathophysiologic remodeling in the airway. We also studied cells cultured under submerged conditions rather than at the air-liquid interface. A recent report by Hackett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] did study TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>induced EMT in both primary airway epithelial cells from normal and asthmatic donors as well as grown under submerged versus air-liquid interface conditions. They observed no differences between normal and asthmatic cells under submerged conditions. Under air-liquid interface conditions, the only significant difference they observed was that EMT was restricted to the basal cells in normal cultures but was less restricted in asthmatic cultures.</p><p>The inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2; is elevated in BAL fluid of symptomatic asthmatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], and there is evidence for a cross-talk between the TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and IL-1&#x003b2; signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Furthermore, overexpression of IL-1&#x003b2; caused emphysema and fibrosis in the airway walls in a murine model of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] and IL-1&#x003b2; has been shown to induce endothelial to mesenchymal transformation in skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Therefore, we assessed the impact of IL-1&#x003b2; on TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-induced EMT in BEAS-2B cells. By itself, IL-1&#x003b2; induced a statistically significant decrease in E-cadherin expression and a statistically significant increase in tenascin C expression. When added together with TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, IL-1&#x003b2; had a significant additive effect on the changes in expression of these genes. Considering the critical role decreased E-cadherin plays in the initiation of EMT, the limited effect of IL-1&#x003b2; may prove to be biologically significant. Our results are compatible to the report by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] showing synergistic effects of TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and IL-1&#x003b2; on the expression of mesenchymal markers in the A549 cancer cell line, without evidence of induction of EMT by IL-1&#x003b2; alone.</p><p>Bronchial asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder in which corticosteroids have become the first line of therapy. Whereas multiple studies support the benefit of corticosteroid treatment in respect to asthma symptoms and disease exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], there is considerable uncertainty concerning whether corticosteroids significantly slow airway remodeling. Several clinical studies as well as studies using murine models of allergic airway inflammation have suggested that corticosteroids reduce subepithelial fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].

Preincubation of BEAS-2B cells with dexamethasone or budesonide followed by TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>stimulation in a moderate concentration did not prevent the morphological changes or influence the reduction in E-cadherin expression. The effect on the induction of ECM proteins was variable as we observed no reduction of the TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>induced expression of fibronectin-EDA, and a slight reduction in the expression of collagen I and tenascin C. Budesonide, but not dexamethasone, inhibited TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>induced &#x003b1;SMA expression. We did not confirm the lack of efficacy of corticosteroids in abrogating EMT using primary airway epithelial cells, and this will be important to do in future studies.</p><p>These data suggest that corticosteroid have only a modest impact on TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-induced EMT. This finding is consistent with reports that while corticosteroid have proven to be very beneficial in treating asthmatic inflammation, their efficacy in preventing or reversing the remodeling process may be limited. New therapy strategies may need to be developed to target airway remodeling in asthma. TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>has been proposed as a target using anti-sense oligonucleotide, pan specific neutralizing antibodies as well as kinase inhibitors targeting TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>receptors.

Additional studies are clearly needed to both confirm these results in primary asthmatic airway epithelial cells and address whether EMT occurs <italic>in vivo </italic>during asthmatic inflammation. Based on our results we suggest that bronchial epithelial cells might be one source for myofibroblasts in vivo in the asthmatic airway, thereby contributing to airway remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>List Of Abbreviations Used</title><p>&#x003b1;SMA: &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin; BAL: bronchoalveolar lavage; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EMT: epithelial to mesenchymal transition; HRPO: horseradish peroxidase; IPF: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; LEF1: lymphoid enhancing factor 1; MMP: matrix-metalloproteinases; NHBE: normal human bronchial epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AD performed all the experiments in the manuscript and participated in its design.
