In response to replication arrest, the fission yeast Cds1 checkpoint kinase maintains the normal S-phase transcriptional program by regulating MBF, the S-phase transcription factor. We show that similar regulation occurs in response to DNA damage during S-phase. We test the relative contributions to replication-stress resistance of transcriptional regulation and the two other major checkpoint functions: cell-cycle arrest and fork stabilization. We show that, although transcriptional regulation provides only modest resistance relative to fork stabilization, it contributes significantly to cell survival. Finally, we investigate the roles of two specific transcripts: <italic>mik1</italic> and <italic>mrc1</italic>. These results demonstrate the general importance of checkpoint regulation of G1/S transcription in response to replicative stress and elucidate the specific roles of Mik1 and Mrc1 in the checkpoint.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In response to inhibition of DNA replication, the replication checkpoint arrests the cell cycle before mitosis, stabilizes stalled replication forks and regulates S-phase transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006944-Carr1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006944-Boddy1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcriptional branch of the checkpoint response up-regulates genes thought to be important for cells to survive prolonged replication arrest. The replication checkpoint, also known as the S-M checkpoint, is commonly induced by hydroxyurea (HU) treatment. Hydroxyurea is a competitive inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase which interferes with deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, resulting in deoxyribonucleotide depletion, fork stalling and checkpoint activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006944-Kelly1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. A related checkpoint is activated by DNA damage during replication. The S-phase DNA damage checkpoint, also known as the intra-S checkpoint, is commonly induced by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment, which methylates DNA, generating adducts that are recognized as damage primarily during S phase.</p><p>The replication checkpoint and S-phase DNA damage checkpoints are mechanistically closely related. Whether they are two distinct checkpoints or one checkpoint activated by different replication stresses is somewhat of a semantic question. They both rely on the central checkpoint kinase Rad3, the fission yeast homolog of human ATR and budding yeast Mec1, and the downstream checkpoint effector kinase Cds1, homolog of Chk2 and Rad53. They have the same two major functions: cell-cycle arrest and replication fork stabilization. However, it is unclear if the mechanisms of fork stabilization are the same. Furthermore, the replication checkpoint regulates transcription by maintaining the normal G1/S transcriptional program through regulation of MBF, the S-phase transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006944-deBruin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006944-Dutta1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Briefly, cells were grown in yeast extract with supplements (YES) media at 30&#x000b0;C, with the exception of yFS632 cells, which were grown in Edinburgh minimal media supplemented with leucine, uracil, adenine and histidine (LUAH) and with thiamine as needed. The expression from the <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter was induced by growing cells in LUAH without thiamine for 16&#x02013;18 hours at 30&#x000b0;C. For time courses, cells were synchronized by centrifugal elutriation and treated with 10 mM hydroxyurea or 200 grays ionizing radiation (IR) at time 0 or 0.015&#x00025; MMS at 60 minutes. For IR, a Faxitron Cabinet X-ray system Model RX-650 was used at 10 Gray/minute. The delay in MMS treatment prevents cells form arresting in the first G2.

In the <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; background in response to HU, the effect is due primarily to <italic>mik1</italic>, with <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>cdc10-2E mrc1</italic>&#x00394; cells being as resistant as <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>cdc10-2E</italic> cells, but <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>cdc10-2E mik1</italic>&#x00394; cells being as sensitive as <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells. These results are consistent with the <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells being able to regulate Mik1 in a Chk1-dependent manner, but only if it is expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006944-BaberFurnari1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The checkpoint-dependent transcription of <italic>mik1</italic> also provides resistance to replicative stress in the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; background, in which other cell-cycle arrest mechanisms are abrogated. In response to both HU and MMS, <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>cdc10-2E mik1</italic>&#x00394; cells are more sensitive than <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>cdc10-2E</italic> cells. The role of Mik1 in providing resistance to replicative stress in the absence of the checkpoint is presumably to prevent premature mitosis by inhibiting Cdc2 via tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006944-g005">Figure 5</xref> and<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006944-Christensen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>). This conclusion is consistent with the observation that constitutively expressed Mik1 kinase in <italic>cdc10</italic>&#x00394;<italic>C4</italic> (a dominant allele of cdc10 resulting in constitutive over expression of MBF-regulated genes) plays a role in increased cell length in division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006944-Ng1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The importance of <italic>mrc1</italic> as a transcriptional target of the checkpoints is apparent in the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; background. In response to MMS, <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>cdc10-2E mrc1</italic>&#x00394; cells are as sensitive as <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells. The situation is somewhat different in the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; background in response to HU. Here, the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>cdc10-2E mrc1</italic>&#x00394; cells are slightly less sensitive than <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells, suggesting that other MBF-dependent transcript contribute to resistance in the absence of <italic>mrc1</italic>. However, the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>cdc10-2E mrc1</italic>&#x00394; cells are as sensitive to HU as <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells, suggesting that loss of <italic>mrc1</italic> inactivates the Cds1-dependent fork-stabilization function and that the MBF-dependent resistance to HU is due to another function, possibly the cell-cycle arrest function. The fact that <italic>mrc1</italic> expression effects <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells, but not <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cell, suggests that Mrc1 requires Cds1 in a checkpoint-independent manner for at least some of its fork stabilization functions. The role of Mrc1 in providing resistance to replicative stress in the absence of the checkpoint is presumably to stabilize stalled forks and allow them to recover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006944-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006944-Katou1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>). In particular, Mrc1 may negatively regulate Cdc45 and the MCM helicase, rendering stalled forks capable of resuming replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006944-Nitani1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our results show that the regulation of MBF-dependent G1/S transcription by the S-phase checkpoints provides a modest but reproducible resistance to replicative stress. Furthermore, they implicate <italic>mrc1</italic> and <italic>mik1</italic> as critical targets of MBF in the transcriptional response to replication stress. Since both Mrc1 and Mik1, as well as the checkpoint regulation of G1/S transcription, are conserved throughout eukaryotes, it is likely that this mechanism of resistance is a general response to replicative stress.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Paul Russell for providing the <italic>mrc1</italic>&#x00394; alleles and the Rhind lab for useful suggestions and experimental
