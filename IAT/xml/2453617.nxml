We previously proposed that blockade of &#x003b1;4 integrin signaling can inhibit inflammation while limiting mechanism-based toxicities of loss of &#x003b1;4 function. Thus, we hypothesized that mice bearing an &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation, which blocks signaling, would be protected from development of high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance.</p><p><bold>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</bold>&#x02014;Six- to eight-week-old wild-type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A) C57Bl/6 male mice were placed on either a high-fat diet that derived 60&#x00025; calories from lipids or a chow diet.

This protection was conferred on wild-type mice by &#x003b1;4(Y991A) bone marrow transplantation. In the reverse experiment, wild-type bone marrow renders high-fat diet&#x02013;fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) acceptor animals insulin resistant. Furthermore, fat-fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice showed a dramatic reduction of monocyte/macrophages in adipose tissue.

Mononuclear cell&#x02013;mediated inflammation in obese adipose tissue plays a pathogenetic role in insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Thus, there is great interest in the possibility of using anti-inflammatory strategies to ameliorate obesity-induced insulin resistance.</p><p>Blockade of leukocyte adhesion is a proven therapeutic strategy for a wide variety of inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). In particular, inhibiting &#x003b1;4 integrins or their counter-receptors (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 &#x0005b;VCAM-1&#x0005d; and mucosal adressin cell adhesion molecule-1 &#x0005b;MadCAM-1&#x0005d;) blocks inflammatory responses mediated by mononuclear leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). &#x003b1;4 integrin antagonists are of proven benefit in several human inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). These antagonists, such as the monoclonal antibody natalizumab, block ligand binding function, thus producing a complete loss of &#x003b1;4 integrin function. Lack of &#x003b1;4 integrins is embryonic lethal and results in defective placentation, heart development, and hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). Furthermore, natalizumab therapy has been associated with fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in humans, possibly because of defective T-cell trafficking to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Thus, currently available &#x003b1;4 integrin antagonists are of proven value in mononuclear cell&#x02013;mediated diseases; however, complete loss of &#x003b1;4 integrin function is associated with developmental defects and abnormal hematopoiesis.</p><p>As noted above, whereas &#x003b1;4 integrin antagonists show promise for several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, mechanism-based toxicities may limit their use, particularly in low-grade chronic inflammatory conditions, such as obesity-induced insulin resistance. We recently proposed an alternative strategy&#x02014;blockade of &#x003b1;4 integrin signaling&#x02014;to perturb functions involved in inflammation, while limiting mechanism-based adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). &#x003b1;4 integrin signaling involves the binding of paxillin to the &#x003b1;4 integrin tail, and a point mutation (&#x003b1;4Y991A) that selectively blocks this interaction reduces &#x003b1;4-mediated leukocyte migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>) and adhesion strengthening in flowing blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>) while sparing &#x003b1;4-mediated static cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). Furthermore, mice bearing an &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation are viable and fertile and have intact lympho-hematopoiesis and humoral immune responses; however, they exhibit defective recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes in experimental inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Here, we report that the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation reduces mononuclear leukocyte infiltration of white adipose tissue (WAT) in high-fat diet&#x02013;induced obese mice and hence reduce high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance. Thus, we establish that blocking &#x003b1;4 integrin signaling can ameliorate the metabolic consequences of high-fat diet&#x02013;induced obesity.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals and animal care.</title><p>The &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice were previously described and have been backcrossed nine times onto the C57BL/6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>).

To investigate the role(s) of integrin &#x003b1;4 interaction with paxillin in &#x003b1;4-mediated functions in vivo, we previously generated and analyzed mice bearing a point mutation in the &#x003b1;4 integrin tail (Y991A) that inhibits paxillin binding with little detectable effect on the binding of other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). To examine the potential effect of this mutation on a model of human type 2 diabetes, these &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice and wild-type controls were placed on a 60&#x00025; fat diet for 16&#x02013;22 weeks. On this diet, wild-type animals developed impaired glucose tolerance (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, mice bearing the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation were partially protected against high-fat diet&#x02013;induced glucose intolerance (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>; Supplemental Fig. 1<italic>A</italic>). The increased glucose tolerance in the high-fat diet&#x02013;fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) animals was not due to greater insulin release because these mice released significantly less insulin than high-fat diet&#x02013;fed wild-type animals (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.036) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>.). The wild-type mice showed a greater increase in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells than those bearing the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>) in response to the high-fat diet. Because increased &#x003b2;-cells is an early manifestation of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>), these findings strongly suggested that the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation helped preserve sensitivity to insulin in fat-fed animals. This idea was confirmed by the finding that the high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mutant mice showed a much greater insulin-induced drop in blood glucose than the high-fat diet&#x02013;fed wild-type mice (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). Thirty minutes after administration of 0.85 units/kg insulin, plasma glucose decreased by 43&#x00025; in the mutant fat-fed animals compared with a 28&#x00025; decline in wild-type animals. In contrast, the chow-fed animals of both genotypes exhibited a 37&#x00025; decline at 30 min (0.75 units/kg insulin injected). At later time points, there was a statistically insignificant trend of greater insulin-induced drop in chow-fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) animals versus wild type. Thus, the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation protects against high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance.</p><sec><title>The &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation did not affect caloric intake or weight gain.</title><p>Both wild-type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice exhibited the same caloric intake on high-fat diet (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>left</italic>), which was about 1.5-fold higher than on chow diet (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Consistent with similar caloric intake, no differences in weight gain were observed between wild-type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>left</italic> and <italic>right</italic>). Animals were weight matched before starting the 16 weeks of diet &#x0005b;average starting weight for high-fat diet, 27.8 &#x000b1; 0.6 and 27.3 &#x000b1; 1.0 g for wild type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A), respectively; for chow diet, 27.8 &#x000b1; 1.3 and 28.8 &#x000b1; 1.6 g for wild type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A), respectively&#x0005d;). Gross histological analysis of WAT isolated from high-fat diet&#x02013;fed wild-type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice showed no statistical difference in adipocyte size or number (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>; Supplemental Fig. 1<italic>B</italic>).</p><p>Plasma levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides were similar between wild-type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice on both diets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Wild-type mice exhibited increased plasma cholesterol on high-fat diet (238.7 &#x000b1; 10.5 mg/dl) in comparison with those on chow diet (132.2 &#x000b1; 5.9 mg/dl). The &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice on high-fat diet exhibited a statistically insignificant trend to a lesser rise in cholesterol (203.0 &#x000b1; 27.9 vs. 130.0 &#x000b1; 2.7 mg/dl, high-fat diet vs. chow diet), which may reflect a decrease in LDL levels. Plasma adiponectin concentrations decreased to similar levels in both high-fat&#x02013;fed wild-type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice. Plasma leptin and resistin levels increased after high-fat diet, but no differences were found between genotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). High-fat diet&#x02013;fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice exhibited similar plasma expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), and MCP-1, compared with wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Bone marrow&#x02013;derived cells are responsible for protection from high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance.</title><p>Even though &#x003b1;4 integrin is not present at the surface of adipocytes (data not shown), it is widely expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>) and is particularly prominent in the functioning of mononuclear leukocytes. Moreover, bone marrow&#x02013;derived mononuclear cells contribute to insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). To determine whether the protection against high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance in the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice is mediated through bone marrow&#x02013;derived cells, we performed bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experiments. Six- to eight-week-old lethally irradiated (10 Gy) wild-type male mice received bone marrow cells from either wild-type or &#x003b1;4(Y991A) donor mice via tail vein injection. Recipient mice were allowed 4 weeks for recovery and reconstitution of the transplanted bone marrow and were then placed on high-fat diet for 16&#x02013;22 weeks before metabolic experiments. Posttransplant chimerism was evaluated by PCR on both groups. No wild-type &#x003b1;4 was detected in blood collected from mice receiving bone marrow from &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice &#x0005b;&#x003b1;4(Y991A)-BMT&#x0005d;. Mice transplanted with wild-type and &#x003b1;4 mutant &#x0005b;&#x003b1;4(Y991A)-BMT&#x0005d; bone marrow gained equal amounts of weight on high-fat diet compared with normal chow (data not shown). Levels of plasma fatty acids, cholesterol, triglycerides, adiponectin, and leptin were similar between genotypes (data not shown).</p><p>Wild-type mice that received &#x003b1;4(Y991A) bone marrow were partially protected against high-fat diet&#x02013;induced glucose intolerance (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>) and insulin resistance (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>) compared with wild-type animals that received wild-type bone marrow. When animals were fed a normal diet, glucose tolerance was similar in mutant and wild-type transplanted mice (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>), but there was a statistically insignificant trend toward increased insulin sensitivity in chow-fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) compared with wild-type marrow recipients (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). In reverse BMT experiments, i.e., transplantation of wild-type bone marrow into lethally irradiated &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice, no mutant allele was detected in &#x003b1;4(Y991A) animals receiving wild-type bone marrow, confirming complete reconstitution of wild-type bone marrow in these animals. Wild-type marrow made &#x003b1;4(Y991A) acceptor mice susceptible to glucose intolerance (Supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, bone marrow&#x02013;derived cells are responsible for the observed protection of &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice from high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation leads to a decrease in adipose tissue monocyte/macrophages in high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice.</title><p>The foregoing experiments showed that the effect of the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation was manifest through bone marrow&#x02013;derived cells. Among bone marrow&#x02013;derived cells, &#x003b1;4 integrin is highly expressed on most mononuclear leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). Monocyte/macrophages are bone marrow&#x02013;derived mononuclear cells that mediate the inflammatory response to high-fat diet, and macrophages contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). We therefore used flow cytometry to quantify the presence of monocyte subpopulations, defined by the level of expression of surface markers 7/4 and Ly6-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>) in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of WAT isolated from wild-type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice on chow or high-fat diet. We used a combination of Ly-6G and 7/4 markers, described by Tsou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>), which define a cell population uniformly positive for F4/80, CD11b, and CC chemokine receptor 2 for CCL2/MCP-1 (CCR2) and phenotypically identical to the inflammatory monocytes previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>).</p><p>The accumulation of macrophages, associated with obesity-induced insulin resistance, occurs predominantly in epididymal WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>); hence we studied WAT from this site. High-fat diet&#x02013;fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice exhibited a marked reduction in the number of monocytes (7/4<sup>hi</sup>Ly-6G<sup>neg</sup>) compared with high-fat diet&#x02013;fed wild-type mice (0.8 &#x000b1; 0.13 vs. 2.88 &#x000b1; 0.49&#x00025;) (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>top left panel</italic>) in WAT SVF. This phenomenon was also observed (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom left panel</italic>) with 7/4<sup>dim</sup>Ly-6G<sup>neg</sup> cells (mixed monocyte/lymphocytes) (Y991A 3.77 &#x000b1; 1.43&#x00025; vs. wild type 7.6 &#x000b1; 1.11&#x00025;). In contrast, when fed a normal diet, wild-type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice had similar percentages of both 7/4<sup>hi</sup>Ly-6G<sup>neg</sup> and 7/4<sup>dim</sup>Ly-6G<sup>neg</sup> cells in their WAT SVF (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>right panels</italic>). These results were confirmed by the reduction in mRNA for F4/80, a macrophage marker, in WAT from fat-fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice compared with wild-type mice (Supplemental Fig. 1<italic>C</italic>). Thus, the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation leads to a reduction in monocyte/macrophage accumulation in the WAT SVF in response to high-fat diet.</p><p>WAT monocyte/macrophages derive in part from peripheral blood monocytes, which in turn are derived from the bone marrow. To investigate the cause of the reduced monocyte/macrophage accumulation in WAT of &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice, we quantified monocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood and in the bone marrow of wild-type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice. In the high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice, there was a reduction in the percentage (1.4 &#x000b1; 0.28 vs. 2.9 &#x000b1; 0.38&#x00025; for Y991A and wild type, respectively) and absolute number of monocytes in the peripheral blood of &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref> and <italic>B</italic>). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the percentage of pure or mixed monocyte populations in the bone marrow of high-fat diet&#x02013;fed wild-type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Similarly, a slight monocytopenia was observed in the peripheral blood of normal chow&#x02013;fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice (1.71 &#x000b1; 0.13 vs. 2.39 &#x000b1; 0.12&#x00025; for Y991A and wild type, respectively), and there was no significant difference in abundance of 7/4<sup>hi</sup>Ly-6G<sup>neg</sup> and 7/4<sup>dim</sup>Ly-6G<sup>neg</sup> cells in the bone marrow (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation does not impair monocyte development. Rather, they suggest that the mutation reduces mobilization of these cells. These data do not define the relative contributions of reduced egress from the bone marrow and entry into the adipose tissue in high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice in the observed reduced macrophage accumulation in &#x003b1;4(Y991A) WAT.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b1;4(Y991A) monocyte/macrophages exhibit reduced chemotaxis toward MCP-1.</title><p>MCP-1 is an important monocyte chemoattractant and is particularly implicated in the mobilization of monocytes from the bone marrow and the infiltration of adipose tissue with monocyte/macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the decreased 7/4<sup>hi</sup>Ly-6G<sup>neg</sup> and 7/4<sup>dim</sup>Ly-6G<sup>neg</sup> cells in WAT of high-fat diet&#x02013;fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice could be due to impaired migration in response to this chemokine. &#x003b1;4(Y991A) bone marrow&#x02013;derived macrophages showed reduced &#x003b1;4 integrin&#x02013;dependent MCP-1&#x02013;driven migration relative to wild-type cells (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Thus, impaired &#x003b1;4 integrin&#x02013;dependent monocyte/macrophage migration can account for the decreased number of monocyte/macrophages detected in WAT of fat-fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice.</p><p>Chemokines, such as MCP-1, are produced by macrophages, endothelial cells, and adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). Deficiency in MCP-1 production and/or secretion could also contribute to an impairment of monocyte/macrophages migration into adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Circulating MCP-1 was increased approximately twofold after high-fat diet, but no significant difference was observed between genotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The relative expression of MCP-1 was also evaluated in the WAT of &#x003b1;4(Y991A) and wild-type mice by RT-PCR (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). As expected from the circulating level of MCP-1, no difference was observed in MCP-1 mRNA expression in epididymal WAT between genotype in high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Thus, we ascribe the reduction in monocyte/macrophages in WAT in high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice to an impaired migratory response to MCP-1 rather than to reduced production of this chemokine.</p><p>The amelioration of insulin resistance in high-fat diet&#x02013;fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice appears to depend on reduction of monocyte/macrophages in WAT; these cells are the source of cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6. Abdominal adipose gene expression levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and leptin are positively linked with insulin resistance. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL6 were strikingly reduced (70 and 55&#x00025;, respectively) in &#x003b1;4(Y991A) compared with wild-type WAT (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). In contrast, we observed similar levels for fat-derived peptides leptin and PAI-1 in wild-type and &#x003b1;4(Y991A) WAT. Thus, the reduction in monocyte/macrophages in WAT in high-fat diet&#x02013;fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice leads to reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6) in WAT.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>&#x003b1;4 integrins are proven therapeutic targets in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis; however, complete blockade of &#x003b1;4 integrin function can result in defects in hematopoiesis, heart, and placental development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>) and is associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Chronic low-grade inflammation contributes to the development of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>), and the adipose tissue macrophage is a principal cell type responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). Here, we report that mice bearing the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation are protected from high-fat diet&#x02013;induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. The mutation did not block development of monocytes in the bone marrow but impaired their migration in response to MCP-1, leading to a combination of reduced egress into the blood and diminished accumulation in adipose tissue. Reduction of &#x003b1;4(Y991A) monocyte/macrophages in WAT consequently diminished pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;) production, which can explain the amelioration of insulin resistance in these mice. This is the first study showing a role for integrin signaling in the pathogenesis the metabolic consequences of diet-induced obesity.</p><p>&#x003b1;4 integrins are important in the pathogenesis of high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance because they mediate the localization of monocyte/macrophages to adipose tissue. In particular, we found that a point mutation that impairs &#x003b1;4 integrin signaling led to markedly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice. The &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice become obese on a high-fat diet, but they remained insulin-sensitive. This insulin-sensitive phenotype can be conferred by transplanting bone marrow from &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice into irradiated wild-type host animals. In the reverse experiment, fat-fed &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice receiving wild-type bone marrow were insulin resistant. Thus, bone marrow&#x02013;derived cells are responsible for this protective effect, most likely by limiting accumulation of inflammatory adipose tissue macrophages. Recent studies have begun to classify macrophage subpopulations with differing roles in insulin resistance; future studies will be required to define effects of the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mutation on these subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>). It is noteworthy that improvement of glucose tolerance in mutant mice fed a high-fat diet is not complete. This implies that other factors could contribute to glucose intolerance induced by high-fat diet. These results add insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes to diseases in which &#x003b1;4 integrins may serve as therapeutic targets.</p><p>Consistent with our results, MCP-1 deficiency or deletion of the MCP-1 receptor (CCR2) reduced monocyte egress from the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>) and accumulation of macrophages in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>), and MCP-1 or CCR2 KO mice are partially protected from high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). Thus, deletion of CCR2 or its main ligand leads to a similar phenotype as shown here for the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated a defect in CCR2-driven chemotaxis in &#x003b1;4(Y991A) monocytes. These relationships suggest that CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment is linked to the binding of paxillin to the &#x003b1;4 integrin cytoplasmic domain.</p><p>The phenotypes observed in the &#x003b1;4(Y991A) and &#x003b1;4(Y991A)-BMT animals are remarkably similar to those observed in mice deficient in <italic>Sorbs1</italic> gene, which encodes cbl-associated protein (Cap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). These mice are also protected from high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance, and this protection can be transferred to wild-type mice by BMT of Cap-null bone marrow. Furthermore, Cap deletion resulted in reduced numbers of monocytes/macrophages in both blood and adipose tissue, and Cap knockdown led to decreased migration in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line. Previously, Cap was shown to mediate signals for the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions through interaction with the focal adhesion kinase p125<sup>FAK</sup>, an effector directly linked to paxillin binding to &#x003b1;4 integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>), and Cbl is required for macrophage spreading and migration. Thus, the relationship between Cap and &#x003b1;4-paxillin interaction in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance is an area of potential future interest.</p><p>Chronic inflammation can be a primary mediator of obesity-induced insulin resistance, and inflammation is recognized as one of the contributors to the metabolic syndrome (or syndrome X) and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>). This study establishes a new role for &#x003b1;4 signaling in the development of high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance through its action on monocyte/macrophage trafficking. It also suggests that blockade of &#x003b1;4 signaling can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation, which could translate into clinical benefit in type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db07-1751_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db07-1751_supps.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>C.C.F. has received a postdoctoral fellowship from the Arthritis Foundation.
