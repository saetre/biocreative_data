The Notch family comprises heterodimer transmembrane receptors consisting of an extracellular domain and a noncovalently linked intracellular domain (ICD). In mammals, 4 Notch receptors (Notch1-4) and 5 ligands (Delta-like &#x0005b;Dll&#x0005d;-1, Dll3, Dll4, Jagged1 and Jagged2) have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-ArtavanisTsakonas1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon interaction with ligands on neighbouring cells, Notch undergoes proteolytic cleavages managed sequentially by ADAM proteins (a desintegrin and metalloproteinase) and the &#x003b3;-secretase complex. Release of the cytoplasmic Notch C-terminal intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane is followed by its translocation into the nucleus where it forms a complex with CSL, removing the repression and allowing for target genes (<italic>hes, hey</italic>) transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Iso1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Notch proteins display a selective cellular and tissue distribution. The vascular cells express all four Notch receptors but only Notch4 displays an almost exclusively endothelial expression pattern whereas Notch1-3 are expressed more ubiquitously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Uyttendaele1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In the vasculature, Notch1 and Notch4 are predominantly endothelial, prominent in both arteries and veins while the expression of Notch2 has been reported in pulmonary endothelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Villa1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Notch3 is primarily expressed in adult arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In addition to a specific pattern of tissue expression, several observations suggest that temporal regulation of Notch signaling may be equally important to control the diverse functions of the Notch family. Notch signaling plays a critical role in vascular development and homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Iso2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and is involved in vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, differentiation, vascular remodeling, and maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Gridley1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Combined deletion of <italic>Notch1</italic> and <italic>Notch4</italic> genes enhances the defects in vasculature remodeling observed in Notch1 single knock-out mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Krebs1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Endothelial cell (EC)-specific expression of an activated form of Notch4 leads to embryonic lethality with abnormal vessel structure and patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Uyttendaele2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Constitutive activation of Notch4 in ECs also causes defects in vascular remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Uyttendaele2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments also demonstrate that Notch4 activation protects ECs from apoptosis, promotes endothelial-to-mesenchymal trans-differentiation and blocks both proliferation and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-MacKenzie1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Noseda1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Endothelial cells control vascular tone, leukocyte adhesion and thrombosis by fine-tuned regulation of many cell surface and soluble molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Pober1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. EC activation is considered to be an early event which subsequently leads to EC dysfunction and ultimately to vascular injury, key events associated with acute and chronic inflammation, such as occurs during sepsis, atherosclerosis and acute vascular and chronic allograft rejection. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), an important mediator of innate inflammation, acts on vascular ECs to promote the inflammatory response. In cultured human ECs, human TNF causes apoptosis, especially in the presence of RNA or protein synthesis inhibitors such as actinomycin D or cycloheximide (CHX), respectively. TNF activates both NF<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B and AP-1 in ECs, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins, such as E-selectin (CD62E), ICAM-1 (CD54), VCAM-1 (CD106) and IL-8. TNF also promotes expression of an array of &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; genes including the zinc finger protein A20, heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and Bcl-xL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Bach1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been suggested that Notch is necessary for the establishment and/or maintenance of quiescent EC phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Noseda1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a role for Notch signaling in activated EC phenotype and function upon inflammation has not been documented.</p><p>In a previous study, we showed that impaired Notch4 expression caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines in cardiac allograft vessels promotes EC dysfunction and transplant arteriosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Quillard1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the importance of Notch4 in controlling EC proliferation, differentiation and survival has been established, little is known about the role of Notch2 expressed on vascular endothelium. This study further investigates the regulatory crosstalk between TNF signaling and Notch receptors expression and activity in primary cultures of human vascular ECs. In particular, we show that TNF strongly upregulates Notch2 on vascular ECs. Moreover, the present work establishes the direct contribution of Notch2 signaling in the transcriptional regulation of several pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules. Both forced Notch2 NICD (N2ICD) expression and Notch2 silencing demonstrate interplay between Notch2 signaling and survivin expression in the control of EC apoptosis. Taken together, our findings indicate that dysregulated Notch2 signaling by TNF sensitizes vascular endothelial cells to apoptosis by the downregulation of a set of mediators of apoptosis and suggest a major role for survivin as effector of Notch signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Informed written consent was obtained from patients.

Consequently, the first aim of this study was to investigate how TNF signaling may control the expression of Notch receptors (Notch1, 2, 3 and 4) in cytokine-activated ECs. Firstly, primary cultures of ECs were treated for 0 to 24 h with recombinant TNF and transcript levels were analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008244-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, TNF selectively modulates the mRNA steady-state levels of the Notch receptors. TNF decreases transcript levels for Notch1, Notch3 and Notch4 with a significant effect starting 2 h after treatment and with a maximal inhibition at 24 h of 49&#x000b1;7&#x00025;, 88&#x000b1;2&#x00025; and 78&#x000b1;2&#x00025; for Notch1, 3 and 4 as compared with basal levels (p&#x0003c;0.05 for all). In contrast, an enhanced mRNA level for Notch2 was found in response to TNF, corresponding to a 3.3&#x000b1;0.3-fold increase at 24 h (p&#x0003c;0.05) as compared with the basal mRNA level. TNF-regulated expression for Notch2 was further confirmed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008244-g001">Figure 1B&#x02013;D</xref>). TNF also triggers the activation of Notch2 signaling as reflected by the induction of the activated cleaved-form of Notch2 receptor (c-Notch2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008244-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

Our analysis thus focused on regulating the Notch2 pathway in human vascular ECs. To this end, we first generated a recombinant adenoviral vector encoding the intra-cellular domain of Notch2 (N2ICD) and GFP as a reporter gene (AdN2ICD). Controls were ECs transduced with a recombinant adenovirus encoding GFP alone and empty vector (AdGFP and AdNull) to account for any effects that may be due to adenoviral infection or/and GFP expression. Western blot analysis further indicates that, N2ICD expression is dose-dependent in transduced ECs (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008244.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Validation of the N2ICD transgene was also attested by its nuclear translocation as well as its ability to promote canonical Notch pathway activity (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008244.s001">Figure S1D-E</xref>).</p><p>Notch2 signaling was then tested for regulation of EC survival. First, the effect of N2ICD on EC viability was examined by a DNA content analysis from 24 h to 72 h after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008244-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). At 24 h, no significant effect was observed. At 48 h, a significant decrease in cell viability (46.5&#x000b1;5.9&#x00025;) was found when ECs were infected with AdN2ICD at moi 40 while a lower dose of virus (moi 20) decreases cell survival by 31.8&#x000b1;8.4&#x00025; indicating that N2ICD-induced cell death is a dose-dependent process. Finally, at 72 h post-infection, in contrast to AdGFP and AdNull controls that did not alter cell survival, AdN2ICD was sufficient to drastically induce cell death (40.0&#x000b1;14.0&#x00025; and 67.5&#x000b1;6.1&#x00025; of cell death for moi 20 and 40, respectively). To test whether EC death reflected apoptosis, ECs were labeled with AnnexinV and Propidium iodide 72 h after infection and apoptotic cells (AnnV&#x0002b;) were detected by flow cytometry. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008244-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, N2ICD strongly induces apoptosis in a dose dependent manner. AdN2ICD transduced ECs displayed 58.2&#x00025; and 77.5&#x00025; of apoptotic cells for moi 20 and 40, respectively. In contrary, no effect was observed after AdGFP infection or with the corresponding empty Adenovirus at a moi of 40 thus attesting that the deleterious effect of AdN2ICD was not due to GFP nor to the viral charge. No necrotic cells (AnnV-PI&#x0002b;) were detected. To further characterize N2ICD-mediated apoptosis, we first used a PhiPhiLux&#x02122; system to detect real-time activation of caspase in live cells. PhiPhiLux incorporated into a cell is specifically cleaved by caspase-3 or caspase-7, and the cleaved products give fluorescence that can be detected by fluorescent Time lapse videomicroscopy imaging. After 48 h post-infection, ECs were subjected to time lapse imaging for 18 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008244-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

This experimental setting allowed us to follow AdN2ICD-mediated apoptosis induction in reat time. As shown for AnnexinV staining, AdN2ICD was associated with a high number of caspase3/7-dependent apoptosis (37&#x00025;) as compared to AdGFP and AdNull controls (5&#x00025; and 2&#x00025;, respectively) 66 h after infection.</p><fig id="pone-0008244-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008244.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Notch2 activation elicits EC apoptosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of EC viability 0&#x02013;72 h post-infection with AdGFP, AdNull or AdN2ICD using a DNA content assay.

The 17-kDa form of cleaved caspase-3 was detected in EC overexpressing N2ICD at 48 and 72 h and parallels a decrease in full caspase-3 expression. Correlated to caspase-3 activation, clivage of caspase-7 and PARP were also observed. In contrast, no cleavage of caspase-6 and -9 was found (data not shown). To quantify caspase activation by N2ICD, we used a colorimetric assay for caspase-3 and -7 activation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008244-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, ECs overexpressing N2ICD exhibited a strong caspase activity as compared to AdGFP and AdNull controls (40.9 fold and 93.4 fold increase, respectively).</p><p>Protective effect of the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK in AdN2ICD-transduced ECs further confirmed that Notch2 mediates EC death by inducing caspase-mediated apoptosis (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008244.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>In vascular ECs, TNF promotes EC activation/dysfunction but low levels of apoptosis, notably by inducing protective signaling pathways.

Another (non exclusive) possibility to consider comes from the recent study by Wu <italic>et al.</italic> that discovered an unexpected role for the Notch coactivator <italic>Maml1</italic> in mediating the specific signaling of Notch2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Wu1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings suggesting that individual <italic>Maml</italic> coactivators may regulate molecular specificity of Notch receptor functions remains to be confirmed.</p><p>Apoptosis is believed to be an important factor in vascular remodeling in normal and pathologic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Cailhier1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) that is upregulated in cancer and has recently been implicated in vascular injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-BlancBrude1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Survivin was originally detected in tumors; however, subsequent studies have revealed that many normal adult tissues express survivin albeit at levels lower than cancer cells. Survivin is an essential protein in that disruption of the survivin locus in mice results in early embryonic lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Altieri2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. This reflects a critical dual function of survivin in the regulation of cell division and the preservation of cell viability. The demonstration that survivin levels in normal tissues can be up-regulated by cytokines suggests that survivin may have physiologic roles in regulating proliferation and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-KirkilesSmith1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the existence of functional survivin&#x02013;caspase complexes is controversial, the ability of survivin to inhibit apoptosis has been clearly demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Romagnoli1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression of survivin protects normal or transformed cells from apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Altieri3">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> while forced expression of survivin inhibits various forms of cell death both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Altieri2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Lack of endothelial cell survivin resulted in embryonic lethality. Mutant embryos had prominent and diffuse haemorrhages from embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) and died before E13.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Zwerts1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, pointing out a key protective role of survivin in ECs. Our findings are complementary to studies in primary cultured human ECs and VSMCs where induction of apoptosis by TNF and cycloheximide or inflammatory cytokines (IFN&#x003b3;, TNF, IL1&#x003b2;) was completely prevented by survivin overexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-OConnor1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008244-Wang1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, whether survivin inhibition by Notch2 could be implicated in proliferation blockade resulting from Notch2 induction remains to be verified. Nonetheless, survivin may act upstream of gene expression and directly influence the transcription of pivotal growth-related gene(s) in vascular cells. In the future, this information might lead to novel strategies to prevent cancer and vascular diseases where Notch/survivin signaling plays a pathogenic role.</p><p>In conclusion, we show for the first time that TNF signaling strongly upregulates and activates Notch2 in vascular ECs. Our findings further indicate that dysregulated Notch2 signaling sensitizes vascular ECs to apoptosis and demonstrate a major role for survivin as effector of Notch signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008244.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Activation of Notch2 signaling in ECs.(A) Dose-dependent transduction of ECs according to moi for the recombinant AdGFP and AdN2NICD.
