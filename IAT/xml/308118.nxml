RYB-a is a 31 kDa protein that contains a conserved cold-shock domain and an amino acid alignment similar to those of charge zipper proteins. Expression of RYB-a mRNA was highly abundant in the skeletal muscle, spleen, and fetal liver. The expression is very low in new-born and adult livers, suggesting its expression is under developmental regulation. In addition, the expression of RYB-a mRNA was induced in the liver during regeneration and by stimulation of quiescent fibroblast cells with serum. Induction in the fibroblasts was inhibited by treating the cell with a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein or by detachment of cell-adhesion. Since both treatments are known to inhibit G1 cells to enter S phase, RYB-a gene is thought to be a member of growth-inducible genes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0115-a" xlink:role="2037"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0116-a" xlink:role="2038"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0117-a" xlink:role="2039"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0117-b" xlink:role="2039"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0118-a" xlink:role="2040"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2036"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2037"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2038"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2039"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2040"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00035-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2041"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
