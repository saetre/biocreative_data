Retinoic acid (RA)-treatment of neuroblastoma (NB) cells implicates activation of Ret and TrkB RTKs as critical step to induce cell differentiation. By studying the signaling interplay between TrkB and Ret as paradigmatic example, here we demonstrate the existence of a cross-talk mechanism between the two unrelated receptors that is needed to induce the cell differentiation. Indeed, we show that TrkB receptor promotes Ret phosphorylation by a mechanism that does not require GDNF. This reveals to be a key mechanism, since blocking either TrkB or Ret by small interfering RNA causes a failure in NB biochemical and morphological differentiation. Our results provide the first evidence that a functional transactivation between distinct tyrosine kinases receptors is required for an important physiological process.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins that in response to growth factors stimulate intracellular pathways that control most fundamental cellular processes including the cell cycle, cell migration, cell metabolism and survival, as well as cell differentiation and proliferation. All known RTKs become activated by the selective binding of dimeric ligands to their extracellular domains, resulting in their dimerization and autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Hunter1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Schlessinger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there is accumulating evidence that enlarges the traditional view of growth factor receptors activation in that the receptor may be transactivated and, thus, tyrosine-phosphorylated by ligands which specifically bind to other membrane receptors. For example, it has been widely demonstrated the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by agonists for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other extracellular stimuli unrelated to EGF-like ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Fischer1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Edwin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to EGFR, it has been shown that activation of Trk (tropomyosin-related kinase) receptor tyrosine kinases TrkA (P04629 Swiss-Prot accession number) and TrkB (Q16620 Swiss-Prot accession number) can also occur via a GPCR mechanism, without involvement of nerve growth factor (NGF, P01138 Swiss-Prot accession number) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, P23560 Swiss-Prot accession number) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Lee1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Lee2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Rajagopal1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> thus indicating alternative modes of stimulating trophic functions in neuronal cells by linking different receptor signalling pathways.</p><p>As first example of intracellular cross-activation between RTKs, it has been shown that in cultures of sympathetic neurons the NGF receptor, TrkA, acts on Ret (rearranged during transfection, P07949 Swiss-Prot accession number) kinase by an intracellular mechanism that transactivates its catalytic domain whereas doesn't require ligand expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-TsuiPierchala1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As demonstrated for brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme and other solid tumours, the co-activation of RTKs limits the efficacy of therapies targeting single receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Stommel1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, thus a deeper insights in the inter-RTK signalling pathways is needed to find combination of therapeutic agents with increased anti-cancer efficacy.</p><p>Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumor of childhood outside the central nervous system; it is made of neural crest cells that can occur at any point along the sympathetic ganglia or the adrenal medulla. Expression of neurotrophin receptors of Trk family is an important prognostic factor in NB and activation of different Trk receptors leads to variable clinical presentation and behaviour of the tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Brodeur1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Schramm1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Differences in the expression pattern of the receptors or their downstream signalling components could in part explain the differences in favourable (in the case of TrkA) or unfavourable (in the case of TrkB) tumors. However, the cross-talk between the Trk receptors and other receptors on cell surface may influence the outcome of the NB cellular response. In NB cells it has been shown that the stably transfection of TrkB receptor results in enhancing neuroblastoma invasiveness via upregulating the expression of hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor TK, c-Met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Hecht1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The need of cooperation between TrkA and Ret pathways has been shown in the HTLA230 neuroblastoma cells as critical to promote neuronal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Peterson1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, there is evidence in literature indicating that the Ret and TrkB signal pathways are associated with the process of NB differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Matsushima1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous studies have shown that RA induces the neuronal differentiation of many human neuroblastoma cell lines. It has been reported that RA alone induces neurite extension in NB cells (SH-SY5Y, LAN-5 and KCNR cells) which have endogenous expression of BDNF, <italic>via</italic> induction of TrkB expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The existence of an autocrine loop sustained by RA-treatment and involving increase of TrkB expression and its activation, has been demonstrated for KCNR cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, in all these cell lines RA also induces Ret tyrosine kinase receptor expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Bunone1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and we have recently demonstrated that in SK-N-BE cells, the RA-treatment induces a positive autocrine loop that sustains Ret activation and downstream signalling and depends on glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, P39905 Swiss-Prot accession number) expression and release. Ret stimulation in turn is crucial to mediate cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Cerchia1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>However, even if collectively these data indicate a central role of TrkB and Ret receptors in RA-induced cell differentiation, a clear understanding of their respective biological need is still lacking and the mechanism for their involvement in this process has been never clarified.</p><p>Here, we investigated the mechanism of Ret and TrkB involvement in differentiation of malignant NB cells. Our results demonstrate that the RA-induced differentiation of human NB cells depends on the signalling interplay by TrkB and Ret receptors. By promoting Ret phosphorylation in a GDNF-independent manner, the BDNF-stimulated TrkB, causes the induction of the neurite outgrowth and expression of differentiation-specific molecular markers.

Interestingly, inhibiting Ret expression hampered the process of differentiation induced by RA as assessed by monitoring the levels of two proteins whose expression is up-regulated upon RA-induced differentiation in several NB cell lines, the nerve growth factor inducible protein (VGF) and the growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Cerchia1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Rossi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Dimitroulakos1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Even tough this is recognised as the main mechanism that regulates RTK activity, recent reports indicate that alternative ways of activation exist that implicate transactivation triggered by other unrelated membrane receptors in the cytoplasm.</p><p>Here we report for the first time that a physiological process, as the RA-induced differentiation, requires a novel transactivation mechanism which places Ret tyrosine kinase receptor downstream of TrkB receptor.</p><p>As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Bunone1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Cerchia1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> retinoic acid treatment of several human neuroblastoma cells is rapidly followed by a strong increase in the expression of both these transmembrane receptors that become activated in the absence of exogenously added BDNF and GDNF ligands. Here we show that at difference of SH-SY5Y and LAN-5 cells, upon RA-treatment, in SK-N-BE the TrkB protein even increased in expression levels is neither tyrosine phosphorylated nor competent for BDNF acute stimulation. On the other hand, Ret is induced and phosphorylated at comparable levels in the three cell lines.</p><p>Furthermore, we demonstrate that a functional TrkB receptor is needed for RA-mediated cell differentiation, indeed silencing TrkB causes a failure in morphological and biochemical cell differentiation in SH-SY5Y and LAN-5 whereas no effects were observed in SK-N-BE cells that express a non-functional TrkB receptor. On the other hand, we show that blocking Ret expression and activation by siRNA hampers as well the process of differentiation thus indicating that in LAN-5 and SH-SY5Y cells the concurrent activity of both receptors is needed for differentiation.</p><p>In this scenario, the fact that, in SK-N-BE, cell differentiation exclusively depends on Ret activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Cerchia1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> raises the obvious question of by which mechanism TrkB and Ret cooperate in order to shift the NB cells toward a differentiated phenotype.</p><p>Given that silencing of Ret impairs NB differentiation in the three cell lines this indicates that Ret signalling is a common critical step for differentiation. For what it concerns LAN-5 and SH-SY5Y cells, our results establish that the RA-mediated Ret activation and cell differentiation are, in turn, dependent on TrkB activity, since inhibition of TrkB by siRNA significantly impairs Ret phosphorylation. Furthermore, we can exclude the presence of a GDNF-dependent mechanism of Ret activation since neither the D4 aptamer nor the EC-Ret<sup>wt</sup> soluble protein reveal effective in inhibiting Ret phosphorylation following RA treatment of LAN-5 and SH-SY5Y cells. Indeed, the D4 aptamer interferes with the GDNF-mediated Ret dimerization and the EC-Ret<sup>wt</sup> molecule competes for binding to GDNF thus depleting the culture medium of the functional ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Cerchia2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Cerchia3">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Amoresano1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Taken together, our findings strongly indicate that at least two mechanisms can lead to stimulation of Ret activity by RA: the first, characteristic of SK-N-BE cells, lacking of a functional TrkB receptor, implicates the expression and secretion in the medium of GDNF thus providing maintenance of an autocrine loop that mediates cells differentiation (18 and current results); the second, in LAN-5 and SH-SY5Y cells, implicates that Ret activation is mediated by TrkB activity and occurs in the absence of GDNF stimulation. This indicates that a cross-talk mechanism between TrkB and Ret is functional in human NB cells. Furthermore, we show that the BDNF acute stimulation of SH-SY5Y and LAN-5 cells leads to Ret phosphorylation and transactivation in the absence of GDNF, thus confirming the existence of such inter-RTK signalling. In conclusion here we demonstrate that in the three NB cell lines, the RA-dependent Ret activation, both if GDNF-mediated (SK-N-BE) or TrkB-mediated (SH-SY5Y and LAN-5) is needed to induce cell differentiation since the outcome of blocking Ret phosphorylation is a failure in NB cell differentiation.</p><p>Two major mechanisms could explain the TrkB-dependent Ret activation. First, TrkB may heterodimerizes with Ret following BDNF stimulation. Second, TrkB, once phosphorylated by BDNF could in turn activate Ret by an intracellular way.</p><p>The heterodimerization of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor with EGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Saito1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Graves1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> or fibroblast growth factor receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Faraone1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and heterodimerization of insulin-like growth factor receptor and EGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Nahta1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> are examples showing that cross-talk of different receptors may be mediated, at least in some cases, by their heterodimerization. This is unlikely to happen between TrkB and Ret on the basis of the following observations. The D4 aptamer inhibiting properties base on the capability of the RNA molecule to fold in a specific three-dimensional shape that binds at high affinity to Ret monomer and interferes with homodimerization and activation of the receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-Cerchia2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is plausible that this molecule once bound to Ret monomer could obstacle as well Ret/TrkB dimerization. Our result showing that the D4 is unable to hamper RA-dependent Ret activation and differentiation of LAN-5 and SH-SY5Y cells, lends support to the second mechanism.</p><p>Furthermore, it has been demonstrated the existence of cross-talk between the signal pathways mediated by Ret and by another member of the Trk-family, the TrkA receptor, in developing sympathetic neurons, whereby increased Ret expression and phosphorylation takes place as a consequence of TrkA activation by NGF by intracellular mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001643-TsuiPierchala1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.
