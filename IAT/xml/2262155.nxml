Earlier experimental research indicated that cells expressing both EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and the ErbB4 receptor (E1/4 cells) induced E1/4 cell-specific B-Raf activation and higher extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, followed by cellular transformation, than cells solely expressing EGFR (E1 cells) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Since our experimental data revealed the presence of positive feedback by ERK on upstream pathways, it was estimated that the cross-talk/feedback pathway structure of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade might affect ERK activation dynamics in our cell system. To uncover the regulatory mechanism concerning the ERK dynamics, we used topological models and performed parameter estimation for all candidate structures that possessed ERK-mediated positive feedback regulation of Raf. The structure that reliably reproduced a series of experimental data regarding signal amplitude and duration of the signaling molecules was selected as a solution. We found that the pathway structure is characterized by ERK-mediated positive feedback regulation of B-Raf and B-Raf-mediated negative regulation of Raf-1. Steady-state analysis of the estimated structure indicated that the amplitude of Ras activity might critically affect ERK activity through ERK-B-Raf positive feedback coordination with sustained B-Raf activation in E1/4 cells. However, Rap1 that positively regulates B-Raf activity might be less effective concerning ERK and B-Raf activity. Furthermore, we investigated how such Ras activity in E1/4 cells can be regulated by EGFR/ErbB4 heterodimer-mediated signaling. From a sensitivity analysis of the detailed upstream model for Ras activation, we concluded that Ras activation dynamics is dominated by heterodimer-mediated signaling coordination with a large initial speed of dimerization when the concentration of the ErbB4 receptor is considerably high. Such characteristics of the signaling cause the preferential binding of the Grb2-SOS complex to heterodimer-mediated signaling molecules.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Overexpression or mutation of the ErbB receptor is closely correlated with the incidence of various kinds of human cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Olayioye1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Yarden1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

This phenomenon is also confirmed at the cellular level, where transformation of cells occurs when different ErbB receptors are co-expressed in the same cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-GrausPorta1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Schulze1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this cellular transformation mechanism has not been identified because an investigation of the primary interaction of adaptor proteins following kinase activation induced by growth hormones results in relatively small differences in protein binding patterns for cells expressing either single- or multiple-species of ErbB receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Alroy1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Cohen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, EGF (epidermal growth factor)-stimulated EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) in ErbB4 co-expressing cells essentially interacts with adaptor and effector proteins such as growth factor receptor-bound protein2 (Grb2), Src homology and collagen domain protein (Shc), the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3&#x02032;-kinase (PI3K), Cbl and phospholipase C&#x003b3; (PLC&#x003b3;) in a manner that is similar to EGF-stimulated cells solely expressing EGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Alroy1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Cohen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the increase in biological response elicited by the coexpression of ErbB receptors cannot be solely explained by specific protein interactions induced by each receptor. Recently, it was understood that quantitative (strength and duration of activities of the pathways) rather than qualitative (e.g. regulation of different pathways) differences between signaling pathways may largely account for dissimilar biological responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Nagashima1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This explanation may be relevant to a general investigation of factors determining ligand-specific or receptor-specific signal transduction pathways when considering the fact that mammalian cells share almost the same sets of signaling components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Kao1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Moelling1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several studies indicated that signal amplitude and duration are temporally modulated by cross-talk between two pathways (e.g. Raf inhibition by Akt) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Moelling1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Reusch1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and inhibitory feedback from ERK to Grb2-SOS complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Chen1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Holt1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and Raf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Balan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Dougherty1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, our previous study indicated that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing both EGFR and ErbB4 receptors (E1/4 cells) induced specific B-Raf and higher ERK activation than cells solely expressing the EGFR receptor (E1 cells) and induced cellular transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Hatakeyama1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore understood that regardless of the same primary recruitment of effector proteins to each ErbB receptor dimer, the cells induce different structures of downstream regulatory pathways and that such differences might cause a change in the kinase activity level in relation to the cell fate determination process.</p><p>The aim of the present study is to give a mechanistic insight into how E1/4 cells induce a higher amplitude of ERK activity than E1 cells and how B-Raf is involved in ERK activation in an E1/4 cell-specific manner. Our experimental data showed that the inhibiting kinase activity of MEK (MAP kinase kinase) on ERK lowered the MEK response with EGF, indicating that there might exist positive feedback by ERK somewhere within upstream pathways. Furthermore, there are increasing reports of cross-talk between Raf-1 and B-Raf pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Balan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Dougherty1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Garnett1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Rushworth1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the pathway structure of feedback/cross-talk in the MAPK cascade is not clear in our CHO cell lines. Therefore, we estimated the structure based on model parameter estimation examining which structures could reliably reproduce the experimental data with respect to the signal amplitude and duration of the signaling molecules. Although a main structure of MAPK cascade was originally analyzed by Heinrich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Heinrich1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Huang1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, we are the first to apply the topological modeling to CHO cells by adding cross-talk and feedback to explain ERK activation dynamics. As a result, we specified a structure that possesses both negative cross-talk regulation by B-Raf to Raf-1 and positive feedback by ERK to B-Raf. The steady-state analysis of the estimated pathway structure of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade indicated that the amplitude of Ras activity might critically affect ERK activity through ERK-B-Raf positive feedback coordination with sustained B-Raf activation in E1/4 cells. On the other hand, it was shown that the amplitude of Rap1 activity might be less influential on ERK activity. Accordingly, we further investigated differences in amplitude of Ras activity in ErbB signaling pathways using a detailed upstream model modified from Kholodenko's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Kholodenko1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the initial reaction velocity of EGFR/ErbB4 receptor heterodimerization might be considerably higher than that of EGFR homodimerization, and as a result, the Grb2-SOS complex preferentially binds to the activated heterodimer rather than the activated homodimer. Finally, we concluded that the amplitude of Ras activity becomes more potent under high expression of the ErbB4 receptor in E1/4 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Estimation of the feedback and cross-talk structure of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade in CHO cells using a mathematical model</title><p>We first experimentally investigated the presence of feedback regulation by ERK on upstream signal transduction pathways using the MEK inhibitor. The MEK-mediated activation of ERK through phosphorylation of ERK threonine/tyrosine residues has been well established. The inhibition of kinase activity of MEK on ERK and subsequent measurement of MEK phosphorylation represents one approach that could be used to evaluate the effect of ERK-mediated feedback on the upstream pathways. U0126 is a selective inhibitor of MEK and can therefore be used to block the phosphorylation of ERK by MEK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Favata1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Results indicated that EGF-induced MEK activity decreased when ERK activation was inhibited through the use of U0126 in both E1 and E1/4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g001">Figure 1</xref>) (The Western blot data relating to ERK activity following U0126 use is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001782.s011">Figure S1</xref>). This fact implied positive feedback regulation by ERK on upstream molecules, although the feedback point was not clear. Additionally, there is a possibility of cross-talk between Raf isoforms, which has been reported in many cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Dougherty1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Garnett1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Rushworth1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to determine the structure of feedback/cross-talk in CHO cells, we carried out topological modeling of the central Raf-MEK-ERK cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We began by using the main structure of the MAPK cascade (steps 1&#x02013;11) originally given by Heinrich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Heinrich1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, and then included feedback (steps 13, 15, 16, 18), cross-talk (steps 12, 14, 17, 19), and dual phosphorylation of ERK (steps 8&#x02013;11) components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Markevich1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Brightman1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Detailed information pertaining to model construction is summarized in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. We assumed that the structure and kinetic parameters are identical for E1 and E1/4 cells, whereas time courses relating to Ras- and Rap1-GTPs, which represent inputs of the cascade, can differ. Moreover, we assumed that the effect of feedback regulation by ERK on upstream pathways can be approximated by the effect on Raf activity. For instance, suppose that SOS (Son of Sevenless homologue protein) is negatively regulated by ERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Chen1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, and the down-regulation of SOS activity reduces Raf-1 activity via the down-regulation of Ras. Raf-1 activation is then modeled with ERK negative feedback in our topological model. Similarly, we assumed cross-talk regulation between Raf-1 and B-Raf.</p><fig id="pone-0001782-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001782.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The effect of MEK inhibitor U0126 on MEK phosphorylation in E1 and E1/4 cells.</title><p>Serum-starved E1 and E1/4 cells were incubated with 10 nM EGF for the indicated time period with or without pretreatment of 200 nM U0126.

In fact, the simulation results were quite similar for the two structures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g005">Figure 5A</xref> for the number 4 structure and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001782.s014">Figure S4</xref> for all structures). Interestingly, both structures possess positive feedback by ERK to B-Raf and negative cross-talk regulation by B-Raf to Raf-1, and the difference between the two structures being the absence or presence of ERK-mediated positive feedback regulation of Raf-1. However, we found that the ERK-mediated regulation of Raf-1 in number 29 structure was negligible since the maximum velocity was markedly smaller than that determined for Ras-GTP, indicating that the number 29 structure was essentially the same as the number 4 structure. Therefore, we concluded that the structure of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade in E1 and E1/4 cells might be characterized by the number 4 structure, which possesses negative cross-talk regulation by B-Raf to Raf-1 and positive feedback by ERK to B-Raf (steps 14 and 16).

As a result, we found that ERK activity increased with a steep slope along with the input level of Ras-GTP coordination with ERK-B-Raf positive feedback that can stabilize the promotion of ERK activity, but be insensitive to that of Rap1-GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This indicated that ERK activity might be regulated predominantly by Ras activity rather than Rap1 activity in this pathway structure. Interestingly, this conclusion was also true for B-Raf activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), although B-Raf can also be regulated by Rap1-GTP. If this is the case, Rap1 activity would be less influential on ERK activity. In order to confirm the lesser impact of Rap1 activity on ERK activity, we compared ERK activity 5 min after 10 nM EGF treatment in the presence or absence of the PLC&#x003b3; inhibitor U73122, which can indirectly suppress Rap1 activity in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001782-t001">Tables 1, no. 7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Hatakeyama1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. U73122 showed less effect on ERK activity both in E1 and E1/4 cells, and is consistent with the above-mentioned perspective based on steady-state analysis.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, the peak level of Ras activation in E1/4 cells was considerably higher than that of E1 cells. We marked the points at which the amplitude of ERK and B-Raf activity would be induced by input levels equivalent to the peak values of Ras-GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g005">Figures 5B and 5C</xref>) to determine the extent to which the differences impact on ERK and B-Raf activity. Since the input level of Rap1-GTP was not sensitive to ERK activity, we placed symbols at a zero input level of Rap1-GTP for clarity. Notably, the peak activity of Ras-GTP in E1/4 cells was placed at the upper level of ERK activity over the steep slope in comparison with that of E1 cells, which was placed at the lower level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the experimentally observed difference in amplitude of ERK activity was mainly caused by differences in amplitude of Ras activity between E1 and E1/4 cells. Unlike the case of ERK, the peak activity of Ras-GTP in E1 cells was placed at the upper part of the slope of the B-Raf activity profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g005">Figure 5C</xref>); the amplitude of B-Raf activity is therefore quite close to that for E1/4 cells. Furthermore, we investigated ERK and B-Raf activities that would be induced by input levels equivalent to Ras activity 30 min following EGF treatment as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. We found that B-Raf activity at 30 min differed markedly between E1 and E1/4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), whereas ERK activity returned to considerably lower levels in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This implies that B-Raf activity would be sustained for a greater period of time in E1/4 cells than in E1 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that the characteristics of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade are determined mainly by the amplitude of Ras activity and not Rap1 activity. Additionally, differences in the peak level of ERK activity between E1 and E1/4 cells might result from differences in Ras activation amplitude coordination with E1/4 cell-specific sustained B-Raf activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Detailed upstream model of EGFR/ErbB4 heterodimer-mediated Ras activation</title><p>Many studies revealed that ErbB receptor-mediated Ras signaling is deeply involved in ERK activation upon EGF stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Kolch1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, it was reported that Shc activity, which results in Ras activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Brightman1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Maruta1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, might be regulated by mechanisms that differ between E1 and E1/4 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Yumoto1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the detailed mechanism concerning EGFR/ErbB4 heterodimer-mediated signaling is still unclear. In the previous section we demonstrated that differences in amplitude of ERK activity between the two cell lines might be caused predominantly by different Ras activities independently of Rap1 activation dynamics, where we assumed that the pathway structure and kinetic parameters of the central Raf-MEK-ERK cascade were the same. We therefore constructed a detailed upstream model of EGFR/ErbB4 heterodimer-mediated Ras activation to predict how differences in amplitude of Ras activity between E1 and E1/4 cells can be caused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We assumed that one of the crucial factors is the presence of the ErbB4 receptor in the pathways, implying that homodimer-mediated pathways (steps 1&#x02013;12, the left box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g006">Figure 6</xref>) are common in the two cell lines and that heterodimer-mediated pathways (steps 14&#x02013;22, the right box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g006">Figure 6</xref>) are E1/4 cell-specific. For a simulation of E1 cells, the concentration of the ErbB4 receptor was set to zero. Then, steps 14&#x02013;22 were inactive and Ras activity could be controlled by only E11P_ShcP_GS (step 12), otherwise control was achieved through E11P_ShcP_GS and E14P_ShcP_GS (steps 12 and 22). Steps 1&#x02013;11, which include Shc recruitment to the receptor, binding to the Grb2-SOS complex and receptor internalization, were adopted from the earlier study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Kholodenko1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. However, those were re-simplified to maintain the essential dynamics of the pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Hatakeyama2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Our experimental data indicated that the signal amplitude of EGFR phosphorylation was similar in E1 and E1/4 cells although the dynamics seemed to differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), while the amplitude and dynamics of Shc phosphorylation were very different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Therefore, we hypothetically introduced the steps 14&#x02013;22 in order to take into account the effect of ErbB4 receptor-mediated signaling on Shc and Ras regulation. Kinetic parameters were also estimated using GLSDC (Genetic Local Search with distance independent Diversity Control) by comparing the experimental data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001782-t001">Table 1, nos. 4, 8&#x02013;10</xref>) with simulated values (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for parameter estimation of the upstream model).

When the simulation model was used to examine the effect of a 10 nM EGF perturbation on E1 and E1/4 cells, the model reasonably reproduced a similar signal amplitude of EGFR phosphorylation, different amplitude and dynamics of Shc phosphorylation, different amplitude of Ras activation, and transient dynamics of ErbB4 phosphorylation in E1/4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001782-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001782.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Detailed upstream model of EGFR/ErbB4 heterodimer-mediated Ras activation.</title><p>The pathways in the left and right boxes are mediated by the EGFR homodimer and the EGFR/ErbB4 heterodimer, respectively.

To this end, we varied the concentration of the ErbB4 receptor from about 100&#x00025; of the total ErbB4 receptors in E1/4 cells to about 0&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g009">9</xref>). The model with 0&#x00025; ErbB4 receptors corresponds to the E1 cell model. As the abundance of ErbB4 receptors increased, the peak level of activation of E14P_ShcP_GS increased with a steep slope, whereas that of E11P_ShcP_GS decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the peak level of E14P_ShcP_GS was much greater than that of E11P_ShcP_GS, especially for higher concentrations of the ErbB4 receptor. Therefore, the peak level of Ras activation might be critically affected by the concentration of ErbB4 receptors through E14P_ShcP_GS (step 22 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g006">Figure 6</xref>) rather than E11P_ShcP_GS (step12). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g009">Figure 9</xref> shows the time-course patterns of signaling molecules in this sensitivity analysis. The change in peak level of E14P_ShcP was also affected by the concentration of ErbB4 receptors as well as E14P_ShcP_GS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g009">Figures 9B and 9D</xref>), although E11P_ShcP was not sensitive to such changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g009">Figures 9A</xref>). However, the peak level of E11P_ShcP_GS became quite small at around a 100&#x00025; concentration of ErbB4 receptors despite such insensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g009">Figure 9C</xref>) compared to that of E14P_ShcP_GS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g009">Figure 9D</xref>). E11P_ShcP and E14P_ShcP share the interaction partner, the GS (Grb2-SOS) complex. In addition, the initial reaction velocity of E14P_ShcP was faster than that of E11P_ShcP at higher concentrations of the ErbB4 receptor (60&#x02013;100&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g009">Figures 9A and 9B</xref>). Therefore, GS might preferentially bind to E14P_ShcP rather than E11P_ShcP. These results as a whole indicate that the concentration of the ErbB4 receptor in our detailed model might be quite important for the considerably strong Ras activation observed in E1/4 cells, where the ErbB4 receptor-mediated signaling pathway can dominate Ras activation dynamics.</p><fig id="pone-0001782-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001782.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Effect of ErbB4 receptor concentration on E11P_ShcP_GS and E14P_ShcP_GS.</title><p>The two complexes E11P_ShcP_GS and E14P_ShcP_GS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001782-g006">Figure 6</xref> regulate Ras activity.

Moreover, given the benefits of simplified modeling using minimal variation of feedback/cross-talk connections, we were able to arrive at a structure that possessed negative cross-talk regulation of Raf-1 by B-Raf and positive feedback by ERK to B-Raf.

The role of Rap1 in Ras-mediated signaling is still unclear. Rap1 might be implicated in both negative and positive control of Ras-mediated signaling depending on the kinds of ligand and cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-York1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Campa1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Vossler1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our results might be consistent with the earlier results of Zwartkrius et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Zwartkruis1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> in which it was shown that Rap1 did not affect ERK activation in Rat-1 cells.</p><p>Our earlier study showed that E1/4 cells induced specific B-Raf and higher ERK activation upon EGF stimulation than E1 cells, followed by cellular transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Hatakeyama1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. From the steady-state analysis, we concluded that the peak level of Ras activity in E1/4 cells was sufficiently high to induce the ultrasensitive ERK activation. On the other hand, activity in E1 cells is near the bottom of the slope of the Ras-ERK steady-state response curve, such that the amplitude of ERK activity in E1 cells became considerably low. In addition, the B-Raf steady-state response induced by the peak level of Ras activity is similar and high in E1 and E1/4 cells, but considerably different when evaluating Ras activity 30 min after EGF stimulation. Such a difference might cause the different B-Raf activation dynamics upon EGF stimulation, which are sustained in E1/4 cells and transient in E1 cells. The sustained B-Raf activation can then stabilize the promotion of ERK activity through the ERK-B-Raf positive feedback loop in E1/4 cells.</p><p>The mechanism of Ras activation dynamics has been investigated in many studies using mathematical modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Kholodenko1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Hatakeyama2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Schoeberl1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. However, less is known about the effect of heterodimerization on signal transduction pathways. In the present study, we found that the amplitude of Ras activity becomes more potent as the concentration of ErbB4 receptors increases in E1/4 cells. An earlier study revealed that co-expression of EGFR with ErbB2 or ErbB3 biases signaling to the cell surface and retards signal down-regulation, followed by prolonged signaling of downstream molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Shankaran1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike the ErbB1-3 system, we speculated that the initial reaction velocity of EGFR/ErbB4 receptor heterodimerization might be important and considerably higher than that of EGFR homodimerization in our CHO cells. In fact, the critical parameter in determining signal efficacy for the EGFR homodimer-mediated signal transduction system is the initial velocity of receptor activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001782-Schoeberl1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. We have reached a similar conclusion with EGFR/ErbB4 heterodimer-mediated signaling, but here we insisted that the initial velocity of heterodimerization might be more effective for Ras activation dynamics than that of the homodimer. If we follow the ODEs of the detailed upstream model, the concentration of dimers, E11 and E14, are modulated by the following ODEs:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001782.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001782.e002.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>Since the initial concentrations of E11, E11P, E14 and E14P are equivalent to zero, the initial velocities of E11 and E14 are dominated by the first terms. Therefore, in the range<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001782.e003.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>the reaction velocity of E14 becomes higher than that of E11, followed by the difference in the initial reaction velocity. Again, it should be noted that such a range would be wider when the concentration of ErbB4 receptors is high.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>Recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) was purchased from PeproTech House (London, England).
