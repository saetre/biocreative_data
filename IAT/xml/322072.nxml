The genomic DNA segments that hybridized with cDNA were subcloned in M13 phages and their sequences were determined. The nucleotide sequences showed that the IL-2 receptor gene was encoded by eight exons and that the coding region sequences agreed completely with that of the IL-2 receptor cDNA cloned from a cell line derived from adult T cell leukemia (ATL), in which IL-2 receptors are expressed abnormally. The nucleotide sequence of the 5'-flanking region had a putative promotor region, which had some homology with the human IL-2 gene. Transcription initiation sites were clustered about 25 bp 3' to the TATA box as assessed by primer extension analysis. These sites for normal and ATL T cells were the same. Exons 2 and 4 encoding the extracytoplasmic portion had significant homology, suggesting that the two exons are derived by duplication of an ancestral exon. Exon 2 contained six cysteine residues, four of which are conserved at the corresponding positions in exon 4.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0055-a" xlink:role="7587"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7579"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7580"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0049.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7581"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0050.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7582"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0051.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7583"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0052.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7584"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0053.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7585"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7586"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0055.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7587"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7588"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00315-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7589"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
