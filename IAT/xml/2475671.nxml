A heterohexameric protein complex called the origin recognition complex (ORC) binds to origins of replication and becomes a stage upon which the replication initiation machinery assembles. Cdc6 and Cdt1 associate with ORC and help recruit the MCM helicase complex. Many other factors are recruited, including DNA polymerase, which allow DNA replication to begin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Machida1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Mendez1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the assembly of these proteins onto origins and regulation of their activities is a critical step in limiting DNA replication to once per cell cycle.</p><p>The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) regulates DNA replication and is important for maintaining proper ploidy.

Similarly, loss of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rb homologue, <italic>rbf1</italic>, results in inappropriate replication and mislocalization of Orc2 in follicle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Bosco1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the temporal and spatial pattern of histone acetylation at a <italic>Drosophila</italic> replication origin is altered in <italic>rbf1</italic> mutant follicle cells, also suggesting a role for this protein in chromatin-mediated origin activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Hartl1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The canonical function of Rb is to restrict cell proliferation by binding and suppressing members of the E2F family of transcription factors, which results in downregulation of genes required for DNA synthesis and S phase progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Dimova1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Cobrinik1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Rb also physically interacts with the proteins of many genes it transcriptionally regulates, such as MCM, DNA polymerase alpha, RFC, and Cyclin E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Sterner1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Kelly1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, human Rb can repress replication in a Xenopus cell-free and transcription-free system by binding to MCM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Sterner1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Gladden1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Pacek1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively, this evidence suggests that Rb may have a direct, post-transcriptional influence on DNA replication machinery. The molecular mechanisms through which Rb might directly influence origin activity are unclear.</p><p>The amino-terminal domain of Rb may play a role in regulating DNA replication initiation. Some <italic>in vitro</italic> replication assays have shown that the Rb amino-terminus can bind and inhibit MCM7, a component of the replicative helicase that is important for replication initiation and elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Sterner1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Pacek1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rbf1 interacts with ORC in an E2F independent manner through multiple domains that are outside of the E2F binding domain. The Rbf1 amino-terminal domain associates <italic>in vivo</italic> with chromosomal regions implicated in replication initiation, including colocalization with Orc2 and acetylated histone H4. Significantly, our work illustrates novel interactions of Rb with the replication initiation machinery that have important implications for our understanding of cell proliferation and tumor suppression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Rbf1 interacts with ORC through multiple domains</title><p>We showed previously by coimmunoprecipitation that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Orc1 and Orc2 proteins interact with the dDP/dE2F1/Rbf1 complex in ovarian extracts, and we wished to further characterize this interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Bosco1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

We used <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell culture to test the association of transiently transfected Rbf1 proteins with endogenous ORC proteins. We expressed V5 epitope tagged Rbf1 deletion fragments in S2 cells under the inducible metallothionein promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Bunch1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and tested whether they would coimmunoprecipitate with endogenous Orc2. We found that the Rbf1 N-terminal fragment (Rbf1N, amino acids 1&#x02013;345) was sufficient for its interaction with ORC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We next tested the Rbf1-ORC interaction in S2 cells using two different constructs of the Rbf1 C-terminal fragment, one with amino acids 345&#x02013;845 and another with amino acids 345&#x02013;797. We observed that the Rbf1(345&#x02013;845)-V5 fragment could be coimmunoprecipitated with Orc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the Rbf1(345&#x02013;797)-V5 fragment did not pellet with Orc2 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This data suggests that an interaction of ORC with the Rbf1 C-terminus requires amino acids 797&#x02013;845 of Rbf1. However, it was also possible that the 345&#x02013;797 fragment could not properly fold into a functional protein. It has been shown previously that the C-terminal half of Rbf1 contains a pocket domain that interacts with dE2F and that the 345&#x02013;797 fragment is sufficient for this interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Xin1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we asked whether the V5 tagged Rbf1 345&#x02013;797 fragment could still associate with dE2F1 in S2 cell extracts. Indeed, Rbf1(345&#x02013;797)-V5 was found in dE2F1 immunoprecipitates while Rbf1(1&#x02013;345)-V5 was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Additional deletions of the Rbf1 N-terminal region into amino acids 1&#x02013;150 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) and amino acids 1&#x02013;330 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) allowed us to further define the N-terminal 150&#x02013;330 Rbf1 amino acids as being necessary for its association with Orc2. These observations indicate that ORC interacts with Rbf1 through multiple sites distinct from the dE2F binding site. Since there are two Rb family genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Rbf1 and Rbf2, we tested whether ORC also interacts with Rbf2.

We expressed Rbf1N-RFP in larvae using GAL4 drivers expressed specifically in the salivary glands. The salivary glands were incubated in chromatin wash buffer before being fixed with formaldehyde to remove any unbound Rbf1N-RFP. Confocal images of whole-mount nuclei reveal that Rbf1N-RFP localizes specifically to the regions in between DNA bands stained by DAPI, called interband DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Co-staining with an antibody directed against the modified histone dimethyl-H3K4, a marker of interbands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Ebert1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, confirms that Rbf1N-RFP is enriched at interbands. In addition, measurements of fluorescent intensity along chromosome bands visibly exhibit the interband localization of Rbf1N-RFP and dimethyl-H3K4 in between the DAPI bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Rbf1N-RFP appears to be more broadly distributed across the chromosomes than dimethyl-H3K4. However, a closer analysis of colocalization revealed that 49 out of 54 dimethyl-H3K4 bands chosen at random overlap conspicuously with Rbf1N-RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, Rbf1N-RFP localization on polytene chromosomes also overlaps consistently with acetylated histone H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g004">Figure 4</xref>), a histone modification that was shown to also mark active origins of replication in <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Hartl1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Aggarwal1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Rbf1N and Orc2 appear to colocalize in many places on the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), where 32 out of 40 bands chosen at random contain both Rbf1N-RFP and Orc2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Measurement of fluorescent intensity along one region of the chromosome shows that colocalization of Rbf1N and Orc2 occurs in an interband (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). It is also interesting to note that photobleaching of Rbf1N-RFP resulted in a modest increase in GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g005">Figure 5D boxed area, and Figure 5G</xref>), which may be an indication of FRET. Previous studies illustrated that EGFP and mCherry have the ability to exhibit fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with a F&#x000f6;rster radius at 5.4nm, which is the distance at which 50&#x00025; of the excited EGFP molecules are neutralized by FRET <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Tramier1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Merzlyak1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it appears that Rbf1N-RFP complexes with ORC and is within sufficient proximity (1&#x02013;10 nm) so as to neutralize some of the light emission from Orc2-GFP, which is characteristic of FRET. Upon photobleaching, Rbf1N-RFP can no longer absorb the GFP emission, which allows us to more fully visualize the Orc2-GFP. To quantify FRET we photobleached RFP in a discrete section of three different nuclei and compared the amount of fluorescence between photobleached and non-photobleached areas within the same nucleus. We found that GFP fluorescence increases 1.5&#x02013;2 fold after RFP photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). A two-tailed T-test indicates that GFP fluorescence increase is highly statistically significant p&#x0003c;0.0001 in each of the three nuclei.

Due to its association with ORC, Rbf1 might inhibit the activity of the replication initiation complex. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of Rbf1 by Cyclin-CDK complexes releases binding partners, such as E2F, and may constitute part of a reversible switch to regulate origins of replication. This switchable regulation may come in part through changes in recruitment of associated chromatin modifying enzymes and tethering of phosphorylated Rbf1 by the Myb-MuvB complex may allow Rbf1 to ping-pong from one complex to another in a localized manner. (B) We speculate that because Rbf1 may be able to associate with chromatin bound ORC and through multiple domains it can be tethered in more than one orientation, thereby presenting and/or occluding docking sites for other Rbf1-associated chromatin factors (e.g. histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferase, etc.). For example, this may allow Rbf1 to function as an &#x0201c;adaptor&#x0201d; molecule at any one ORC site where its specific orientation dictates which factors (depicted as &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Y&#x0201d;) may or may not be present at any given time. This model predicts that a single genomic site may have constitutive ORC/Rbf1 localization while re-orientation of the Rbf1 molecule can mediate the recruitment of different suites of chromatin modifying enzymes.

In addition, Rbf1 may also associate with other replication factors, for example RFC and MCM complexes that may also serve to tether Rbf1 to chromatin. Our observations and data reported by others support a model in which Rbf1 may constitute part of a sensor switch at origins of replication and/or sites of transcription that can be rapidly disabled to allow for replication initiation or gene transcription, while its physical presence allows it to be reactivated just as quickly to repress these processes in response to specific cues, such as DNA damage or developmental signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Hartl1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Aggarwal1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Lewis1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Korenjak1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Georlette1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>.

This idea adds further complexity to the sensor switch model in that any given genomic locus where Rbf1 is tethered may have very different chromatin states (at different times or in different cells) that are determined as Rbf1 &#x0201c;rotates&#x0201d; through its multiple binding sites with its tether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002831-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

Although we have failed to observe any appreciable cell cycle function of the Rbf1N domain by itself, we nevertheless propose that this domain plays an important function by creating multiple protein binding configurations and by tethering Rbf1 to chromatin. Protein sequence and structural conservation between humans and flies and within Drosophilidae also suggests a conserved and unappreciated function of the N-terminal domain of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor proteins. We speculate that the amino-terminal domain of Rb in both flies and humans has much to reveal about cell cycle control and cancer biology that merits further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>RBF1 expression constructs and transgenic flies</title><p>All C-terminal V5-tagged RBF1 proteins were expressed under the metallothionein gene promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002831-Bunch1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pMT/V5-HisB expression plasmid (Invitrogen).

Pairwise protein sequence alignments were performed to determine the percent amino acid identity between respective N-terminal (A) and C-terminal (B) domains of human and fly retinoblastoma family proteins. Note that percent similarity is in parentheses. The analysis revealed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rbf1 shares the highest percentage of amino acid identity with human p107, most notably in its N-terminal domain. On the other hand, Rbf2 is most identical to Rbf1 throughout the length of the protein. The C-terminal half of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rbf proteins show more overall amino acid similarity to human pRb than p107 or p130. Thus, Rbf1 appears to have a split personality between p107 and pRb. (C and D) Both domains of the Rbf1 and Rbf2 proteins are conserved within Drosophilidae. Multiple sequence alignments of the protein domains of Rbf1 and Rbf2 were used to produce a phylogenetic tree that includes relative distances of divergence. Tree branch lengths indicate that amino acid sequences of both domains of Rbf1 have been more tightly conserved relative to Rbf2. Indeed, Ka/Ks analysis (E) confirms that both domains have been under negative selection and that Rbf1 appears to have been under stronger negative selection than Rbf2. It is also interesting to note that, although Rbf2 protein sequence has experienced greater drift than Rbf1, the Rbf2 N-terminal domain appears to have drifted less than its C-terminal domain, as indicated by the branch lengths of the phylogenetic trees (C and D) and Ka/Ks analysis (E). Rbf2 is not an essential gene, and it has overlapping functions with Rbf1, which might explain the loose conservation of its protein sequence. However, the N-terminal domains of Rbf1 and Rbf2 had similar Ka/Ks values, indicating that they had been under similar selection pressures to retain the amino acid sequence of this domain. (F) A protein structure of Rbf1N was modeled based on the crystal structure of the human RbN. Residues were highlighted based upon conservation determined by pairwise sequence alignments, with red indicating identical amino acids, orange representing conserved substitutions, and yellow being semi-conserved substitutions. The dashed circle encompasses an area of conservation representative of a possible protein interaction surface. (G) Multiple sequence alignment of the conserved surface circled in (F) from widely divergent organisms revealed that this region is highly conserved.
