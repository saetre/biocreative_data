The results showed that the Yps are largely homologous in translated regions, especially in the 3' half of the genes. Untranscribed flanking regions had little homology. A conserved inverted repeat (the H-box) has homology both to vertebrate steroid hormone receptor binding sites and to the ecdysone control region of Drosophila's hsp23. These results identify sequences to mutate in order to define elements that regulate Yp gene expression and govern YP polypeptide function.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0079-a" xlink:role="69"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0080-a" xlink:role="70"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0077.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="67"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0078.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="68"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0079.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="69"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="70"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="71"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="72"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="73"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="74"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="75"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="76"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="77"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="78"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="79"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="80"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="81"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="82"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="83"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="84"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00245-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="85"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
