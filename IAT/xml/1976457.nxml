Previously we have revealed a five-helix structure of the N-terminal CUT domain, which is essentially the folded region in the MAR-binding domain, of human SATB1 by NMR. Here we determined crystal structure of the complex of the CUT domain and a MAR DNA, in which the third helix of the CUT domain deeply enters the major groove of DNA in the B-form. Bases of 5&#x02032;-CTAATA-3&#x02032; sequence are contacted by this helix, through direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds and apolar and van der Waals contacts. Mutations at conserved base-contacting residues, Gln402 and Gly403, reduced the DNA-binding activity, which confirmed the importance of the observed interactions involving these residues. A significant number of equivalent contacts are observed also for typically four-helix POU-specific domains of POU-homologous proteins, indicating that these domains share a common framework of the DNA-binding mode, recognizing partially similar DNA sequences.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Association of the matrix attachment regions (MARs) in the chromosomal DNA with the nuclear matrix organizes the higher order structure of the genome, forming looped structures that are likely to be equivalent to active chromatin domains in terms of transcription as well as replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The MAR sequences are generally AT-rich at 70% and possess potential of DNA bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). They have regions where base pairs tend to break under an unwinding stress (base-unpairing region: BUR), centered at a sequence ATATAT, which was termed as BUR nucleation sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The tendency of base unpairing in the MAR DNA was shown to be essential in binding to the nuclear matrix and enhancing the promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1) was originally isolated as a factor that specifically binds to the BUR sequence, where mutation of the ATATAT sequence impaired the binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). SATB1, predominantly expressed in thymocytes, recruits histone deacetylase complex to the MAR site inside the interleukin-2 receptor &#x003b1; gene, in order to repress its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). SATB1-null mice exhibit irregular expression of the above gene and related genes in the premature CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, which caused small thymi and spleens, and death at age of 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). SATB1 also regulates the expression of fetal globin genes in the erythroid progenitor cells, by binding to MARs in the locus control region and the &#x003b5;-globin promoter region in the &#x003b2;-globin cluster, and forming a complex with CREB-binding protein that possesses histone acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Inside the cells, SATB1 is localized at nuclei and surrounds heterochromatin, forming a cage-like network structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Recently, it was shown that phosphorylation by protein kinase C alters preference for proteins to bind, i.e. histone deacetylase or histone acetyltransferase, and that acetylation by the latter impairs DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>SATB1 is &#x0223c;800 amino acids in length, possessing three DNA-binding motifs, i.e. two CUT domains and a homeodomain, in which a region of &#x0223c;150 amino acids that includes the N-terminal CUT domain (CUT repeat 1, CUTr1) is reported to be the region relevant to the recognition of the MAR DNA (MAR-binding domain; MBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). We have revealed by NMR that the CUTr1 region of &#x0223c;80 amino acids is folded whilst the remainder of MBD is largely unfolded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The solution structure of CUTr1 contained five &#x003b1;-helices, in which the N-terminal four are arranged similarly to the four-helix structures of the CUT domain of hepatocyte nuclear factor 6&#x003b1; and the POU-specific domains of POU-homologous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). Our NMR titration analysis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments using groove-specific binding drugs and methylated DNAs indicated that SATB1 possesses a DNA-binding mode similar to that of the POU-specific domain, in which third helix recognizes DNA bases from the major groove side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), although the mechanism of specific recognition of the MAR sequence has yet to be revealed.</p><p>In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the complex of SATB1&#x02013;CUTr1 and a MAR DNA, by a molecular replacement method using the NMR solution structure. The domain indeed contacted DNA from the major groove side, similarly to the POU-specific domains. The contacting manners by the two types of domains show striking similarity to each other at least in part, revealing that they share a framework of the DNA binding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Sample preparation</title><p>A pET15b (Novagen) expression vector of a SATB1-CUTr1 mutant fragment where four basic residues Arg-Lys-Arg-Lys were attached to the C-terminus of fragment Asn368&#x02013;Leu452 was produced by PCR from a previously made expression vector of fragment Val353&#x02013;Asn490 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) with primers including the mutational sequence (5&#x02032;-CAACAGGTT<italic>CATATG</italic>AACACAGAGGTGTCTTCCGAAATC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CA<italic>GGATCC</italic>TATTA<underline>TTTACGTTTACG</underline>CAAGCTCCTTTCCCTTTCGTCCTGG-3&#x02032;; mutational sequence in the reverse primer is underlined and recognition sequences of <italic>Nde</italic>I or <italic>Bam</italic>HI are shown in italic.).

The structure of DNA is essentially in the standard B-form without significant deformation. The &#x003b1;3-helix, especially in its N-terminal half, deeply enters the major groove of DNA acting as the recognition helix, in a manner where the helical axes of the &#x003b1;-helix and DNA are perpendicular to each other. The backbone structure of the protein in the crystal is similar to that of the solution structure determined by NMR (the minimized average structure of the ensemble) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b). The RMSD value for the C&#x003b1; atoms in the Val371-Gln445 region is 0.99&#x02009;&#x000c5; after superimposition. However, the two structures significantly differ in Arg400&#x02013;Gln402 in the N-terminal cap region of &#x003b1;-helix 3, with RMSD of 2.59&#x02009;&#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b). In this region, &#x003b1;-helix 3 starts from Gln402 in the crystal structure, even though Gly at position 403 generally acts as a helix breaker, although it starts from Leu404 in the solution structure. This is likely to be caused by the interaction with DNA, since the side-chains of the residues in this region directly contact DNA bases and phosphates, as described below. The difference in the C-terminal region is more noticeable, with RMSD of 6.12&#x02009;&#x000c5; for Asp446&#x02013;Leu452, where the helix of the solution structure is truncated at Gln445 while that in the crystal structure elongates to Leu452. This is not likely to be the result of the protein&#x02013;DNA interaction, since the previous NMR titration experiment did not show significant chemical-shift changes in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Alternatively, we suggest that the solution structure of the domain also contains the long helix at least in some conformations, although NMR structural constraints based on nuclear Overhauser enhancements and amide hydrogen exchange protection were not obtained because of the significant flexibility in this region. The Asp446&#x02013;Leu452 region shows relatively large temperature factors, with average of 39.2 &#x000b1; 8.9 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for backbone atoms, where the whole determined region (Glu370&#x02013;Arg453) shows 22.4 &#x000b1; 9.2 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>. In addition, the two crystal structures showed relatively large RMSD value of 1.29&#x02009;&#x000c5; in this region, which also indicates the high flexibility (Supplementary Figure S4). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Structures of SATB1-CUTr1 and POU-specific domains.

It is noteworthy that two basic residues in &#x003b1;-helix 3, Arg410 and Lys411, form hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic contacts with Glu407. Especially, Arg410 form two hydrogen bonds to Glu407 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c). These interactions are likely to constrain the conformation of Glu407 side-chain so that the C<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> and C<sup>&#x003b4;</sup> atom are closer to the C<sup>5M</sup> atoms of T4&#x02032; and T5&#x02032; than the O<sup>&#x003b5;</sup> atoms, which is essential for the apolar contacts.

In addition, O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> of Ser421 is in a position allowing a hydrogen bond to the backbone phosphate of G1, if the DNA is not artificially truncated. Among these residues, Gln390 is of special note in that, in addition to two hydrogen bonds to two phosphate groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a), the O<sup>&#x003b5;</sup> atom forms a hydrogen bond to the N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup> atom of Gln402 that is the only residue forming direct hydrogen bonds to the base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b). This hydrogen-bonding network is likely to contribute primarily to fixing the relative position of protein and DNA, namely, defining the DNA-binding framework.</p><p>The contacts to the DNA backbone should be important in the protein&#x02013;DNA binding, enhancing the affinity, although not directly contributing to the sequence-specific recognition. It should be noted that Thr401, Gln402, Leu404, Ser406 and Glu407 contact to both the DNA bases and backbones, simultaneously. It was shown for Ser406 that a mutation to Ala reduces the DNA-binding activity by more than 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>It should be emphasized that mutations of the base-contacting residues conserved among CUT domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a), i.e. Gln402 and Gly403, on the MBD fragment (Val353&#x02013;Asn490), as well as those of Ser406 and Arg410, significantly reduced the DNA-binding activity [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>b; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>)]. Therefore, the binding mode described above is unlikely to be induced by the basic residues introduced at the C-terminus of the present SATB1-CUTr1 fragment.</p></sec><sec><title>SATB1 recognition sequence in the MAR DNA</title><p>The base contacts described above are likely to define the sequence specificity of SATB1-CUTr1 to the MAR DNA, resulting in a recognition sequence of CTAATA/TATTAG, or (Y)TAATA/TATTA(R) considering the relatively weak contact and the presumable preference to pyrimidine (Y) rather than purine (R) at the C2 position. The recognition sequence only partially includes the BUR nucleation sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), ATATAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b), to which SATB1 is initially expected to bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The mutation that impaired the binding of SATB1 changed the CTAATA sequence to CTACTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), which should interfere the contacts by Gln402, Gly403, Ser406 and Glu407, at least partly, according to the present contacting profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a). Consistently, a missing nucleotide experiment in the same report showed that SATB1 contacts the DNA in the region centered at a sequence CTAATA, but not at ATATAT. We have previously introduced methylation at the N<sup>6</sup> atom of adenine base at position of A3&#x02032; or A6&#x02032; and observed that DNA binding was significantly interfered only when A6&#x02032; was methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), which is also consistent with the present observation that the O<sup>&#x003b5;</sup> atom of Gln402 forms a hydrogen bond with the N<sup>6</sup> atom of A6&#x02032;, while the A3&#x02032; base is not contacted by the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>a)</p></sec><sec><title>DNA recognition by other CUT domains</title><p>This study is the first report regarding the geometry of sequence-specific DNA recognition by a CUT domain. There are three subgroups of CUT-domain proteins, i.e. (i) SATB proteins including SATB1 and SATB2, possessing two CUT-domain repeats, (ii) ONECUT group including HNF6&#x003b1; and ONECUT proteins, possessing a single CUT domain and (iii) human CCAAT displacement protein (CDP) and its murine autholog, Cut homeobox (Cux), possessing three repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). Sequence specificity and/or DNA-binding activities of these CUT domains are significantly different among one another. Namely, HNF6&#x003b1; recognizes the ATCAAT sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and the N-terminal CUT domain, repeat 1, of CDP/Cux recognizes the CCAAT sequence, while the other two CUT domains, repeat 2 and repeat 3, recognize ATCGAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), which are different from the present SATB1-binding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c). In addition, Cut repeat 2 of SATB1 protein is dispensable for binding to the MAR DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, many DNA-contacting residues observed in this study are conserved among these CUT domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a), indicating that the DNA-binding mode is essentially shared. Especially, the important base-contacting residues, Gln402 and Gly403, are perfectly conserved, which form hydrogen bonds to A6&#x02032; base, and apolar and van der Waals contacts to T5&#x02032;, respectively. Also, Thr or Ser is conserved at position 401, which is, together with Gly at position 403, capable of forming the water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the N<sup>6</sup> and N<sup>7</sup> atoms of the A4 base. With regard to these hydrogen bonds, the A4 base can be replaced by a G base, since O<sup>6</sup> and N<sup>7</sup> of the G base would act as two hydrogen-bond acceptors. Therefore, a sequence of the three base pairs R4A5T6/A6&#x02032;T5&#x02032;Y4&#x02032; is likely to be recognized commonly by the CUT domains.

When Leu404 is simply replaced by Thr in the present SATB1-CUTr1/DNA structure, it is still possible to form apolar contacts to the C<sup>5M</sup> atom in the T3 base, but not to atoms of the C2 base. In contrast, when Glu407 is replaced by Asp, apolar contacts to the C<sup>5M</sup> atoms of the T4&#x02032; and T5&#x02032; bases are likely to be disrupted. These observation suggest that HNF6&#x003b1; recognizes the T3/A3&#x02032; base pair, but not the A4/T4&#x02032; base pair, and, therefore, that the ATTGAT sequence (&#x02018;HNF6aR&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c), but not the ATCAAT, is the direction equivalent to the YYRAT consensus core sequence.</p><p>The three CUT domains of CDP possess Ser at the position equivalent to Leu404 of SATB1-CUTr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). When Leu404 is simply replaced by Ser in the SATB1-CUTr1/DNA structure, an apolar contact between the Ser C<sup>&#x003b2;</sup> atom and the T3 C<sup>5M</sup> atom would still be possible depending on the conformation (data not shown), although it should be much weaker than those from the C<sup>&#x003b2;</sup> and C<sup>&#x003b4;1</sup> atoms of the Leu residue and may allow a C base at the T3 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c). It should be noted that CUT repeat 1 possesses Glu at the position equivalent to Glu407, although it is Asp for CUT repeats 2 or 3. For CUT repeat 1, the interactions between Glu and the T4&#x02032; and T5&#x02032; bases should be conserved, although for CUT repeats 2 and 3, those between Asp and the T bases are unlikely. Therefore, repeat 1, but not repeat 2 or 3, is likely to require an A base at position 4.</p><p>SATB1-CUTr2 is not likely to contribute to the MAR-DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), which may be explained as follows. Among the several DNA-contacting residues that differ between CUTr1 and CUTr2, those likely to largely influence the binding are Trp at position 404 and Cys at position 406 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). The former possesses a bulky side-chain compared to Leu and, when simply replaced, shows a steric hindrance with DNA sugar-phosphate backbone or other amino acids, such as Arg400 and Asn425, probably disrupting contacts including hydrogen bonds to the phosphate. Also, the side-chain of Cys at position 406 is unable to form a hydrogen bond to a DNA phosphate.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with POU-specific domains</title><p>We previously predicted that the framework of DNA binding by the five-helix SATB1-CUTr1 structure is similar to that by the basically four-helix POU-specific domains of POU-homologous proteins, in that the third helix acts as the recognition helix and deeply enters the major groove of DNA, judging from the structural similarity and the NMR titration and SPR experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), which was confirmed by the present crystal structure. In the crystal structures of the complex of DNA and POU-homologous proteins, Oct-1, Pit-1 and HNF1&#x003b1; (PDB entries 1OCT, 1AU7 and 1IC8, respectively), the third helix of the common four helices of the POU-specific domains acts as the recognition helix, achieving the sequence-specific DNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31">29&#x02013;31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c and d). We have re-analyzed contacting profiles in these crystal structures, by the same criteria adopted in this study.</p><p>Although the amino acid sequences in the recognition helices of POU-specific domains are not very similar to those of CUT domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b), a Gln residue that is strictly conserved among the POU-specific domains forms a pair of hydrogen bonds to adenine N<sup>6</sup> and N<sup>7</sup> atoms, essentially in the same manner as Gln402 of SATB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b and d). In addition, another Gln residue is also conserved, which forms hydrogen bonds to the side-chain of the above Gln residue and at the same time to phosphate groups from both the side-chain and backbone N atoms, in the similar manner as Gln390 of SATB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>a, c and d, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>b and d). Since this conserved hydrogen-bonding network is most important in defining the DNA-binding framework, as described above, SATB1-CUTr1 and POU-specific domains are likely to share the DNA-binding framework.</p><p>Therefore, in order to compare the DNA-contacting profiles, amino acid sequences of the recognition helices are aligned so that the Gln residue equivalent to Gln402 of SATB1 (hereafter we use term &#x02018;residue 402&#x02019;, etc.) is conserved among the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). Also, sequences of the DNA regions contacted in the crystal structures are aligned in reference to the T6-A6&#x02032; base pair that is contacted by Gln402 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c). Based on the alignments, the contacting profiles i.e. locations and modes, of SATB1-CUTr1 and POU-specific domains are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>d. In addition to the conserved hydrogen bonds to the A base at position equivalent to A6&#x02032; of SATB1-CUTr1 recognition sequence (hereafter we use term &#x02018;base 6&#x02032;&#x02019;, etc.), there are several points where the contacting profiles of the SATB1-CUTr1 and POU-specific domains are similar to each other, as indicated in red color in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>d. For example, hydrogen bonds between residue 403 and base 4 are observed for SATB1 and all the POU-specific domains. It should be noted, however, that the amino acids of residue 403 (Gly, Thr or Ser) and bases of base 4 (A or C or T) are different and therefore, manners of hydrogen bonding are different. Namely, for OCT1, O<sup>&#x003b3;1</sup> of Thr accepts a hydrogen bond from N<sup>4</sup> of C base, while for Pit-1, O<sup>&#x003b3;1</sup> of Thr donates a hydrogen bond to O<sup>4</sup> of T base, and for HNF1&#x003b1;, O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> of Ser accepts a hydrogen bond from N6 of A base (data not shown), which are also different from SATB1-CUTr1, where backbone N of Gly donates a hydrogen bond to a water that behaves as both hydrogen donor and acceptor to the A4 base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a).</p><p>There are four contacts that are observed only for SATB1-CUTr1, while 16 are observed only for either of the three POU-specific domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>d). Among the latter 16, only four are observed for all the POU-specific domains, i.e. hydrogen bonds between residue 403 and base 5&#x02032;, hydrogen bonds between residue 407 and base 3, van der Waals contacts between residue 403 and base 4, and van der Waals contacts between residue 407 and base 3. Even for these four, manner of contacts are diverse, similarly to as described above. Thus, the difference between the base-contacting profiles of SATB1-CUTr1 and POU-specific domains are at a similar level to that among the POU-specific domains. In fact, common and different contacts between SATB1-CUTr1 and HNF1&#x003b1; are both 14 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>d, which is better than the case between OCT-1 and HNF1&#x003b1;, showing 11 common and 15 different contacts, and the case between Pit-1 and HNF1&#x003b1; with 11 common and 18 different contacts.</p><p>Contacts to DNA backbone are also similar among these domains at least partially. Namely, contacts equivalent to the hydrogen bonds from Gln390 (Gln27 of OCT-1 and of Pit-1, and Gln130 of HNF1&#x003b1;; mentioned above; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>d), Thr401 (Ser43 of OCT-1 and Pit-1), Ser406 (Ser48 of OCT-1 and Ser145 of HNF1&#x003b1;), Ser421 (Ser56 of OCT-1 and Pit-1) and Asn425 (Asn59 of OCT-1 and Pit-1) of SATB1-CUTr1 to phosphate groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a) are observed also for either of the POU-specific domains. In addition, apolar contacts similar to that from Ser389 of SATB1 are observed for Thr26 of OCT-1 and Pit-1. It should be noted that the contacted phosphates and sugars are equivalent to those of the nucleotides contacted by SATB1-CUTr1 on the basis of the alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c.</p><p>It is concluded, therefore, that the SATB1-CUTr1 shares its DNA-binding framework with POU-specific domains, where a significant number of contacts to DNA bases and backbones are conserved. Within the framework, contacts of bases by similar or different types of amino acids located at similar positions yield a partly similar recognition sequences. In the alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c, a preference to the ATA/TAT sequence at positions 5&#x02013;7/7&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; is clear. It should be noted that one of the sequences contacted by HNF1&#x003b1; (TTAATA) matches the (Y)TAATA recognition sequence of SATB1 when the relatively weak contact and the presumable preference to pyrimidine (Y) rather than purine (R) at the C2 position was considered, as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary implications</title><p>As described above, the CUT domains and POU-specific domains are two very similar subtypes of helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix DNA-binding domains, which are highly likely to be evolutionarily related to each other. The conserved hydrogen-bonding network involving two Gln and an A base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a,c and d; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b and d) is also observed for some other proteins with helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix DNA-binding motif, such as 434 repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), 434 Cro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) and &#x003bb; repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), which all are from phages, but not for Trp repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), CAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), lac repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) or purine repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), which are of bacterial origin. Therefore, this hydrogen-bonding network can be a strong clue to classifying the subfamilies of the helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix DNA-binding domains, and CUT and POU-specific domains are likely to be related to phage repressors, rather than bacterial ones.</p><p>The proteins containing CUT or POU-specific domains are also likely to be related to each other. They commonly possess homeodomain regions more C-terminal to CUT or POU-specific domain, except for minor entries possessing only CUT or POU-specific domain, which appear in the NCBI Conserved Domain Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml</ext-link>). Both the groups of the proteins are identified from <italic>bilateria</italic> group of animals that includes nematoda, insects and vertebrates, but not from more primitive animals, yeast or plants, while homeodomain proteins exist more widely in eukaryotes. Together with the structural relationship with phage repressors, we propose a hypothesis of a lateral transfer in which a phage repressor-like DNA-binding domain was incorporated into a homeodomain protein of a nematoda-like animal that is fed on bacteria occasionally transfected with phages. After the transfer, the proteins became divided into two groups along with the evolution of animals. During the evolution, these proteins are likely to keep functioning as transcriptional repressors or activators, although the target systems became quite diverse, e.g. nervous systems including pituitary gland, and blood and immune systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of the DNA-binding activity of the full-length SATB1</title><p>The most characteristic point in the interaction between SATB1&#x02013;CUTr1 and a MAR&#x02013;DNA is that only a single pair of direct hydrogen bonds are used to recognize bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>a), which is atypical of DNA recognition from the major groove side mostly driven by direct hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Although water-mediated hydrogen bonds, apolar contacts and other van der Waals contacts compensate them to achieve the sequence specificity, the affinity is not expected to be very strong. In fact, this CUT domain itself did not show significant DNA-binding activity when isolated from the other regions of MBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and we attached four basic residues at C-terminus for the present crystallographic study. To gain stable DNA binding by the full-length protein, attachment of homeodomain at more C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) and dimerization driven by the N-terminal PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) are likely to be necessary. When the PDZ domain is removed by proteolysis by caspase 6, the DNA-binding activity of the protein as well as the activity in the transcription regulation is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Recently it was reported that acetylation by histone acetyltransferase at the N-terminal PDZ-domain region impairs the DNA-binding activity, implying a possibility of loss of dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Therefore, affinity in the DNA-binding domain itself should not be too strong, in order to allow post-translational regulation of the DNA-binding activity of the protein in cells, and thereby effective transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Accession number</title><p>The co-ordinates of the structures determined from the laboratory and synchrotron data sets as well as the relevant structural factors have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank under accession IDs 2O49 and 2O4A, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm504_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm504_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm504_2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm504_3.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm504_4.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm504_nar-00683-r-2007-File008.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors thank H.
