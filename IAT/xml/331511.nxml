Bacteriol. 175: 655-660, 1993) was mapped precisely. A 9540-bp region containing the dnaA gene was cloned and the entire region was sequenced with the exception of a previously reported region of 2517 bp (Fujita, M.Q., Yoshikawa, H. and Ogasawara, N. Gene 93: 73-78, 1992). The organization of the 9540-bp region was compared with that of corresponding regions in other bacteria. The arrangement and directions of rnpA, rpmH, dnaA, dnaN were conserved, but no other open reading frames were found that were homologous to those that are commonly found around dnaA genes in other bacteria. The directions of movement of the replication fork around the dnaA gene were analyzed by neutral/alkaline two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The forks developed in a 1569-bp region that consisted of the dnaA structural gene and its downstream non-coding region, and then they proceeded bidirectionally.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0172-a" xlink:role="4820"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0172-b" xlink:role="4820"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4816"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4817"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4818"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4819"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4820"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4821"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4822"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4823"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
