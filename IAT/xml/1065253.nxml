We have used atomic force microscopy to examine the architecture of SeqA and the mode of binding of one molecule of SeqA to a pair of hemi-sites in aqueous solution. SeqA has a bipartite structure composed of a large and a small lobe. Upon binding of a SeqA molecule to a pair of hemi-sites, the larger lobe becomes visibly separated into two DNA binding domains, each of which binds to one hemi-site. The two DNA binding domains are held together by association between the two multimerization domains that make up the smaller lobe. The binding of each DNA binding domain to a hemi-site leads to bending of the bound DNA inwards toward the bound protein. In this way, SeqA adopts a dimeric configuration when bound to a pair of hemi-sites. Mutational analysis of the multimerization domain indicates that, in addition to multimerization of SeqA polypeptides, this domain contributes to the ability of SeqA to bind to a pair of hemi-sites and to its cooperative behavior.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA methylation plays key roles in epigenetic regulation of chromatin assembly, gene expression, development and differentiation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the adenine residues of GATC sequences on both strands are methylated at the 6-amino group by Dam methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Replication of the chromosome generates hemi-methylated GATC sequences, since the newly synthesized strand is transiently unmethylated. SeqA protein preferentially binds to hemi-sites and sequesters them from methylation by Dam, especially at the origin of chromosomal replication (<italic>oriC</italic>), so preventing over-initiation of chromosomal replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). SeqA foci appear to be formed in the hemi-methylated region behind the replication fork and track the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). SeqA function is required for nucleoid organization and proper segregation of replicated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), and these functions require the interaction of SeqA with topoisomerase IV, an enzyme that relaxes negatively and positively supercoiled DNA and decatenates replicated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Also, SeqA appears to be involved in maintaining the negative superhelicity of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>One molecule of SeqA, as a functional unit, binds to two hemi-sites that can be separated by up to 31 bp, and induces bending of the bound DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The binding affinity and extent of bending are maximal when the two hemi-sites are present on the same side (or phase) of the DNA helix. In addition, two SeqA molecules can interact cooperatively when the pairs of hemi-sites to which they are bound are separated by &#x02264;30 bp, and as a result their capacity to interact with another molecule bound at distal hemi-sites is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). This interaction between the bound proteins triggers further aggregation of free SeqA proteins onto the bound proteins, leading to the formation of large aggregates that can be visualized as foci <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p><p>Gel filtration, sedimentation and chemical cross-linking experiments have suggested that SeqA behaves as a homotetramer of 21 kDa polypeptides that aggregates reversibly in a concentration-dependent manner enhanced by the presence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Trypsin digestion of SeqA protein has revealed that the N-terminal fragment (residues 1&#x02013;50) is responsible for multimerization and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The structure of co-crystals of a C-terminal fragment (amino acid residues 51&#x02013;181) and DNA containing a hemi-site has permitted localization of the contact sites of SeqA with the hemi-site. It appears that the narrow major groove and distorted backbone structure of a hemi-site contributes to its recognition by SeqA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p><p>Although the structure of co-crystals of the C-terminal fragment and DNA containing a hemi-site has been resolved, the structure of the intact SeqA molecule remains unclear. The properties of the latter differ from those of the C-terminal fragment in the following respects: SeqA behaves as a multimer, but the fragment as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>); in the presence of a large excess of competitor DNA, SeqA forms stable complexes with hemi-methylated DNA, whereas the fragment does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>); and finally, even in the absence of competitor DNA, formation of the fragment&#x02013;DNA complex requires a much greater concentration of the participating fragment than in the case of the SeqA&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). These discrepancies led us to determine the structures of SeqA and of SeqA&#x02013;DNA complexes by atomic force microscopy (AFM) under physiologically relevant conditions. We have also shown, by mutational analysis, that the N-terminal region contributes to the binding of SeqA to a pair of hemi-sites and to its cooperative binding to multiple hemi-sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Sources were as follows: restriction enzymes and cloning enzymes, Promega; [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) and poly(dI&#x02013;dC), Amersham Biosciences; T4 polynucleotide kinase, New England Biolabs; Pyrobest DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase, Takara; QIAEX II gel extraction kit, Qiagen; site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene; and unmethylated and methylated synthetic oligonucleotides, Genotech.

We used AFM in tapping mode to examine the structure of SeqA in a buffer solution in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the tapping mode, the oscillating tip only touches the sample at the end of its downward movement, thereby reducing the contact time and the frictional forces. Compared with the contact mode of AFM, the tapping mode causes less damage to samples in liquid media. Most of the images of SeqA bound to the mica surface were uniformly of bipartite structures of similar size, with a large lobe (or domain) linked to a smaller one, and there appeared to be a groove in the large lobe (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). SeqA aggregates in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). To observe these aggregates, we increased the SeqA concentration on the mica 4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This resulted in oligomeric structures in which two or more bipartite structures were stacked repetitively in the same direction. Even at lower SeqA concentrations than that used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, no forms smaller than bipartite structures were observed. These results indicate that the bipartite structure is the functional unit of SeqA.</p><p>The AFM image of 75 bp DNA containing two hemi-sites was linear with an average contour length of 29.8 &#x000b1; 2.5 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although the limit of resolution caused by the tip radius (&#x0003c;20 nm) did not allow accurate measurements, the estimated length is in fairly good agreement with the expected value of 25.5 nm for B-DNA (0.34 nm/bp) and with previous measurements by AFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>).</p><p>In SeqA complexes with 75 bp DNA containing two hemi-sites separated by 21 bp, the large lobe appeared to be bound to the DNA, linked to the smaller lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The grooves in the complexes were wider than in free SeqA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and the unbound regions of the bound DNA looked like a pair of a &#x02018;duck's web feet&#x02019; connected to two &#x02018;legs&#x02019; separated by the groove in the large lobe. The distance between the two ends of the bound DNA was 20.4 &#x000b1; 1.9 nm, compared with 29.8 &#x000b1; 2.5 nm for the free DNA, pointing to a conformational change, a bending, of the bound DNA. The most frequent bending angle of the bound DNA was 55&#x02013;59&#x000b0; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and the DNA was bent inwards towards the bound protein. The binding of one molecule of SeqA to a pair of hemi-sites and the bending of the bound DNA agree with previous conclusions from gel-shift experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). SeqA complexes with DNA containing one hemi-site were barely detectable by AFM.</p></sec><sec><title>Dimeric configuration of SeqA protein</title><p>DNA with an 11 bp spacing between the two hemi-sites resulted in SeqA complexes that differed from the 21 bp spacing DNA&#x02013;SeqA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The location of two hemi-sites towards one end of the 75 bp DNA (nucleotide numbers of 44&#x02013;47 and 55&#x02013;58) permitted the unbound region to be distinguished from the bound region and the bound SeqA appeared to be more compact than when bound to the 21 bp spacing DNA.</p><p>When the spacing between the two hemi-sites was increased to 31 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), the large lobe of SeqA that was bound to the 31 bp spacing DNA was split into two domains that were bound to different points on the DNA. The increase in spacing resulted in a less compacted structure of the bound SeqA as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. The similar mobility of the SeqA complexes formed with DNAs with different spacing of the two hemi-sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) eliminates the possibility that two separate molecules of SeqA bind to the DNA when there is 31 bp spacing. Instead, this result shows that the large lobe of each SeqA molecule actually consists of two DNA binding domains each of which binds to a hemi-site; the small lobe was also split with a cleft between the two parts.</p><p>When two hemi-sites were separated by 16 bp they faced in opposite directions on the helix. SeqA bound to 16 bp spacing DNA had a structure different from that bound to 11 or 21 bp spacing DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>): the large lobe was lengthened and the small lobe split in two. SeqA has the highest affinity for DNA with the 21 bp spacing followed by the 11, 31 and 16 bp spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), indicating that it achieves the most favorable structure with the 21 bp spacing DNA.</p><p>Both SeqA and its N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1&#x02013;50) eluted as a tetramer in gel-filtration studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Chemical cross-linking experiments showed that pairs of monomers of SeqA are closely associated. Hence, we have proposed that the SeqA molecule is composed of two dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). A recent crystal structure revealed that the N-terminal fragment is a dimer that oligomerizes to form a filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). These observations agree with our finding that SeqA has a bipartite structure and oligomerizes on one direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Taken together these results suggest that SeqA is a dimer of two 21 kDa polypeptides, not a tetramer. The tetrameric behavior of SeqA protein observed in previous experiments may have been a consequence of the extended, non-globular structure of SeqA.</p><p>The AFM structures of the SeqA bound to DNA, especially those obtained with the 31 bp spacing DNA, thus reveal that the large lobe actually contains two DNA binding regions and the small lobe two multimerization sites. The latter become associated and serve as an anchor that supports the dimeric configuration of SeqA. Amino acids 71&#x02013;181 region of SeqA form a hemi-site binding domain and the 51&#x02013;70 region forms a flexible hinge region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The N-terminal fragment containing amino acid residues 1&#x02013;50 is responsible for multimerization. We also propose that the DNA binding and multimerization domains in the AFM structures correspond to the C-terminal region (amino acids 71&#x02013;181) and N-terminal region (amino acids 1&#x02013;50), respectively, with the two domains connected by a flexible hinge region (amino acids 51&#x02013;70).</p></sec><sec><title>Thr-18 in the multimerization domain is necessary for cooperative binding of SeqA to hemi-methylated DNA</title><p>We have identified the amino acids participating in the interaction between SeqA molecules by bacterial two-hybrid analysis with randomly mutagenized <italic>seqA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). One of the mutated proteins defective in the interaction had Thr-18 replaced by Gly (data not shown). We have analyzed the binding of SeqA(T18G) to hemi-sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Because one SeqA molecule binds to a pair of hemi-sites, both wild-type SeqA and SeqA(T18G) formed a complex with DNA containing two hemi-sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and their affinity for the DNA was similar. Binding of the wild-type and mutant proteins to DNAs harboring four hemi-sites with 16 or 19 bp spacing between the pairs of hemi-sites generated an additional slow-mobility complex formed by the binding of two SeqA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). However SeqA(T18G) formed much less of this complex and the latter migrated more slowly. We have shown that two SeqA molecules bind cooperatively to DNA with &#x02264;30 bp spacing between pairs of hemi-sites, but independently to DNA with &#x0003e;30 bp spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). It is this cooperative binding that is more efficient with wild-type SeqA than with SeqA(T18G) and that generates a faster moving slow-mobility complex. On the other hand, with the DNA with pairs of hemi-sites spaced 41 bp apart, the wild-type and mutant proteins formed similar amounts of the slow-mobility complexes and these migrated with the same speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and the absence of cooperative binding of SeqA to the 41 bp spaced DNA reduced formation of the slow-mobility complex. Evidently, SeqA requires Thr-18 in the multimerization domain for cooperative binding to hemi-methylated GATC sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Glu-5, Asp-7 and Glu-9 of the multimerization domain contribute to proper binding of SeqA to a pair of hemi-sites</title><p>The N-terminus of SeqA has abundant negatively charged amino acids: Glu-5, Asp-7, Asp-8 and Glu-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). We substituted each of these amino acids with lysine (K), and examined the binding of the resulting proteins to hemi-methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). While SeqA(E5K), (D8K) and (E9K) bound to DNA containing a pair of hemi-sites with similar affinity to wild-type protein, SeqA(D7K) and SeqA(E5, 9K) lost their binding ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). When we tested cooperative binding of the mutant proteins to DNA containing two pairs of hemi-sites with 16 bp spacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), SeqA(D7K) formed less of the complexes than the other proteins and favored the slow-mobility complex over the fast-mobility complex, and SeqA(E9K) also formed more of the slow-mobility complex than the fast-mobility complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). SeqA(E5,9K) did not form stable complexes with this DNA on its own, but was able to bind cooperatively when mixed with wild-type or other mutant SeqA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). When the spacing between the two hemi-sites was increased to 32 bp, SeqA(D7K) no longer formed a slow-mobility complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results indicate that cooperative interaction between SeqA(D7K) molecules permits SeqA(D7K) to form slow-mobility complexes with 16 bp spacing DNA.</p><p>It thus appears that SeqA(D7K) and SeqA(E5,9K) possess a defect in forming a complex with DNA containing two hemi-sites, but that cooperative interaction between the mutant proteins themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) or with other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) permits them to form a complex with the DNA containing four hemi-sites. This suggests that the mutant proteins recognize pairs of hemi-sites, but cannot form stable complexes with them. Hence, we conclude that Glu-5, Asp-7 and Glu-9 are needed for proper binding of SeqA to a pair of hemi-sites.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The binding of a SeqA molecule to a pair of hemi-sites separated by up to three helical turns (31 bp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) of the DNA suggests that the conformation of SeqA is flexible. The free SeqA proteins observed by AFM were homogeneous in appearance with a groove of constant width in the large lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). No free molecules with split DNA binding domains were observed, such as the complexes with 31 bp spacing DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These observations exclude the possibility that, prior to DNA binding, the free SeqA molecules are a mixture of conformations with the two DNA binding domains at different distances from one another and that different molecules in the population bind to differently spaced hemi-sites. Instead we suggest that, since the C-terminal domains of SeqA are able on their own to bind to a hemi-site with a low affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), the transient binding of one of the two DNA binding domains to a hemi-site causes a conformational change of the molecule that allows the other DNA binding domain to make contact with an unbound hemi-site, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>The extended conformation of SeqA bound to two hemi-sites on a linear DNA molecule is stabilized by bending the region between the two hemi-sites. Increasing the spacing between two hemi-sites to three helical turns results in greater separation of the DNA binding domains of the SeqA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Presumably, it is for this reason that SeqA has a lower affinity for 31 bp spacing DNA than for 21 bp spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) and is not able to bind to DNA with hemi-sites spacing of more than 31 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). These results suggest either that its two DNA binding domains cannot reach two hemi-sites separated by more than three helical turns, or that SeqA has limited space into which to fit the bent DNA, or both. The distortion of SeqA that accompanies its binding to hemi-sites on opposite sides of the DNA helix accounts for its preference for hemi-sites on the same side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>A SeqA molecule bound to a pair of hemi-sites can interact cooperatively with another SeqA molecule bound to an adjacent pair of hemi-sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The cooperative interaction between the bound molecules enhances their capacity for interaction and permits them to interact with another SeqA molecule bound to distal hemi-sites. This step-wise interaction is followed by aggregation of free SeqA proteins onto the bound proteins. Thus, SeqA possesses three distinct and consecutive biochemical properties: binding to a pair of hemi-sites, cooperative binding to two or more pairs of sites and aggregate formation.</p><p>We have shown that Glu-5, Asp-7 and Glu-9 are required for proper binding of SeqA to a pair of hemi-sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and that Thr-18 is necessary for cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1&#x02013;50) is responsible for aggregation of SeqA proteins onto long hemi-methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) as well as the multimerization of individual SeqA polypeptides to form a multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Thus, the multimerization domain influences many aspects of the biochemical behavior of SeqA protein: multimerization of SeqA polypeptides, proper binding of the DNA binding domain to a pair of hemi-sites, cooperative binding to multiple hemi-sites and aggregation onto hemi-methylated DNA.</p><p>The GATC sequences that become transiently hemi-methylated upon DNA replication are distributed with variable spacing between the sequences in <italic>E.coli</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The flexible dimeric configuration of SeqA and its cooperative and aggregation properties permit it to interact with the diversely spaced hemi-sites. In this way, SeqA can perform its roles in DNA replication: the regulation of chromosome initiation, formation of foci, maintenance of negative superhelicity and segregation of the replicated DNA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a grant from the 21C Frontier Microbial Genomics and Applications Center Program and from Systems Biology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Republic of Korea.
