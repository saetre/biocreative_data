On the basis of circular dichroism (CD) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we have shown that the guanine-rich (G-rich) strand of the DNA in this region can form stable intramolecular parallel G-quadruplexes under physiological conditions. A <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase stop assay has shown that the G-rich strand of the NHE can form two major G-quadruplex structures, which are in dynamic equilibrium and differentially stabilized by three G-quadruplex-interactive drugs. One major parallel G-quadruplex structure of the G-rich strand DNA of NHE was identified by CD and dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprinting. Surprisingly, CD spectroscopy shows a stable parallel G-quadruplex structure formed within the duplex DNA of the NHE at temperatures up to 100<bold>&#x000b0;</bold>C. This structure has been characterized by DMS footprinting in the double-stranded DNA of the NHE. In transfection experiments, 10 <bold>&#x003bc;</bold>M TMPyP4 reduced the activity of the basal promoter of PDGF-A <bold>&#x0223c;</bold>40%, relative to the control. On the basis of these results, we have established that ligand-mediated stabilization of G-quadruplex structures within the <italic>PDGF-A</italic> NHE can silence <italic>PDGF-A</italic> expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which was originally isolated from human platelets, is composed of four polypeptide chains designated A, B, C and D. These polypeptide chains make up five biologically active dimeric PDGF isoforms: PDGF-AA, -AB, -BB, -CC and -DD, which exert their effects through two tyrosine kinase receptors, PDGFR-&#x003b1; and PDGFR-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). PDGF-A and PDGF-B are considered to be major mitogens for a variety of mesenchymal cell types. They play critical roles in normal embryonic development, cellular differentiation and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). The overactivity of the PDGFs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases characterized by excessive cell growth, including cancer, atherosclerosis and various fibrotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Significantly augmented expression of the PDGF-A gene has been observed in a number of human tumor cell lines and tissues, particularly in gliomas, sarcomas and ostoastrocytomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10">6&#x02013;10</xref>). Abnormal PDGF-A expression is linked to accelerated malignant cell growth through autocrine and paracrine pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). For these reasons, PDGF signaling pathways are important targets for anticancer therapeutics; specifically, inhibitors of <italic>PDGF-A</italic> gene expression could be valuable in the treatment of some cancers.</p><p>Transcription of the PDGF-A gene is controlled by several positive and negative regulatory elements located in the promoter region and the 5&#x02032;-distal upstream region of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). An important, highly guanine- and cytosine-rich region located at nucleotides &#x02013;120 to &#x02013;33 within the <italic>PDGF-A</italic> promoter accounts for 80% of basal promoter activity. This GC-rich region was originally identified by its sensitivity to the single-strand-specific endonuclease S1 nuclease and has been termed the nuclease hypersensitive element (NHE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). <italic>PDGF-A</italic> is also subject to transcriptional repression by two discrete S1 nuclease hypersensitive (SHS) elements. One is located within the 5&#x02032;-distal region (&#x02013;1418 to &#x02013;1338) of the promoter (5&#x02032;SHS), while the other is located within the first intron (+1605 to +1630, intron SHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>). Multiple transcription factors bind to and regulate <italic>PDGF-A</italic> genes through the NHE region, such as Sp1, Egr-1, Wilms&#x02019; tumor protein (WT1), GC factor 2 (GCF2), nuclear factor 1-X (NF1-X) and the metastasis suppressor protein NM23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23">17&#x02013;23</xref>). This region is structurally dynamic and capable of adopting non-B-DNA conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The importance of the unwound paranemic structure of NHE in <italic>PDGF-A</italic> promoter activity was confirmed by demonstrating that a single-stranded DNA oligomer, derived from the guanine-rich strand (&#x02013;74 to &#x02013;51), inhibits the promoter activity of <italic>PDGF-A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). It is believed that the equilibrium between the B-form DNA, the single-stranded DNA, and intramolecular secondary DNA structures is instrumental in the determination of the binding of transcription factors to the NHE region of PDGF-A (NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>). However, the molecular details of the unwinding of secondary structures in the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> are poorly understood. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Promoter structure of <italic>PDGF-A</italic> and locations of the important NHEs.

The basic building block, the G-tetrad, and examples of folding patterns are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B. The involvement of G-quadruplex structures in cellular processes, such as transcriptional control of <italic>c-MYC</italic> expression, has stimulated the development of anticancer drugs that are selective for G-quadruplexes. The G-rich strand of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> contains five contiguous guanine runs, each separated by one base. The G-tract motif in NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> has some similarity to the G-tract motif in the NHE region of <italic>c-MYC</italic> (NHE<sub>c-MYC</sub>). However, in NHE<sub>c-MYC</sub> the minimum number of guanines in any run is three rather than four, and NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> contains a very long run of 13 contiguous guanines at the 5&#x02032;-end (see sequences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Since the G-rich strand of NHE<sub>c-MYC</sub> is known to form G-quadruplex structures, by analogy the G-rich strand of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> has the potential to form G-quadruplex structures under physiological conditions. Consequently, these G-quadruplex structures may play an important role in modulating the expression of <italic>PDGF-A</italic>. For these reasons, this work examines the <italic>in vitro</italic> formation and properties of G-quadruplex structures within the G-rich strand of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>, including its transcriptional modulation by TMPyP4. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparative CD spectra of three known G-quadruplex-forming sequences with the PDGF-A Pu48-mer.

All DNA oligomers were PAGE-purified and dissolved in double-distilled water before use. The extinction coefficients that the manufacturers provided for a given DNA sequence were calculated using the nearest-neighbor method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). When the DNA oligomers fold into a G-quadruplex, the base stacking results in hyperchromicity. Thus, the extinction coefficients of DNA oligomers that can form DNA secondary structures need to be corrected for the hyperchromicity. To address this issue, we used UV/vis thermal denaturation techniques to determine the high-order structural hyperchromicity of the G-quadruplex-forming DNA oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The UV experiments were carried out on a Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. Cells with optical path lengths of 10 mm were used, and the temperature of the cell holder was controlled by an external circulating water bath (Varian). The UV melting experiments were done by collecting spectra every five degrees as the sample heated up from 20 to 100&#x000b0;C, and monitoring the absorption change at &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub>. The plateau at the top of the melting curve (usually 20&#x000b0;C above the respective <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) was extrapolated back to 20&#x000b0;C to obtain the hyperchromicity.

This spectrum is similar to that of the guanine-rich DNA oligomer Pu27-mer of NHE<sub>c-MYC</sub> (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), which forms intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures that have been well characterized by NMR, CD and DMS footprinting studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). To further identify the topology of the G-quadruplex structures formed in Pu48-mer, we compared the CD spectrum of Pu48-mer to two other DNA sequences, the thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) and the <italic>Bcl-2</italic> Pu39WT (green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The chair-type antiparallel G-quadruplex structure of TBA has been proposed on the basis of NMR and X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), and it has a signature CD spectrum characterized by a positive maximum band around 290 nm, a negative band at 265 nm and a smaller positive band at 246 nm.

The CD spectrum of this hybrid G-quadruplex structure shows a major positive band at &#x0223c; 265 nm with a negative band at 240 nm, which is similar to the parallel G-quadruplex. However, it has a unique pronounced shoulder absorption between 280 and 300 nm, which is not observed in the CD spectrum of the parallel G-quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The CD spectrum of the Pu48-mer is quite different from those of <italic>Bcl-2</italic> Pu39WT and TBA, and it resembles most closely that of the c-MYC Pu27-mer. Collectively, these data suggest that the major G-quadruplex structure in the Pu48-mer is a parallel structure.</p><p>DNA oligomers folding into intramolecular G-quadruplex structures migrate faster than non-structured single-stranded DNA and the corresponding intermolecular dimers in a native gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Thus, it is possible to isolate the intramolecular G-quadruplex structure from the other DNA structures by native gel electrophoresis. To determine whether the G-quadruplexes formed by Pu48-mer in our CD studies are intra- or intermolecular, we analyzed the electrophoretic mobilities of different concentrations of Pu48-mer in the presence of 50 mM KCl. When the DNA concentration was 15 &#x003bc;M or lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 2&#x02013;4), the major DNA species of Pu48-mer migrated in an 8% native polyacrylamide gel much faster than the corresponding denatured Pu48-mer that represents the random linear DNA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 1 as control). These results suggest that the Pu48-mer folds into a compact intramolecular G-quadruplex at low DNA concentrations. However, when the DNA concentration was 20 &#x003bc;M, more than 40% of the Pu48-mer was found as a slowly migrating species, which is presumed to represent higher-order intermolecular DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 5).

These CD spectra showed similar parallel G-quadruplex characteristics. However, a dramatic increase in the elliptic intensity was observed with the sample that was pre-incubated with 100 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, red line), while 100 mM NaCl only slightly increased the magnitude of the CD signal around 280&#x02013;300 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, blue line) as compared to the spectrum of DNA in the Tris&#x02013;HCl buffer alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, black line). This indicates that K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> can increase the formation of the <italic>PDGF-A</italic> Pu48-mer G-quadruplex, but a more significant effect occurs with K<sup>+</sup>. K<sup>+</sup> strongly increases the formation of the parallel Pu48-mer G-quadruplex structure, while Na<sup>+</sup> appears to induce the formation of a hybrid parallel/antiparallel Pu48-mer G-quadruplex structure. Further evidence that K<sup>+</sup> stabilizes the Pu48-mer G-quadruplex structure was obtained by comparing the melting curve of Pu48-mer in the absence or presence of KCl. We monitored the CD spectra of Pu48-mer as a function of temperature and then plotted the ellipticity at 266 nm versus temperature to generate a melting curve. The full melting curve of Pu48-mer in Tris&#x02013;HCl (50 mM, pH 7.2) showed a <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 75&#x000b0;C (data not shown). This high <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> suggests that intramolecular Pu48-mer G-quadruplex structures are very stable. Surprisingly, in the presence of 25 mM KCl, the Pu48-mer still showed a detectable parallel G-quadruplex CD signal at 110&#x000b0;C. Because of the high-temperature limit of our CD instrument, we could not obtain a full melting curve for the Pu48-mer in 25 mM KCl.

The <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase arrest sites for these two major stop products were determined by sequencing the template DNA.

Since N7 of guanine in a G-tetrad is involved in Hoogsteen bonding and is inaccessible to alkylation by DMS, we can identify those guanine bases engaged in the formation of a G-quadruplex structure. The DMS methylation pattern produced by band 3 was consistent with a linear single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 3). For bands 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4), the DMS protection patterns suggested the formation of intramolecular G-quadruplexes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B (lanes 1 and 2), full DMS protection occurred within the four runs of guanines (G3&#x02013;G4, G8&#x02013;G10, G16&#x02013;G19 and G22&#x02013;G25) of band 1.

Within the long run of 13 guanines there are two runs of guanines that are clearly protected: a run of two guanines (G3&#x02013;G4) and three guanines (G8&#x02013;G10). Partial protection of the intervening run of guanines (G5 and G7) occurs between these two fully protected regions, and likewise G11 is partially protected. The first guanine involved in the formation of the G-tetrad at the 3&#x02032;-end of band 1 is G25. This corresponds to the arrest site for the 5&#x02032;-end stop product in the <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase stop assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

These somewhat ill-defined N7 methylation protection patterns do not provide straightforward insight into the specific G-quadruplex structures for the DNA species in bands 1 and 2. Most probably these ill-defined bands result from mixtures of multiple intramolecular G-quadruplexes existing in dynamic equilibrium (see Discussion Section).</p><sec><title>Formation of a G-quadruplex within the double-stranded DNA of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub></title><p>To date, all well-characterized G-quadruplex structures have been determined by studying single-stranded DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28 B29 B30">25&#x02013;30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).

Significantly, the CD spectrum of the NHE 90 bp double-stranded DNA exhibited an almost identical CD spectrum to the parallel G-quadruplex formed in the single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, blue line), which is characterized by a positive ellipticity maximum at 266 nm and a negative minimum at 240 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). This CD spectrum is substantially different from the CD signal of B-form duplex DNA, which typically has an ellipticity maximum absorption around 275&#x02013;280 nm and zero ellipticity at 258 nm.

This CD profile of the NHE 90 bp double-stranded DNA indicates that a dominant intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex is formed within the duplex DNA of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>. To determine the stability of this G-quadruplex structure, we monitored the CD spectra of the NHE 90 bp double-stranded DNA over a 25&#x02013;100&#x000b0;C temperature range.

The CD spectrum of purified NHE 60-mer double-stranded DNA was consistent with that of the NHE 90 bp double-stranded DNA (data not shown). EMSA was performed to isolate the duplex DNA species containing the G-quadruplex structure, which was 5&#x02032;-end <sup>32</sup>P-labeled in the G-rich and C-rich strands. Two bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, bands 1 and 2) were observed in both duplex DNA samples (lanes 2 and 3) pre-incubated with 100 mM KCl. These bands were duplex DNA species, since they both migrated differently to the single-stranded intramolecular G-quadruplex species. The duplex DNA species containing the partially unwound region was less compact than the linear duplex DNA and as expected showed slower migration in EMSA. Thus band 1 corresponds to the duplex DNA species containing the G-quadruplex structure, while band 2 corresponds to the fully linear duplex DNA. By coincidence, this band migrates at the same point as the presumed dimer intermolecular species from the Pu60-mer. However, it cannot correspond to this species since the NHE 60 bp duplex DNA labeled on the C-rich strand also gives this species. Bands 1 and 2 were both extracted and subjected to DMS footprinting.

In all cases, the mutant sequences that were predicted to form defined loop isomers showed lower stability. Surprisingly, all these guanine mutant isomers showed a significant decrease in parallel G-quadruplex signals and an increase in antiparallel signals. This shows that these mutants predominantly form antiparallel or hybrid parallel/antiparallel G-quadruplex structures, which is different from the biologically relevant NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> G-quadruplex. Among these guanine mutant isomers, the most surprising results originated from two dual mutants, PA-Mut1 and PA-Mut2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). These two mutant oligomers were designed to provide dual G-to-T or G-to-A base mutations at G15 and G21 in the core sequence of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>.

To gain further insight into the selective action of G-quadruplex-interactive agents with the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> sequence, three well-established G-quadruplex-interactive agents, TMPyP4, telomestatin and Se2SAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), were evaluated by a <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase stop assay with a DNA template containing the whole core sequence of the G-rich strand of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>. TMPyP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), a positional isomer of TMPyP4 that lacks the ability to insert or stack into the G-tetrad structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), served as the negative control compound in our studies. Since there was a considerable amount of 5&#x02032;-end stop products formed in the absence of drugs and KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 2), we used an elevated primer extension temperature (60&#x000b0;C) to partially destabilize the arresting G-quadruplex structure and thereby permit a larger window for drug stabilization of the G-quadruplex structures. The pausing at the 5&#x02032;-end stop product in the absence of G-quadruplex-interactive ligands and KCl at a high temperature of 60&#x000b0;C is another indication that the G-quadruplex structure in the 5&#x02032;-end product is more stable than other possible G-quadruplex structures formed by the G-rich strand of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 2). This suggests that the 5&#x02032;-end G-quadruplex is the primary G-quadruplex structure formed in NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>, corresponding to the one formed in the NHE duplex DNA. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structures of the G-quadruplex-interactive compounds TMPyP4, telomestatin and Se2SAP, and the control compound TMPyP2.

When the concentration of drugs was 0.05 &#x003bc;M and lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lanes 8 and 9), TMPyP4 significantly increased stabilization of the 5&#x02032;-end stop products in a concentration-dependent manner, but telomestatin and Se2SAP only marginally increased the formation of 5&#x02032;-end stop products (lanes 13, 14, 19 and 20 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). In contrast, when the concentration of all three drugs was 0.5 &#x003bc;M and higher, decreased formation of the 5&#x02032;-end stop products was observed for all three G-quadruplex-interactive drugs, because of the accumulation of the 3&#x02032;-end stop product. TMPyP4 achieved the maximum stabilizing effect on the 5&#x02032;-end stop products at a concentration of 0.05 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 9, and C (b)]. The <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase stop assay also showed that these three G-quadruplex-interactive drugs induced formation of the 3&#x02032;-end stop products at high drug concentrations (&#x02265;0.5 &#x003bc;M). A concentration-dependent increase in stabilization of the 3&#x02032;-end stop products was also observed for all three drugs. However, telomestatin and Se2SAP were more selective at stabilizing the 3&#x02032;-end stop product; both achieved the best stabilizing effect on the 3&#x02032;-end G-quadruplex at a concentration of 1 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 21, and C (c and d)]. In addition, at drug concentrations of 1 and 2.5 &#x003bc;M, TMPyP4 exhibited preferential binding for duplex DNA over the G-quadruplex structures (lanes 11 and 12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>TMPyP4 selectively inhibits the promoter activity of the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub></title><p>In light of our results demonstrating that the duplex DNA of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> can form a G-quadruplex structure, we sought to determine if stabilization of this G-quadruplex structure affects <italic>PDGF-A</italic> transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, we constructed pGL3-Basic derivative (pA361) in which the human genomic DNA fragment containing the proximal promoter region of <italic>PDGF-A</italic> (&#x02013;218 to +142, relative to the transcriptional start site) was inserted upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. When transfected into MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells, pA361 drove luciferase expression into these cells. Thus, the <italic>PDGF-A</italic> proximal promoter, which contains the complete NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> core sequence, can drive transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, RT-PCR studies demonstrated significantly higher PDGF-A expression in MIA PaCa-2 cells than in the normal pancreatic cell line HPDE-6 (data not shown).</p><p>Since TMPyP4 at low concentrations selectively stabilized the biologically relevant G-quadruplex structure (the 5&#x02032;-end stop product) formed by duplex NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, we directly assessed its specific biological effects on <italic>PDGF-A</italic> transcription. MIA PaCa-2 cells were co-transfected with plasmids pA361 and pRL-TK as an internal control and treated with varying concentrations of TMPyP4 or TMPyP2. We measured the expression of firefly luciferase relative to the renilla luciferase of pRL-TK by dual luciferase assay, 24 h after transfection. At all concentrations used, TMPyP4 reduced the expression of firefly luciferase activity by inhibiting the promoter activity of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>, whereas TMPyP2 had no significant effect on the firefly luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). We found that 10 &#x003bc;M TMPyP4 could reduce the expression of firefly luciferase to &#x0223c;50% of the control, indicating that the stabilization of the G-quadruplex has a strong repression effect on promoter activity of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>.

One strategy to block PDGF signaling pathways is to target the PDGF receptors. Employment of this strategy led to the discovery of selective PDGF antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). For example, the PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor STI-571 (Gleevec) has been approved for clinical use for the treatment of certain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54 B55 B56">54&#x02013;56</xref>). Because the PDGF-A polypeptide is short in length, it has not been thought of as a druggable anticancer target. However, another viable strategy for targeting PDGF signaling pathways in tumors is to decrease <italic>PDGF-A</italic> expression by inhibiting its promoter activity. Transcription of <italic>PDGF-A</italic> is under the strict control of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> in the promoter. The unwound paranemic NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> structure plays an important role in regulating transcription factors that bind to the <italic>PDGF-A</italic> promoter. The G-rich strand of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>, which contains five G-tracts with each G-tract separated from the neighboring G-tract by a single intervening base, is anticipated to form G-quadruplex structures under physiological conditions. Therefore, the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> G-quadruplex structure is potentially involved in transcriptional control of PDGF-A expression, perhaps as the silencer element. Consequently, the search for compounds that have selectivity for binding to the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> G-quadruplex and that inhibit <italic>PDGF-A</italic> gene expression might well be valuable in the treatment of some cancers and other disorders, as described earlier.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrate that the G-rich strand of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>, located within the proximal promoter region of <italic>PDGF-A</italic>, is able to form two stable intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures (3&#x02032;-end and 5&#x02032;-end G-quadruplexes) that are potentially involved in transcriptional regulation. The formation of these G-quadruplex structures is K<sup>+</sup>-dependent. The DMS footprinting patterns of the G-quadruplexes formed by PDGF-A Pu48 and Pu60 imply that these structures must contain at least four G-tetrads, and this is supported by the CD data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, in which the molar ellipticity is greater for the PDGF-A G-quadruplex than for the c-Myc G-quadruplex. Significantly, an intramolecular G-quadruplex that has a similar folding pattern to the 5&#x02032;-end G-quadruplex found in single-stranded DNA of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> can be formed within the duplex DNA of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>. In light of the protocol for formation of the duplex containing the G-quadruplex, the G-quadruplex obtained within the duplex DNA of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> probably forms prior to the formation of the duplex species. Thus, the species formed during the annealing is a result of hybridization of the single-stranded G-rich strand already containing the G-quadruplex with the single-stranded C-rich strand. This is unlikely to be the same mechanism for the formation of the G-quadruplex structure within the duplex DNA in <italic>in vivo</italic> situations where superhelicity is involved (see subsequently). Nevertheless, this is the first time that we have been able to isolate the duplex DNA containing a G-quadruplex structure <italic>in vitro</italic>. This unique structure is likely to represent the dominant biologically relevant G-quadruplex structure formed in the PDGF-A promoter. It has been proposed that superhelicity of genomic DNA may play an important role in determining the presence of such an interconversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). The functional analysis of the <italic>PDGF-A</italic> promoter revealed that the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> adopted a non-B-DNA conformation and was hypersensitive to the S1 nuclease in the supercoiled plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16">13&#x02013;16</xref>). This provides further evidence that the formation of a G-quadruplex in the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> can compete with the superhelical duplex conformation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The implication of the formation of a stable G-quadruplex in duplex DNA is that the C-rich strand forms a single-stranded DNA loop, which may be in equilibrium with an i-motif structure.</p><p>The folding pattern of the biologically relevant G-quadruplex structure formed by the three consecutive G-tracts (G1&#x02013;G25) at the 5&#x02032;-end of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> duplex DNA most likely represents a mixture of different loop isomers. Of particular interest, the 13-mer G-tract (G1&#x02013;G13) must provide the two runs of guanines at the 5&#x02032;-end. The flanking regions of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> are also made up of polypurine and polypyrimidine elements, which may have a significant impact on the propensity to form the G-quadruplex in the G-rich strand of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> double-stranded DNA. The overall folding patterns of the parallel G-quadruplex structure in NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> duplex DNA has been defined by its characteristic CD spectra, which demonstrates that it has a unique double-chain reversal structure. Previously, examples of G-quadruplexes consisting of double-chain reversals in promoter regions have been confined to three tetrads with a single base in the internal loop. This is the first example of a G-quadruplex with four tetrads and a two-base internal loop. The DMS footprinting pattern of the G-quadruplex in NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> duplex DNA reveals that the 3&#x02032;-face of this G-quadruplex structure has two runs of four guanines, which are separated by a two-base (CG) internal loop. A molecular model of the four G-tetrads in the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> G-quadruplex structure shows that a two-base internal loop is the minimum required to bridge two runs of four guanines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A). The opposite 5&#x02032;-face of this G-quadruplex structure is constructed from the run of 13 contiguous guanines, in which the DMS footprinting pattern predicts a mixture of at least four double-chain reversal loop isomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). Loop isomers &#x02018;a&#x02019;, &#x02018;b&#x02019;, and &#x02018;c&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B have a two-base internal loop on the 5&#x02032;-face dictated by the demonstrated DMS cleavages of G11, G12 and G13 (&#x02018;a&#x02019; isomer), G12 and G13 (&#x02018;b&#x02019; isomer) and G1 and G2 (&#x02018;c&#x02019; isomer) in the core sequence of NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Finally, the cleavage of G5, G6 and G7 predicts loop isomer &#x02018;d&#x02019;. By analogy with the c-Myc parallel G-quadruplex structure, in which the double-chain reversal loops on the opposite face are sufficient to stabilize a third intervening loop size of six bases, the double-chain reversals in the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> G-quadruplex can stabilize a third internal loop of up to five bases (as predicted in loop isomer &#x02018;a&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Two views of a molecular model of loop isomer &#x02018;a&#x02019; having the predicted folding pattern are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A. <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of the biologically relevant NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> G-quadruplex [loop isomer 5&#x02032;-(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>)-3&#x02032;], which contains two 2-base double-chain reversal loops and one 5-base intervening loop (guanines = red, cytosines = yellow and K<sup>+</sup> ions = white). For clarity, hydrogen atoms have been removed.

Guanines = red, cytosines = yellow.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm538f9"/></fig></p><p>A surprising finding illustrated by the CD results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B for two dual mutant oligomers is that base changes, even in potential loop positions, result in destabilization and apparent dramatic changes in the folding patterns. This is in contrast to the c-Myc G-quadruplex, where elimination of the redundancy in loop isomers by judicial G-to-T mutations does not dramatically change the stability or folding patterns of the parallel-stranded G-quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The effects of G-to-N mutations in the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> G-quadruplexes are not limited to the run of 13 contiguous guanines, but also occur when the 3&#x02032; terminal guanines in the two runs of 5 guanines (G15 and G21) are mutated to thymines or adenines. On the basis of DMS cleavage results, these guanines are predicted to be predominantly in the loops, implying that the dynamic equilibrium between different loop isomers is an important feature of both stability and formation of the parallel-stranded species. This phenomenon may be uniquely linked to the 13 contiguous guanines in this promoter sequence.</p><p>An important aim of our research program is to identify small molecules that can selectively modulate <italic>PDGF-A</italic> transcription by stabilizing or modifying the unique G-quadruplex structures formed by NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub>. Therefore, we examined the affinities of three well-known G-quadruplex-interactive drugs (TMPyP4, Se2SAP and telomestatin) for the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> G-quadruplex. The results of our <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase stop assays revealed that these three drugs preferentially interact with and stabilize the 5&#x02032;-end NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> G-quadruplex, which has a similar folding pattern to the biological G-quadruplexes formed in the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> duplex DNA at low concentrations. TMPyP4 exhibited stronger selectivity than either Se2SAP or telomestatin for stabilization of the 5&#x02032;-end stop product. Thus, TMPyP4 appeared to be an ideal candidate for modulating <italic>PDGF-A</italic> transcription. Our data confirms that, in cells, TMPyP4 can specifically downregulate <italic>PDGF-A</italic> promoter activity by interacting with the NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> G-quadruplex. Because TMPyP4, and not TMPyP2, inhibits <italic>PDGF-A</italic> proximal promoter activity, this is strong evidence that G-quadruplexes exist <italic>in vivo</italic> and that NHE<sub>PDGF-A</sub> G-quadruplex structures act as transcriptional silencers for <italic>PDGF-A</italic>.</p><p>Finally, the relationship of the 5&#x02032;SHS and intron SHS elements to the dynamic equilibrium of the G-quadruplex and associated C-strand structures remains to be determined. The complementarity of the 5&#x02032;SHS and the 5&#x02032;-end of the intron SHS is suggestive of the interaction of these elements. Experiments addressing this question are in progress.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This research has been supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (CA94166) and the Arizona Biomedical Research Commission (9006).
