First, the median amplitude of the first derivative of the EJP was larger when there was a coincident NCT in the impaled cell, compared with instances when no coincident NCT occurred. Second, the time-to-peak amplitude of the first derivative was shorter if there was a coincident NCT in the impaled cell, compared with when no coincident NCT was observed within the field.</p><p>Surprisingly, first derivative amplitude increased with the distance (of the corresponding NCT) from the microelectrode. The microelectrode did not locally inhibit the functional quantal size as there was no effect of distance on the normalized NCT amplitude. When the significant effect of distance (between the microelectrode and NCTs) on the first derivative amplitude was removed, there was no correlation between the unstandardized residual (of distance vs. first derivative amplitude) and NCT amplitude.</p><p>The absence of a correlation between DE and NCT amplitudes suggests that the NCT amplitude is a poor measure of quantal size. The usefulness of NCTs hence lies primarily in locating neurotransmitter release and measuring changes in local release probability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>confocal microscopy</kwd><kwd>discrete event</kwd><kwd>EJP</kwd><kwd>NCT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>BAPTA, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N&#x02032;,N&#x02032;-tetraacetic acid</kwd><kwd>DE, discrete event</kwd><kwd>EJP, excitatory junction potential</kwd><kwd>GPVD, guinea-pig vas deferens</kwd><kwd>MVD, mouse vas deferens</kwd><kwd>NCT, neuroeffector calcium transient</kwd><kwd><italic>n</italic><sub>NCT</sub>, number of neuroeffector calcium transients per stimulus per cell</kwd><kwd>PSS, physiological salt solution</kwd><kwd>sEJP, spontaneous excitatory junction potential</kwd><kwd>SMC, smooth muscle cell</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Packets of ATP, released from sympathetic nerves onto smooth muscle cells (SMCs), cause a local depolarization; the coordination of contraction is widely assumed to arise because the SMCs are electrically coupled (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Brading, 1999</xref>). This may not apply to SMCs in the mouse vas deferens (MVD), however. There are several studies that suggest that these SMCs are only weakly electrically-coupled (<xref rid="bib19 bib8 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Holman et al., 1977; Blakeley et al., 1989; Young et al., 2007</xref>); for example, the mean input resistance of surface SMCs (176&#x000b1;18 M&#x003a9;; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2007</xref>) is comparable to that of dispersed cells (331&#x000b1;43 M&#x003a9;; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Blakeley et al., 1989</xref>) and significantly greater than that recorded from syncytial smooth muscle (5&#x02013;30 M&#x003a9;; <xref rid="bib2 bib19 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Bennett, 1967; Holman et al., 1977; Manchanda and Venkateswarlu, 1999</xref>). The capacitance is also inconsistent with syncytial coupling. Surface cells of the MVD, with a membrane time constant of 8.6 ms (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Blakeley et al., 1989</xref>; equal to RC), have a capacitance of 48 pF; a coupled network of about 100 arteriole SMCs (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hirst and Neild, 1980</xref>) has a capacitance of 5.9 nF [calculated from the initial <italic>dV</italic>/<italic>dt</italic> we measure as 42 mV/s during a 0.25 nA current injection in their <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and noting that <italic>C</italic>=<italic>I</italic>/(<italic>dV</italic>/<italic>dt</italic>)]. The ratio of capacitances between these systems (1:100) suggests that the ratio of coupled cells is also 1:100, and hence that the surface cells in the vas deferens are electrically isolated.</p><p>This conclusion is supported by a recent comparison of &#x003b1;-latrotoxin (25 pM)-stimulated spontaneous excitatory junction potentials (sEJPs) and simultaneously recorded neuroeffector Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (NCTs, <xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2002, 2003</xref>) in the same SMCs in the MVD (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2007</xref>). Coincident sEJPs and NCTs were variable, but positively correlated in amplitude. Such a correlation suggests that the left-skewed amplitude distribution of sEJPs is not due to electrotonic attenuation of effects of ATP packets released onto neighboring SMCs within the syncytium, as earlier assumed (<xref rid="bib22 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Purves, 1976; Tomita, 1970</xref>). More likely is that every sEJP was triggered by release of a single packet of ATP directly onto the impaled SMC and that the amplitude variation was due either to variability in the size of the released ATP packets, or in the responses of P2X-receptors on the SMC surface (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The question asked in the present study is if nerve impulse-evoked EJPs in MVD are also caused exclusively by direct impact of released ATP packets onto P2X-receptors of the impaled SMC, or are in part due to spread of the effects of ATP packets released onto nearby SMCs. Based on studies in guinea-pig vas deferens (GPVD) or MVD of both EJPs and their first time derivative, the &#x02018;discrete events&#x02019; (DEs; <xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blakeley and Cunnane, 1978, 1979</xref>), the conclusion was drawn that the nerve impulse&#x02013;evoked EJP in single SMCs has two components: (i) a non-intermittent, non-fluctuating &#x02018;slow&#x02019; component, and occasionally, superimposed on that, (ii) a &#x02018;fast&#x02019; component, fluctuating in amplitude. The slow component was thought to be a population response to asynchronous release of single &#x02018;packets&#x02019; of ATP from 1% to 3% of the many varicosities innervating the SMC bundle, spreading to the impaled SMC, and the fast component the response to single packets of ATP released from one to three of the much fewer varicosities directly innervating the impaled SMC. Each nerve impulse evoked an EJP but often, especially in GPVD, failed to trigger a DE (<xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Blakeley and Cunnane, 1978, 1979; Cunnane and Stj&#x000e4;rne 1982, 1984</xref>), indicating that local action potential&#x02013;evoked release of transmitter from individual sites was often highly &#x02018;intermittent&#x02019; (<italic>P</italic> that a stimulus would give rise to a DE ranged from 0.02&#x02013;0.5). In the MVD stimulus-locked DEs occurred in two separate latency bands, within each of which DEs were much less intermittent, <italic>P</italic> was relatively high and could approach unity (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blakeley and Cunnane, 1979</xref>). In both species, DEs within single latency bands were initially thought to represent release of 1 to 10 transmitter quanta per pulse from one or a few varicosities closely innervating the impaled SMC (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blakeley and Cunnane, 1979</xref>).</p><p>The validity of this view has later been questioned, as more rigorous criteria were set up to identify a DE as the image of the effect of release of transmitter from a single release site (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cunnane and Stj&#x000e4;rne, 1984</xref>). Based on the occurrence of spontaneous and evoked DEs with closely similar amplitude and time-course (&#x02018;identical fingerprints&#x02019;), the conclusion was drawn that per pulse transmitter release from the average individual varicosity (in both MVD and GPVD) is monoquantal and highly intermittent (<italic>P</italic><sub>DE</sub> 0.02&#x02013;0.03 at 1 Hz stimulation; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cunnane and Stj&#x000e4;rne, 1984</xref>). This high degree of intermittency of per pulse neurotransmitter release from single varicosities in MVD has recently been directly supported by study of NCTs in MVD (mean <italic>P</italic><sub>NCT</sub> 0.019 at 1 Hz stimulation, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In MVD the vast majority of axons are in close apposition (&#x0003c;50 nm separation) with adjacent SMCs in this tissue (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lane and Rhodin, 1964</xref>), which contrasts with the GPVD, in which the majority (80%) are not in close apposition with the SMC (<xref rid="bib21a" ref-type="bibr">Merrillees, 1968</xref>). The reason why the probability that nerve impulse&#x02013;released ATP will encounter the impaled SMC is so much higher in MVD than in GPVD is probably that the MVD has a higher density of close contact junctions.</p><p>The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between the NCT and DE, and to establish whether the DE is indeed a measure of local neurotransmitter release. It should be noted that the amplitude of the first derivative of the voltage (<italic>V</italic>) with respect to time (<italic>t</italic>) is proportional to the maximum net current (<italic>I</italic>), as long as the capacitance (<italic>C</italic>) does not change [as <italic>V</italic>=<italic>Q</italic>/<italic>C</italic>, <italic>dV</italic>/<italic>dt</italic>=(1/<italic>C</italic>)&#x000a0;&#x000b7;&#x000a0;(<italic>dq</italic>/<italic>dt</italic>)=(1/<italic>C</italic>)&#x000a0;&#x000b7;&#x000a0;<italic>I</italic>]. The advantage of comparing DEs and NCTs is that both, ideally, reflect effects of opening the same P2X-receptors on the same SMC by the same released ATP packet. The difference is that DEs reflect the net flux of ions (including its small Ca<sup>2+</sup> component) and NCTs the transient local increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the SMC resulting both from Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and its downstream effect: Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from stores within the SMC (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2003</xref>). By combining confocal imaging with simultaneous intracellular electrophysiological recording in the mouse isolated vas deferens, it is possible to utilize the spatial information of NCTs coincident with EJPs to determine whether DEs are indeed indicative of local neurotransmitter release.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator loading</title><p>Eight- to 12-week-old Balb/c mice (Harlan, Bicester, Oxfordshire, UK) were killed by cervical fracture and both vasa deferentia removed.

In one preparation (of six), however, there was a weak negative correlation between distance and latency; this is likely to have occurred by chance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary aim of this study was to address the relationship between nerve impulse-evoked EJPs and peaks in their first time derivatives, DEs, and NCTs using a recently established simultaneous laser-scanning confocal microscopy and electrophysiological recording technique (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2007</xref>). A second aim was to use the spatial information of NCTs coincident with DEs, to explore whether DEs represent the local release of ATP as a sympathetic neurotransmitter.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Intermittent neurotransmitter release</title><p>That the electrically-evoked release of sympathetic neurotransmitter from individual varicosities may be highly intermittent was first suggested based on studies of the overflow of noradrenaline (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Folkow et al., 1967</xref>). It has been more directly demonstrated by electrophysiological and optical analysis of the release of packets of ATP which trigger DEs (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Blakeley and Cunnane, 1978</xref>), excitatory junction currents (<xref rid="bib12 bib1" ref-type="bibr">Brock and Cunnane, 1987; &#x000c5;strand et al., 1988</xref>) and NCTs (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The large variation in the probability of neurotransmitter release, quantified as <italic>P</italic><sub>DE</sub>, shown in the present study (<italic>P</italic><sub>DE</sub> ranged from 0&#x02013;0.99) is consistent with the findings of previous studies reporting local intermittence measuring excitatory junctional currents (0.002&#x02013;0.03, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cunnane and Stj&#x000e4;rne, 1984</xref>) and a variable number of functional release sites on each SMCs. The cause of the variation at the level of the single release site is not presently known. First, the exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration strongly influences <italic>P</italic><sub>DE</sub>, which increased from 0.34&#x000b1;0.04 at 1.1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to 0.53&#x000b1;0.03 at 2.1 mM (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Blakeley et al., 1986</xref>). Second, the stimulus frequency is positively correlated with <italic>P</italic><sub>DE</sub>. Stimulation at 0.5 Hz evoked 20 DEs per 500 stimuli, which increased to 60 per 500 at 1 Hz, and 150 per 500 at 2 Hz (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cunnane and Stj&#x000e4;rne, 1984</xref>). Third, it is unclear how previous studies have distinguished a DE from more slow-rising changes in the first derivative. It may be more reasonable to classify events by eye based on their shape, rather than trying to determine a threshold of first derivative amplitude (e.g. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cunnane and Stj&#x000e4;rne (1984)</xref> were able to find an SMC in which <italic>P</italic><sub>DE</sub> was unusually low (0.002), although the density of such low probability recording sites remains to be established. It should be noted that a large variation in <italic>P</italic><sub>DE</sub> has been observed between MVD and GPVD. This difference may be attributed to differences in the density of close contact junctions between the two species (<xref rid="bib20 bib21a" ref-type="bibr">Lane and Rhodin, 1964; Merrillees, 1968</xref>).</p><p>The two methods of monitoring the postjunctional effects of ATP binding to P2X-receptors, DEs and NCTs, yield similar estimates of the probability of per pulse release from individual varicosities in the MVD. Study of the occurrence of spontaneous and evoked DEs with identical fingerprints gives a <italic>P</italic><sub>DE</sub> per single release site (i.e. varicosity) of 0.01&#x02013;0.03 (<xref rid="bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cunnane and Stj&#x000e4;rne 1982, 1984</xref>) in the GPVD; study of the occurrence of NCTs triggered from single visualized varicosities at single junctions gives a <italic>P</italic><sub>NCT</sub> per varicosity of 0.019, range 0.001&#x02013;0.1 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, the optical method has the advantage over DEs that NCTs reveal activity in visually identified varicosities, whereas estimates based on DEs reflect, at best, activity in single release sites, assumed to be a single varicosity. But DEs do have one advantage over NCTs: reproducibility of the response to a released ATP packet. The close similarity in amplitude and time course (&#x02018;identity&#x02019;) of repeated spontaneous and/or evoked fingerprinted DEs implies constancy, either of the size of ATP packets, or of the P2X-receptor-mediated response to a packet of ATP released from a particular site (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Cunnane and Stj&#x000e4;rne, 1984</xref>). This is in contrast to the variability of the, also P2X-receptor-mediated, NCTs responses to release of ATP from single identified varicosities, whose amplitude at a given junction can vary by more than ninefold (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2002</xref>). This is surprising, as both monitors of neurotransmission reflect effects of ATP-induced opening of the pore of the same P2X receptors. Apparently the answer is that DEs reflect the net flux of ions (including Ca<sup>2+</sup>) through this pore, but NCTs both Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and a significant but variable downstream effect: amplification by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Estimates of innervation based on measures of intermittency</title><p>Using the calculated <italic>n</italic><sub>NCT</sub> (stimulus<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;cell<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; median 0.63, range 0.27&#x02013;1.77, <italic>n</italic>=9) and <italic>P</italic><sub>NCT</sub> per varicosity (0.019; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2002</xref>) it is possible to estimate the number of varicosities that functionally innervate a single SMC to be 33 (median; range 14&#x02013;93, <italic>n</italic>=9). These values may, however, underestimate the (presently not known) innervation density of MVD, due to the presence of varicosities in which the probability of neurotransmitter release is especially low (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>DEs are a measure of neurotransmitter release onto the impaled cell</title><p>This study shows for the first time that DEs represent neurotransmitter release onto the impaled cell. First, the median amplitude of the first derivative of the EJP was larger when an NCT occurred in the impaled cell, compared with when the NCT occurred in an adjacent cell or when there was no discernable NCT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Second, the time-to-peak amplitude of the first derivative was briefer if there was a coincident NCT in the impaled cell, compared with when no coincident NCT was observed within the field (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>As the entire SMC could not be simultaneously viewed within one confocal optical section (mean field 126.5&#x000b1;9.8 &#x003bc;m), it is possible that an NCT could occur at a considerable distance from the recording electrode, i.e. in an area of the impaled SMC not viewed. Thus the spatial information associated with NCTs was used to test further the hypothesis that DEs are indicative of local neurotransmitter release. NCTs were observed to occur in distinct spatially-separate groups (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>Ai), consistent with previous observations and the finding that they occur close to varicosities (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2002</xref>), and so EJPs were classed according to the position of their coincident NCT on the SMC.</p><p>The absence of an effect of distance on (normalized) NCT amplitude (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C) implies that neurotransmitter release is not affected by the location of the electrode. The amplitude of the first derivative of the EJP was, counterintuitively, positively correlated with the distance between the recording site and the position of NCT occurrence (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B), suggesting that the electrode reduces the local current (see below). The absence of a fall in amplitude away from the electrode (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B) argues against electrotonic decay; an absence of electrotonic decay implies that the cell will be isopotential.</p><p>The EJP amplitude in MVD is monotonically related to the net current through P2X<sub>1</sub> receptors, while NCTs are initiated by local Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2002</xref>). Usually, the current through P2X<sub>1</sub> receptors is dominated by Na<sup>+</sup>, with a small contribution by Ca<sup>2+</sup>; despite the observation that K<sup>+</sup> is just as permeable as Na<sup>+</sup> through P2X<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Evans et al., 1996</xref>), its current through this receptor is negligible because the Nernst potential for K<sup>+</sup> is close to the very negative resting membrane potential of the SMCs studied. One hypothesis is that a lower first derivative amplitude close to the electrode is caused by solute exchange through the electrode tip. As dyes, used to determine the position of the electrode, are seen to leak from the tip into the SMC (Young, unpublished observations), it is feasible that K<sup>+</sup> (present at 5 M, with acetate) may also leak into the impaled cell. The resulting high local K<sup>+</sup> concentration around the recording site would cause a K<sup>+</sup> efflux through &#x02018;open&#x02019; P2X<sub>1</sub> receptors, reducing the amplitude of depolarizations close to the recording site. However, quantitative modeling of diffusion from the electrode tip with K<sup>+</sup> leak out of the cell (see <xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">supplementary material</xref>), predicts that in the steady state, K<sup>+</sup> will fall off exponentially with distance from the electrode with a space constant of around 585 &#x003bc;m. Hence, based on the best available parameters, this hypothesis is quantitatively inconsistent with the observed spatial zone of inhibition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). We have not identified an alternative well-supported hypothesis, although it is possible that some unknown factor may locally inhibit Na<sup>+</sup> but not Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance through the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>The differing latencies of DEs are not due to distance between release and recording site</title><p>DEs occurred with differing latencies (e.g. <xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>A) as previously described (<xref rid="bib5 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Blakeley et al., 1982; Cunnane and Stj&#x000e4;rne, 1984</xref>). It has been suggested that the different latencies may be due to the distance between the release site and the recording site, with long latencies, for example, arising from more distant release (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Blakeley et al., 1984</xref>). However, this hypothesis is not supported by the observation that there is no correlation between distance (between recording site and the coincident NCT) and the latency of the DE (<xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>B). The basis of the variable latencies of DEs is more likely to be differing conduction velocities of axons innervating an SMC.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>Correlations in the amplitudes of NCTs and the first derivative of the EJP</title><p>The significant effect of distance, between the recording site and the site of NCT occurrence, and the amplitude of the first derivative of the EJP was first removed before the relationship between NCT amplitude and the amplitude of the first derivative of the EJP was investigated. There was no correlation between NCT amplitude and the resulting unstandardized residual of distance and the amplitude of the first derivative of the EJP. This finding represents a difference between sEJPs, which are positively correlated in amplitude with NCTs (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2007</xref>), and the amplitude of the first derivative of the EJP, which are not correlated (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>; present study). This absence of a correlation between NCT amplitude and the amplitude of the first derivative of the EJP is surprising, but might arise because some DEs arise from the synchronous (evoked) release of neurotransmitter at different junctions on the same cell. For example, in a Poisson process with a mean probability of 0.99, the probability of having more two or more events on a given trial (using the condition that at least one event occurs; i.e. that an NCT is present) is 41%. Such confounding simultaneous release (at a distance) is not expected with spontaneous neurotransmitter release.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><title>Temporal correlation between NCTs and EJPs</title><p>NCTs correlate in timing with EJPs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B) but the latency between the peak EJP and the peak NCT is both greater than one frame and is very variable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Delays were greater than those reported between the sEJP and corresponding NCT (&#x02212;30 to &#x02212;57 ms; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2007</xref>). The difference in delays between EJPs and NCTs (this study), and sEJPs and NCTs (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2007</xref>) can be explained by the stimulation protocol used in this study. Electrical stimuli were provided at 1.5 Hz; this was at the beginning of every tenth confocal (acquisition) frame. This experimental design has the shortcoming that the first sign of an NCT (e.g. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, frame ii)&#x02014;a spatially small (&#x02018;very focal&#x02019;) rise in fluorescence&#x02014;is of insufficient amplitude to be detected by the image analysis algorithm, which detects events based on both their amplitude, with respect to the noise, and area (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brain et al., 2003</xref>). Detection of the NCT took place only when the fluorescence had spread slightly (e.g. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, frame iii). The result is that temporal measurements have an error of at least one frame.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>1. DEs coincide with NCTs in the impaled cell but not in nearby cells. DEs thus reflect the action of packets of ATP on the impaled SMC. SMCs are poorly coupled electrically. 2. The relationship between DE amplitude and distance suggests that the junctional current is low close to the electrode, while the SMC is isopotential. 3. There is no correlation between DE and NCT amplitudes; the usefulness of NCTs lies primarily in locating the sites of impact of released ATP packets. But DEs may more reliably reflect the magnitude of packeted P2X-receptor-mediated response to released ATP packets. Both may give similar estimates of the release probability in individual sympathetic nerve varicosities.</p></sec><sec id="sec5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><label>Appendix</label><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at <ext-link xlink:href="doi:10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.05.044" ext-link-type="uri">doi:10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.05.044</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="sec6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media xlink:href="mmc1.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc2"><caption><title>Supplementary Figure 1</title></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc3"><caption><title>Supplementary Figure 2</title></caption><media xlink:href="mmc3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Mr. R.

Images, acquired at 13.5 Hz, are 4 consecutive frames of a 200 frame series. Electrical stimulation, occurring on frame ii, produced a NCT in a SMC (arrowhead).
