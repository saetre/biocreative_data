It has been postulated that this residual function, at least in part, may be mediated by another L-type calcium channel subunit, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D), expressed within cone photoreceptors. However, the expression of the calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit within photoreceptors remains debatable due to discrepancies among the immunohistochemical studies reported in the literature. In order to get around the innate complications of utilizing unproven antibodies and to shed light on this discussion, we investigated the mRNA expression profile for the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit in the mouse retina.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In situ hybridization was performed on wild type mouse retinal sections with two independent sets of digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D)-specific sense and antisense cRNA probes. The two probe sets employed correspond to two distinct regions of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit mRNA, each encoding a different fragment of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) polypeptide. In situ hybridization of wild type mouse brain sections with these same probes was performed as an additional control for specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Abundant L-type calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit mRNA expression was confirmed in most cells of the outer nuclear layer using two independent Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D)-specific antisense cRNA probes, confirming expression in rod photoreceptors. Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA expression was also observed within most cells of the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layers using these same antisense cRNA probes. No labeling of tissue was observed using either sense cRNA probe. In situ detection of concentrated Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA expression within the hippocampus and Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellum of wild type mouse brain with these same probes confirmed specificity of the probes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our finding of expression of the L-type calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit mRNA in rods substantiates the possibility that this pore-forming subunit may be a competent component of channels mediating the residual photoreceptor responses observed in mutant mice lacking functional Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (&#x003b1;1F) subunits and in humans with CSNB2. Furthermore, the combined observations of abundant expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA in wild type rods and the large reduction in the transmission of photoreceptor responses in mice lacking Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (&#x003b1;1F) raises the possibility that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) protein expression levels, localization, or functioning might be concomitantly altered by disruption of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (&#x003b1;1F) subunit in rods. To date, no studies of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA nor protein expression levels or localization in <italic>cacna1f</italic> mutant mice or humans with CSNB2 have been published. Our findings warrant such studies to address the abovementioned possibilities. Finally, the observation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA expression in multiple retinal cell types suggests the potential for a broader role for this L-type calcium channel subunit in overall functioning of the normal retina than previously appreciated. We therefore suggest that lesions in either the gene encoding the L-type calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit or other molecules that interact with and regulate it may underlie one or more retinopathies with currently unidentified molecular etiologies.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Incomplete X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2) is a recessive, nonprogressive visual disease in humans. CSNB2 was originally described as a distinct form of night blindness characterized by an extremely reduced (negative type) electroretinogram (ERG) b wave due to impaired transduction of the photoreceptor response to second order neurons of the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Mutations in the human CACNA1F gene encoding the pore-forming Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (&#x003b1;1F) subunit of voltage gated L-type calcium channels have been firmly linked to CSNB2 and are thought to be the underlying molecular lesion causing CSNB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. The immunohistochemical localization of this subunit to putative active zones of the terminals of rod photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>] of the rat retina supports this notion. The recently reported histological and ERG abnormalities observed in transgenic mice in which the <italic>cacna1f</italic> gene is disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>] and in the naturally occurring <italic>cacna1f</italic> mutant mouse, <italic>nob2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], add further support for this hypothesis.</p><p>In a recent communication, Morgans et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>] suggested that the residual photoreceptor function observed in <italic>nob2</italic> mice and humans with CSNB2 may be the result of rod signals transferred to cones through rod-cone coupling and subsequent forwarding via neurotransmitter release from the cone synapse controlled by another L-type calcium channel subunit isoform, such as Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D). In this same report, Morgans et al. demonstrate Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) immunoreactivity in wild type mouse cone pedicles, consistent with previously reported immunohistochemical localization of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) to cone terminals within tree shrew retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. In this same communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], however, Morgans et al. acknowledge a second and more parsimonious explanation: the presence of another calcium channel &#x003b1;1 subunit isomer within rod photoreceptors that may mediate neurotransmitter release from the terminals of rods.</p><p>Although Morgans' immunohistochemical data support the expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) in mouse cones and not rods, Xu et al., using a different anti-Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) antibody, reported intense immunohistochemical labeling of rod somata in the rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. There are 2 potential explanations for the discrepancy in these reports regarding the localization of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) within photoreceptors. As Morgans et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>] examined mouse retina and Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] examined rat retina, the difference may simply reflect a species variation in calcium channel subunit expression. This difference in results could also be the consequence of using different antibodies. As the antibodies used in the two studies were generated against distinct regions of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit, they may actually detect different Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) polypeptides translated from different mRNA spice variants of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) gene. Such reliance upon antibodies, the specificity of which has not been rigorously demonstrated using tissues from mice with a targeted deletion of the <italic>cacna1d</italic> gene encoding the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit, is a limitation of both studies. For this reason, we decided to investigate the mRNA expression profile of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) within the mouse retina using in situ hybridization, with the goal of enlightening the discussion of its potential contribution to forwarding of light signals from rod photoreceptors to second order neurons within the retina. Portions of this study have been previously reported in abstract form (Steele, EC Jr. Analysis of L-type calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 subunit expression in the mouse retina. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 2006; 47:E-Abstract 1046).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Wild type C57Bl/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Lab for these studies.

Hybridization buffer containing about 500 ng /ml DIG-11-UTP-labeled RNA probe, which was preheated to 80 &#x000b0;C for 5 min and then placed on ice, was added to sections before covering with DEPC-treated coverslips and incubating overnight at 61 &#x000b0;C (Probe A) or 58 &#x000b0;C (Probe B) in a humidified chamber. For each probe pair, a range of hybridization temperatures 55 &#x000b0;C, 58 &#x000b0;C, and 61 &#x000b0;C was tested to empirically determine the hybridization temperature which yielded strong staining of tissues with antisense probe following a short colorometric detection reaction time but no staining with sense probe following the same colorometric detection reaction time.</p><p>Following hybridization, slides were washed in 0.2X SSC 2 times for 30 min 1 h at 68 &#x000b0;C to remove unbound probe.

After RNase treatment, slides were rinsed with 0.2X SSC for 5 min at room temperature, followed by a rinse in 0.1 M Tris pH7.5, 0.15 NaCl for 5 min at room temperature. Slides were then blocked in 0.1 M Tris pH7.5, 0.15 NaCl containing 1-10% heat inactivated normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were then incubated in this same blocking buffer containing alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (diluted 1:400) for 2 h at room temperature. Following incubation with antibody, slides were rinsed 3 times for 7 min with blocking buffer at room temperature to remove unbound antibody. Slides were then equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.1 M Tris pH 9.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> for 5 min at room temperature, before staining with BCIP/NBT in the dark (Vector Labs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

The very small numbers of cones in the mouse retina preclude us from making any comment regarding the expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA in cones or the potential contribution of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) within cones to transmission of light signals derived via rod-cone coupling to second order neurons of the retina.</p><p>The observation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA expression in rods raises some other interesting possibilities worthy of serious consideration in interpreting the reported observations from <italic>cacna1f</italic> null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>] and the <italic>nob2</italic> mutant mice with a naturally occurring mutation in <italic>cacna1f</italic>, the gene encoding Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (&#x003b1;1F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Specifically, it warrants concern that the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit protein expression level, localization, or functioning might be altered in addition to that of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (&#x003b1;1F). Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) protein expression, localization, or functioning may be coupled to Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (&#x003b1;1F) expression, localization, or functioning, and be compromised as a direct result of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (&#x003b1;1F) mutations and concomitant aberration in rod-bipolar cell synapse formation.</p><p>Along this same vein of thinking, it is interesting that mice null for the auxiliary b<sub>2</sub> subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels have a disrupted outer plexiform synaptic layer and have abnormal ERG b waves. Consistent with the established role of auxiliary &#x003b2;subunits in targeting the pore-forming a subunits to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>], the phenotype of the &#x003b2;2 null mice is presumed to be due to the observed inefficiency in targeting of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (&#x003b1;1F) subunits to the synapses of rod photoreceptors. In contrast to mice null for the &#x003b2;2 subunit, mice null for the &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;3, or &#x003b2;4 subunit do not exhibit histopathological or functional consequences in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>], suggesting that the &#x003b2;2 auxiliary subunit plays the most prominent role in targeting the pore-forming calcium channel &#x003b1;1 subunits to the membranes of the synapses within the retina. To date, no data regarding the identity of the auxiliary &#x003b2;subunit associated with the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit in photoreceptors has been published. Based upon our finding s in the present study and the evidence from mice null for the calcium channel &#x003b2;2 subunit, it is highly likely that the auxiliary &#x003b2;2 subunit associates with Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) in addition to Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (&#x003b1;1F) in rods and that calcium channels containing the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit are substantially reduced in the retinas of mice lacking the &#x003b2;2 subunit. To date, no studies of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA nor protein expression levels or localization in <italic>cacna1f</italic> mutant mice, the &#x003b2;2 null mice, nor <italic>post mortem</italic> retinae from humans with CSNB2 have been published. Our findings warrant such studies to make sure these possibilities are not overlooked.</p><p>Finally, in addition to abundant expression in rod photoreceptors, we noted extensive Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA expression in most, if not all, neurons within all three nuclear layers of the mouse retina. This observation is consistent with the previously published results of Kamphuis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] using radiolabeled cRNA probes for in situ analysis of rat retinal sections. The observation of extensive labeling of cells within the inner nuclear layer is also consistent with previous reports of immunohistochemical localization of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) to the terminals of rat bipolar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>] and putative M&#x000fc;ller cell processes in rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] and salamander retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] and single-cell RT-PCR detection of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA expression in acutely isolated human M&#x000fc;ller cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] and mouse AII amacrine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Further experiments using combined in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical analysis of retina or acutely dissociated cells with cell specific markers are required for precise demonstration of the expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA within specific cell types of the inner nuclear layer of the retina. Although not uninteresting, the question of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) expression in these other cell types is beyond the scope of this study, which was to investigate the potential expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) in rod photoreceptors as a potential explanation for the observed residual photoreceptor function in patients with CSNB2. The apparently ubiquitous expression pattern of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) mRNA we observed in the mouse retina suggests the potential for a much broader role for this L-type calcium channel subunit in overall functioning of the normal retina than previously appreciated. We therefore suggest that lesions in the gene encoding the L-type calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit or other molecules that interact with or regulate the L-type calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (&#x003b1;1D) subunit may underlie one or more retinopathies with currently unidentified molecular etiologies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant U54 NS-34194.
