Its multi-step biosynthesis involves production of polyisoprenoid diphosphate in a reaction that requires the enzymes be encoded by <italic>PDSS1</italic> and <italic>PDSS2</italic>. Homozygous mutations in either of these genes, in humans, lead to severe neuromuscular disease, with nephrotic syndrome seen in <italic>PDSS2</italic> deficiency. We now show that a presumed autoimmune kidney disease in mice with the missense <italic>Pdss2<sup>kd/kd</sup></italic> genotype can be attributed to a mitochondrial CoQ biosynthetic defect. Levels of CoQ<sub>9</sub> and CoQ<sub>10</sub> in kidney homogenates from B6.<italic>Pdss2<sup>kd/kd</sup></italic> mutants were significantly lower than those in B6 control mice. Disease manifestations originate specifically in glomerular podocytes, as renal disease is seen in <italic>Podocin/cre,Pdss2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> knockout mice but not in conditional knockouts targeted to renal tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes. Liver-conditional B6.<italic>Alb/cre,Pdss2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> knockout mice have no overt disease despite demonstration that their livers have undetectable CoQ<sub>9</sub> levels, impaired respiratory capacity, and significantly altered intermediary metabolism as evidenced by transcriptional profiling and amino acid quantitation. These data suggest that disease manifestations of CoQ deficiency relate to tissue-specific respiratory capacity thresholds, with glomerular podocytes displaying the greatest sensitivity to <italic>Pdss2</italic> impairment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Coenzyme Q is a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the process by which cells make energy. Coenzyme Q deficiency in humans causes a wide range of disease manifestations affecting the nervous system, muscles, and kidneys. Here, we show that the failure to make Coenzyme Q due to a <italic>Pdss2</italic> mutation is the cause of a lethal kidney disease in mice that was previously thought to result from an autoimmune process. Studying both a spontaneously occurring missense mutant and a series of mutants generated to have the Coenzyme Q deficiency targeted solely to liver, kidney, or macrophages, we show that the specific cell type in which the kidney disease arises is the glomerular podocyte. No other manifestations of disease are evident in these animals. However, our analysis of livers from these mice reveals that they have significant depletion of Coenzyme Q, impairment of mitochondrial respiratory chain function, and disturbance of many other basic metabolic processes. Similar microarray patterns of cellular alterations to primary mitochondrial dysfunction were seen both in these mice and in a previously reported nematode model, suggesting that a common cellular profile of primary respiratory chain function may exist across evolution.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is a benzoquinone molecule with a polyisoprenylated side chain that ranges from 6 to 10 isoprenyl units in length. It functions as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, where it transports electrons from complexes I or II to complex III. The polyisoprenyl diphosphate synthases which form the isoprenyl side chain of CoQ in mice and humans are each heterotetramers of two protein subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000061-Saiki1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The genes that encode these subunits are now designated <italic>Pdss1</italic> and <italic>Pdss2</italic> in mice, and <italic>PDSS1</italic> and <italic>PDSS2</italic> in humans. Although its identity was not understood at the time, the first known mutation in the <italic>Pdss2</italic> gene arose spontaneously in the CBA/CaH colony of Dr. Mary Lyon and was designated kidney disease (<italic>kd</italic>).

Our results suggest that CoQ deficiency negatively impacts mitochondrial respiratory chain function, although loss of CoQ antioxidant function may also be involved in pathogenesis, which leads to podocyte death with important consequences for kidney function. The slit diaphragm, which is dependent on podocyte foot processes, is essentially destroyed, causing leakage of various proteins normally maintained within the circulation, such as serum albumin. Some of these molecules have deleterious effects on the collecting tubules, which leads to tubular dilatation and dysfunction, release of inflammatory mediators, and development of interstitial nephritis.</p><p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000061-t002">Table 2</xref> suggest that the elevation in serum cholesterol that is characteristic of <italic>Pdss2<sup>kd/kd</sup></italic> homozygotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000061-Madaio1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> is not entirely attributable to kidney disease, but likely results from shunting of farnesyl diphosphate (one of the precursors in the CoQ biosynthetic pathway immediately proximal to the <italic>Pdss2</italic> enzymatic block) to alternative pathways, primarily involving cholesterol biosynthesis. This is supported by transcriptional profiling of B6.<italic>Alb/cre,Pdss2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> liver which demonstrated upregulation of two pathways for which cholesterol is the starting substrate, namely bile acid biosynthesis and steroid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>In light of the severe, multi-system phenotype of the child with primary CoQ deficiency due to <italic>PDSS2</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000061-Lopez1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, we undertook an extensive phenotypic evaluation of B6.<italic>Pdss2<sup>kd/k</sup></italic><sup>d</sup> spontaneous missense homozygous mutants. All studies were performed in animals more than 120 days old, the time by which renal dysfunction is present. No overt non-renal disease manifestations could be detected, although significant deficiencies were observed in their respiratory function and activity of isolated liver mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g006">Figure 6</xref>), as well as quantitative amino acid profiles in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g008">Figure 8</xref>). It remains possible that additional manifestations of CoQ deficiency would develop with time but do not because of the high mortality of their renal disease. This possibility is being further evaluated by prolonged observation of tissue-specific conditional knockouts without renal disease.</p><p>Interestingly, B6.<italic>Alb/cre,Pdss2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> liver-conditional knockout mutants manifest no overt symptoms or signs of liver disease through at least eight months of life. Nonetheless, focused evaluations of the livers of these animals demonstrated substantial (97&#x00025;) knockdown of <italic>Pdss2</italic> expression; pronounced CoQ<sub>9</sub> deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and significant impairment of complex I- and complex II-dependent integrated respiratory capacity as well as complex I-III and II-III enzyme activities with compensatory increase in complex IV-dependent respiratory capacity in isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The relatively robust respiratory electron transport chain activities are quite remarkable, given that CoQ<sub>9</sub> was not detected over background in these liver lipid extracts. The low levels of CoQ<sub>9</sub> present in these animals must support significant activities of complexes I, II, and III. Very small amounts of CoQ support significant respiratory chain activity in other models (yeast, nematode, isolated mitochondria). Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000061-Liu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> showed that hepatocytes in <italic>clk-1/&#x0002b;</italic> heterozygous mice lose heterozygosity (become <italic>clk-1</italic> &#x02212;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;), and these cells undergo clonal expansion within the liver. These findings suggest that liver cells perform quite adequately with low CoQ content.</p><p>A significantly altered cellular metabolism phenotype in liver of B6.<italic>Alb/cre,Pdss2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> mice was evidenced by concordant upregulation of 43 biochemical pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g007">Figure 7</xref>) with significant deficiency of 9 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Taken together, these alterations confirm that <italic>Pdss2</italic> dysfunction is a nuclear gene-based mitochondrial respiratory chain defect to which cellular adaptation is occurring. Indeed, 15 key biochemical pathways were concordantly upregulated on transcriptional profiling in this murine model of primary mitochondrial dysfunction and in previously reported <italic>C. elegans</italic> models of primary respiratory chain dysfunction due to mutations in nuclear gene-encoded subunits of complexes I, II, and III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These similarities spanning evolution provides support that a transcriptional &#x0201c;signature&#x0201d; of mutations in the respiratory chain appears to be stimulation of the constituent components of oxidative phosphorylation, the enzymes of the TCA cycle, and many pathways (e.g., glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism) that furnish substrate to it, as well as stimulation of key cellular defense pathways such as glutathione and P450 metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000061-Falk1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Global amino acid alterations in <italic>Pdss2</italic> mutant liver further suggest that significant impairment may be occurring in flux through key biochemical pathways, including glycolysis, the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, the TCA cyle, and ureagenesis. Changes in the hepatic amino acid profile were not qualitatively dissimilar in B6.<italic>Alb/cre,Pdss2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> mutants compared with those of the B6.<italic>Pdss2<sup>kd/k</sup></italic><sup>d</sup> missense mutants, but alterations in the liver-conditional knockout were far more widespread and intense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The characteristic pattern in both mutants was a sharp reduction of hepatic amino acid concentrations, which appear to be related to a relative depletion in the hepatic concentration of glutamate. Indeed, glutamate is the &#x0201c;pivot&#x0201d; of nearly all amino acid metabolism as it furnishes amino groups to ketoacids to support the concentrations of alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, and phenylalanine, as well as to glutamine via glutamine synthetase. In addition, glutamate rapidly enters the TCA cycle as &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate either via transamination or the glutamate dehydrogenase pathway. We propose that diminished glutamate may occur in <italic>Pdss2</italic> mutants due to their enhanced utilization of glutamate as a metabolic fuel in response to a relative diminution in their glucose consumption rate via glycolysis. It is recognized that in some tissues &#x02013; particularly kidney and brain &#x02013; glutamate can become an important metabolic substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000061-Nissim1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The significant reduction observed in alanine concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g008">Figure 8</xref>, Panel C) is consistent with this formulation, since alanine carbon forms from pyruvate that is produced in glycolysis. Similarly, the sharp reduction in the glutamate&#x02236;aspartate ratio in mutant liver implies an increase of hepatic oxaloacetate, a TCA cycle intermediate which is the obligatory precursor both to aspartate carbon as well as to the TCA cycle citrate synthetase reaction. In other words, if glycolytic flux is relatively diminished in the <italic>Pdss2</italic> mutants, less pyruvate will be produced and flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase will be attenuated, thereby limiting availability of acetyl-CoA to the citrate synthase reaction, which would augment the hepatic pool of oxaloacaetate and impair TCA cycle flux. Diminished glutamate would also impede production of N-acetylglutamate, an obligatory effector of the carbamylphosphate synthetase reaction sequence in the mitochondrial segment of the urea cycle that leads from ammonia to citrulline, the total absence of which (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g008">Figure 8</xref>, Panel C) points to a compromise of ureagenesis in the liver of B6.<italic>Alb/cre,Pdss2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> mice. It is of interest in this regard that the sole amino acid to be significantly increased is aspartic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000061-g008">Figure 8</xref>, Panel C), since a failure of citrulline synthesis would sharply curtail flux through cytosolic argininosuccinate synthetase, a step in the urea cycle that utilizes both citrulline and aspartate as precursors. The diminished glutamate&#x02236;aspartate ratio highlighted above also denotes compromised flux through the hepatic urea cycle, to which aspartate is a major nitrogen donor. Additional investigations are necessary and underway to verify the extent to which metabolic flux is impaired in <italic>Pdss2</italic> CoQ biosynthetic mutants.</p><p>We conclude that the <italic>Pdss2<sup>kd</sup></italic> allele causes a milder phenotype in homozygous mice than that observed in the homologous human case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000061-Lopez1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. What is especially puzzling about the <italic>Pdss2<sup>kd/kd</sup></italic> mutant mouse is why an intermediate level of activity in oxidative phosphorylation should uniquely affect podocytes, a cell type not previously characterized by unusually high levels of respiratory activity. However, it is clear that CoQ concentrations and intermediary metabolism are significantly altered in the missense mutants.

The occurrence of a subsequent intense inflammatory response suggests that autoantigens are exposed by autophagy to initiate either an innate or adaptive immune response. The inflammatory response is not the primary cause of the renal disease, but appears to be the mechanism used to collect and dispose of cellular debris.

Fresh petroleum ether (6 ml) was added to each vial containing the aqueous phase and vortexed for 1 min. The vials were subjected to centrifugation as before and the second petroleum ether layer removed. The process was repeated once more, and the three pooled petroleum ether fractions were dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 200 &#x000b5;l methanol. The quinones were then separated and quantified by HPLC connected to an electrochemical detector as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000061-Jonassen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, with the following exceptions: the precolumn electrode was the only electrode used and was set at &#x0002b;650 mV to oxidize all hydroquinones, and a Gilson 118 UV/Vis detector was utilized to detect quinones (275 nm) as they eluted from the column. The amount of CoQ<sub>9</sub> and CoQ<sub>10</sub> in the standards and samples was normalized to the amount of CoQ<sub>6</sub> recovered in the individual lipid extracts.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Integrated Respiratory Capacity Analysis of Freshly Isolated Liver Mitochondria</title><p>Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation without general anesthetic, since anesthetics may exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction in primary mitochondrial disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000061-Falk2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.
