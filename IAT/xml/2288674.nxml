During Vif-negative HIV-1 replication, A3G is incorporated into HIV-1 particles, induces mutations in reverse transcribed viral DNA and inhibits reverse transcription. However, HIV-1 Vif counteracts A3G's activities by inducing its degradation and by blocking its incorporation into HIV-1 particles. Thus, it is interesting to elucidate a mechanism that would allow A3G to escape the effects of Vif in order to rescue its potent antiviral activity and to provide a possible novel therapeutic strategy for treating HIV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>In this study, we generated an R88-A3G fusion protein by fusing A3G to a virion-targeting polypeptide (R14-88) derived from HIV-1 Vpr protein and compared its antiviral effects relative to those of HA-tagged native A3G (HA-A3G). Our study showed that transient expression of the R88-A3G fusion protein in both Vif<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HIV-1 producing cells drastically inhibited viral infection in HeLa-CD4-CCR5-cells, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> C8166 T cells and human primary PBMCs. Moreover, we established CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> C8166 T cell lines that stably express either R88-A3G or HA-A3G by transduction with VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral vector that harbor expression cassettes for R88-A3G or HA-A3G, respectively, and tested their susceptibility to Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HIV-1 infection. Our results clearly reveal that expression of R88-A3G in transduced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> C8166 cells significantly blocked Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HIV-1 infection. In an attempt to understand the mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of R88-A3G, we demonstrated that R88-A3G was efficiently incorporated into viral particles in the presence of Vif. Moreover, PCR analysis revealed that R88-A3G significantly inhibited viral cDNA synthesis during the early stage of Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> virus infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results clearly indicate that R88 delivers A3G into Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HIV-1 particles and inhibits infectivity and spread of the virions among CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. This study provides evidence for an effective strategy to modify a host protein with innate anti-HIV-1 activity and rescue its potent anti-HIV potential in the presence of Vif. Further characterization and optimization of this system may lead to the development of an effective therapeutic approach against HIV-1 infection.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of primary CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, macrophages and some immortalized T cell lines requires the HIV-1 encoded viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein. In the absence of Vif protein, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G; hereafter referred to as A3G), which is a cellular cytidine deaminase, was found to interfere with the replication of retroviruses, including HIV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Sheehy1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. A3G is efficiently incorporated into viral particles, associates with the HIV-1 reverse transcription complex (RTC), and interrupts HIV infectivity by introducing dC-to-dU mutations in the minus viral DNA strand during reverse transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Zhang1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Mariani1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to its deaminase activity, A3G directly inhibits viral reverse transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Chiu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Newman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These previous observations highlight the multifaceted anti-HIV activities of A3G during HIV-1 replication.</p><p>In activated T lymphocytes, A3G is packaged into the progeny virus through interactions with the NC domain of Gag and/or with the viral RNA during virion assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Cen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Burnett1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. However, during wild-type HIV-1 infection, the antiviral effects of A3G are blocked by Vif, which decreases incorporation of A3G into virions by reducing the intracellular level of A3G through accelerating ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of A3G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Mariani1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Stopak1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Conticello1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, previous studies suggest that Vif may act as an effective barrier to completely block targeting of A3G into virions, based on the observation that, even though a low level of A3G was detected in Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HIV producing cells, the progeny virions remained infectious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Mariani1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Kao1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Kao2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Opi1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, breaking through Vif's barrier and successfully targeting A3G into virions may promote inactivation of HIV-1 and eliminate its infectivity.</p><p>Given that A3G exerts potent anti-HIV activity which is neutralized by the HIV-1 Vif protein, characterization of the A3G-Vif interaction is of considerable interest, as it provides a target for novel therapeutic strategies against HIV-1 infection. Recent studies have shown that a single amino-acid substitution of an aspartic acid residue to a lysine at position of 128 of A3G abrogated its interaction with HIV-1 Vif and rescued A3G's antiviral activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Bogerd1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Xu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, Huthoff <italic>et al.,</italic> employed a molecular genetic approach to map a 3 amino-acid motif, comprised of aspartic acid-proline-aspartic acid (DPD), at amino-acid positions 128 to 130 of A3G that is a crucial region for the interaction between A3G and HIV-1 Vif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Huthoff1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a 4 amino-acid region (YYFW) adjacent to the N-terminus of the DPD motif of A3G has been identified as an important determinant for virion packaging of A3G. Such an intimate alignment of these two functional domains within A3G raises the possibility that disruption of the A3G/Vif interaction by targeting of the DPD motif with pharmaceutical agents may simultaneously interfere with recognition of the A3G packaging signal, and affect its antiviral activity. Therefore, developing novel strategies to efficiently target A3G into virions by allowing it to escape from Vif's blockage will broaden our current arsenal of anti-HIV therapies.</p><p>HIV-1 Vpr, a viral auxiliary protein, is efficiently incorporated <italic>in trans</italic> into HIV particles, through its interaction with the p6 domain of the Gag precursor polyprotein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Yao1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Lavallee1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Its high incorporation efficiency into HIV-1 virions has enabled Vpr to deliver heterologous molecules, as Vpr fusion proteins, into the virus, thereby interfering with viral infectivity or complementing a defective virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Wu1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Ao1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been shown that a virion-incorporation peptide R14-88 derived from Vpr can efficiently direct heterologous enzymatic proteins, such as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, into HIV-1 particles in a p6-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Yao2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we generated an R14-88-pcs-A3G (R88-A3G) fusion protein by fusing A3G to R14-88 and investigated its anti-HIV effect in the presence of Vif. Our study has shown that co-expression of R88-A3G with Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HIV-1 provirus (HxBru-Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) drastically inhibited the infectivity of progeny virus in HeLa-CD4-CCR5-&#x003b2;-Gal cells, CD4&#x0002b; C8166 cells and human primary PBMCs. The same inhibitory effect was also observed in susceptible CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> C8166 T cell lines that stably express R88-A3G. Moreover, we found that R88-A3G was efficiently incorporated into viral particles and significantly inhibited reverse transcription during the early stage of Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> virus replication. These results support the hypothesis that the R88-A3G fusion protein acts as a potent antiviral agent against HIV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression of R88-A3G efficiently inhibits HIV-1 infection regardless of the presence of Vif</title><p>We initially sought to develop a strategy to antagonize the Vif-mediated blockade of A3G incorporation, and subsequently to inhibit HIV infection.

An HIV-1 protease cleavage site (SQNY/PIV) was inserted between R14-88 and A3G in order to release the native A3G protein in the virion through a specific cleavage mediated by HIV-1 protease. In parallel, an HA-A3G-expressorwas constructed as a control.

Both cell and virus lysate samples were directly loaded onto a 12&#x00025; SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by Western blotting with rabbit anti-A3G and anti-p24, as indicated (upper panel). The ratio of R88-A3G or HA-A3G incorporation into the viral particle relative to the total amount of R88-A3G or HA-A3G was also quantified by laser densitometry (lower panel).

At 48 hours post-transfection, viral particles were collected and concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 20&#x00025; sucrose cushion. Cell- and virion-associated HA-A3G, R88-A3G and Gag-p24 were detected by 12&#x00025; SDS-PAGE of cell and virus lysates followed by Western blotting with the rabbit anti-A3G and anti-p24 antibodies.

This ratio was adjusted relative to the level of virion-associated Gag-p24protein, which was employed as an internal control.

CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> C8166 T cells were then transduced with the resultant lentiviral particles. Since the lentiviral vector contains a puromycin-resistance gene, the transduced cells were selected with puromycin (0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml) to obtain stable C8166 T cell lines expressing R88-A3G or HA-A3G. As expected, the transduction efficiency of lentiviruses containing R88-A3G was dramatically reduced (data not shown). However, through puromycin selection, we were able to obtain C8166 T cell lines stably expressing R88-A3G. The low levels of HA-A3G and R88-A3G protein present in the stably transduced cells were not detectable by anti-A3G Western blotting.

Further studies revealed that Vif recruits cullin 5-elongin B/C E3 ubiquitin ligase which polyubiquitinates A3G and results in its proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Yu1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Yu2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Mehle1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings have led to the prevailing opinion that Vif inhibits A3G encapsidation by inducing its rapid degradation in virus-producing cells. In addition, several other studies suggest that Vif may act as an effective barrier to sequester A3G and prevent its incorporation into virus, even though a low level of A3G and/or degradation-resistant mutants of A3G are detected in Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HIV producing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Mariani1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Kao1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Kao2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Opi1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, we wonder whether the higher level of R88-A3G in the virus could be due to the lower sensitivity of R88-A3G to Vif-induced degradation. Based on the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001995-g003">figure 3A</xref>, it is clear that R88-A3G and HA-A3G are equally susceptible to Vif-mediated degradation. Consistent with previous observations, these data suggest that the intracellular degradation of A3G may not be the sole role played by Vif in the production of infectious viruses from A3G-expressing cells. An interaction between Vif and A3G may block virion-incorporation of A3G, which may be necessary for complete neutralization of A3G. In the case of R88-A3G, the incorporation pathway of the fusion protein is different from that of A3G. This altered incorporation pathway can bypass Vif's blockage, and consequently restore A3G's antiviral activity. However, at this point, we do not know whether the efficient virion-incorporation ability of R88-A3G is the only factor that accounts for its potent anti-HIV activity, because a low level of HA-A3G was detected in Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HIV virus lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001995-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), while they were not functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001995-g002">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). We speculate that, in addition to its ability to target A3G into virus particles, R14-88 may further optimize A3G's activity, possibly by altering its intraviral localization or its association with viral components. Indeed, a recent study by Aguinar <italic>et al</italic> suggested that Vpr targeted A3A (APOBEC3A), another member of the human APOBEC3 protein family, into the viral core and possibly into the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), but that A3A alone was only loosely associated with viral particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Aguiar1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that, in the presence of Vif, R88-A3G is targeted to the core and associated with the RNP, which is critical for the inhibitory effect of R88-A3G. In contrast, Vif may disrupt the intraviral location of native A3G, including HA-A3G, even though a small amount of HA-A3G may be packaged in the virus. We posit that these questions merit further study.</p><p>The inhibition of R88-A3G on Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> virus infectivity was examined by measuring its effect on viral reverse transcription synthesis. Viruses produced by R88-A3G-expressing cells were defective at reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001995-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), which closely correlated with the loss of viral infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001995-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). These observations indicate that one of main functions of R88-A3G is to directly affect HIV-1 reverse transcription, which is similar to the activity of native A3G during Vif<sup>&#x02212;</sup> virus infection. Indeed, several previous studies have shown that Vif<sup>&#x02212;</sup> viruses produced from A3G expressing cells produced a severely reduced level of viral DNA in newly infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Goncalves1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Guo2">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a report by Bishop <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that the antiviral phenotype of APOBEC proteins correlates with their ability to prevent accumulation of reverse transcripts, but not with the induction of hypermutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Bishop1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Although R88-A3G significantly inhibits the reverse transcription step, it is worth noting that A3G's deaminase activity may contribute to the potent antiviral effect of the R88-A3G fusion protein. Further study is underway to assess the contribution of A3G deaminase activity to R88-A3G's activity, and to evaluate its contribution to the mutational burden carried by viral DNAs.</p><p>Our initial experiments revealed that co-expression of R88-A3G and HIV-1 in 293T cells significantly inhibited progeny virus infectivity regardless of the presence of Vif protein. Importantly, these experiments raise the concern that the effect of R88-A3G is, at least in part, due to its over-expression during viral production. Therefore, it is necessary to assess whether a lower level of R88-A3G expression in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells renders cells resist to viral infection. To that end, we introduced R88-A3G into CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> C8166 T cells by use of a lentiviral vector. These transduced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell lines expressed very low levels of the R88-A3G fusion protein, such that we could not detect R88-A3G protein expression in these cells. Instead, we detected R88-A3G in concentrated viruses released from these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001995-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Our infection experiments consistently demonstrate that a low level of R88-A3G in C8166 T cells sufficiently inhibits Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HIV-1 infection and transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001995-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). It should also be noted that stable R88-A3G expression did not affect C8166 T cell growth, cell division or CD4 surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001995-g005">Fig. 5B, C and D</xref>). Interestingly, our experiments revealed that virus production was partially reduced in R88-A3G-transduced C8166 T cells initially infected with Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> virus, while HA-A3G-transduced cells were fully susceptible to viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001995-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). This is surprising since A3G is generally observed with a high molecular mass (HMM) in activated T cells, which is not able to affect virus replication during the first round of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Chiu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Kreisberg1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. At this point, we do not know whether the R88-A3G fusion protein has undefined features that may affect incoming virus replication. A previous study has shown that adding recombinant Vpr could <italic>in trans</italic> complemented HIV-1 preintegration complex for its nuclear translocation in an <italic>in vitro</italic> nuclear import assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001995-Popov1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, whether the R14-88 peptide component of R88-A3G directs the fusion protein to incoming virus reverse transcription complexes and consequently affects early stages of viral replication is worthy of further investigation. Another interesting observation is that the progeny virus produced from R88-A3G-transduced C8166 T cells lost their ability to mediate subsequent infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001995-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), indicating that Vif<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> virus is not transmissible in the presence of R88-A3G.</p><p>Overall, this study demonstrates a novel strategy to modify a host innate anti-HIV protein and rescue its potent anti-HIV potential, even in the presence of Vif. Further characterization and optimization of this system may lead to development of an effective therapeutic approach against this deadly viral infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The cDNA of human APOBEC3G (A3G) was kindly provided by Dr. S.K.
