Much of our knowledge of cell cycle regulators derives from loss-of-function studies. To reveal new cell cycle regulatory genes that are difficult to identify in loss-of-function studies, we performed a near-genome-wide flow cytometry assay of yeast gene overexpression-induced cell cycle delay phenotypes. We identified 108 genes whose overexpression significantly delayed the progression of the yeast cell cycle at a specific stage. Many of the genes are newly implicated in cell cycle progression, for example <italic>SKO1</italic>, <italic>RFA1</italic>, and <italic>YPR015C</italic>. The overexpression of <italic>RFA1</italic> or <italic>YPR015C</italic> delayed the cell cycle at G2/M phases by disrupting spindle attachment to chromosomes and activating the DNA damage checkpoint, respectively. In contrast, overexpression of the transcription factor <italic>SKO1</italic> arrests cells at G1 phase by activating the pheromone response pathway, revealing new cross-talk between osmotic sensing and mating. More generally, 92&#x00025;&#x02013;94&#x00025; of the genes exhibit distinct phenotypes when overexpressed as compared to their corresponding deletion mutants, supporting the notion that many genes may gain functions upon overexpression. This work thus implicates new genes in cell cycle progression, complements previous screens, and lays the foundation for future experiments to define more precisely roles for these genes in cell cycle progression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>All cells require proper cell cycle regulation; failure leads to numerous human diseases. Cell cycle mechanisms are broadly conserved across eukaryotes, with many key regulatory genes known. Nonetheless, our knowledge of regulators is incomplete. Many classic studies have analyzed yeast loss-of-function mutants to identify cell cycle genes. Studies have also implicated genes based upon their overexpression phenotypes, but the effects of gene overexpression on the cell cycle have not been quantified for all yeast genes. We individually quantified the effect of overexpression on cell cycle progression for nearly all (91&#x00025;) of yeast genes, and we report the 108 genes causing the most significant and reproducible cell cycle defects, most of which have not been previously observed. We characterize three genes in more detail, implicating one in chromosomal segregation and mitotic spindle formation. A second affects mitotic stability and the DNA damage checkpoint. Curiously, overexpression of a third gene, <italic>SKO1</italic>, arrests the cell cycle by activating the pheromone response pathway, with cells mistakenly behaving as if mating pheromone is present. These results establish a basis for future experiments elucidating precise cell cycle roles for these genes. Similar assays in human cells could help further clarify the many connections between cell cycle control and cancers.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> undergoes a cell cycle similar to other eukaryotic organisms except for the lack of nuclear envelope dissolution during mitosis and the production of daughter cells <italic>via</italic> budding, and thus budding yeast has become a model system for studying eukaryotic cell cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Hartwell1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> due to its rapid division, the availability of genetic tools, and homology to higher eukaryotic cell cycle processes.

Extensive effort has been made to decipher the mechanisms of cell cycle control.

Hartwell and colleagues identified more than 50 cell division cycle (CDC) genes required at specific stages in cell cycle division, by identifying conditional temperature-sensitive mutants with specific arrest points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Hartwell2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Hartwell5">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Gene dosage has been another powerful approach to study gene function. Either increasing (overexpression) or decreasing gene dosage (gene deletion or gene knockdown) can influence the activity of genes and lead to detectable phenotypes. Most large-scale cell cycle screens have focused on studying cell cycle progression by employing loss-of-function approaches such as gene deletion, RNAi, and promoter shutoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Bjorklund1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Yu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and have successfully identified many cell cycle genes. However, loss-of-function mutations can often be masked, such as in the cases of genes acting as negative regulators or genes compensated for by redundant functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Gelperin1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Sopko1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, overexpression of a gene product can potentially overcome such effects and often leads to a more detectable effect on cellular function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Sopko1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Overexpression also offers the opportunity to identify and study gain-of-function mutations.</p><p>In order to identify additional cell cycle genes, especially those difficult to identify in loss-of-function studies, large-scale screens focusing on the effects of overexpression-induced gain-of-function of genes in cell-cycle progression are needed. Stevenson <italic>et al.</italic> performed the first such large-scale overexpression screen for cell cycle genes by expressing a moderated GAL promoter-driven cDNA library and sheared genomic DNA pool in ARS-CEN vectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Stevenson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Although 113 genes, including those causing only slight effects on the cell cycle, were identified from this screen, this screen was unsaturated due to the coverage of the cDNA library and incomplete gene annotation. Therefore, completion of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome sequence and the systematic cloning of all genes into overexpression vectors now allow a more comprehensive analysis of the set of genes.</p><p>Analysis of overexpression phenotypes using cell sorting to assay the distribution of cells in different cell cycle stages has the advantage of being more quantitative and discerning than simple growth screens. However, flow cytometry has not been carried out comprehensively to cover all genes in the genome. In the present work, we performed a near-saturating screen for yeast genes having overexpression-induced defects in cell cycle progression, taking advantage of the availability of a yeast open reading frame (ORF) clone collection covering 91&#x00025; of the yeast complete ORF set, including dubious ORFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Gelperin1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

Excess accumulation of cells with either one copy (1C) or two copies (2C) of DNA content indicates a defect in progression through a particular cell cycle stage (G1 or G2/M, respectively). Thus, in order to search for such defects induced by overexpression of a particular yeast gene, we analyzed asynchronous cell cultures and determined the distributions of DNA content, assaying if cells from each given ORF overexpression strain exhibited a skewed distribution relative to control cells. In all, &#x0223c;5,700 DNA histograms were acquired and quantitatively analyzed, measuring the ratio of 1C/2C cells for each strain, <italic>i.e</italic>., the ratio of cells in the G1 phase to cells in the G2/M phase. We observed the Log2 (1C/2C) ratios of the 5,556 ORF strains and of 139 replicate analyses of control strains to be approximately normally distributed and well-fit by a Gaussian distribution (R<sup>2</sup>&#x0223c;0.97) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000120-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, for each strain, we calculated a Z-score for its distribution of DNA content across cells and could thus identify the ORF strains with significantly higher accumulations of cells in the G1 or G2/M growth phases. Based on this Z-score, 2 categories were assigned: ORF strains with Log2 (1C/2C) ratios in the left tail of the Gaussian distribution were considered to have significant G2/M delays, in which cells accumulated with two copies of DNA. Similarly, ORF strains with Log2 (1C/2C) ratios in the right tail of the distribution showed significantly higher proportions of cells with one copy of DNA, and were considered to exhibit G1 delays. Examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000120-g001">Figure 1C</xref>. We could assign genes to the G1 and G2/M categories using different confidence levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000120-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). At the 95&#x00025; confidence level, 198 genes were identified whose overexpression caused cell cycle detects; only 3 of 139 control strains exceeded this threshold. As the large-scale screen was based upon only a single culture per ORF strain, we further selected those strains with reproducible defects. Of the 198 strains, 108 were validated at least twice by manual flow cytometry analysis (DNA histograms are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000120.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Additionally, we tested that all 108 genes identified showed cell cycle delay phenotypes only upon induction in galactose, and that the phenotype for each hit therefore derived specifically from the GAL-promoter-driven gene. Of the 108 genes, 21 caused a significant accumulation of cells in the G1 phase, 87 genes in the G2/M phase.

However, genes involved in the pheromone response pathway do not appear to be regulated by <italic>SKO1</italic> under normal culture conditions, at least as measured by chromatin-immunoprecipitation of <italic>SKO1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Lee2">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, our results suggest that <italic>SKO1</italic> regulates genes in the pheromone response pathway through a gain-of-function mechanism, e.g., such as by enabling binding to a cryptic or lower affinity promoter when overexpressed.</p></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this paper, we describe a near-saturating screen for yeast genes whose overexpression causes cell cycle delays and which are thus likely to function in cell cycle progression. We individually examined the effects of overexpression on cell cycle progression for each of &#x0223c;5,556 yeast ORFs, and report the 108 genes with the most significant and reproducible cell cycle defects. 82 of these genes have not been reported in previous large-scale screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Yu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Sopko1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Stevenson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, probably due to different overexpression conditions and strain backgrounds, false positives in large-scale screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Bjorklund1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, or more likely, false negatives, e.g., such as might derive from variable 2 micron plasmid copy numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000120-Futcher1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> increasing phenotypic variability and thus allowing cell cycle defects to escape detection. Our analysis thus complements previous screens. These results lay the foundation for future experiments to elucidate the precise roles of these genes in cell cycle progression, such as the mechanisms of <italic>RFA1</italic> and <italic>YPR015C</italic>. Overexpression screens such as we have described here provide complementary information to loss-of-function studies and therefore offer new opportunities for discovery of genetic interactions, such as by systematically testing the overexpression plasmids in deletion strains to screen for phenotype suppression or synthetic interactions. Finally, since overexpression is an efficient technique in human cell culture and since regulation of cell proliferation is an important aspect of studying human diseases, we anticipate that a similar effort to this work in human cell lines could accelerate our understanding of cell cycle control in mammalian systems and help to further clarify the many connections between cell cycle control and cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000120.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Flow cytometry histograms of 108 ORF overexpression strains causing cell cycle defects upon induction.</p><p>(0.44 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000120.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000120.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>77 of 82 ORF strains not previously known to show cell cycle defects upon induction were tested for drug sensitive growth phenotypes.</p><p>(10.62 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000120.s002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000120.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>Protein expression is significantly induced in overexpression strains, even for proteins expressed natively at high levels.</p><p>(0.14 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000120.s003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000120.s004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>Overlap of identified genes with previous large-scale studies.</p><p>(0.15 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000120.s004.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000120.s005"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>108 yeast ORFs causing cell cycle defects when overexpressed.</p><p>(0.03 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000120.s005.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000120.s006"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Summary of 108 strains with cell cycle defects.</p><p>(0.01 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000120.s006.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000120.s007"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>Comparison between over-expression and loss-of-function phenotypes.</p><p>(0.01 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000120.s007.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000120.s008"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p>Genes whose overexpression induces slow growth, drug sensitivity.</p><p>(0.01 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000120.s008.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000120.s009"><label>Table S5</label><caption><p>Genes upregulated following overexpression of <italic>SKO1</italic>.</p><p>(0.02 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000120.s009.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000120.s010"><label>Table S6</label><caption><p>Over-expression strains appearing diploid or 3C.</p><p>(0.04 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000120.s010.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Traver Hart for aid with microscopy, Hong Cui and Dr. Makkuni Jayaram for providing the plasmid, strain and protocol for mitotic instability assay, and Dr. Angela M.
