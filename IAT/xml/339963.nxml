We determined the nucleotide sequences of six sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) late histone genes located on four genomic segments. Comparative analysis of these sequences identified several conserved elements in 5' flanking regions, including the sequences ATGPyATANTATA shared by all late genes and GGCGGGAAATTGAAAA shared by two late H4s. Comparisons of protein-coding sequences of late H4 and H2B genes with their early counterparts showed that silent sites have diverged to the theoretical maximum, indicating that early and late histone gene classes diverged at least 200 million years ago. Since extant echinoderms evolved from a common ancestor at about that time, it is likely that early and late histone gene sets are characteristic of all echinoderm groups. Amino acid sequences derived from nucleotide sequences of late H2A and H2B gistone genes differ substantially from amino acid sequences of their late counterparts. Most such differences are in highly mutable positions. A few, however, occur in positions that do not mutate frequently and thus may reflect functional differences between the early and late forms of the H2A and H2B proteins.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0484.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10569"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0485.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10570"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0486.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10571"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0487.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10572"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0488.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10573"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0489.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10574"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0490.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10575"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0491.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10576"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0492.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10577"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0493.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10578"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0494.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10579"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0495.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10580"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0496.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10581"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00268-0497.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10582"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
