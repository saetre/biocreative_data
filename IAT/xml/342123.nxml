It was characterised for sequence and the very basic N-terminal region of the protein was found to be absent. No smaller resistant fragments were produced. 5S RNA binding experiments indicated that the basic N-terminal region, from amino acid residues 1 to 17, was not important for the L18-5S RNA association. Under milder trypsin digestion conditions three resistant fragments were produced from the free protein. The largest corresponded to that isolated from the complex. The smaller ones were trimmed slightly further at both N- and C-terminal ends. These smaller fragments did not reassociate with 5S RNA. It was concluded on the basis of the trypsin protection observations and the 5S RNA binding results that the region extending from residues 18 to 117 approximates to the minimum amount of protein required for a specific and stable protein-RNA interaction. The accessibility of the very basic N-terminal region of L18, in the L18-5S RNA complex, suggests that it may be involved, in some way, in the interaction of 5S RNA with 23S RNA.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0038-a" xlink:role="1758"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0040-a" xlink:role="1760"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0042-a" xlink:role="1762"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1753"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1754"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1755"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1756"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1757"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1758"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1759"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1760"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1761"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1762"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1763"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1764"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1765"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00467-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1766"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
