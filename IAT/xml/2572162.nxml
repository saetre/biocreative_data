In the event of neuronal stress or injury, microglial cells rapidly react and change their phenotype. This response may lead to a deleterious type of microglial activation, which is often associated with neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in several neuropathological conditions. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying triggering of microglial activation by necrotic neuronal damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Primary cultures of microglia were used to study the effect of necrotic neurons on microglial inflammatory responses and toxicity towards cerebellar granule neurons (CGN). The mouse hippocampal cell line, HT22, was used in this study as the main source of necrotic neurons to stimulate microglia. To identify the signal transduction pathways activated in microglia, primary microglial cultures were obtained from mice deficient in Toll-like receptor (TLR) -2, -4, or in the TLR adapter protein MyD88.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Necrotic neurons, but not other necrotic cell types, induced microglial activation which was characterized by up-regulation of: i) MHC class II; ii) co-stimulatory molecules, i.e. CD40 and CD24; iii) &#x003b2;2 integrin CD11b; iii) pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e. interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-12p40 and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF); iv) pro-inflammatory enzymes such as nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, type II NOS), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and increased microglial motility. Moreover, microglia-conditioned medium (MCM) obtained from cultures of activated microglia showed increased neurotoxicity mediated through the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). The activation of microglia by necrotic neurons was shown to be dependent on the TLR-associated adapter molecule myeloid differentiation primary response gene (<italic>MyD88</italic>). Furthermore, MyD88 mediated enhanced neurotoxicity by activated microglia through up-regulation of the expression and activity of glutaminase, an enzyme that produces glutamate, which is an NMDAR agonist.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results show that necrotic neurons activate in microglia a MyD88-dependent pathway responsible for a pro-inflammatory response that also leads to increased neurotoxic activity through induction of glutaminase. This finding contributes to better understanding the mechanisms causing increased neuroinflammation and microglial neurotoxicity in a neurodegenerative environment.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Necrotic-like neuronal death is associated with the development of several pathologic conditions, including brain ischemia subsequent to stroke or trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], infectious-driven neuroinflammation, e.g. meningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], HIV-associated dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and cerebral malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], as well as noninfectious-driven neuroinflammation, e.g. multiple sclerosis (MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In such pathological conditions microglia, the resident CNS macrophage equivalents, may contribute to neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Upon neuronal injury, microglial cells are activated, acquiring increased motility and phagocytic activity. Moreover, expression of molecules that regulate immune responses, including MHC class I and II, Fc&#x003b3;R, and the co-stimulatory molecules B7.1 and B7.2 are also increased during the process of microglial activation. This can be beneficial by removing cellular debris and can also support neuronal survival through the secretion of neurotrophic factors such as bFGF and NGF (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). On the other hand, this may also lead to unfettered microglial activation with deleterious consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] such as increased production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF, IL-6 and IL-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], neurotoxins including the pro-oxidant molecules nitrogen oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and metabolites such as quinolinic acid and glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Specific factors released by stressed or damaged neurons, including matrix metalloproteinase-3, (MMP-3), &#x003b1;-synuclein, neuromelanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] have been shown <italic>in vitro </italic>to induce the production of inflammatory factors by microglia. On the other hand, during the last decade several other putative endogenous "danger signals" or "alarmins" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], released by necrotic but not by apoptotic cells have also been shown to stimulate pro-inflammatory responses in dendritic cells and in monocytes/macrophages. These "danger signals" include the heat shock proteins (hsp) hsp60, hsp70, hsp90, and gp96 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; the calcium-binding S100 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], DNA, proteases, uric acid and the chromosomal protein high-mobility group B1 (HMGB1) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). These molecules, referred to as "damage-associated molecular patterns" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], can be recognized by a series of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that include TLRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and scavenger receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], but also by other cell surface proteins such as CD40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and CD91 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and the intracellular NOD-like receptors (NLRs) family as well, namely NALP-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Phenotypic alterations and migration of microglial cells following neuronal cell damage have been extensively reported. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating this activation and microglial cell neurotoxicity require further elucidation. Here we address the effects of neuronal necrosis on microglial activation and neurotoxicity. In this paper we report that necrotic neurons, but not other necrotic cell types, can induce in microglia a pro-inflammatory phenotype that in turns causes NMDAR-mediated toxicity of neurons. This activation of and neurotoxic activity by microglia resulting from stimulation by necrotic neurons is shown to be dependent on MyD88, which mediates the up-regulation of glutaminase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6, B10scN (which lack the genomic region containing the <italic>tlr-4 </italic>gene), TLR-2 (C57BL/6) and MyD88 (C57BL/6) deficient mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in our animal facilities in accordance with guidelines from the Animal User and Institutional Ethical Comities of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci&#x000ea;ncia.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary cell cultures</title><sec><title>Microglia</title><p>Neonatal microglia cultures were prepared from newborn mice as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Briefly, after removal of the meninges, brains were mechanically disrupted. Cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbeco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) medium containing Glutamax (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and supplemented with 10% FBS (Endotoxin less than 10 EU/ml, Invitrogen), 5 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich Qu&#x000ed;mica, S.A, Portugal), 2.0 mg/ml L-glucose (Sigma) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin 50 mM (Invitrogen) for 14&#x02013;21 days (na&#x000ef;ve microglia). Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) (GM-CSF-microglia) was added at the beginning of the culture and subsequently every 3 days at a final concentration of 0.25 ng/ml. At day 14, confluent mixed glial cell cultures were shaken for 3 h at 250 rpm. Microglial cells were obtained from the supernatant after filtering through 100-&#x003bc;m cell strainers (BD, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FBS, 50 &#x003bc;M &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (RMPI-FBS). Cells were plated in 6 well plates (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) or 24 well plates (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) for 1 hour. Adherent cells were washed twice with warm Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) to remove cell debris and astrocytes.

Cells were resuspended in PBS (10<sup>7 </sup>cells/ml) and a necrotic-like cell death type was induced by 3 cycles of freeze and thaw or mechanically disrupted using a syringe and needle (0.5 &#x000d7; 16 mm). Cells were immediately added to microglial cells or kept on ice until they were used to minimize protease activity. Loss of cell viability was confirmed using trypan-blue (Sigma) (&#x0003e;95% cell death). To induce apoptosis, cells were UV-irradiated in a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 1 h.

Cells were incubated for 3 hours at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere and migrated cells were collected from the lower chamber. After centrifugation cells were stained with trypan-blue and counted using a hemocytometer (Neubauer chamber) or mixed with 10 &#x003bc;m latex beads (Bechman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and counted by flow cytometry (BD, FACSCalibur&#x02122;)</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Antibodies against CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (HL3), H-2Kb (AF-88.5), CD86 (GL1), CD40 (3/23), CD80 (16-10A1), CD14 (rmC5-3), CD45 (30-F11) and CD24 (M1/69) were purchased from BD Biosciences (BD, Pharmingen&#x02122;). The antibody against Fc&#x003b3;R (2.4G2) was prepared in house from hybridoma culture supernatants.

We investigated the modulation of several cell activation markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] by microglial cells responding to necrotic neuronal HT22 cells, a mouse hippocampal cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], using FACS analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Microglial cells responded to necrotic HT22 cells with a 2&#x02013;6 fold increase in the expression of CD40 and of MHC class II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The alpha chain of the &#x003b1;<sub>M</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin CD11b and the heat-stable antigen CD24 were also increased, albeit to lesser degrees (~2 fold, p &#x0003c; 0.05 and p &#x0003c; 0.001 respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Other molecules such as the co-stimulatory molecules B7.1 and B7.2 and CD11c were not up-regulated whereas CD45 and CD14 were poorly induced by necrotic cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Apoptotic HT22 neuronal cells induced a lower increase in CD40 expression in microglial cells when compared to necrotic HT22 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, right graph). However, some degree of stimulation was detectable with apoptotic HT22 cells, which is probably explained by the high percentage of secondary necrosis which we observed during incubation with microglia (40% after 24 hours) (<italic>data not shown</italic>). Primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGN), but not astrocytes, mimicked the effect of necrotic HT22 cells by inducing CD40 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, left panel) and TNF secretion by microglia (71.5 &#x000b1; 17.6 pg/ml compared to non-detectable values in non-stimulated microglia or microglia incubated with astrocytes). In addition, necrotic cells obtained from mouse EL-4 (lymphoma) or WHEI 164 (fibrosarcoma) cell lines were unable to trigger CD40 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, right panel) or TNF (non-detectable values) in microglia. We further evaluated the pro-inflammatory phenotype of microglia upon stimulation with necrotic neurons. Necrotic neurons induced 11- and 9-fold increases in secretion of IL-12p40 and IL-6, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Production of TNF and of NO, estimated by the nitrite concentration in the supernatant of microglial cell cultures, were significantly increased by necrotic neurons although ~10-fold lower when compared with the levels induced by other stimuli such as IFN-&#x003b3; or LPS (data not shown). IL-1&#x003b2; was not induced in microglia by necrotic neurons (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

These PRR include, but are not restricted to, members of the TLR family. MyD88 is an adapter protein required for signal transduction by TLRs, with the exception of TLR-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We isolated microglial cells from MyD88-deficient mice to assess whether this pathway is involved in signal transduction pathways via which necrotic neurons activate microglial cells. Ablation of MyD88 in microglia cells suppressed microglial activation by necrotic neurons, as assessed by the expression of CD40 or MHC class II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). MyD88-deficient microglia could be activated by IFN&#x003b3; but not by a specific ligand for TLR-2, Pam3CSK4.

We assessed the neurotoxicity of microglia-conditioned medium (MCM), added at final concentration of 20%, obtained from untreated microglia or from microglia activated with necrotic neurons. Although MCM from untreated microglia exhibited some neurotoxicity, probably due to basal activation levels of this cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], neuronal cell death was significantly increased by 21.5% (p &#x0003c; 0.005) when neurons were incubated with MCM from activated microglia (MCM (Nec.), Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The neurotoxicity of MCM was due to the microglial conditioning since exposure of neurons to fresh medium at the same ratio resulted in a lesser, and non-significant, increase in cell death (13.4 &#x000b1; 10.5% of neurons compared to 8.3 &#x000b1; 3.0% in the absence of medium). We next investigated the basis for MCM-induced neurotoxicity. This was neither abolished when MCM was heat inactivated before exposing it to neurons, nor by inhibition of the microglial enzymes iNOS and IDO, which are responsible for the formation of two neurotoxic agents, NO and QA, respectively (data not shown). On the other hand, MCM obtained from microglial cells cultured in glutamine-free medium (- Glutamine) or in the presence of the glutaminase inhibitor, DON (+ DON), showed significantly reduced neurotoxicity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These results suggested that cell death could be mediated by glutamate through NMDAR. To test this hypothesis, MCM from non-stimulated or stimulated microglia were added together with MK-801, an antagonist of NMDAR. In both conditions, the antagonist completely abolished the MCM-induced neurotoxicity, clearly showing that the mechanism of neurotoxicity mediated by microglia is NMDAR-dependent. Altogether these results show that necrotic neurons cause an over-activation of microglia with consequent NMDAR-mediated neurotoxicity, most likely mediated through increased production of glutamate.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Necrotic neurons enhance microglial-induced neurotoxicity mediated by NMDAR</bold>.

Consequently, we investigated whether the enhanced neurotoxicity of stimulated microglia was affected by the absence of MyD88. In contrast to wild type microglia, the increase in neurotoxicity associated with activation of microglia by necrotic neurons was completely abrogated in the absence of MyD88 expression in microglia (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). When primary cerebellar neurons were cultured with 20% MCM from microglia pre-stimulated with necrotic neurons there was a 33% increase in cell death compared to cerebellar neurons cultured with MCM from non-stimulated cultures. In contrast, MCM from MyD88-deficient microglia treated with necrotic neurons did not show any increase in neurotoxicity. Since we have shown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) that neurotoxicity is dependent on glutaminase activity, we analysed the mRNA expression levels of glutaminase and glutamate in supernatants of microglia from both wild type and MyD88-deficient microglia. We observed that the observed increase in neurotoxicity correlated with up-regulation of glutaminase mRNA expression in wild type microglia activated by necrotic neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This increase was not observed in MyD88-deficient microglia, and this explains the inability of these microglia to produce enhanced neurotoxicity upon stimulation with necrotic neurons.

The goal of the present study was to understand the pathways of microglial activation induced by neuronal necrosis, and the effects of such activation on microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. We demonstrate that necrotic neurons induce several markers of microglial activation such as co-stimulatory molecules, MHC class II, pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes and enhanced motility. This activation, which involves a MyD88-dependent signalling pathway, also increases NMDAR-dependent microglial neurotoxicity by up-regulation of glutaminase expression and activity.</p><p>Bacteria-derived products are known to induce neuronal cell death through the activation of the MyD88 pathway in microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Here we demonstrate that "molecular danger patterns" exposed by necrotic neurons also activate microglia and enhance microglial neurotoxicity by a MyD88-dependent pathway. However, in the absence of TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-9 (data not shown) which signal through MyD88, the response of microglia to necrotic neurons is not affected. Either necrotic neurons activate other than those tested, or more than a single TLR are redundantly activated in response to the necrotic stimuli. In the later case, only by blocking a common signaling point, as in MyD88-deficient microglia, would activation of microglia by necrotic neurons be highly compromised as we have observed using assays of CD40 and MHC II expression and IL-6 and IL-12 production (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A mechanism involving activation of NLRs by ligands exposed by necrotic neurons cannot be excluded since these PRRs induce IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 which act through MyD88. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, we did not detect an increase in IL-1&#x003b2; secretion by microglia activated with necrotic neurons.</p><p>Microglia activated with necrotic neurons clearly show a pro-inflammatory phenotype dependent on MyD88. This type of response by microglia may contribute to enhanced neuropathogenesis after necrotic neuronal cell death. Interestingly, it has been shown recently that MyD88-deficient mice, but not TLR4/TLR2-deficient mice, show reduced brain inflammatory responses and decreased lesions after cold-induced cortical injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, pro-inflammatory mediators may have diverse effects after neuronal injury caused by brain ischemia. Whereas inhibition of COX-2 is neuroprotective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines such IL-6 and TNF is ambiguous in this context, with both deleterious and beneficial effects having been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>We have demonstrated that glutaminase expression is regulated by a MyD88-dependent pathway. By bioinformatics analysis using PROMO software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], we have identified three putative DNA-binding sites for the transcription factor Activation Protein-1 (AP-1) at 20 bp, 240 bp and 300 bp upstream of the start codon. Since a MyD88-dependent pathway was shown to activate AP-1, which together with NF-kB controls the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], AP-1 may be one of the putative transcription factors involved in the induction of glutaminase expression. </p><p>It has been reported that HSP60, present in the supernatant of total necrotic CNS cells, activates TLR4 on microglia leading to increased microglial neurotoxicity towards cortical neurons. This effect could be partially but significantly reduced by inhibiting iNOS activity, suggesting that other neurotoxic mechanisms may be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In our study, iNOS was induced in microglia activated by necrotic neurons but NO did not play a significant role in mediating the killing of CGN. This probably reflects different susceptibilities to neurotoxic molecules on the part of different neuronal cell populations. Of the variety of neurotoxic molecules that activated microglia can secrete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we clearly show that glutamate is the sole candidate as the agent that enhances neurotoxicity of CGN through NMDAR in microglia activated with necrotic neurons. These results are in accordance with previously described mechanisms of macrophage/microglial neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Moreover, it has been shown that excessive activation of this receptor contributes to a large number of neurological disorders associated with microglial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrate that necrotic neurons induce a pro-inflammatory and glutaminase-mediated neurotoxic response by microglia. Both mechanisms are dependent on the adapter signalling protein MyD88 and may be highly relevant to increased neuropathology in the context of brain injury. Therefore, the MyD88-dependent pathway and glutaminase activity may constitute potential targets for new pharmacological strategies to control massive neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SC is the Principal Investigator and Head of the laboratory and the group, and conceptualized and initiated the project.
