However, the means by which Sec is synthesized in eukaryotes is not known. Herein, comparative genomics and experimental analyses revealed that the mammalian Sec synthase (SecS) is the previously identified pyridoxal phosphate-containing protein known as the soluble liver antigen. SecS required selenophosphate and <italic>O</italic>-phosphoseryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> as substrates to generate selenocysteyl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup>. Moreover, it was found that Sec was synthesized on the tRNA scaffold from selenide, ATP, and serine using tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup>, seryl-tRNA synthetase, <italic>O-</italic>phosphoseryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> kinase, selenophosphate synthetase, and SecS. By identifying the pathway of Sec biosynthesis in mammals, this study not only functionally characterized SecS but also assigned the function of the <italic>O-</italic>phosphoseryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> kinase. In addition, we found that selenophosphate synthetase 2 could synthesize monoselenophosphate in vitro but selenophosphate synthetase 1 could not.

However, many eukaryotes also have a rare selenium-containing amino acid, selenocysteine, which is the 21st amino acid in the genetic code. Selenium is essential for human health, and its health benefits, including preventing cancer and heart disease and delaying aging, have been attributed to the presence of selenocysteine in protein. How selenocysteine is made in eukaryotes has not been established. To gain insight into its biosynthesis, we used computational analyses to search completely sequenced genomes for proteins that occur exclusively in organisms that utilize selenocysteine. This approach revealed a putative selenocysteine synthase, which had been previously identified as a pyridoxal phosphate&#x02013;containing protein dubbed soluble liver antigen. We were able to characterize the activity of this synthase using selenophosphate and a tRNA aminoacylated with phosphoserine as substrates to generate selenocysteine. Moreover, identification of selenocysteine synthase allowed us to delineate the entire pathway of selenocysteine biosynthesis in mammals. Interestingly, selenocysteine synthase is present only in those archaea and eukaryotes that make selenoproteins, indicating that the newly defined pathway of selenocysteine biosynthesis is active in these domains of life.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Xu XM, Carlson BA, Mix H, Zhang Y, Saira K, et al.

This intermediate serves as the acceptor for activated selenium, and when selenium is donated, selenocysteyl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> is formed.

Selenophosphate is indeed synthesized in mammals by SPS2, whereas the distant homolog of SelD in mammals, SPS1, did not synthesize the active selenium donor.

Twenty-six eukaryotes and three archaea that had these proteins and 24 eukaryotes and 24 archaea that did not were identified.

Each of the searches had known components of Sec insertion machinery as top candidates as well as an additional protein, herein designated as SecS. In mammals, SecS is also known as SLA. SLA was first detected as an autoimmune factor that coimmunoprecipitated tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> from cell extracts in patients with autoimmune chronic hepatitis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050004-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, and it also bound other Sec insertion components &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050004-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050004-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

These observations strongly suggested that SecS may be the missing SecS in eukaryotes and archaea. Based on the multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of SecS and other PLP-dependent proteins, including SelA, SelA-like, and SepCysS, it was clear that bacterial SelA and archaeal SelA-like proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050004-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, on one hand, and SecS, on the other, belonged to completely different families of PLP-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050004-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050004-g002">2</xref>), suggesting that their similar functions arose by convergent evolution.

These data provide further evidence that mSPS1 cannot synthesize SeP from selenide.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>In Vitro Sec Biosynthesis</title><p>Previous studies analyzing Sec biosynthesis did not utilize SeP to assess whether this compound served directly as the active selenium donor.

Our results clearly demonstrate that SPS2 makes the active selenium donor, SeP, for the biosynthesis of Sec.</p><p>We recently identified the gene that phosphorylates seryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> and characterized the gene product, <italic>O-</italic>phosphoseryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050004-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the precise role of <italic>O-</italic>phosphoseryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> was not determined. The current results showed that <italic>O-</italic>phosphoseryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> is the substrate of SecS, and therefore <italic>O-</italic>phosphoseryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> kinase is involved in the Sec biosynthesis pathway.</p><p>What is the intermediate produced by mSecS? Most certainly the dephosphorylated product of <italic>O</italic>-phosphoseryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> cannot be seryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050004-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The intermediate could possibly be aminoacrylyl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> (dehydroalanyl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup>) which could yield pyruvate on hydrolysis. The facts that the intermediate generated by SelA is aminoacrylyl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0007d;Sec</sup> and that mSecS contains pyridoxal phosphate suggest that the Schiff base intermediate of aminoacrylyl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0007d;Sec</sup> postulated for Sec synthesis in prokaryotes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050004-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; is analogous to that formed in eukaryotes. However, it proved possible to trap the proposed aminoacrylyl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> by reduction with KBH4 leading to the formation of alanine on hydrolysis in the prokaryotic, but not eukaryotic, case. This result may be due to differences between the enzyme to which the aminoacrylyl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> is bound; that is, reduction can occur before hydrolysis in the prokaryotic, but not eukaryotic, case.

The mSPS2-Cys reaction was added to 10 &#x003bc;l containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 20 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 &#x003bc;M PLP, 1.0 &#x003bc;g of purified mSecS, and approximately 5 &#x003bc;g (about 30,000 cpm) of either <italic>O</italic>-phospho-&#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;seryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> or &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;seryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> and, in a positive control reaction, SelA in place of mSecS, and in a negative control reaction, thioredoxin (with a His-tag) in place of mSecS. Reactions were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 2 h and then heated at 75 &#x000b0;C for 5 min, aminoacyl-tRNAs were deacylated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050004-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, and 1 &#x003bc;l of an unlabeled amino acid mix (containing 12.5 mM concentration each of serine, <italic>O-</italic>phosphoserine, Sec, and alanine in 50 mM of KBH<sub>4</sub>) was added. Each reaction, along with several control lanes containing unlabeled amino acids and <sup>14</sup>C-pyruvate, was chromatographed on Whatman 3M filter paper (45 &#x000d7; 60 cm) in ethanol/acetic acid/water (12:3:5) for 16 to 20 h. Then 1.0-cm strips were cut out of the dried chromatogram and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The locations of each amino acid were determined by staining the lanes with unlabeled amino acids in 0.3&#x00025; ninhydrin in acetone or by cutting out 1.0-cm strips of lanes with <sup>14</sup>C-pyruvate and counting in a liquid scintillation counter. For direct use of SeP as a selenium donor, reactions contained the same components as above except 1 mM SeP was used in place of mSPS2-Cys reaction solutions and DTT was omitted from the mSecS reactions, since we found that the activity of mSecS is higher without DTT. SeP was generated by hydrolysis of 20 mM chemically synthesized &#x0005b;(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiO&#x0005d;<sub>3</sub>PSe &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050004-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Reactions were incubated and analyzed as above.</p><p>For measurement of the SecS synthesis rate, reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10 &#x003bc;l of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 0.2 mM SeP, and 4 &#x003bc;g (approximately 120 pmol) of <italic>O</italic>-phospho-&#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;seryl-tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup>. Reactions were initiated by adding 2 &#x003bc;g (approximately 35 pmol) of mSecS and were stopped at specific time points between 0 and 80 min by boiling for 2 min and then deacylating and counting as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050004-st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Eukaryotes and Archaea Used in the Computational Searches</title><p>(41 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050004.st001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank</ext-link>) accession numbers for the sequences used in this paper are <named-content content-type="genus-species">Homo sapiens</named-content> (SecS&#x0005f;HS), Q9HD40; <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mus musculus</named-content> (SecS&#x0005f;MM), Q6P6M7; <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> (SecS&#x0005f;DM), NP&#x0005f;649556; <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> (SecS&#x0005f;CE), Q18953; <named-content content-type="genus-species">Methanococcus jannaschii</named-content> (SecS&#x0005f;MJ), Q58027; <named-content content-type="genus-species">Methanopyrus kandleri</named-content> (SecS&#x0005f;MK), Q8TXK0.
