Different types of membrane microdomains (rafts) have been postulated to be present in rear and front of polarized leukocytes and disruption of rafts by cholesterol sequestration prevents leukocyte polarization. Reggie/flotillin-1 and -2 are two highly homologous proteins that are ubiquitously enriched in detergent resistant membranes and are thought to shape membrane microdomains by forming homo- and hetero-oligomers. It was the goal of this study to investigate dynamic membrane microdomain reorganization during neutrophil activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We show now, using immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation, that endogenous flotillin-1 and -2 colocalize and associate in resting spherical and polarized primary neutrophils. Flotillins redistribute very early after chemoattractant stimulation, and form distinct caps in more than 90&#x00025; of the neutrophils. At later time points flotillins accumulate in the uropod of polarized cells. Chemotactic peptide-induced redistribution and capping of flotillins requires integrity and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, but does not involve Rho-kinase dependent signaling related to formation of the uropod. Both flotillin isoforms are involved in the formation of this membrane domain, as uropod location of exogenously expressed flotillins is dramatically enhanced by co-overexpression of tagged flotillin-1 and -2 in differentiated HL-60 cells as compared to cells expressing only one tagged isoform.</p><p>Flotillin-1 and -2 associate with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) in resting and in stimulated neutrophils as shown by colocalization and co-immunoprecipitation. Neutrophils isolated from PSGL-1-deficient mice exhibit flotillin caps to the same extent as cells isolated from wild type animals, implying that PSGL-1 is not required for the formation of the flotillin caps. Finally we show that stimulus-dependent redistribution of other uropod-located proteins, CD43 and ezrin/radixin/moesin, occurs much slower than that of flotillins and PSGL-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These results suggest that flotillin-rich actin-dependent membrane microdomains are importantly involved in neutrophil uropod formation and/or stabilization and organize uropod localization of PSGL-1.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>An adequate innate immune response requires neutrophils to rapidly bind to and transmigrate through endothelial cells, and chemotax through the extracellular matrix toward the source of inflammation.

Activated neutrophils become polarized with a contracted tail (uropod) in the rear and F-actin-rich protrusions at the front and start crawling. Actin and proteins regulating actin polymerization are key players in the establishment of the morphological and functional cell polarity. Actin polymerization and membrane ruffling are the first events leading to establishment of chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophil polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Niggli1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, it has been shown that proteins retrieved in detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) segregate in two opposite &#x0201c;sets&#x0201d; of membrane microdomains, situated at the leading and trailing edges of polarized leukocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Seveau1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Maes1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-GmezMoutn1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Membrane microdomains located in the uropod of neutrophils contain transmembrane adhesion proteins such as P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), L-selectin, CD43 or CD44 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Seveau1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Abbal1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

According to two recent publications, cholesterol-rich microdomains in the plasma membrane are linked to the actin cytoskeleton and depend on it for their existence and activation-induced coalescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Lillemeier1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Chichili1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, proteins residing in membrane microdomains and able to link to the actin cytoskeleton might be important for segregating transmembrane adhesion proteins into the uropod of leukocytes. Indeed, ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins involved in actin-membrane linkage, have also been detected in leukocyte uropod rafts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Viola1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Reggie/flotillin-1 and -2 are two highly homologous proteins whose enrichment in DRMs has been ubiquitously observed.

We show here that endogenous flotillin-1 and -2 interact and upon stimulation with chemotactic peptide rapidly form membrane caps and at later time points accumulate in the uropods of polarized cells in more than 90&#x00025; of primary neutrophils. Both flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 are involved in formation of this membrane domain, as uropod location of exogenously expressed flotillins is dramatically enhanced by co-overexpression of tagged flotillin-1 and -2 in dHL-60 cells as compared to cells expressing only one tagged isoform. Capping of endogenous flotillins in human neutrophils stimulated with chemotactic peptides is sensitive to disruption or stabilization of actin cytoskeleton whereas inhibition of acto-myosin signaling implied in uropod formation has no impact. Additionally, we present evidence showing that, during polarization of human neutrophils, flotillin capping precedes capping of other uropod components such as CD43 and phosphorylated ERM proteins (P-ERM). Finally we show that flotillin capping and redistribution to the uropod matches temporally and spatially that of PSGL-1, and that flotillins interact (directly or indirectly) with PSGL-1 in primary human neutrophils. Using neutrophils isolated from PSGL-1 deficient mice, we show that PSGL-1 is not required for the capping of flotillins. This study suggests novel roles of flotillin isoforms in neutrophil polarization and adhesion protein relocation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>Materials and suppliers: N-formyl-L-norleucyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-norleucyl-L-tyrosyl-L-lysine (fNLPNTL), Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland.

Moreover we report novel interactions of flotillins with the selectin-ligand PSGL-1.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Flotillins cap very early in chemotactic peptide-stimulated neutrophils dependent on actin turnover but independent of myosin contractility</title><p>Our results show that endogenous flotillin-1 and -2 colocalize and interact in resting and stimulated neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), likely forming heteroligomers. Flotillin-1 and -2 in resting neutrophils are evenly distributed along the cell periphery and are organized in small aggregates, in agreement with their raft location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Larger flotillin caps appear only in stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g002">2</xref>). Formation of these caps is a very early event during cell stimulation, occurring 20 to 40 s after addition of stimulus and occurs in more than 90&#x00025; of the primary neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Flotillin caps always form opposite of actin-rich ruffles where later on the uropod is formed. Our results strongly suggest that these caps mark the site of the future uropod. Organization of flotillin in such a locally confined structure suggests a stimulus-induced coalescence of flotillin-containing membrane microdomains into a larger platform. Both flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 are involved in the formation of this macrodomain, as uropod location of exogenously expressed flotillins is dramatically enhanced by co-overexpression of tagged flotillin-1 and -2 in dHL-60 cells as compared to cells expressing only one tagged isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g003">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). These data show that overexpression of both flotillin 1 and 2 is sufficient to induce formation of specific membrane domains in dHL-60 cells. Furthermore our results demonstrate that ectopically expressed flotillins are located in the same place in dHL-60 cells, the uropod, comparable to the location of endogenous flotillins in human neutrophils. dHL-60 cells are thus a good model system for the study of the dynamic behaviour of expressed flotillins during cell migration, even if uropod capping of endogenous flotillins is much less pronounced as compared to human neutrophils. Our findings are in accordance with the results obtained with HeLa cells, where co-overexpression of both flotillins is required for the formation of membrane domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Frick1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Membrane microdomains and clustering-dependent installation of signaling platforms in the plasma membrane are thought to be involved in establishment of leukocyte polarity.

Proteins such as ICAMs, selectins, PSGL-1, CD43 or CD44, which reside in membrane microdomains, are enriched in the uropod, similar to our findings for flotillin. Capping of these proteins is abolished by depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Seveau2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Lorant1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly cholesterol-rich microdomains in lymphocytes are linked to the actin cytoskeleton and depend on it for their integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Lillemeier1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Chichili1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We show now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> that stimulus-dependent capping of flotillins in human neutrophils requires integrity and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Our findings on the actin-dependence of flotillin-1 and -2 reorganization in neutrophils correlates with recent findings, showing the direct association of flotillin-2 with actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Langhorst1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Double-staining for flotillin-2 and actin in stimulated cells shows that, in agreement with actin-dependence of flotillin-raft coalescence, the time course of flotillin reorganization parallels that of actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, actin accumulates in ruffles opposite to flotillin caps within 1 to 2 min of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The merge of actin and flotillin stainings shows clearly that flotillin is not present in actin-rich regions of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Actin polymers can be organized in different ways, forming different pools of F-actin, and different actin antibodies can visualize different actin patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Jockusch1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Phalloidin staining of polarized neutrophils indicates that small amounts of F-actin are also present in the contracted tail of neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Niggli3">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. However TCA fixation of cells that is required for optimal flotillin immunofluorescence does not allow staining of F-actin with phalloidin. Interestingly, according to recent work by Cooper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Cooper1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, the neutrophil uropod contains a subpopulation of F-actin which can be visualized with an F-actin probe that detects a more stable actin population. A possible mechanism of formation of the flotillin platforms in stimulated cells could involve stimulus-dependent rapid establishment of the stable F-actin pool, which segregates into areas that later develop into the uropod. Direct connections of flotillins with this F-actin pool would then power their relocation and capping in the uropod. However such a mechanism would require specific interactions of flotillin with stable F-actin but not with the dynamic F-actin present in the front of the cell. Evidence for such specific interactions is yet lacking.</p><p>We show moreover that Rho-kinase dependent signaling, leading to acto-myosin contraction and uropod formation in stimulated neutrophils, is in contrast not required for chemotactic peptide-induced flotillin capping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), in accordance with the fact that flotillin capping occurs several minutes before the appearance of the uropod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). We cannot exclude that Rho alone, via effectors different from Rho-kinase, might influence flotillin organization. However this is unlikely, as there is to our knowledge no evidence in the literature of Rho signaling acting separately of Rho-kinase in the context of neutrophils polarization and migration. Induction of neutrophil polarization via microtubule disassembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Niggli4">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> also induces flotillin capping which now can be suppressed by Rho-kinase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Thus activation of rear signaling, correlating with formation of the uropod, appears to be sufficient in colchicine-treated cells but is not necessary for flotillin capping in fNLPNTL-stimulated cells. Note that actin assembly is required for flotillin capping both in cells stimulated by fNLPNTL and by microtubule disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Our findings suggests that several parallel redundant pathways may promote formation of flotillin scaffolds in neutrophils.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Selective interaction of flotillin-1 and -2 with PSGL-1</title><p>In lymphocytes, ERM proteins are located in DRMs and associate with actin on one hand and with proteins belonging to membrane microdomains of the uropod on the other hand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Maes1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Viola1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

In neutrophils, P-ERM, CD43, CD44, L-selectin and the selectin-ligand PSLG-1 have all been isolated in DRMs and shown to redistribute to the uropod of polarized cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Seveau1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Abbal1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-AlonsoLebrero1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

Coalescence and capping of flotillins occurs very early in cells not yet fully polarized, whereas formation of caps containing P-ERM and CD43 correlates with that of the uropod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g005">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g009">9</xref>). Moreover, prevention of uropod formation by MLCK inhibition disturbs capping of P-ERM and CD43, but not that of flotillins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0005403-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005403.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of reorganization of flotillins, PSGL-1, P-ERM and CD43 during neutrophil activation.</title><p>Resting cells exhibit randomly dispersed small rafts at the plasma membrane containing flotillins and/or PSGL-1 and/or P-ERM and/or CD43. 20 s after addition of chemotactic stimulus, flotillins and PSGL-1 co-assemble into large caps at the site of the future uropod, whereas P-ERM and CD43 still are randomly distributed at the plasma membrane.

Another explanation would be a transient dissociation of ERM proteins and of CD43 from flotillin-containing membrane domains during the initial phase of neutrophil activation. Indeed, transient dephosphorylation and thus inactivation of ERM has been noted in neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-YoshinagaOhara1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover Gupta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Gupta1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> have provided evidence that transient ezrin inactivation during B-cell activation allows coalescence of small rafts that are tethered to F-actin via ezrin and thus are kept apart in resting cells. Possibly, small flotillin-rich microdomains also are coupled to F-actin via ERM in resting neutrophils. Transient ERM inactivation during chemotactic stimulation may be required for release of these platforms from the cortical actin and formation of large flotillin-rich macrodomains. These macrodomains could then associate directly with the newly formed stable F-actin pool located opposite of the dynamic F-actin in the front. This hypothesis will be tested in future experiments.</p><p>Whereas the time course and the sensitivity to inhibition of myosin activity of CD43 and P-ERM capping do not correlate with those of flotillin redistribution, another raft-resident protein, PSGL-1, colocalizes with flotillins at all times assessed before and after stimulation, forms caps even in the absence of a uropod and co-precipitates with flotillins. Association of PSGL-1 with flotillins is not significantly affected by the activation state of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g006">Figs. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g009">9</xref>). These results strongly suggest that flotillins and PSGL-1 belong to the same membrane microdomains, which undergo coalescence into larger platforms upon stimulation. We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005403-g008">Fig. 8</xref> that the integrity and redistribution of those microdomains do not rely on PSGL-1, as capping and uropod location of flotillins is not affected in PSGL-1 deficient neutrophils.</p><p>PSGL-1-mediated adhesion to selectin on endothelial cells mediates rolling and capture of neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Ma1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Ley1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our data now suggest that flotillin association with PSGL-1 might mediate actin powered relocalization of the latter molecule into the uropod of polarized neutrophils.</p><p>In lymphoid cell lines and HL-60 cells, PSGL-1 has been shown to interact with ERM proteins, and ERMs are responsible for targeting PSGL-1 to the uropod in lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-AlonsoLebrero1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Serrador1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on our findings the mechanisms of targeting of PSGL-1 to the uropod may thus differ in lymphocytes and peripheral blood neutrophils. Interestingly, in agreement with our findings, a recent study on primary murine neutrophils demonstrates that the cytosolic domain of PSGL-1, which mediates ERM interaction, is not required for proper redistribution of PSGL-1 into the uropod of stimulated murine neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005403-Miner1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the light of our results, flotillins could be the raft molecules that relocalize PSGL-1 into the uropod of polarized neutrophils. Our findings do not exclude a later reassociation of ERM proteins with PSGL-1 in the uropod of neutrophils.</p><p>In summary our results demonstrate that flotillin-1 and -2 associate in resting and activated neutrophils. Flotillin clusters reorganize early during chemotactic peptide induced cell activation, later on forming caps at the tip of the uropods of polarized neutrophils. Formation of those caps relies on integrity and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton but does not require Rho-kinase-dependent signaling and myosin II activation leading to uropod formation in chemotactic peptide-stimulated cells. We show that flotillins interact directly or indirectly with PSGL-1, and that redistribution of flotillin and PSGL-1 upon stimulation precedes that of the actin membrane cytoskeleton linker ERM proteins and the uropod protein CD43. Our results suggest that flotillin scaffolds are important structural features of the neutrophil uropod, localizing adhesion molecules such as PSGL-1. The precise protein arrangement in these scaffolds will be addressed in future studies.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank C. Gumy and A. Odermatt for providing cDNA from HEK293 cells, R.
