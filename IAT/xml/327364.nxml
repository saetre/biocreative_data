Within ternary complex with ribosome and tRNAPhe all reagents covalently bind to ribosome the extent of modification being 0.1-0.4 mole/mole 70S. p(Up)n-1UCHRCl alkylates either 30S (n=5,7) or both subunits (n=6,8). rRNA is preferentially modified within 30S subunit. ClRCH2NHpU(pU)6 alkylates both subunits the proteins being mainly modified. The distribution of the label among proteins differ for various reagents. S4, S5, S7, S9, S11, S13, S15, S18 and S21 are found to be alkylated within 30S subunit, proteins L1, L2, L6, L7/L12, L19, L31 and L32 are modified in the 50S subunit. Most proteins modified within 30S subunit are located at the "head" of this subunit and proteins modified within 50S subunit are located at the surface of the contact between this subunit and the "head" of 30S subunit at the model of Stoffler.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0247.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3465"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0248.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3466"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0249.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3467"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0250.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3468"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0251.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3469"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0252.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3470"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0253.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3471"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0254.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3472"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0255.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3473"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0256.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3474"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0257.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3475"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0258.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3476"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0259.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3477"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0260.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3478"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0261.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3479"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0262.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3480"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00407-0263.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3481"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
