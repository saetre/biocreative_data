In addition, the FGF2 IRES is strongly activated under these ischemic conditions associated with hypoxia, whereas cap-dependent translation is repressed by 4E-BP hypophosphorylation.

These data reveal the physiological importance of IRES-dependent translation during hypoxic stress and underline the complexity of the cellular response to hypoxia, suggesting a novel role of FGF2 in the regulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; during the induction of angiogenesis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The establishment of a stable and functional blood vessel network is a complex process requiring several angiogenic factors to stimulate vessel sprouting and remodeling from the primitive vascular network. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is one of the major regulators of blood vessel formation, involved in angiogenesis as well as in arteriogenesis. However the regulation of its expression during these processes remains to be deciphered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Javerzat1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Hypoxia is a major pathophysiological trigger of angiogenesis. In solid tumours, the angiogenic switch responsible for tumour development is induced by hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Pouyssegur1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In cardiovascular diseases, ischemia corresponds to a shortage of the blood supply, resulting in tissue damage because of the lack of oxygen and nutrients. In ischemic conditions, hypoxia generates a process of revascularization involving both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Silvestre1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The response to hypoxic stress generates a transcriptional response mediated by hypoxia-induced factor 1 (HIF-1), whose &#x003b1; subunit is stabilized in the absence of oxygen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Pouyssegur1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, hypoxia also generates the blockade of cellular mRNA translation by impairing the classical cap-dependent mechanism of translation initiation. Translational repression by hypoxia mainly occurs through modulating the activity of two kinases, mTOR and PERK. Inactivation of mTOR results in hypophosphorylation of eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP), which increases their affinity for the cap-binding protein eIF-4E and inhibits cap-dependent translation by sequestering eIF-4E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Richter1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. PERK activation by hypoxia, mediated by the unfolded protein response, is responsible for translation inhibition by phosphorylating the translation initiation factor eIF2-&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Koumenis1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Translation of specific mRNAs during hypoxia thus requires alternative mechanisms, such as translation initiation mediated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs). IRESs are RNA structural elements present in the 5&#x02032; non-translated regions of a small number of mRNAs, allowing translation to occur in conditions of stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Vagner1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Stein1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, IRESs are present in mRNAs coding for several angiogenic factors, as well as in the HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Graber1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. While the transcriptional response to hypoxia is fully documented, little information is presently available, in particular <italic>in vivo</italic>, about the mechanisms regulating IRES-mediated mRNA translation in response to hypoxic stress.</p><p>The regulation of FGF2 expression has been mainly described as post-transcriptional: indeed 90&#x00025; of the FGF2 mRNA, which is transcribed from a single promoter, consists of non-translated or alternatively translated regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Prats1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternative initiation codons allow for expression of several FGF2 isoforms in human as well as in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Sorensen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This process is crucial for the fate of FGF2, as these isoforms have different localizations and functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Touriol1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The small 18 kDa isoforms, initiated at an AUG codon, is responsible for the FGF receptor-mediated auto- paracrine activity of FGF2. The high molecular weight isoforms (22, 22.5, 24 and 34 kDa in human, versus 21&#x02013;22 kDa in mouse), are initiated at in frame, upstream CUG codons, localized in the nucleus and possess intracrine activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Arnaud1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Bikfalvi1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, translation of the FGF2 mRNA is under the control of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Vagner2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The FGF2 IRES is the first cellular IRES to have been studied <italic>in vivo</italic>, with transgenic mice expressing bioluminescent, bicistronic transgenes.

FGF2 protein accumulation was measured in 911 cells treated with a siRNA against FGF2 and submitted to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Under such conditions, FGF2 protein levels progressively decreased and were hardly detectable after 16 h of hypoxia, whereas treatment by the control siRNA led to an accumulation of FGF2. This clearly showed that FGF2 is not stabilized by hypoxia and that protein stabilization can not be responsible for the increase of FGF2 protein levels that culminates at 16 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). These data indicated that FGF2 induction from 7 h to 24 h most probably results from an increase in FGF2 mRNA translation and not through effects on FGF2 protein stabilization.</p><p>To evaluate the level of IRES activity in response to hypoxia, 911 human retinoblasts were stably transfected with the bicistronic construct described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g001">Fig. 1</xref>.

To know whether FGF2 induction was HIF-dependent or not, 911 cells were treated with siRNA against HIF-1&#x003b1; prior to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Strikingly, HIF-1&#x003b1; knock down resulted in FGF2 induction after 3 h of hypoxia, and abrogated the peak of FGF2 induction observed at 16 h in the control siRNA- and mock-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). This experiment suggested that the small amount of HIF-1&#x003b1; expressed at 3 h (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) is able to repress expression of FGF2. Interestingly, 3 h is also the time at which FGF2 mRNA levels increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that an early effect of HIF-1&#x003b1; on FGF2 expression is the translational repression of FGF2 mRNA.

This suggests that FGF2 signaling may act on HIF-1&#x003b1; induction, as shown in recent reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Calvani1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Egger1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to establish whether FGF2 might have an influence on HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation during hypoxia, FGF2 was knocked down in 911 cells by siRNA treatment and protein expression was measured. The results showed that FGF2 knock down generates HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation during early hypoxia, followed by a strong decrease of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein in later stages of hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Thus while the small amount of FGF2 that is present at the 3 h time point is able to prevent HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation, the larger amount of FGF2, which is induced at later times, has a positive effect on HIF accumulation.</p><p>These data revealed a complex crosstalk between FGF2 and HIF-1&#x003b1; during the hypoxic response. FGF2 and HIF seem to regulate each other in two successive feedback loops: in early hypoxia (3 h), FGF2 and HIF-1&#x003b1;, present in small amounts, behave as mutual inhibitors in a negative regulatory loop, whereas in late hypoxia (16 h) they amplify each others expression in a positive regulatory loop.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we demonstrate that FGF2 expression is up-regulated in response to ischemia <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as under hypoxic conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>. Strikingly, this up-regulation does not occur at the mRNA level but at the protein level, revealing new mechanistic aspects of the hypoxic response. Our data show that hypoxia generates a strong increase of FGF2 IRES-mediated translation both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, when cap-dependent translation is blocked. This suggests that FGF2 induction during hypoxia occurs by a translational mechanism, providing an important pathophysiological function to the IRES present in the FGF2 mRNA. In addition, our data reveal that FGF2 interacts with HIF-1&#x003b1; in a very unusual crosstalk, different from the classical angiogenic growth factor induction by HIF-1&#x003b1;. FGF2 and HIF-1&#x003b1; regulate each others expression by a negative feedback loop in early hypoxia, followed by a positive feedback loop in late hypoxia.</p><p>A striking feature of our data is that induction of FGF2 protein is concomitant with a decrease in FGF2 mRNA, <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, FGF2 protein induction <italic>in vitro</italic> correlates with a decrease in mRNA accumulation. This indicates that FGF2, in contrast to classical HIF-1&#x003b1; targets, can be induced by hypoxia without transcriptional activation, despite the putative hypoxia responsive element (HRE) recently characterized in the FGF2 gene promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Black1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This HRE, whose activity has been described in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, is clearly not involved in FGF2 induction in ischemic skin at the time points used in our study. However, in human retinoblasts 911, FGF2 mRNA levels increase during early hypoxia (3 h), then decrease in late hypoxia (7 h to 24 h), suggesting that, in these cells, FGF2 would be subjected to two steps of regulation: transcriptional induction would occur first (where the mRNAs remain translationally silent), and would be followed by FGF2 protein induction concomitant with a decrease in mRNA levels. Thus hypoxia may induce FGF2 by distinct mechanisms, probably depending upon the cell type or tissue.</p><p>An unexpected finding concerns the decrease in FGF2 mRNA levels that accompany the increase in FGF2 protein levels. Such an inverse correlation between FGF2 protein and mRNA levels has been previously reported and might be mediated by an instability element identified within the FGF2 mRNA 3&#x02032;untranslated region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-GarmySusini1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Touriol2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Efficient translation of FGF2 transcripts could activate their degradation. Such an observation questions the numerous studies based on transcriptome analyses, which may lead to a misinterpretation of gene expression levels.</p><p>Our study shows that FGF2 increases at the protein level in response to hypoxia. Such a protein accumulation may be due either to protein stabilization, activation of FGF2 mRNA translation or both. Several previous reports from the literature have reported that FGF2 expression is controlled at the translational level, whereas no information is available about the FGF2 protein degradation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-GonzalezHerrera2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Prats2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. To analyze FGF2 protein accumulation during hypoxia, we used the siRNA knock down approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). These data, showing a disappearance of FGF2 during late hypoxia and in the absence of mRNA translation, allows us to rule out an increase in FGF2 protein stability by hypoxia. Furthermore we show that FGF2 IRES-dependent translation is enhanced under hypoxic conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas 4E-BP hypophophorylation in ischemic skin indicates a repression of cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The inhibition of cap-dependent translation by hypoxia <italic>in vitro</italic> has been previously described in several other reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Gingras2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Thomas1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore our results agree with a previous study showing activation of the FGF2 IRES in a murine ischemic hind leg model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Bornes1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these data indicate that FGF2 is induced in late hypoxia by a translational event most probably involving the IRES. Our study shows that IRES-dependent regulation in a bicistronic mRNA context is much more sensitive to hypoxia <italic>in vivo</italic> than <italic>in vitro</italic>: the IRES activity is up-regulated 40 times in mouse skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), versus only 4 times in hypoxic 911 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). This points out the importance of studying such regulations in pathophysiological situations <italic>in vivo</italic>, and suggest that <italic>in vitro</italic> studies may underestimate the physiological regulation of IRES activity.</p><p>A very amazing result is that expression of the LucR cistron, which is expected to be cap-dependent and to decrease during ischemia, is activated 24 h after surgery, concomitant with IRES-dependent activation of LucF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The decrease of bicistronic mRNA levels under ischemic conditions, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, indicates that such an activation does not result from an induction of mRNA transcription. While one might argue that cap-dependent translation is not repressed under our conditions, there exist numerous reports describing the blockade of cap-dependent translation by stress and we clearly demonstrate that 4E-BP is hypophosphorylated in our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Hypophosphorylated 4E-BP sequesters the cap-binding factor eIF-4E and reflects the repression of cap-dependent translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Gingras1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Gingras2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. One possible explanation for the observed increase in LucR is provided by a recent paper that reports that the IRES in a bicistronic construct stimulates translation of the upstream cistron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Junemann1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The authors conclude that whenever eIF-4F has been captured to a bicistronic mRNA by binding to a picornavirus IRES via its eIF-4G moiety, it can be provided in cis to the 5&#x02032; end of the mRNA and stimulate translation initiation. An IRES-dependent activator effect of the first cistron has also been observed with a cellular IRES in a recent report using C2C12 myoblasts and a bicistronic construct containing the FGF1 IRES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-DellucClavieres1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>However, the model proposed above can only partially explain our data, as functional eIF-4F (the protein complex containing the cap-binding protein eIF-4E) is present in low amounts in our system where eIF-4E is sequestered by 4E-BP. Another hypothesis is based on a hypoxia-dependent formation of stress granules (SGs) that sequester mRNAs in a translationally silenced state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Anderson1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Moeller1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. SGs contain the majority of polyadenylated mRNAs that are subject to stress-induced translational arrest but exclude mRNAs encoding stress-induced proteins. Thus we can hypothesize that mRNAs containing the FGF2 IRES that are induced by hypoxia might be excluded from stress granules. The presence of the IRES would thus generate an active recruitment of the bicistronic mRNA into polysomes and result in active translation of the first cistron. Further investigation will be required in order to resolve this issue. At this time we can only conclude that one must be cautious when calculating IRES activity as the ratio between LucF and LucR activities, as it may in fact be an underestimate of the actual IRES activity.</p><p>The positive amplification feedback between FGF2 and HIF-1&#x003b1; observed during late hypoxia in our study is supported by recent reports. One such study has uncovered the existence of an HIF-1&#x003b1;/FGF2 autocrine loop, which induces an angiogenic response in human endothelial cells (HUVECs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Calvani1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Using FGF2 neutralizing antibodies, the authors show that FGF2 is required for late but not early induction of HIF-1&#x003b1;. This autocrine effect is specific to FGF2, whereas antibodies against VEGF, IGF-1 or PDGF-BB do not influence HIF-1&#x003b1; induction. The same report shows using a HIF-1&#x003b1; siRNA, that HIF-1&#x003b1; is required for hypoxic induction of FGF2 mRNA and for FGF2 protein secretion in HUVEC culture supernatant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Calvani1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Another report has shown that HIF-1&#x003b1; up-regulation by hypoxia in myoblasts requires FGF2 and heparane-sulfate containing low-affinity FGF2 binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Egger1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>More unexpected is the negative feedback uncovered here between FGF2 and HIF-1&#x003b1; during early hypoxia: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g005">Fig. 5B and 5C</xref> clearly show that HIF-1&#x003b1; siRNA up-regulates FGF2 protein whereas FGF2 siRNA up-regulates HIF-1&#x003b1; after 3 h of hypoxia. This negative feedback occurs when both FGF2 and HIF-1&#x003b1; are present in low amounts, suggesting that it could occur beneath a given threshold of the two proteins and that the amplification loop might start when this threshold is exceeded. The consequence of this negative feedback is a delay of the stress response. Interestingly, a previous report revealed that during hypoxia, HIF-1 regulated transcripts are translationally silenced by sequestration into stress granules, resulting in a down-regulation of HIF signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Moeller1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The translational inhibition is relieved later upon reoxygenation, when the cell becomes able to rapidly translate the once-sequestered HIF-1 regulated transcripts, allowing it to recover from the hypoxic shock. In our data, the presence of untranslated FGF2 mRNA after 3 h of hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) could be explained by its sequestration in stress granules. Then IRES activation after 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003078-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) would allow the FGF2 mRNA to be excluded from stress granules, resulting in FGF2 protein expression.</p><p>With respect to the effect of FGF2 on HIF-1&#x003b1; expression, the activator effect has been shown to occur by an autocrine mechanism, implicating an involvement of FGF2 secretion and FGF2 receptor signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003078-Calvani1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.
