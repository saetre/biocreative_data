The exact function for Jak2 in DCs, however, remained poorly understood as Jak2 deficiency leads to embryonic lethality. Here we established Jak2 deficiency in adult <italic>Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>Jak2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice by tamoxifen induction. Loss of Jak2 significantly impaired DC development as manifested by reduced BMDC yield, smaller spleen size and reduced percentage of DCs in total splenocytes. Jak2 was also crucial for the capacity of DCs to mediate innate immune response. <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> DCs were less potent in response to inflammatory stimuli and showed reduced capacity to secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; and IL-12. As a result, <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were defective for the early clearance of <italic>Listeria</italic> after infection. However, their potency to mediate adaptive immune response was not affected. Unlike DCs, <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages showed similar capacity secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting that Jak2 selectively modulates innate immune response in a DC-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were remarkably resistant to lethal dose of LPS-induced septic shock, a deadly sepsis characterized by the excessive innate immune response, and adoptive transfer of normal DCs restored their susceptibility to LPS-induced septic shock. Mechanistic studies revealed that Jak2/SATA5 signaling is pivotal for DC development and maturation, while the capacity for DCs secretion of proinflammatory cytokines is regulated by both Jak2/STAT5 and Jak2/STAT6 signaling.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen presenting cells (APCs) known today <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Wen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

All of these results demonstrate that Jak2/STAT6 signaling regulates the capacity of DCs to secrete cytokines implicated in innate immune response. To our surprise, we failed to detect a significant impact for Jak2/STAT4 signaling on either DC development or cytokine secretion.

However, despite past extensive studies, its exact function in DCs remains controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Nefedova1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Nefedova2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Chiang1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Nefedova3">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The main reason for the discrepant results is that most studies were conducted using Jak2 inhibitors as loss of Jak2 is embryonic lethal, while those inhibitors could non-specifically target other molecules. In this study, we have generated an inducible Jak2 deficient model by crossing <italic>Jak2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with Cre-ERT2 transgenic mice. We first performed studies to examine the implication of Jak2 in DC development. We have demonstrated that loss of Jak2 impairs DC development as manifested by the reduced BMDC yield, smaller spleen size, and reduced percentage of DCs in total splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g001">Figures 1B&#x02013;D</xref>). Other than this recognized role, we further noticed a pivotal role for Jak2 in the regulation of the capacity for DCs to mediate innate immune response. <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> DCs were found to be less potent in response to inflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g001">Figures 1E &#x00026; 1F</xref>), and furthermore, they showed significant reduced capacity to secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; and IL-12 upon LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). As a result, <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were defective for the early clearance of <italic>Listeria</italic> after infection as compared with that of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). However, their potency to mediate adaptive immune response such as the capacity to activate allogenic or antigen specific T cells was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g003">Figures 3A&#x02013;C</xref>). Very interestingly, it appears that Jak2 regulation of innate immune response is DC-dependent as macrophages deficient for Jak2 showed similar capacity secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; and IL-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This discrepancy could be caused by the difference for the STAT activation profile between DCs and macrophages. For example, Jak2 deficiency affected the activation of STAT3, 4, 5 and 6 in DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g005">Figure 5</xref>), while defective activation was only noted for STAT3 and 4 in <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009593.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Together, our data suggest that Jak2 selectively modulates innate immune response which appears to be DC-dependent.</p><p>To further dissect the role of Jak2 in DC-mediated innate immune response, we used septic shock, a typical disorder characterized by the uncontrolled innate immune response, as a model for the study. Septic shock is a severe sepsis due to excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; and IL-12, which then lead to vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, hypotension, multiple organ failure and ultimately shock and death. Unlike septic death resulted from late phase of sepsis, septic shock is manifested by excessive innate immune response such as copious amount of proinflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, Jak2 signaling might be a potential therapeutic target for controlling excessive innate immune response during septic shock. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) is a widely used experimental model for sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Park2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. However, animals die after CLP usually ranging from 24 h to 7 days which implicates both altered innate immune response and maladaptive immune response. Since our focus is to determine Jak2 deficiency in DC-mediated innate immune response, it would be crucial to ultimately exclude the implication of adaptive immune response. As a result, we have chosen lethal dose of LPS-induced septic shock for the study. As expected, 78&#x00025; of control mice died from septic shock within 36 h of lethal dose of LPS challenge, while 85&#x00025; of <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice have survived from the same dose of LPS challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were protected from LPS-induced septic shock. Adoptive transfer studies were then applied to further address that this protective effect is DC-dependent. Since macrophages deficient for Jak2 only showed defective activation for STAT3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009593.s007">Figure S7</xref>), we selected adoptive transfer of DCs for the study, in which 1&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> normal DCs were transferred into irradiated <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. As expected, <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice after adoptive transfer of normal DCs showed restored susceptibility to LPS-induced septic shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These results demonstrate that DCs with reduced capacity for initiation of innate immune response rendered <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice more resistant to LPS-induced septic shock. In consistent with this conclusion, ELISA analysis of serum cytokines revealed significant lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; and IL-12 in <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice after 12 h of nonlethal dose of LPS challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), while the production of IL-10 was similar between <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009593.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>Of note, unlike TNF&#x003b1; and IL-12, we noticed much higher levels of serum IL-2 in <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice after LPS challenge as compared with control mice, although the absolute IL-2 level was relatively low in both strains of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Recent studies demonstrated that microbial stimuli (not proinflammatory cytokines) are able to induce IL-2 secretion by DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Granucci1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Granucci3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, while we failed to detect IL-2 secretion in DCs following LPS stimulation which could be due to the differences of our culture system or lower sensitivity of our detection system. Given the important regulatory role exerted by IL-2 in the immune system, it has been suggested to be tightly regulated by the STAT5-dependent negative feedback signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Villarino1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the reduced <italic>Stat5</italic> activity probably contributes to the observed higher levels of serum IL-2 in <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. Studies have shown that DC-derived IL-2 plays a pivotal role in their capability to prime alloreactive T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Granucci1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Granucci4">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, and therefore, enhanced IL-2 production in <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> DCs probably contributes to their unchanged potency to stimulate allogenic or antigen specific T cell activation as well.</p><p>Given the important role of Jak2 in cell signaling, we anticipate that Jak2 deficiency would affect the activation of multiple signaling pathways of DCs. Unexpectedly, we only detected altered activity for Stat3, 4, 5 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g005">Figure 5</xref>). It seems that loss of Jak2 in DCs has negligible impact on Stat1 and NF&#x003ba;B signaling, which could be due to the compensated effect from other redundant Jak kinases. For example, other than Jak2, Stat1 can be activated by either Jak1 or Tyk2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Leonard1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Using Stat5-Tg mice, we have demonstrated evidence indicating that Jak2/STAT5 is indispensable for DC development and maturation in response to inflammatory stimulation. In opposite to <italic>Jak2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, Stat5-Tg mice displayed higher DC yield, larger spleen size and higher potency in response to LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, Jak2/STAT5 only partly regulates DCs secretion of IL-12, indicating additional signaling pathway(s) that are also implicated in the regulation of DCs secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.</p><p>To examine the possible implication of additional signaling pathway(s), we performed studies in <italic>Stat6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and demonstrated a pivotal role for Jak2/STAT6 signaling in the regulation of cytokine secretion in DCs. We noticed a significant impaired production of TNF&#x003b1; and IL-12 in <italic>Stat6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> DCs following LPS stimulation, although <italic>Stat6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> DCs secreted relatively higher baseline of TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Based on the results for TNF&#x003b1; and IL-12 production, there is no doubt that Jak2/STAT6 signaling regulates the capacity of DCs secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. We further performed similar studies in <italic>Stat4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and DC2.4 cells transfected with a <italic>Stat3</italic> siRNA. Surprisingly, we failed to detect any perceptible impact for STAT3 and STAT4 on the capacity of DCs for cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009593-g006">Figures 6E &#x00026; F</xref>). Given the importance of STAT4 pathway in T cell polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Egwuagu1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Park3">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, Jak2/STAT4 signaling could be implicated in the regulation of DCs to mediate T cell polarization. On the other hand, STAT3 has been recently suggested to be important for DC development and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Coffer1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Park1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, and therefore, Jak2/STAT3 could work together with Jak2/STAT5 signaling to implicate in DC development.</p><p>Extensive studies have been conducted for decades to demonstrate the function of Jak2 in immune cells including DCs by using different Jak2 inhibitors. Results derived from these studies, however, remained controversial, because of non-specificity of each Jak2 inhibitor. To our knowledge, the present report is the first study carried out in adult mice deficient for Jak2. Due to the complexity of Jak2 in the regulation of immune responses, we have limited our current study to APCs, particularly, to DC-mediated innate immune response. The implication of Jak2 in the regulation of adaptive immunity is yet to be determined. We are also aware that Jak2 is essential for the development and functionality of other immune cells such as T and B cells. Future studies focused on demonstrating these questions would shed light to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009593-Sayyah1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated the function of Jak2 in the regulation of DC development, maturation and cytokine secretion. Our data strongly support that Jak2 only selectively regulates the capacity of DCs to initiate innate immune response, while their capacity to stimulate T cell activation is not impacted. As a result, mice deficient for Jak2 show a DC-dependent resistance to lethal dose of LPS-induced septic shock, a deadly disorder caused by the excessive innate immune response. Together, our data suggest that Jak2 could be a unique therapeutic target for the intervention and treatment of clinical septic shock.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Stat4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (<italic>H-2<sup>d</sup></italic>), <italic>Stat6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (<italic>H-2<sup>d</sup></italic>) and BALB/cJ (<italic>H-2<sup>d</sup></italic>) mice were purchased from the Jackson's Laboratory.
