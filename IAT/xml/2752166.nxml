Deficient regulation of basal apoptosis, or its perturbation, can result in impaired development and/or disease states including cancer. In contrast to stress-induced apoptosis the regulation of apoptosis under basal conditions is poorly understood. To address this issue we have compared basal- and stress-induced apoptosis in human epithelial cells of normal and cancerous origins. For this purpose we focussed our study on the opposing pro-apoptotic JNK/anti-apoptotic NF&#x003ba;B pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Combinatorial RNAi plus gene knockout were employed to access and map basal regulatory pathways of apoptosis. Follow-on, in-depth analyses included exogenous expression of phosphorylation mutants and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We demonstrate that basal apoptosis is constitutively suppressed by JNK2 in a range of human cancer cell lines. This effect was not observed in non-cancer cells. Silencing JNK2 by RNAi resulted in JNK1-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells via up-regulation of the AP-1 factor c-Jun. Unexpectedly we discovered that JNK1 and c-Jun promote basal apoptosis in the absence of &#x0201c;activating phosphorylations&#x0201d; typically induced by stress. Hypo-phosphorylated c-Jun accumulated to high levels following JNK2 silencing, auto-regulated its own expression and suppressed expression of Bcl-3, an unusual I&#x003ba;B protein and regulator of NF&#x003ba;B. Basal apoptosis was mediated by components of the TNF&#x003b1; response pathway but was mechanistically distinct from TNF&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our results demonstrate that mechanistically distinct pathways operate to regulate apoptosis in mammalian cells under basal (physiological) versus stress-induced conditions. We also describe a novel apoptotic network which governs the basal survival of cancer cells. Such information is crucial for understanding normal cellular turnover during mammalian development and subsequently throughout life. This information also opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention in human proliferative disease states including cancer.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (MAP kinases, MAPKs) and are activated in response to cellular stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Chang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Jaeschke1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In response to stress JNK1 and JNK2 are activated via dual phosphorylation of T183 and Y185 by MAPK kinases (MAPKK), specifically MKK4 and MKK7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Sabapathy1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Tournier1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. MAPKs and MAPKKs form part of a signal transduction super-family that includes the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and p38 MAPK. The functions of JNK1 and JNK2 are determined by cell type and by the nature of the stress responsible for their activation. Initial studies identified JNKs by their ability to phosphorylate the N-terminus of c-Jun, a member of the activating protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Hibi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequently JNKs were shown to phosphorylate and regulate the activity of other AP-1 proteins as well as additional proteins involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis including p53, c-Myc, Bcl-2 and Bim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Jaeschke1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>AP-1 factors are a group of structurally and functionally related members of the Jun protein family (c-Jun, JunB and JunD) and the Fos protein family (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Hess1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Dimerisation within these family members forms an AP-1 transcription factor and the relative abundance of individual AP-1 subunits and dimer composition are important factors determining cell fate. The repertoire of AP-1 dimer composition allows tailoring of an AP-1-mediated response by individual cell types to a given stimulus. Post-translational modification and protein turnover are two mechanisms for regulating AP-1 activity. For example, in response to stress the transactivation potential of c-Jun is activated by JNK-mediated N-terminal phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Pulverer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Smeal1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas the stability of c-Jun protein is down-regulated via GSK-3-mediated C-terminal phosphorylation which targets c-Jun for ubiquitinylation and degradation via the E3 ligase Fbw7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Wei1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An important activator of the JNK apoptotic pathway is tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;), a pro-inflammatory cytokine that governs cell survival via promoting either cell proliferation or apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Mocellin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. TNF&#x003b1; engages with its trimeric receptor, TNFR1, at the external surface of the cell membrane. TNF&#x003b1;/TNFR1 interaction results in formation of an intracellular heterogeneous protein complex (complex 1) at the cytoplasmic tail of TNFR1. In its turn this complex leads to activation of JNK and also of I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK). Elegant studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> have demonstrated that, in hepatocytes exposed to TNF&#x003b1;, activated JNK1 phosphorylates and activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Chang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Gallagher1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Activated ITCH induces ubiquitinylation and degradation of cFLIP (cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein) which otherwise specifically inhibits activation of pro-caspase 8 (also called FLICE). Caspase 8 activation results in apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Chang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Wei1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This pro-apoptotic pathway is counter-balanced by NF&#x003ba;B which up-regulates c-FLIP expression and thus inhibits pro-caspase 8 activation and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Liu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>NF&#x003ba;B is a transcription factor composed of homo- or heterodimers of members of the Rel family of proteins, including p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50 and p52 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Ghosh1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Transcription activation domains are absent in p50 and p52 which thus need to form heterodimers in order to transactivate target genes. The principal assembly is a heterodimer of p65&#x02013;p50 but different dimer compositions are also formed. NF&#x003ba;B is subject to regulation by protein-protein interactions with I&#x003ba;B proteins. I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2; preferentially target p65&#x02013;p50 heterodimers. Phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B by I&#x003ba;B kinases triggers I&#x003ba;B degradation with release of dimeric NF&#x003ba;B which translocates into the nucleus and regulates gene expression. Bcl-3 is an unusual I&#x003ba;B which preferentially binds p50&#x02013;p50 and p52&#x02013;p52 NF&#x003ba;B homodimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Franzoso1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Wulczyn1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Bcl-3 is further distinguished from other I&#x003ba;B proteins in that it can localise to the nucleus, it is not degraded upon activation of NF&#x003ba;B and it possesses seven, rather than six, ankyrin repeat domains. Nuclear localisation of Bcl-3 is compatible with its ability to form a ternary complex with DNA-bound p50:p50 homodimers of NF&#x003ba;B, and also to assist uptake of p50 into the nucleus (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Michel1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and references therein). Bcl-3 was first described in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Ohno1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and is regarded as a putative oncoprotein.</p><p>In addition to their roles in the stress response JNK1 and JNK2 also function under basal, non-stress conditions as evidenced by tissue-specific abnormalities observed in JNK1&#x02212;/&#x02212; and JNK2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. For example, JNK1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice exhibit decreased T-cell differentiation and defective immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Dong1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the mechanisms of JNK1 and JNK2 functioning under basal, physiological conditions are poorly understood.</p><p>To investigate the individual roles of JNK1 and JNK2 in human epithelial cells under basal conditions we employed a combination of (i) RNAi induced in the absence of applied stress, (ii) gene knock-out cell lines, and (iii) exogenous gene expression. In a range of human cell lines we discovered that JNK1 is actively pro-apoptotic but is constitutively inhibited by the presence of JNK2 in cancer cells. This effect was not observed in non-cancer cells. Co-silencing experiments revealed that these basal, opposing pro- and anti-apoptotic functions of JNK1 and JNK2 are largely independent of up-stream kinases MKK4 and MKK7. This was consistent with lack of discernable change in JNK1 phosphorylation despite JNK1-dependent apoptosis following depletion of JNK2. Further experiments revealed that the basal JNK1 pro-apoptotic pathway involves c-Jun plus components of the TNF&#x003b1;-responsive MAP kinase pathway coupled with the NF&#x003ba;B pathway via c-Jun-mediated down-regulation of Bcl-3. Thus the basal regulation of cancer cell survival appears to be dependent upon the opposing functions of JNK2/Bcl-3 (pro-survival) and JNK1/c-Jun (pro-apoptotic) and to be under constitutive control by JNK2.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Selective knock-down of JNK2 enhances JNK1 expression</title><p>For RNAi we employed synthetic siRNAs under conditions previously demonstrated to give efficient knock-down of target mRNAs without activation of the p53 cellular stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Allison1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Ford1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results indicate that up-regulation of FAS following JNK2 silencing is c-Jun-dependent.</p><p>In contrast Bcl-3 appeared to be down-regulated by c-Jun. Thus, c-Jun silencing resulted in increased Bcl-3 expression whilst JNK2 silencing correlated with Bcl-3 down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g008">Fig. 8C and 8D</xref>). JNK1 silencing also increased Bcl-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g008">Fig. 8F</xref>) consistent with its positive role in basal c-Jun functions. Bcl-3 down-regulation was clearly dependent upon c-Jun since co-silencing c-Jun with JNK2 negated their opposing effects on Bcl-3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g008">Fig. 8C and 8D</xref>). Thus JNK-2 silencing in HCT116 cancer cells causes down-regulation of Bcl-3 expression and this effect is mediated via c-Jun.</p></sec><sec id="s2q"><title>Bcl-3 and c-Jun are pivotal in basal cancer cell survival</title><p>Since Bcl-3 has been implicated in abnormal cell survival we next asked if Bcl-3 is required for the survival of HCT116 cancer cells. RNAi-mediated silencing of Bcl-3 induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g008">Fig. 8E</xref>). This effect could not be rescued by co-silencing c-Jun (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g008">Fig. 8E</xref>), indicating that the pro-survival function of Bcl-3 is down-stream of c-Jun. Our results suggest that the c-Jun pro-apoptotic mechanism operates, at least in part, via c-Jun-dependent down-regulation of Bcl-3. These observations are important and link the basal JNK2-mediated regulation of cancer cell survival with the NF&#x003ba;B pathway and identify c-Jun and Bcl-3 as reciprocal pivotal determinants of apoptosis versus survival respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Basal apoptosis versus stress-induced apoptosis</title><p>The programmed regulation of apoptosis under basal physiological conditions is crucial for normal mammalian development and, in the adult, for normal cellular turnover in individual tissue types. A further level of apoptotic control is induced in response to stress. Indeed, much of our understanding of the regulation of apoptosis in mammalian cells is based upon studies in which cells are analysed following exposure to defined stress conditions. From such studies it is becoming clear that different apoptotic programs are induced by different stimuli and are governed by cell type and physiological context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Reed1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to stress-induced apoptosis, the intrinsic regulation of apoptosis under basal conditions is poorly understood. To address this problem we have investigated cells in the absence of applied stress and explored the regulatory balance governing basal cell survival versus apoptosis.

They also place JNK2 upstream of a novel regulatory network in which apoptosis (i) is driven by co-ordinated pro-apoptotic functions of JNK1 and c-Jun, (ii) is primed under basal conditions, (iii) is constitutively suppressed by JNK2, (iv) is linked with the NF&#x003ba;B survival pathway via Bcl-3/c-Jun, and (v) is mechanistically distinct from stress-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g009">Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). Moreover, the basal pro-apoptotic functions of JNK1 and c-Jun appear active despite the absence of site-specific phosphorylations known to be required for activation in response to stress. Following JNK2 depletion hypo-phosphorylated c-Jun protein translocates to the nucleus where it accumulates in the insoluble fraction and autoregulates its own expression. These changes in c-Jun are dependent upon hypo-phosphorylated JNK1 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0007305-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007305.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Basal survival of human cancer cells involves JNK2 suppression of a novel pro-apoptotic pathway.</title><p>(A) JNK2 constitutively represses JNK1-mediated apoptosis.

However their functional interactions appear to be mechanistically distinct from those induced by stress (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>). This indicates that the regulation of basal cell survival/apoptosis is distinct from stress-induced apoptosis even though the same pro-apoptotic players are employed. It is possible that as yet uncharacterised protein-protein interactions govern basal apoptotic functions of hypo-phosphorylated JNK1, JNK2 and c-Jun. Such interactions may enable the formation of multi-protein complexes and basal apoptotic pathways distinct from those induced by stress.</p><p>Our results also indicate that the basal pro-apoptotic pathway is countered by the I&#x003ba;B protein Bcl-3. Once again JNK2 is the master regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). Mechanistically this is attributable to JNK2-mediated suppression of c-Jun, which we identify as down-regulator of Bcl-3 expression in HCT116 cancer cells. JNK2 depletion results in accumulation of c-Jun protein which, in turn, down-regulates Bcl-3 mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>). Down-regulation of Bcl-3 directly impacts upon cell survival since we also demonstrate that RNAi-mediated depletion of Bcl-3 induces apoptosis despite the continued presence of JNK2 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of Bcl-3 in the basal regulation of cancer cell survival versus apoptosis is particularly interesting, especially since Bcl-3 is already identified as a putative oncoprotein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Ohno1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Pratt1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Rebollo1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Westerheide1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Bcl-3 has an atypical domain structure for an I&#x003ba;B protein. This confers distinct functional properties for Bcl-3. For example, in contrast to I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2;, the nuclear localisation signal on Bcl-3 lies outside the ankyrin repeat domain and enables transport of bound p50:p50 NF&#x003ba;B homodimers into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Michel1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and references therein). Also, the seventh ankyrin repeat of Bcl-3, missing on I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2;, has been identified as a good candidate for interaction with the minor groove of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Michel1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, possibly accounting for Bcl-3 complexing with DNA-bound NF&#x003ba;B homodimers.</p><p>The functional significance of Bcl-3 is unknown. Our discovery that this unusual I&#x003ba;B protein is reciprocally linked with JNK1/c-Jun in the basal regulation of apoptosis raises the possibility that Bcl-3 may function selectively under basal physiological conditions. Thus, during evolution, the functioning of Bcl-3 and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;/I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2; may have diverged to regulate cell survival under basal versus stress-induced conditions respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Cancer versus non-cancer cells</title><p>Comparison of cancer and non-cancer cell lines indicates that the JNK2 requirement for cell survival is restricted to cancer cells (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

In contrast the ARPE19 non-cancer cells were refractory to each of these three conditions. These cancer-related differences may reflect differences in sub-cellular localisations of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins such as c-Jun and Bcl-3 in cancer versus non-cancer cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g008">Fig. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007305.s006">Fig. S5</xref>). Cancer-related differences in spatial proteomic fluxes may also influence the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic effectors under basal conditions.</p><p>Another possibility is that altered metabolism and aerobic glycolysis, characteristic of cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Fantin1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, also impact upon pro- and anti-apoptotic systems.

SIRT1 protein turnover appears subject to JNK2 in human cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Ford1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. As yet the significance of this is unknown.</p><p>Cellular differentiation may also affect the balance of basal pro- and anti-apoptotic networks. For example, normal intestinal epithelial cells presumably become intrinsically primed to undergo basal apoptosis as a part of the normal process of cellular turnover. This process must be under stringent temporal control in order to prevent premature apoptosis on one hand, and to prevent delayed apoptosis and abnormal cellular accumulation on the other hand. On the basis of our current observations we suggest that components of the JNK and NF&#x003ba;B pathways may be exploited and co-ordinated to achieve this effect. We hypothesise that the basal JNK1/c-Jun pro-apoptotic pathway may be held in check by JNK2 until terminal apoptosis is required (represented schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007305-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). We further propose that during earlier stages of differentiation the JNK2/JNK1/c-Jun apoptotic network is non-operational. This would minimise the risk of premature apoptosis and also explain the observed resistance of undifferentiated non-cancer cells (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>) to JNK2 silencing or over-expression of c-Jun. However, at all stages of differentiation the cells are able to respond to stress since they express JNK and NF&#x003ba;B pathways which can be activated by stress-induced kinase signalling.</p><p>According to the above model for intrinsic apoptosis it is predicted that failure to engage the basal JNK1/c-Jun pro-apoptotic mechanism would compromise normal apoptotic turnover and so favour tumour formation. Indeed, this is exactly what is observed in JNK1-/- mice which exhibit pre-disposition to intestinal tumour formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Tong1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Failure to alleviate JNK2-mediated suppression of JNK1/c-Jun would similarly favour tumour formation, and this is supported by our evidence for constitutive JNK2-mediated suppression of JNK1/c-Jun in a range of human colorectal cancer cell lines (this paper).</p><p>In summary, the link between JNK2/JNK1/c-Jun and Bcl-3 identifies pivotal roles for these proteins in the basal regulation of apoptosis versus cell survival. The discovery of a novel apoptotic network governing basal cell survival is crucial for understanding the intrinsic regulation of normal cellular turnover and opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention in human proliferative disease states.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines and transfection</title><p>Epithelial cancer cell lines used include human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 isogenic clones (p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>; Bax<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and Bax<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Jaeschke1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007305-Bunz1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>; LoVo and RKO (wt p53), HT29 (mutant p53); breast carcinoma: MCF7 (wt p53) and osteosarcoma: U2OS (wt p53).
