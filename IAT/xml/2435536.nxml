COPD is defined by the American Thoracic society as a disease process involving progressive chronic airflow obstruction because of chronic bronchitis, emphysema or both[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Both the emphysematous destruction of lung tissue and the enlargement of air spaces along with excessive cough and sputum productions associated with bronchitis are believed to be related to an exaggerated inflammatory response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Indeed the activation and infiltration of inflammatory cells including (CD8+) T lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils is a prominent feature of COPD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition to the chronic state of inflammation observed in the airway patients with COPD are also prone to periods of exacerbation of the disease which are an important cause of the morbidity and mortality found in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. COPD exacerbations are caused by a variety of factors such as viruses, bacteria and common pollutants. COPD exacerbations are now being recognised as important features of the natural history of COPD, as the frequency of exacerbations is associated with the severity of disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Statergies to reduce exacerbation frequency are thus urgently required and depend on an understanding of the inflammatory milieu associated with exacerbation episodes. The precise role of bacteria in COPD exacerbation has been difficult to asses due to approximately 30% of stable state COPD patients having bacterial colonisation within the airways[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The most common organism isolated from COPD patients is <italic>Haemophilus Influenzae </italic>and others include <italic>streptococcus pheumoniae </italic>and <italic>Bramhemella carrarhalis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Bacterial colonisation has been shown to be related to the degree of airflow obstruction and increased exacerbation frequency[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. More recently Stockley and colleagues have shown that COPD exacerbations associated with purulent sputum are more likely to produce positive bacterial cultures than exacerbations where the sputum was mucoid[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Additionally Sethi and collegues have shown that exacerbations associated with H. <italic>influenza </italic>and B. <italic>catarrhalis </italic>both gram negative bacteria are associated with significantly higher levels of inflammatory markers compared to pathogen-negative exacerbations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Wedzicha and colleagues have shown that stable state COPD patients with high sputum levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and CXCL8 have more numerous exacerbations, suggesting that the frequency of exacerbations is associated with increased airway inflammation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Cytokines such as IL-6 and CXCL8 are rarely produced individually instead they are more usually released in combination with other cytokines and mediators that are characteristic of a particular disease state. These cytokine networks exhibit great pleiotropy and redundancy to the effect that any one cytokine may be influenced by another released simultaneously. TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; have been identified as key cytokines that are able to initiate inflammatory cascades during exacerbations of chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and severe asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although it is presumed that COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway inflammation, as in patients with asthma, there is little information on the nature of the inflammatory mediator milieu during an exacerbation, especially when studied from the onset of symptoms.</p><p>In this study we aimed to assess the kinetics of key pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines released from lung parenchymal explants obtained from COPD patients, using an <italic>ex vivo </italic>model of Gram negative Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced acute inflammation. We found that COPD disease severity was associated with an enhanced <italic>ex vivo </italic>pro-inflammatory cytokine response led by TNF&#x003b1; which was not ameliorated by the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics for human lung tissue experiments</title><p>Human parenchymal lung tissue was obtained from 37 patients (15F/21M) undergoing resection for carcinoma and 1 male undergoing surgery to remove a cyst at Guy's Hospital, London. All specimens of parenchymal tissue were obtained from sites distant from the tumour. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and all volunteers gave informed consent. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) uses a four step classification for the severity of COPD based on measurements of airflow limitation during forced expiration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Each stage is determined by the volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and by the ratio of FEV<sub>1 </sub>to the forced vital capacity (FVC); lower stages indicate less severe disease. Using the GOLD guidelines our patient cohort was stratified into the following groups, GOLD I (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c; 70%, FEV<sub>1 </sub>&#x02265; 80% predicted), GOLD II (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c; 70%, 50% &#x02264; FEV<sub>1 </sub>&#x0003c; 80% predicted) and individuals with normal lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003e; 70%, FEV<sub>1 </sub>&#x02265; 90% predicted)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Briefly, resected lung tissue was dissected free of tumour, large airways, pleura and visible blood vessels and finely chopped using dissecting scissors, into 2 mm<sup>3 </sup>fragments during several washes with Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% sodium bicarbonate. Six explants (total weight approx. 30 mg) were incubated per well (2.0 cm<sup>2</sup>) of a 24 well plate with RPMI-1640 medium containing 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, and 1% gentamycin at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% carbon dioxide/air for 16 hours. Tissue was then either stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) or maintained in cell culture media alone for 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, or 48 hours. For neutralisation of TNF&#x003b1; and IL-10 bioactivity, tissue was incubated with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of neutralising TNF&#x003b1; or IL-10 antibody or an isotype control (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) for 1 hr prior to stimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS. Lung tissue fragments and supernatant were harvested at each time point and both were stored at -80&#x000b0;C until analysis. The tissue fragments were weighed to determine total tissue weight to normalize the levels of released cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry of human lung tissue</title><p>For the last 18 individuals recruited in the study the lung explants collected (6 per experimental condition) were embedded in glycol methacrylate (GMA), following stimulation with LPS or cell culture media alone for 1 or 6 hrs, as described above.

All sections stained positively for varying amounts of neutrophil elastase, CD68 and mast cell tryptase.

We demonstrate that lung explants obtained from COPD patients classified with mild to moderate airflow obstruction (GOLD I and II) release elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6 and CXCL8 in response to LPS but failed to mount an appropriate anti-inflammatory IL-10 response when compared to normal lung tissue. We suggest that these findings may have important clinical implications for the pathogenesis of COPD as dysregulated resolution of inflammation by IL-10 could account for the exaggerated inflammation observed in COPD patients during episodes of exacerbation.</p><p>The association between bacterial colonization and the development and progression of airway inflammation in COPD has been a subject of study for several years[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Although bacteria such as H. <italic>influenzae </italic>have been associated with COPD exacerbation, early studies have provided conflicting results as to its isolation during exacerbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Later evidence for the role of bacteria in COPD exacerbations has come from antibiotic therapy studies. Hill and colleagues in a large COPD study showed that the airway bacterial load was related to inflammatory markers and that the bacterial species present was related to the degree of inflammation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although the subsequent inflammatory response following a bacterial infection is considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of COPD, the nature and sequence of the cytokine networks involved in an exacerbation have remained unexplored. The majority of clinical studies have previously concentrated on examining the acute inflammatory response during exacerbations of COPD patients using induced sputum and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. To our knowledge this is the first study to compare explants from patients with characterised COPD and individuals with normal lung function to investigate the kinetics of the acute inflammatory cytokine response within the distal lung towards LPS, a bacterial wall component. LPS is a widely used stimulus that acts on a number of cells within the lung through well-defined signalling cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Within the literature the typical dose of LPS used in cell culture experiments and rodent models of airways disease is 1 &#x003bc;g/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We carried out dose response curves for LPS on the tissue and deliberately chose a sub-maximal concentration of LPS 0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml in order to explore cytokine release and interactions on a number of cells within the lung explants.</p><p>In our model of acute inflammation in human lung tissue we found that TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6 and CXCL8 were released following stimulation with LPS. This model using LPS mimics the cytokine profile previously reported by several groups in COPD patients with bacterial infections. In particular Solar and colleagues showed that the presence of potentially pathogenic organisms in the bronchoaleolar lavage from COPD patients was associated with a greater degree of neutrophillia and higher TNF&#x003b1; levels[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Indeed several studies have confirmed that higher bacterial load is associated with greater airway inflammation measured by elevated TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6 and CXCL8 in BAL fluid from COPD patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Additionally several exacerbation studies have reported elevated levels of TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6 and CXCL8 in induced sputum from COPD patients admitted to hospital following an exacerbation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Although bacterial load was not assessed in these exacerbation studies the cytokines reported, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6 and CXCL8 are the same cytokines that we observe in our acute inflammatory model using LPS. The advantage of this model over <italic>in vivo </italic>studies is that we have been able to determine the kinetic profile of release of the cytokines most reportedly elevated in COPD patients during exacerbations.</p><p>Classification of the patients in our study using the GOLD guidelines for COPD diagnosis allowed us to segregate patients into those with normal lung function and those with mild (GOLD I) and moderate (GOLD II) COPD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Using this approach, we found that lung explants from patients with GOLD I and II status had an elevated TNF&#x003b1; and subsequent IL-6 and CXCL8 response compared to explants obtained from patients with normal lung function. Our data therefore suggests that the parenchyma tissue of an individual with COPD would respond with an enhanced inflammatory response following exposure to LPS. The relationship between the magnitude of the inflammatory response and disease severity in our study may therefore have important clinical implications. Recent findings indicate that some patients with COPD develop frequent exacerbations, and recurrent exacerbations may be associated with increased airway inflammation. Indeed Bhowmik <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported that COPD patients with elevated concentrations of IL-6 and CXCL8 in sputum were more likely to have frequent exacerbations, which is thought to lead to the rapid decline of lung function in these patients. In support of these findings other studies have also demonstrated a negative correlation between FEV<sub>1 </sub>and the levels of TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6 and CXCL8 in sputum[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and BAL fluid[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These <italic>in vivo </italic>studies therefore provide biological significance to our findings that release of TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6 and CXCL8 from explants <italic>in vitro </italic>negatively correlates with patients lung function. Altogether the data suggests that the heightened inflammatory response in both our model and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies of exacerbations may lead to the accelerated decline in lung function observed in COPD patients and therefore has prognostic importance for the disease. In support of these finding Donaldson and colleagues have previous reported that exacerbations in moderate to severe COPD patients contribute a greater extent to the accelerated decline in FEV<sub>1 </sub>per year observed in these patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In addition to the role of exacerbations in COPD progression the work of Hurst and colleagues has recently raised important awareness to the impact exacerbations have on systemic inflammation as they have shown that the degree of systemic inflammation observed in COPD patients is related to the extent of lower airway inflammation during exacerbation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These data bring focus to the accumulating evidence of extra pulmonary manifestations in COPD including cachexia and systemic inflammation which are observed in severe COPD patients. In our model of acute inflammation we observed with disease severity elevated release of cytokines such as IL-6 which could act systemically on the liver to promote fibrinogen production. As raised levels of plasma fibrinogen is a independent risk factor of for cardiovascular disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Future studies using whole animal models would therefore be useful to determine the role exacerbation derived inflammatory mediators play in systemic inflammation</p><p>In our study TNF&#x003b1; was the initial and predictive cytokine released in the cascade following LPS exposure. Given the heterogeneity of lung tissue obtained it was of interest to characterize which cells were responsible for the TNF&#x003b1; release in our model. Applying immunohistochemistry to GMA sections, we found that macrophages and mast cells accounted for the majority of TNF&#x003b1; positive cells following LPS exposure. This finding is supported by previous data showing that endotoxins of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria stimulate TNF&#x003b1; release from both these cell types[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although we observed a 0.92 fold increase in the number and distribution of TNF&#x003b1; positive cells between GOLD I/II patients and controls this difference did not reach statistical significance. An extensive small airway study by Hogg et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] has previously reported that the percentage of airways positive for macrophages and neutrophils is elevated in the moderate to severe stages of COPD. It is difficult to compare our observations due to the differences in atomical location of the tissue analysed, small airways verses parenchyma and the methodologies used and additonally mast cells were not analysed in the Hogg <italic>et al </italic>study. Our investigations have only been able to focus on a narrow window of the disease spectrum due to the nature of patients undergoing surgery and therefore we are unable to include GOLD III and IV patients. Therefore it is difficult to determine if the increase in the numbers of macrophages with increasing COPD severity is responsible for the elevated levels of TNF&#x003b1; observed or that macrophages and mast cells in COPD patients have an exaggerated TNF&#x003b1; response due to pre-sensitisation. Indeed it has been shown that pre-sensitisation with LPS promotes an exaggerated Th<sub>1 </sub>cytokine response in mouse models of allergic asthma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Future studies are therefore required to determine if pre-sensitisation of lung tissue to bacterial agents is related to the degree of inflammation observed in COPD patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>If TNF&#x003b1; is a key cytokine in acute airway inflammation then neutralising its biological activity could provide an important therapeutic treatment if given early enough after a COPD exacerbation. Indeed, in our model inhibition of TNF&#x003b1; activity prevented the release of IL-6, CXCL8 and IL-10 following LPS exposure. Blockade of TNF&#x003b1; activity using monoclonal antibodies or the soluble TNF&#x003b1; receptor has been used as an effective therapy in rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and severe asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However published reports of two clinical trials which examined the effects of the chimeric monoclonal TNF&#x003b1; antibody infliximab (Remicade) in COPD patients found no improvement in symptoms, lung function or reduction of inflammation in induced sputum[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The failure of anti-TNF&#x003b1; therapies may reflect the fact that COPD is a highly complex inflammatory disease in which many mediators are involved. However, the substantial increase in TNF&#x003b1; production following LPS exposure in our model and <italic>in vivo </italic>exacerbation studies suggests that the role of TNF&#x003b1; may be more predominant in acute inflammatory episodes rather than in the chronic disease process. Therefore future studies maybe better focused on the roles of anti-TNF therapies in preventing or modifying the severity of acute exacerbations.</p><p>Several studies have shown that IL-10 acts as a classical negative feedback inhibitor on TNF&#x003b1; release from macrophages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In support of this mechanism of action, we report that neutralization of IL-10 activity significantly augmented LPS stimulated TNF&#x003b1; release from lung explants. Release of IL-6 and CXCL8 were also shown to be augmented following IL-10 inhibition, although this was likely a direct result of the increased levels of TNF&#x003b1;. We also show that IL-10 release was completely abolished by neutralisation of the initial cytokine in the cascade, TNF&#x003b1;. This supports a role for a delicate cytokine balance between pro-inflammatory TNF&#x003b1; and anti-inflammatory IL-10 in both resolution of inflammation and normal homeostasis of the lung. Our finding that lung tissue from GOLD I and GOLD II COPD patients releases decreased levels of IL-10 in LPS derived acute inflammation compared to patients with normal lung function has potential important pathophysiologic relevance. In support of our finding Takanashi et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] have also reported evidence of IL-10 disregulation in COPD as they demonstrated that the level of IL-10 in sputum from COPD patients is decreased in comparison with healthy non-smokers. As decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory mediator IL-10 could lead to the enhanced TNF&#x003b1; released observed in the COPD explants in this study. This raises important questions as to the balance of pro and anti-inflammatory mediators released within the lung during exacerbations and their cause or effect relationship to the inflammatory profile observed in COPD. One possible mechanism for altered IL-10 gene expression could be single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within the gene. To date no consensus has been reached regarding any IL-10 SNP in the progression of COPD. Alternatively IL-10 gene expression could be altered epigenetically due to environmental insults such as cigarette smoke or the oxidants released in response to smoke exposure. Future studies will hopefully provide more information as to the mechanisms and outcomes involved in these modifications and their role in disease progression. As therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing the inflammatory cascade in COPD are currently focused on pro-inflammatory mediators, anti-inflammatory interventions could therefore be equally if not more important. Since IL-10 is able to ameliorate the release of TNF&#x003b1; in acute inflammation, therapeutic strategies which enhance the endogenous release or activity of IL-10 could be used to dampen TNF&#x003b1; responses without compromising the immune system, providing important targets as new therapeutic strategies for a major clinical unmet need.</p><p>Due to the nature of COPD exacerbations it is technically difficult to investigate the kinetics of acute inflammatory events within the lung following admission of patients to hospital. In this <italic>ex vivo </italic>lung explant model, we have been able to interrogate further the acute inflammatory profile in terms of the tissue's response to LPS. The use of lung explants has several advantages over isolated cell cultures, including preservation of normal tissue architecture and cellular interactions. In addition, explants can be manipulated to dissect the role of various resident cells and specific cytokines they release using neutralizing antibodies. Using this model we have been able to clarify the intrinsic response of resident cells within the lung tissue following LPS exposure and eliminate the contribution of cytokine release from circulating cells. Therefore the model also has some disadvantages as it does not entirely mimic the <italic>in vivo </italic>situation as we have not studied the role of recruited inflammatory cells following LPS exposure. Another disadvantage is the fact that lung explants are extremely heterogenous between individuals especially COPD patients, and we have tried to account for this by selecting 6 explants randomly per experimental condition. Additionally all of the explants used were dissected free of small airways and therefore the model does not represent the contribution of small airways following LPS exposure. Other causes of COPD exacerbations include viruses and common pollutants; the role of bacterial-viral or bacterial-pollutant interactions may exist and have not been investigated in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we report on a reliable <italic>ex vitro </italic>model for the investigation of acute lung inflammation and its resolution using lung parenchymal explants from COPD patients. Using this model, we propose that differences in the production of both TNF&#x003b1; and IL-10 in COPD lung tissue following exposure to bacterial endotoxin LPS may have important biological implications for both episodes of exacerbation, disease progression and amelioration. Thus further work is required to determine the role of bacterial colonization, exacerbations and airway inflammation in the pathogenesis of COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Professor ST Holgate has received research funding from Celltech, Wyeth and Centercor in relation to the potential role of TNFa in severe asthma and has consulted with these 3 companies and UCB over the clinical trials of anti-TNF therapy in asthma</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TLH carried out the tissue culture studies, immunoassays, immunohistochemistry, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript, RH participated with the immmunohistochemistry, STH participated in the design of the study and helped draft the manuscript, JAW conceived of the study, participated in its design, coordination and helped draft the manuscript.
