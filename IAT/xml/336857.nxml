The entire sequence is 4276 nucleotides long. Four cistrons have been identified by comparison with the related Group III phage Q beta. The maturation protein contains 449 amino acids, the coat protein contains 131 amino acids, the read-through protein contains 330 amino acids and the replicase beta-subunit contains 575 amino acids. SP is 59 nucleotides longer than Q beta. We have analyzed both sequence and structural conservation between SP and Q beta and shown that the sequences for the coat and central region of the replicase are strongly conserved between the two genomes. We also show that the S and M replicase binding sites of Q beta are strongly conserved in SP. Interestingly, the base composition of SP and Q beta differ significantly from one another, and most of the differences can be accounted for by a strong preponderance of U in the third position of each codon of Q beta relative to SP. We also compare conserved hairpins associated with potential coat protein and replicase binding sites.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0492.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6205"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0493.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6206"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0494.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6207"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0495.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6208"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0496.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6209"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0497.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6210"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0498.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6211"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0499.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6212"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0500.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6213"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0501.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6214"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0502.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6215"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0503.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6216"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0504.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6217"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0505.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6218"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0506.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6219"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0507.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6220"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0508.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6221"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
