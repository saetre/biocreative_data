We generated DLC2-deficient mice to investigate the tumor suppressor role of DLC2 in hepatocarcinogenesis and the function of DLC2 in vivo. In this study, we found that, unlike homologous DLC1, which is essential for embryonic development, DLC2 was dispensable for embryonic development and DLC2-deficient mice could survive to adulthood. We also did not observe a higher incidence of liver tumor formation or diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in DLC2-deficient mice. However, we observed that DLC2-deficient mice were smaller and had less adipose tissue than the wild type mice. These phenotypes were not due to reduction of cell size or defect in adipogenesis, as observed in the 190B RhoGAP-deficient mouse model. Together, these results suggest that deficiency in DLC2 alone does not enhance hepatocarcinogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy and is one of the most common cancers in Asia and Africa.

As suggested by Durkin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Durkin1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, this might also be due to the primary malfunction of other organs such as the developing heart. Our group recently showed that DLC1 negatively regulated the Rho/ROCK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Wong2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, a relatively high level of ROCK expression was previously observed in the developing hearts of embryos, 7.0&#x02013;9.0 dpc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Wei1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and 9.5&#x02013;11.5 dpc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Zhao1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that DLC1 deficiency may disturb the normal function of ROCK proteins in the embryonic heart and lead to embryonic lethality. Nevertheless, the observed phenotypes suggest that DLC1 has a critical role during early murine development.</p><p>In this study, we showed that DLC2 deficiency did not cause any observable developmental defects, and DLC2-deficient mice could survive to adulthood. This suggests that the functions of DLC2 in embryonic development may be compensated by its homolog, DLC1, but not vice versa. It is common that paralogous genes compensate the functions of the members of the group. For example, the members of mouse Hox paralogous group 3, Hoxa3, Hoxb3 and Hoxd3, interact synergistically to regulate embryonic development in a dose-dependant manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Manley1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Manley2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Although DLC2 deficiency did not lead to embryonic lethality, DLC2-deficient mice were smaller and had less adipose tissue. Since it was demonstrated that the fibroblasts derived from 190B RhoGAP-deficient embryos were smaller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Sordella1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and were less effective in adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Sordella2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, we examined the DLC2-deficient mice along these lines.

In this regard, we could not exclude the possibility that the metabolic cage experiment might not be sensitive enough to detect the small difference in the amount of food intake which may cause the observed phenotype in body weight.

One of our primary aims in generating the DLC2-deficient mice was to investigate the tumor suppressor role of DLC2 in vivo. We found that DLC2 deficiency did not predispose to the formation of HCC nor aggravate DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Again, the tumor suppressor function of DLC2 function may be compensated by DLC1. Since DLC1-deficient mice dies at embryonic stage, it would be interesting to see if hepatocyte-specific deficiency of DLC1 may predispose such mice to the development of HCC and to delineate the role of DLC2 deficiency in the development of HCC in these mice. It was demonstrated that loss of p53 would accelerate hepatocarcinogenesis in transgenic mice overexpressing c-myc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Klocke1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. It would be informative to cross DLC2-deficient mice with other knockout mice of tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 and/or transgenic mice overexpressing oncogenes such as c-myc and TGF-alpha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-SantoniRugiu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, the newly developed system by Zender et al. could be exploited to study the tumor suppressor role of DLC2 in hepatocarcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Zender1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In that system, p53-deficient liver progenitor cells could be infected with a combination of ecotropic retroviruses carrying c-myc, RAS, AKT and DLC2. This will enable us to further investigate whether DLC2 has tumor suppressor function in vivo.</p><p>DLC2 belongs to a member of DLC family proteins. It encodes a RhoGAP domain with high sequence homology with DLC family members, DLC1 and DLC3. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that DLC2 or DLC1 was able to inhibit the RhoA activity which resulted in down regulation of actin stress fiber formation. Furthermore, study from Kawai et al indicated that DLC3 could also inhibit the RhoA activity by its RhoGAP domain. Ectopic expression of DLC3 in HeLa cells decreased the numbers of actin stress fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Kawai1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The results suggest that the functional roles of DLC1, DLC2 and DLC3 in cell lines and their downstream effectors are quite similar. In the mouse model, DLC1 depletion was embryonic lethal while our DLC2 knockout mice could survive to adulthood. This suggests that the functions of DLC2 in embryonic development may be compensated by DLC1 or DLC3. However, from our semi-quantitative RT-PCR result, there was no significant increase of either DLC1 or DLC3 in the livers, hearts and skeletal muscles of the DLC2 knockout mice. The result implies that the physiological level of DLC1 or DLC3 expression may be sufficient for the compensation of DLC2 functions. It will be interesting to generate DLC3 knockout mice to study its significance in embryonic development and examine whether its function can be compensated by other DLC members. In addition, the knockout mice data indicate that the DLC members might play different physiological roles in development. Apart from the common downstream effector (RhoA), there might be other different molecular targets being specifically regulated by a particular DLC member.</p><p>Apart from studying the tumor suppressor role of DLC2 in HCC, the DLC2-deficient mice may be useful for studying other cancer types, as downregulation of DLC2 was also observed in lung, ovarian, renal, breast, uterine, gastric, colon and rectal cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006566-Ullmannova1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006566.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Expression level of DLC1 and DLC3 in DLC2&#x02212;/&#x02212; and DLC2&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; mice.
