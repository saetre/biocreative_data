Expressed in most tissues and cells lines, ILK is unexpectedly restricted to the equatorial LEC and differentiated fiber cells of the mouse lens. The occurrence of ILK expression with LEC differentiation is consistent with the positive regulatory function of ILK, which is revealed in a model of EMT in vitro. This is the first study to show the expression of ILK in the lens and its unique distribution pattern within cultured lens epithelia.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a serine-threonine kinase that binds to the cytoplasmic tails of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>- and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-integrins (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]). It acts as an intermediate signaling protein during apoptosis/stress induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>], proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], and cellular interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. ILK has been shown to act downstream and independently of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway to phosphorylate target proteins such as &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>/&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-integrins, protein kinase B (Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; (GSK-3&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Although significant publications have appeared describing the role of ILK in many tissues, in cancer biology (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]), and in several developmental systems, few studies have been conducted in the mammalian eye. It has been speculated that ILK is important in the lens because the motility, differentiation, ECM interaction, and survival of lens epithelia are required for lens development and function. It has also been suggested that, subsequent to cataract surgery, ILK could play a role in the requisite epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) of LEC, which contributes to the development of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Consistent with this proposal, ILK has been identified as a regulator of EMT progression in several epithelia, e.g., renal and ovarian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p><p>The majority of work on ILK has been performed with several commercially-available antibodies; the most commonly-used reagents are a mouse monoclonal antibody and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Upstate Signaling, Lake Placid, NY). These antibodies appear to recognize alternate forms of ILK of 50 kDa and 60 kDa on immunoblots of cellular lysates. Despite these differences, the polyclonal antibody has been used for immunoprecipitation and subsequent ILK activity assays in the majority of recent studies. Neither of the antibodies has been used to show localization of ILK by staining of lens tissue.</p><p>To characterize ILK within the lens and its role in LEC EMT, we developed an affinity-purified, polyclonal antibody which recognizes both human and murine ILK by immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and immunoblotting. With this antibody (R3B1) we determined the expression levels and localization of ILK within the murine lens. Furthermore, using ILK-targeting short interfering RNA (siRNA), we have shown that ILK is an important factor in the EMT of murine LEC, grown from lens explants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, and were carried out with the written permission of the relevant local institutional authorities.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>For immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and staining procedures, the following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-&#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), monoclonal anti-ILK (Upstate), rabbit polyclonal anti-ILK (Upstate), mouse anti-VLA-5 (&#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>) integrin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), hamster anti-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), goat anti-early endosome-associated protein 1 (EEA1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-cellular fibronectin (Sigma), and monoclonal anti-phospho-myelin basic protein (MBP, HRP-conjugate; Upstate).</p></sec><sec><title>Production and affinity-purification of polyclonal anti-ILK antibodies</title><p>Rabbits were injected with the intact 50 kDa recombinant human (rh) ILK protein which was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21-Rosetta strain (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified in our laboratory.

To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we grew primary cultures from explanted mouse lenses in culture for various times and subsequently immunoblotted lysates for ILK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>; ILK) or &#x003b1;-SMA, a marker for EMT in LEC (SMA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). As the cells adapted to culture conditions over time, indicated by increased &#x003b1;-SMA production, their levels of ILK increased significantly.

In animal models ILK has been shown to have important activities in tumor growth/progression, angiogenesis, and tissue differentiation. However, little is known about the function of ILK in the mammalian eye, specifically in the lens. The specialized functions required of the lens epithelial layer for lens maturation and continued transparency make subsets of these cells prime candidates for the expression of ILK. In addition, LEC plays an important role in the potential development of PCO after cataract surgery, a process entailing EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. For these reasons we explored the expression and role of ILK in the mouse lens and during EMT of lens cells in vitro. It was first necessary, however, to produce and characterize a new anti-ILK antibody.</p><p>Previous studies on ILK have been performed with commercially-available reagents that have varied reactivity against ILK and identify proteins with different molecular masses (or possibly, different proteins). Production of an affinity-purified, polyclonal antibody against rhILK (R3B1) proved an effective solution to the variability of available reagents. R3B1 IgG performed reproducibly for immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunohisto/cytochemistry under different protocols of fixation and staining. The purified antibody recognized a band on SDS-PAGE of 50 kDa after reduction and was reactive in ELISA with sensitivity similar to that of the available monoclonal reagent. Staining with the antibody showed specific reactivity in tissue and cells that could be competed by pre-incubation of the antibody with rhILK. Results from immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry with R3B1 have been comparable to those with the monoclonal antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. However, the monoclonal antibody has not been verified for immunoprecipitation of ILK. We therefore demonstrate the purification of a polyclonal anti-ILK antibody with the specificity and reactivity of a commercially-available monoclonal antibody. The polyclonal R3B1 was effective in immunoprecipitation, immunostaining, and in vitro kinase assays.</p><p>While the presence of ILK in the mouse lens was expected, expression was surprisingly localized to the differentiating LEC of the equatorial region and to fiber cells, with little to no expression in the anterior LEC layer. These data were confirmed by immunoblot of dissected lens fractions. Results from RT-PCR were also consistent with data derived from immunoblots, which illustrated the low levels of ILK mRNA present in isolated LEC that increased after differentiation of LEC into fiber cells. Levels of ILK were also substantial in two immortalized lens cell lines.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry was subsequently performed on the lens to verify specific localization of ILK in differentiating LEC and fiber cells. Staining revealed a concentration of ILK along the interface marking the posterior edge of the equatorial LEC and anterior ends of newly-differentiated fiber cells. Staining for ILK continued posterior to the equatorial region along the lateral membranes of the most recently-differentiated fiber cells. Significant levels of ILK were also observed at the lens anterior surface, apparently localized along fiber cell membranes. Immunostaining for ILK and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-integrin showed coincidence at the LEC-fiber cell interface, anterior to the equatorial region of the lens. The localization of ILK deposits in the lens coincides with immunohistochemistry performed in the developing murine brain that revealed foci of ILK at the interface between differentiating tissue layers in a membrane-associated pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>].</p><p>ILK, with its known association with the cytoplasmic tails of integrin &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>- and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-subunits, would be expected to function optimally at integrin-localized areas. Previous work has shown a distribution of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-integrin, unique among tissue epithelia, at both basal and apical membranes of LEC and differentiating fiber cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Of specific interest are the alterations in integrins required during the differentiation of LEC and subsequent fiber cell elongation, migration, and survival. Fiber cell maturation requires migration along the anterior of the lens where little to no ECM is deposited. Additionally, these cells must survive a modified apoptotic process resulting in denucleation, elimination of most organelles, and significant cytoskeletal alterations (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]). The interface between LEC and fiber cells has been shown to be a site of changing integrin interactions and expression by newly-differentiated fiber cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]). Of note are alterations observed in the &#x003b1;<sub>6</sub>-integrin subunit, a binding partner of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-integrin. &#x003b1;<sub>6</sub>-integrin expression, cytoskeletal interaction, and anti-apoptotic signaling are upregulated in LEC as they enter the equatorial region, and these changes continue during fiber cell differentiation, even in a microenvironment (the LEC-fiber cell interface) which exhibits a paucity of ECM deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Specifically in the lens fiber cells, &#x003b1;<sub>6</sub>-integrin has been shown to stimulate PI3K-dependent signaling, which regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and survival during the process of denucleation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Downstream of PI3K/AKT signaling, inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; has been postulated to act as a survival mechanism during lens differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. In addition to the PI3K pathway, GSK-3b can be directly inhibited by ILK phosphorylation in a PI3K-dependent manner (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]). As ILK has been previously shown to be involved in cell survival and cytoskeletal alteration, we postulate that the unexpected distribution of ILK in the lens is due in part to the lens-specific expression pattern of its known interacting integrin partners. This localization would allow ILK to function as a positive regulator of cytoskeletal alteration, migration, and survival in LEC and fiber cells during differentiation in the lens.</p><p>Despite little to no protein detected by either immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry, the dissected LEC fraction contained ILK mRNA. It is possible that contamination of LEC or fiber cells during dissection, or the inclusion of cells from the equatorial region, could account for the faint ILK mRNA signal in the LEC fraction. Whereas ILK expression by LEC in vivo appears minimal, it is upregulated during their differentiation into fiber cells. As ILK has been implicated in EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>] and is expressed by most cultured cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]), we proceeded to determine the expression pattern of ILK and its potential role during culture of explanted LEC.</p><p>The process of EMT in LEC has been seen during the adaptation of lens cells to culture conditions and as a result of cataract surgery, as LEC escaping surgical removal regrow on the posterior surface of the lens implant. These changes include the increased production of survival factors and changes in cytoskeletal and integrin proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. We investigated the role of ILK in this adaptation process by characterizing immortalized LEC and primary LEC outgrowths from lens explants. Over a 2 week interval, immunoblotting and staining showed strong ILK expression in the cell lines and increased levels of ILK in primary mouse LEC. The production of ILK by the explanted LEC was increased concomitantly with that of the EMT markers, &#x003b1;-SMA and fibronectin. Similar results were obtained with regard to ILK and the EMT process in renal tubular epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. ILK-targeting siRNAs were next used to inhibit ILK expression during EMT of the explant cultures. siRNA transfection eliminated the majority of ILK expression (about 70%) over the explant culture period (14 days). This inhibition of ILK production was associated with a retardation of EMT progression, as indicated by the reduced levels of &#x003b1;-SMA and fibronectin. These results substantiate the proposed role for ILK as a positive regulator during LEC EMT and as a target for retardation of PCO following cataract surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>].</p><p>In immortalized LEC, ILK could also be induced by stress in the form of serum deprivation. The removal of serum led to an increase in protein expression and ILK kinase activity, as verified by phosphorylation of its target MBP. ILK was localized in cultured LEC in a distinctive pattern resembling that of certain cytoplasmic proteins including tubulin, lens-specific microtubules, and some of the actin-associated proteins. Although increases in ILK protein were evident in both LEC and cultured hRPE after stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>), a similar pattern of ILK localization was not observed in cultured hRPE (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). It is, therefore, possible that EMT-mediated localization of ILK occurs in cultured LEC. Enhanced production of specific EMT-induced cytoskeletal proteins could potentiate ILK binding and ILK-induced motility, as has been previously reported for cultured myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Work is ongoing to identify EMT-associated and/or lens-specific cytoskeletal components that could account for the staining pattern observed for ILK in cultured LEC. As expected, coincident staining of ILK and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin, as well as the &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> complex, was observed in cultured LEC. Moreover, colocalization was enhanced after &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin was activated by its preferred ECM ligand, fibronectin.</p><p>The use of a novel anti-ILK antibody has allowed us to identify ILK in the newly-differentiated fiber cells of the mouse lens. Although there do not appear to be substantial amounts of ILK mRNA or protein in the anterior lens epithelia, there is an increase in expression as LEC enter the equatorial region of the lens and begin differentiation into fiber cells, a result consistent with recently published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. In addition, ILK production in LEC significantly increased as these cells were grown in vitro, data lending credence to the hypothesis that ILK plays a role in LEC EMT and potentially in the PCO process that can occur after cataract surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the laboratory of Dr. Shoukat Dedhar for the generous contribution of hILK-encoding plasmids.
