This phenomenon occurs in a well defined period called the critical period of visual cortical plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. The critical period extends from postnatal 3 months to 6 years of age in humans, and from postnatal 3 to 6 weeks in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Once this critical period has passed, the presence of an abnormal visual environment cannot lead to amblyopia, and existing amblyopia is difficult to rectify. There has not been any effective drug treatment method devised to date that can ameliorate the effects of amblyopia. Therefore, investigation of the mechanisms leading to the termination of cortical plasticity in developing mammals will help establish a new approach for reestablishing visual function in older amblyopic children and adults. Elucidation of the possible opening or closing-factor(s) may also supply an experimental basis for drug treatment of amblyopia.</p><p>Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a key molecule in the regulation of the extracellular proteolytic cascade reaction in the postnatal mammalian central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that during the critical period of visual cortical plasticity, tPA may influence synaptic reconstruction by its proteolytic effect on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), which are major components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. However, it is not known whether tPA activity is correlated with the initiation or termination of the critical period.</p><p>To explore the relationship between the temporal/spatial profile of tPA and the duration of the critical period of visual cortical plasticity, we used immunofluorescence histochemistry, western blot, and chromogenic assays to investigate the distribution, expression, and activity of tPA in the visual cortex of postnatal Long Evans rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All Long Evans rats used in this study were treated according to Chinese law on the use of laboratory animals, and followed the ethical guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of ARVO.</p><p>Long Evans rats (n=131; Taconic Farms, Hudson, NY) of either sex were divided into five groups according to postnatal age in weeks (PW): PW1 (6&#x02013;8 days, before eye opening, n=19), PW3 (20&#x02013;22 days, beginning of critical period, n=28), PW5 (34&#x02013;36 days, later stage of critical period, n=28), PW7 (48&#x02013;50 days, end of critical period, n=28), and PW14 (95&#x02013;100 days, adult, n=28).

Fields from sections of visual cortex stained with tPA were acquired from layer II-III (depth &#x0003c;350 &#x000b5;m), layer IV (depth between 350 and 500 &#x000b5;m), and deep layer V-VI (depth &#x0003e;500 &#x000b5;m). The full thickness of the visual cortex was roughly similar at all ages examined, and, although the thickness of layer I was thinner at later ages, the depth of the other layers changes very little.

The tissue from two animals for each sample at each age was then homogenized in RIPA buffer (1% Triton/0.5% sodium deoxycholate/0.1% SDS/PBS/2&#x000a0;mM DTT) and after sonication and centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and protein concentrations determined using a modified Lowry method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Matching amounts of protein from each sample were mixed with sample buffer. Samples were loaded onto a 7.5% SDS&#x02013;PAGE linear gel. Following electrophoresis, gels were blotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 2 h, then incubated overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with 1:500 primary antibodies to tPA and 1:10000 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; catalog number KC-5G4; Kang Chen, Shanghai, China).

In tPA-knockout mice, ocular dominance shifts caused by monocular deprivation were inhibited, but cortical plasticity could be restored through an upregulation of endogenous or exogenous tPA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Mataga et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] suggested that the extracellular microenvironment of the visual cortex may be altered during the critical period due to a local degradation of ECM molecules by the tPA cascade reaction, and thus making it amenable to synaptic structure renewal and reconnection.</p><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry and analysis of cell density</title><p>In the present study, the presence of tPA assessed by either immunofluorescence or western blotting was not seen in PW1 rat visual cortex&#x02014;that is, at a time when the rat pups still have not opened their eyes. tPA-positive staining was detected by PW3 after the rat pups have opened their eyes between postnatal days 12 and 13, indicating that, to some extent, there may be an experience-dependency of tPA expression during the critical period. Current research has made it clear that the synaptic plasticity of layer II-III in visual cortex is greater than that of layer IV, i.e., synaptic plasticity of corticocortical pathways is greater than that of thalamocortical pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. We found that tPA staining was prominent in layer II-III and layer IV after PW3, with the bulk of the cells being found in layer II-III. This suggests that different tPA distributions between layer II-III and layer IV may reflect differences in the synaptic plasticity between these two layers. Oray et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>] examined whether monocular deprivation would occlude a subsequent effect of exogenous tPA/plasmin to determine whether tPA/plasmin might be involved in the structural plasticity of dendritic spines during the critical period. They found that layer II-III, in which spine motility is upregulated by monocular deprivation, was unaffected by additional plasmin application, suggesting that monocular deprivation occluded a further increase in spine dynamics via proteolysis of the extracellular matrix. In contrast, spine motility was significantly increased by enzymatic treatment with plasmin in layer IV, a layer in which spine motility is normally unchanged following deprivation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that if a selective local secretion of tPA is responsible for the laminar upregulation of spine motility, spines in the middle parts of the apical arbor corresponding to layer IV, will be exposed to less endogenous tPA compared to spines in layer II-III that will be exposed to a much larger amount of endogenous tPA. Our results are consistent with Oray and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>] and add further weight to this hypothesis. The present data show that during development, the density of tPA-containing cells in layer II-III reaches a maximum toward the latter part of the critical period and is then reduced to minimum after the critical period. By comparison, the density of tPA-containing cells in layer IV reaches a maximum at the peak of critical period, before it is then reduced to minimum at later ages. This prompts the idea that synaptic plasticity of thalamocortical connections may end earlier than that seen for corticocortical connections and this suggestion appears to be supported by the work of Catalano and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. These authors reported that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1) expression (necessary for long-term potential [LTP]) in layer IV of the cat visual cortex was rapidly reduced toward the end of the critical period, but its expression in layer II-III remained abundant into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot and activity analysis of tissue plasminogen activator</title><p>Western blotting for tPA expression and its proteolytic activity illustrates the following points. First, once the critical period ends, tPA expression and activity dramatically decrease, suggesting that CSPGs degradation by tPA is downregulated with a concomitant reinforcement of the inhibition of axon growth and synaptic connectivity by the extracellular microenvironment, thus leading to a reduction in cortical plasticity. Second, lower levels of tPA activity are detected in adulthood, suggesting that tPA may also be involved to some extent in the cortical plasticity seen in adult mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Third, the time course of the amount of tPA expression and its corresponding activity were not in complete agreement. Current studies on tPA development in postnatal cerebellum and hippocampus have suggested a region-specific heterogeneity of tPA expression, which may be related to endogenous inhibitors of tPA. In the brain, at least two types of endogenous tPA inhibitors are defined: neuroserpin and nexin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Wannier-Morino et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] reported that during the critical period neuroserpin mRNA was downregulated, while tPA activity was upregulated in the hemisphere contralateral to the deprived eye. Previous investigations concluded that tPA possessing low proteolytic activity is stored in presynaptic vesicles that can be released in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pattern after synaptic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. However, concomitant release of endogenous tPA inhibitors would rapidly diminish tPA activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. It has also been suggested that changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> affect dendritic spine morphology, and large increases will cause spine shrinkage and lead to their eventual disappearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Possible link to the cortical GABAergic system</title><p>Pizzorusso et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] used a chondroitinase ABC enzyme extracted from plants to degrade chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the adult rat visual cortex. They recorded a physiologic shift in ocular dominance after monocular deprivation, indicating that the application had successfully recovered visual cortical plasticity.</p><p>This important finding suggests CSPGs may be involved in the termination mechanism(s) for the critical period of cortical plasticity, but also indicates there may be endogenous factors regulating the degradation of CSPGs in the visual cortex that may be relevant to the opening/closure of the critical period. tPA may be one of the key factors for adjusting CSPGs degradation. In contrast to the CSPGs distribution observed by of Pizzorusso et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], in which layer IV has the highest expression and layer II-III and V-VI are roughly similar, in our study, tPA expression is highest in layer II-III and lowest in layer V-VI. The morphology of tPA-labeled cells (note the large lightly labeled dendrites in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C,E,G</xref>; see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]) suggests that many of these cells are pyramidal and may account in part for the higher density of tPA-positive cells during the critical period compared to CSPGs cell positive numbers (~10 times more tPA vs CSPGs cells). However, CSPGs and tPA cell number in layer IV-VI in adulthood are very similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>].</p><p>In the visual cortex, the majority of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons are located in layer IV. The GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission of visual cortical neurons is strengthened during the critical period, but the trend can be inhibited by binocular form deprivation and recovered by visual input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. During the latter stage of the critical period, CSPGs gradually assemble into perineuronal nets (PNNs) around somata and dendrites of GABAergic interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. In the visual cortex of adult cats made strabismic as kittens, the density of PNNs, especially in layer IV, is significantly reduced compared to normal animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Degradation of PNNs reduces the inhibitory function of GABAergic interneurons in layer IV to their target neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>], and allows a renewed period of visual plasticity in the adult rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. However, the results of Pizzorusso et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] indicate that the effect of dark rearing is much more pronounced on the distribution of CSPGs-positive cells in layer V-VI compared to layer II-III and layer IV is unaffected (i.e., the layer receiving thalamocortical input). Other findings suggest that the developmental maturation of GABAergic inhibitory neural circuits may be involved in the termination of the critical period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Knockout mice lacking a synaptic isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) have a prolonged cortical plasticity period, which can be closed by benzodiazepine infusion thus restoring an appropriate level of GABAergic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Similarly, transgenic mice in which the overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is accelerated show an early closing of plasticity via BDNF&#x02019;s indirect action on accelerating GABAergic cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. RNA in situ hybridization showed that overexpression of BDNF associated with the early critical period closure was highest in the superficial layers (layers II and III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], that is, in the same layers that show a high convergence and increase in GABA input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Our study found that the density of tPA-positive cells in layer IV-VI progressively decreased during development, with a concomitant downregulation of tPA expression and activity at the closure of the critical period. This suggests that the PNNs containing abundant CSPGs may be the &#x0201c;gate&#x0201d; that can adjust the combination of inhibitory receptors and their isoforms in the cellular membrane with the amount of neurotransmitter. The formation of PNNs may limit synaptic reconnection, resulting in a synaptic structure which is not easily modified; nevertheless, tPA might be one of the keys that can maintain or reopen the &#x0201c;gate.&#x0201d; This hypothesis is supported by our recent in vitro studies on GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic transmission in the developing rat visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. tPA-stop significantly increases the peak value and decay time of inhibitory postsynaptic currents compared to normal values seen throughout the critical period. In contrast, addition of tPA to the perfusion solution significantly decreased inhibitory postsynaptic currents peak values and decay times in the cortical slice preparation. These results suggest that tPA or tPA-stop can significantly alter the time course of cortical maturation and the duration of the critical period by altering PNNs and GABA<sub>A</sub> function.</p><p>Both tPA and CSPGs expression increase over the first seven postnatal weeks after which the expression of CSPGs is maintained and that of tPA decreases. This could suggest that the expression of tPA is produced in sufficient amounts to balance the increase of CSPGs expression, at the same time blocking its function, allowing synaptic modification to continue. At the end of the critical period, the shifting balance in favor of CSPGs allows for synaptic consolidation and limits further changes. The degree to which visual activity can control tPA expression remains to be determined. In light of previous CSPGs experiments and dark rearing, we would hypothesize that tPA expression will remain elevated at the end of the critical period as it continues to maintain a balance with CSPGs activity.</p><p>Previous reports have shown that several interactions and molecular signals potentially control the length of the critical period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. We have shown that the reduction in tPA is closely correlated with the timing of the critical period of cortical plasticity, and may be one of the factors underlying the heterogeneity in synaptic plasticity between layer II-III and layer IV of the visual cortex. Further research on the specific mechanisms by which tPA contributes to the duration of the critical period and the genetic mechanism(s) that control tPA expression are needed to improve our knowledge of amblyopia pathogenesis and to supply new directions for studying drug treatments for this condition.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by grants to Zheng Qin Yin from Hi-tech Research and Development Program of China (&#x0201c;863&#x0201d; Programs, 2007AA042300), National Basic Research Program of China (&#x0201c;973&#x0201d; Programs, 2007CB512203), and National Natural Science Foundation (30672280) of China.
