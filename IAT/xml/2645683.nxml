Although it is known that there are a number of MAR elements in the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene cluster, it is unclear that how these MAR elements are involved in regulating <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> genes expression. Here, we report the identification of a new MAR element at the LCR(locus control region) of human <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene cluster and the detection of the inter-MAR association within the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene cluster. Also, we demonstrate that SATB1, a protein factor that has been implicated in the formation of network like higher order chromatin structures at some gene loci, takes part in <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> specific inter-MAR association through binding the specific MARs. Knocking down of SATB1 obviously reduces the binding of SATB1 to the MARs and diminishes the frequency of the inter-MAR association. As a result, the ACH establishment and the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-like <italic>globin</italic> genes and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-like <italic>globin</italic> genes expressions are affected either. In summary, our results suggest that SATB1 is a regulatory factor of hemoglobin genes, especially the early differentiation genes at least through affecting the higher order chromatin structure.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many studies have shown that a transcriptionally active structure can be formed when genes express actively.

MARs are originally identified as genomic DNA fragments that remain tightly associated with high salt-extracted and DNase I&#x02013;digested nuclei, and have been postulated to be localized at the base of chromatin loops. The MARs help to form the chromatin loops by attaching to the nuclear matrix. MARs identified by such criteria often contain base-unpairing regions (BURs) which become continuously unpaired when subjected to negative super helical strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-KohwiShigematsu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Bode1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. SATB1, which has been characterized as a MAR-binding protein, can bind to the BUR sequences and regulates higher order chromatin loop structures in T-cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Cai1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Kumar1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Kumar et al also showed that SATB1 can recruit a regulatory complex that manages transcription by orchestrating dynamic chromatin-loop architecture in MHC class I locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Kumar1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The intensive studies in the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> locus have revealed that the local chromatin organization is one of the major players in the in vivo regulation of <italic>globin</italic> genes expression. There are 5 developmentally specific genes including embryonic (<italic>&#x003b5;</italic>), fetal (<italic>G&#x003b3;</italic>, <italic>A&#x003b3;</italic>), and adult (<italic>&#x003b4;,&#x003b2;</italic>) globins in the human <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene cluster on chromosome 11. The locus control region (LCR) of <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene cluster, containing 5 DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS), locates in the far upstream region of the cluster and is able to enhance tissue-specific <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> genes expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Hanscombe1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Li1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> locus, the actively expressing globin genes are in close proximity to LCR to form a specialized structure that was termed as ACH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Palstra1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this higher order chromatin structure is not directly associated with gene transcription. Erythroid-specific transacting factors, such as EKLF, GATA-1, and FOG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Drissen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Vakoc1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> are indispensable factors to recruit the active <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-like <italic>globin</italic> genes to the ACH. The details of how this ACH structure was established and maintained are still unclear. There are many candidate MARs in the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> cluster appear to be important in regulating the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-like <italic>globin</italic> genes expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Boulikas1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. MARs flanking the <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>- or <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> genes or within the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> second intervening sequence (IVS2) have been proposed as regulatory elements for <italic>globin</italic> genes expression or hemoglobin switching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Case1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Ostermeier1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. But how these MAR elements regulate the gene expression is only addressed most recently. SATB1 was found to be present in the erythroid cells and the binding of SATB1 to some MARs can up-regulate the expression of <italic>&#x003b5;-globin</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Wen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies indicate that SATB1 could mediate the function of MAR elements in directing the expression of <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> genes.</p><p>In this report, we identified a new MAR element within the &#x003b2;-globin locus and observed the SATB1 mediated inter-MAR association by applying several approaches. We also demonstrated that the inter-MAR association plays an important role in regulating the expression of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-like <italic>globin</italic> genes possibly through influencing the establishment of the ACH(active chromatin harbor). In light of the global regulatory role of SATB1, our data suggest that SATB1 is possibly an important regulator of early erythroid differentiation by influencing the chromatin organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The identification of a new MAR element in the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> cluster</title><p>We applied an improved method QACT (quantitative associated chromatin trap) to search the spatially associated chromatin fragments with a previously identified MAR element, which locate upstream of HS2 (MAR<sup>HS2</sup>) in K562 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Wen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Yan1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

To further validate the associations among these MAR elements, 3C assay was performed using MAR<sup>HS4</sup>, MAR<sup>HS2</sup>, and MAR<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> located restriction fragments as the fixed fragment respectively.

The association results in the looping out of the intermediate regions between different MARs. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that genomic DNA is attached to the NM through MAR elements and the intermediate regions between two MAR elements are organized as separate units. Also, the positions of these four MAR elements on NM are spatially proximal which indicates a &#x0201c;MAR core&#x0201d; structure in the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene locus in K562 cells. The functional significance of this &#x0201c;MAR core&#x0201d; could be observed when the terminal differentiation of K562 cells was induced by hemin.

The ChIP results also showed that there was no binding of SATB1 to the globin gene promoters including <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>- and <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> genes or the core regulatory elements including HS2 and HS4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004629.s002">Fig. S2</xref>), suggesting a binding specificity between SATB1 and MARs. This result indicates that the increased SATB1 binding is a possible reason of increased inter-MAR association when the polymerization property of SATB1 is taken into consideration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Cai1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. To further explore the essential role of SATB1 in mediating the inter-MAR association, we applied the &#x0201c;ChIP-3C&#x0201d; assay in both uninduced and induced K562 cells. Compared with 3C assay, the ChIP-3C assay allows us to examine a specific chromatin interaction mediated by a particular protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Wang1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Horike1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. As the ChIP-3C result showed in both cells, the re-ligation products between any two of MAR<sup>HS4</sup>, MAR<sup>HS2</sup> and MAR<sup>&#x003b5;</sup> can be observed consistently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), indicating that SATB1 mediates the inter-MAR association at least among MAR<sup>HS4</sup>, MAR<sup>HS2</sup> and MAR<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>. Sequencing of the PCR products further confirmed the re-ligation products. We haven't seen any signal of re-ligation products between MAR<sup>HS4</sup>/MAR<sup>HS2</sup> and MAR<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> or other nonspecific chromatin fragments from outside of MAR regions. However, we did observe the association between MAR<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> and MAR<sup>HS4</sup>/MAR<sup>HS2</sup> as shown in 3C assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting that the association is possibly mediated by other trans-acting factor(s). In fact, the binding of SATB1 to MAR<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> was marginal compared with others as shown in the ChIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Additionally, Wen et al also reported that the increasing of <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> gene expression was accompanied by the decreasing of SATB1 expression after hemin induction in the late passage K562 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Wen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, supporting that SATB1 is not a critical regulator of <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> gene expression. Additionally, the ChIP-3C result also supports that hemin induction of K562 cells significantly increases the association frequency of these 3 MARs including MAR<sup>HS4</sup>, MAR<sup>HS2</sup> and MAR<sup>&#x003b5;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).

It could be observed that the expression of SATB1 was markedly repressed in both mRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). As a result, the substantially reduced expression of <italic>&#x003b5;-globin</italic> gene could also be observed in the K562-SATB1-RNAi cells but not in the K562-SATB1-control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g004">Fig. 4B, C</xref>).

The expression of <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> gene was also moderately reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g004">Fig. 4B, C</xref>). These results suggest that knocking down of SATB1 in K562 cells may influence the spatial chromatin structure of <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene cluster. It is also noticeable that the <italic>&#x003b6;-globin</italic> gene, one of the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-like <italic>globin</italic> genes predominantly expresses in fetal stage was also obviously repressed in the K562-SATB1-RNAi cells(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting a general role of SATB1 in erythroid differentiation. Interestingly, there were no significant expression changes of some important erythroid transcriptional factors in the K562-SATB1-RNAi cells(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004629.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). As expected, the bindings of SATB1 at MAR<sup>HS4</sup>, MAR<sup>HS2</sup> and MAR<sup>&#x003b5;</sup> were reduced substantially in SATB1 knocking down cells, whereas the SATB1 binding at MAR<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> was still marginal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Accordingly, the 3C assay result showed that the association between MAR<sup>HS4</sup>/MAR<sup>HS2</sup> and MAR<sup>&#x003b5;</sup> also obviously decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Additionally, the active transcriptional structure formed between HS2 core sequence and <italic>&#x003b5;-globin</italic> gene promoter was affected in K562-SATB1-RNAi cells and the association between HS2core and <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> gene promoter also moderately decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). These results suggest that SATB1 possibly contributes to the <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> expression. However, Wen et al has reported that knocking down of SATB1 resulted in the increasing of <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> gene expression in late passage of K562 cells, suggesting that SATB1 is not an important regulatory factor of &#x003b3;-globin gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Wen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This discrepancy is possibly caused by the using of different passages of K562 cells. There are both early passage of K562 cells and late passage of K562 cells. In the early passage of K562 cells, the expressions of both <italic>&#x003b5;</italic> and <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> genes increase in response to hemin induction as we observed in our experiments and other previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Rowley1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Benz1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The amount of SATB1 in the early passage of K562 cells we used showed no obvious change after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). While in the late passage of K562 cells used by Wen, et al., <italic>&#x003b5;-globin</italic> gene decreased and <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> gene increased after hemin induction. Also, SATB1 decreased in response to the hemin induction.

We also observed the maintaining of the binding of SATB1 to these MARs, that is possibly important for inter-MAR association and the reactivation of genes transcription in next cell cycle.

For a long time, the nuclear matrix was proposed as a static structure that provides a platform or directly participates in diverse matrix-supported processes. Until recently, SATB1 mediated long range chromatin association was reported and this finding provided the first evidence that MAR elements are important regulatory elements helping to create the local looping structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Cai2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Kumar1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Most of the studies showed these MARs are able to attach to the nuclear matrix. In this study, we have identified the <italic>in situ</italic> association among these elements. Unexpectedly, a new MAR element, locating in the interval region between HS5 and HS4, has also been identified. We also proved that the MAR elements contribute significantly to the establishment of the local looping structure within <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene cluster. However, there was also a report describing that the expression of <italic>globin</italic> genes were accompanied by the moving out of the whole locus from the chromosomal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Ragoczy1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, the dual roles of MARs are also anticipated during the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> genes activation.</p><p>During the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene cluster activation, several transcriptional factors mediate the associations between the gene promoters and the enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Drissen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Vakoc1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> to form active chromatin transcriptionally structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Tolhuis1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Palstra1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and our 3C assay has also confirmed that (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004629.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Our results have indicated that the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene cluster specific inter-MAR association is correlated with the formation of ACH. According to our 3C and ChIP-3C results, the association directly generates at least three intact loops, with HS3 and HS4 at one loop, HS1 and HS2 at another loop and <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>- and <italic>&#x003b3;- globin</italic> genes at the third loop. The three loops, therefore, provide the spatial convenience for the conversation among these HSs and the gene promoters. We presume that the formation of these loops is the structural basis for the establishment of ACH. Though there is no direct evidence for the relationship between the inter-MAR association structure and the previously described ACH structure, our data imply the co-existence of these structures mediated by different transcriptional factors. Also, our 3C assay showed that the association frequencys between MAR<sup>HS4</sup>/MAR<sup>HS2</sup> and MAR<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> were higher than the frequency between MAR<sup>HS4</sup>/MAR<sup>HS2</sup> and <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004629.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). Importantly, our study showed that the inter-MAR association can increase substantially after hemin induction of K562 cells, that is consistent with the changed active looping events. Here, the results give a hint that the inter-MAR association structure may act as a pre-existing structure facilitating this activation process. Therefore, this structure should be relative stable and its establishment is not presumed to be mediated by the more dynamic transcriptional factor(s). However, it is only the beginning to realize the possible importance of inter-MAR association structure and much more efforts are required to further establish the role of the inter-MAR association at other gene loci.</p><p>SATB1 has the specific MAR binding property and can self-polymerize to establish a birdcage-like structure that could encapsulate the silenced genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Cai1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. SATB1 was also reported to mediate the long range chromatin associations in the TH2 cytokine locus, suggesting that the polymerization of SATB1 generates stable structure besides the binding to chromatin fragments as a transcriptional factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Cai2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. We also proved that SATB1 is important in the establishment of active loop formation between &#x003b5;-promoter and regulatory elements. The associations among MAR<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>, MAR<sup>HS2</sup> and the newly identified MAR<sup>HS4</sup>, can be consistently observed and be proved to be mediated by SATB1. Because the signal between MAR<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> and MAR<sup>HS4</sup>/MAR<sup>HS2</sup> can not be detected by ChIP-3C, we speculate that SATB1 is not a necessary factor that mediates the recruitment of <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> gene to the ACH. Because MAR<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> can be observed to be associated with the other three MARs, we also presume that it is mediated by an unknown factor. Looping events have been observed to be mediated by distinct transcriptional factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Bartkuhn1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, which may confer the loops different regulatory functions and generate distinct outcomes.

Also, the transcriptional machinery and several gene specific transcriptional factors required for the ACH formation are absent during metaphase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Vakoc1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Michelotti1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004629-Xin1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we presume that the re-establishment of ACH is possibly needed for the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-like <italic>globin</italic> genes expression and SATB1 binding at the MAR elements probably contributes to this active process.</p><p>As a conclusion, here we propose a &#x0201c;MAR-core-loop&#x0201d; model for better interpreting the function of SATB1 mediated inter-MAR association in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). The positions of these MAR elements divide the whole <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> gene cluster into at least 5 parts in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Establishment of &#x0201c;MAR core&#x0201d; by MAR<sup>HS4</sup>, MAR<sup>HS2</sup>, MAR<sup>&#x003b5;</sup> and MAR<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> interactions generates at least 3 separated loops with which HSs, <italic>&#x003b5;-globin</italic> and <italic>&#x003b3;-globin</italic> gene promoters harbored. SATB1 is supposed to be the dominant mediator of the inter-MAR association. A predicted unknown factor is also involved in mediating the MAR<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> association to other members of this &#x0201c;MAR core&#x0201d;. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004629-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>, the &#x0201c;MAR-core-loop&#x0201d; structure is a stable higher order chromatin structure that provides the structural convenience for the crosstalk among HSs or between HSs and gene promoters to form an active transcriptional structure termed as ACH. Importantly, the binding of SATB1 at MAR<sup>HS4</sup>, MAR<sup>HS2</sup> and MAR<sup>&#x003b5;</sup> during the mitotic cell division helps to reactivate <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> genes and high order chromatin structure during cell cycles.</p><fig id="pone-0004629-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004629.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>The MAR-core-loop model.</title><p>A.

Briefly, the prepared 3C templates DNA were completely digested by the secondary endonuclease MspI and then purified. The digested DNA was used for self-ligation in 500 ul to promote the intra-molecule ligation. The primers used for nested inverse PCR were as follows: FMAR<sup>HS2</sup>F:<named-content content-type="gene">CACTGAAAATAGTGTTTAGCAT</named-content>; FMAR<sup>HS2</sup> R: <named-content content-type="gene">GTATCTTATTCCCCACAAGAGT</named-content>; SMAR<sup>HS2</sup>F: <named-content content-type="gene">TCCAGCATCCTCATCTCTGA</named-content>; SMAR<sup>HS2</sup>R: <named-content content-type="gene">ACAGTTAATTATAATGTGCTCTGTC</named-content>. The 5&#x02032; side of SMAR<sup>HS2</sup> primers was modified with biotin. PCR reactions were performed as follows: one cycle at 94&#x000b0;C for 4 min; 25 cycles at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 56&#x000b0;C for 40 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s; followed by one cycle at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The first round PCR products were used as the templates of second round inverse PCR after 100 fold dilution. The second round PCR was performed as follows: one cycle at 94&#x000b0;C for 4 min; 30 cycles at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 60&#x000b0;C for 40 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s; followed by one cycle at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The leader RCF was removed from the purified second round PCR products and the HindIII adaptor was ligated to the left ACPs. HindIII adaptor was obtained by annealing the following primers: HindIII adaptorF 5&#x02032; Biotin-<named-content content-type="gene">ATACGACTCATGGATCCGACA</named-content>; HindIII adaptorR 5&#x02032; Phosphate-<named-content content-type="gene">AGCTTGTCGGATCCATGAGTCGTAT</named-content>. BamHI and MmeI restriction recognition sites were included in the HindIII adaptor. Further MmeI digestion excised 19/20 bp tags from the ACPs and the tags could be captured by magnetic sphere through the HindIII adaptor and its biotin modification. To quantitatively analyze the possible associated chromatin fragments,a NN adaptor was ligated to the other side of the tags. NN adaptor was obtained by annealing of the following primers: NNadF: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032; GCAAGGTGCTCTGCTGCAGNN</named-content>; and NNadR: 5&#x02032; phosphate-<named-content content-type="gene">CTGCAGCAGAGCACCTTGC</named-content>. A PstI restriction site was included in the NN adaptor. Tags were amplified by additional PCR reaction with HindIIIadF and NNadF as primers. The two sides of adaptor were removed by BamHI and PstI.. Self-ligation of these tags produces concatemers including several to nearly twenty tags. The concatemers around 500 bp in length were cloned directly into the MCS(multi cloning site) of the vector pUC19. The inserted concatemers were sequenced. A frequency can be showed according to the sequencing results.
