The sustained antiviral response rate is approximately 50% for genotype-1 infection. The major challenge to the HCV community is to improve antiviral efficacy and to reduce the side effects typically seen in IFN&#x003b1;-based therapy. One of the strategies is to identify new interferons, which may have better efficacy and less undesirable side effects. In this report, we examined the role of IL-28A (IFN &#x003bb;2), a novel type I IFN, in suppression of human hepatitis C viral RNA replication. We have cloned both the human genomic DNA and cDNA of IL-28A, and evaluated their biological activity using HCV RNA replicon cell culture system. The results show that IL-28A effectively inhibits HCV subgenomic RNA replication in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of human hepatoma cells with IL-28A activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and induces the expression of some interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as 6&#x02013;16 and 1&#x02013;8U. We also demonstrate that IL-28A induces expression of HLA class I antigens in human hepatoma cells. Moreover, IL-28A appears to specifically suppress HCV IRES-mediated translation. Although IL-28A receptor shares one subunit with the IL-10 receptor, IL-10 treatment has no detectable effect on IL-28A-induced antiviral activity. Interestingly, IL-28A can synergistically enhance IFN&#x003b1; antiviral efficacy. Our results suggest that IL-28A antiviral activity is associated with the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and expression of ISGs. The effectiveness of IL-28A antiviral activity and its synergistic effect on IFN-&#x003b1; indicate that IL-28A may be potentially used to treat HCV chronic infection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Interferon alpha (IFN-&#x003b1;), the prototype of type I interferon, is widely used to treat human viral infections and certain malignant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. There are several subtypes of type I interferons in humans, namely IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2;, IFN-&#x003c9;, IFN-&#x003ba;, IFN-tau, IFN-epsilon, IFN-zeta, and the recently discovered IFN-&#x003bb; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. At least 13 nonallelic IFN-&#x003b1; genes, a single IFN-&#x003b2; gene, and a single IFN-&#x003c9; gene were identified on human chromosome 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. There are three genes for IFN&#x003bb;, named as IFN-&#x003bb;1, IFN-&#x003bb;2, and IFN-&#x003bb;3 (also referred to as IL-29, IL-28A, and IL-28B, respectively). Expression of these interferons is induced by viral infection in the majority of nucleated cells. All the type I interferons possess antiviral activity, but the antiviral efficacy appears to vary significantly in subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. They play a critical role in the innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Interferons exert their biological activities by binding to the heterodimeric receptor. Current evidence suggests that all the type I interferons, except for IFN&#x003bb;, utilize the same cell membrane-bound receptor, IFNAR, consisting of two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The binding of the receptor by type I interferons predominantly activates The JAK-STAT signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], although other signaling pathways can also be activated in some types of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Activation of the JAK-STAT pathway leads to induction of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF), consisting of STAT1, STAT2, and IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF-9), which serves as a transcription complex to induce the expression of the downstream target genes, referred to as interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In either virus-infected or non-infected cells, IFNs induce the transcription of more than 1000 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], some of which have been shown to possess direct antiviral properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, recent studies suggest that type I interferons have an impact on adaptive immunity by regulating MHC class I antigen expression, stimulating dendritic cell maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and increasing the function of the natural killer (NK) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The three members of novel IFN&#x003bb; have several unique features: 1. The sequence homology of IL-28 and other type I interferons is only 15&#x02013;19%; 2. These genes contain introns; 3. They bind a specific heterodimeric receptor: one subunit belonging to the class II receptor family and the other subunit is identical to the IL-10 receptor subunit 2; 4. The receptor expression exhibits dramatic variations in different tissues; and, 5. The genes are located on chromosome 19 (q13.13). Despite these unique features of IFN-&#x003bb;, initial studies have demonstrated that these interferons can be activated by double-stranded RNA and viral infection in cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These interferons suppressed the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV) in human cell lines, activated the JAK-STAT pathway, and induced expression of some ISGs, which are similar to all the other type I interferons. Thus, it is important to thoroughly investigate these interferons, and to explore the possibility of potential clinical application.</p><p>Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is a global health problem. It infects more than 170 million people worldwide and 4 million people in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. There is no effective vaccine available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and the current treatment is the combination therapy with interferon alpha (IFN) and a nucleotide analog, Ribavirin. The best response rate for genotype 1 infection, the predominant viral strain in the United States, is about 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, IFN treatment carries significant side effects, partially due to the broad range of IFN biological activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of interferon antiviral action, as well as the mechanisms of viral interferon resistance, are still poorly characterized. Thus, a major challenge to the HCV community is to improve therapy for IFN nonresponders, and to reduce its side effects. One of the strategies is to identify new interferons or biological molecules, which may have better efficacy and less undesirable side effects.</p><p>In this report, we examined the role of IL-28A in suppression of human HCV RNA replication. We cloned both the human genomic DNA and cDNA of IL-28A, and evaluated their biological activities, cell signaling pathway, and gene induction using HCV RNA replicon cell culture system. We also examined the interactions of IL-28A, IFN, and IL-10.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cloning of IL-28A genomic DNA and cDNA</title><p>To clone the cDNA of IL-28A, we designed primers according to the available sequence information in Genbank (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_172138">NM_172138</ext-link>). Total RNA was isolated from normal human splenic tissue, followed by RT-PCR amplification. An intense and specific DNA fragment of 1.6 kb in size was identified, which was larger than the predicted 0.7 kb for IL-28A cDNA. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that this fragment represented the genomic DNA of IL-28A gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This 1.6 kb PCR reaction product must be derived from the residual DNA in the total RNA preparation. Consistent with this assumption, extensive DNase I treatment of the RNA preparation eliminated the amplification. Because we could not amplify the cDNA fragment using this approach with several attempts, we, therefore, decided to clone the cDNA fragment using the IL-28A genomic clone. First, the IL-28A genomic DNA was cloned into the expression vector pEF/V5-His-TOPO to construct the plasmid, pTOPO-IL-28A. We then transfected pTOPO-IL-28A into Huh-7 cells, followed by RNA isolation and vigorous DNase I digestion. RT-PCR was performed using the same pair of primers described above. A 0.7 kb cDNA fragment was readily obtained, which corresponded to the predicted cDNA size of IL-28A. We sequenced and analyzed both the genomic fragment and its cDNA. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, there are five introns and six exons in the IL-28A gene. The first ATG starts from nt.53 and ends at nt.655 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The predicted amino acid sequence was identical to that published by Sheppard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>IL-28A gene structure</bold>.

We first tested whether the IL-28A DNA is functional in human hepatoma cells. The eukaryotic expression vectors containing either the genomic DNA or cDNA were transfected into a HCV subgenomic replicon cell line, GSB1. The control cells were transfected by pTOPO vector without any insert sequence. Forty-eight hours after transfection, total RNA was isolated, followed by real-time RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, compared with the control plasmid-transfected cells, the IL-28A transfected cells had significantly lower viral RNA copy numbers. The viral suppression effect was also demonstrated by viral NS5A protein expression, as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To further determine the effect of IL-28A secreted by cells, we then tested the antiviral effect of the conditioned medium. We subcloned IL-28A cDNA into pEF/V5-His-TOPO vector and generated the plasmid, pTOPO-IL-28A07. The plasmid pTOPO-IL-28A07 was transfected into Huh-7 cells, and the supernatant was harvested after 72 hours of incubation. Varying amounts of the conditioned-medium from Huh7 cells transfected with plasmid pTOPO or pTOPO-IL-28A07 were added to GSB1 cells. After 48 hours of incubation, total RNA was isolated from the cells, followed by real-time RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, the IL-28A-conditioned medium demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on HCV RNA replication in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were also obtained using pTOPO-IL28A, the genomic expression construct (data not shown). We then further examined the effect of the recombinant IL-28A on HCV RNA replication by incubating GSB1 cells with varying doses of rhIL-28A, followed by total RNA extraction and real-time PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, the replication levels of HCV RNA were significantly suppressed by rhIL-28A. Again, IL-28A inhibits the viral RNA replication in a dose-dependent manner, but the effective dose of rhIL28A is significantly higher than recombinant IFN.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of IL-28A on HCV RNA replication and protein expression</bold>.

Cells were harvested, and protein extracts were prepared, and a dual luciferase assay using the luciferase assay system was performed. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, translation from the viral IRES elements exhibited a dose-dependent suppression, while the cap-dependent translation is not significantly affected by IL-28A. These data suggest that IL-28A appears to specifically inhibit HCV IRES-mediated translation without affecting cap-mediated translation in the host cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of IL-28A on CAP-dependent and HCV IRES-dependent translation</bold>.

All the human type I IFNs interact with the same receptor, IFNAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. When IFNs bind to specific cell surface receptors on the host cells, the IFNAR receptor complex will activate the JAK proteins, JAK1 and TYK2. The activated-JAK proteins then phosphorylate STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3. We hypothesized that the IL-28A-induced antiviral effect in GSB1 cells would depend upon the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. We, therefore, analyzed the status of STAT1 and STAT3 in response to IL-28A stimulation. Huh7 or GSB1 cells were treated with pTOPO-IL-28A07 conditioned medium or rhIL-28A for 30 minutes, followed by total protein extraction and Western blot analysis using anti-p-STAT1, anti-p-STAT3, total STAT1 and STAT3 monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, both phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 were detected in cells treated with IL-28A. This result indicates that IL-28A utilizes the similar JAK-STAT signaling pathway as the IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2;, despite receptor differences.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The effect of IL-28A on JAK-STAT signaling pathway</bold>.

Interferons exert their biological function through induction of ISGs in the cell. Therefore, it is possible that IL-28A provides antiviral activity by induction of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To determine whether IL-28A can induce the ISGs, total RNA was isolated from the cells treated by IL-28A-conditioned medium from Huh7 cells transfected with pTOPO-IL-28A, followed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis using gene specific primer sets for 6&#x02013;16, 1&#x02013;8U, 1&#x02013;8D, and IFIT1.

There are many subtypes of type I interferons in humans, including the recently identified IFN-&#x003bb;, consisting of three members, &#x003bb;1 (IL-29), &#x003bb;2 (IL-28A), and &#x003bb;3 (IL-28B). The most extensively studied subtypes are IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2;. There is relatively little information available for IFN-&#x003bb;. The major difference between IFN-&#x003bb; and the other type I IFNs is the utilization of different receptors. Current type I interferon therapy has significant side effects. Identification of novel type I interferons with desirable clinical efficacy and less side effects is needed. IFN&#x003bb; s are potentially such candidates.</p><p>In this report, we have cloned both the cDNA and the gene of human IL-28A. Through a series experiments, we have shown the biological effects of this protein on HCV viral replication, its signaling events in human liver cells, and its interaction with IFN-&#x003b1; and IL-10.</p><p>To clone this gene, we employed a RT-PCR approach using total RNA extracted from spleen, liver, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). With extensive effort, we could only obtain IL-28A genomic clones but not cDNA, while we could readily amplify IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; cDNA from the same RNA source. We confirmed that the amplified genomic clones were derived from the residual DNA in the RNA preparation, since two rounds of DNase I treatment eliminated the amplification. This indicates that there is no detectable IL-28A expression in these tissues at a normal physiological condition, although it has been reported that IL-28A is expressed in PBMCs from HCV-infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To obtain the cDNA clone, we decided to clone the genomic DNA into a expression vector, and then transfected it into Huh7 cells. Total RNA was extracted from the transfected cells and RT-PCR was performed. The cDNA DNA fragment was easily amplified using this approach. We noticed that Kotenko et al. used a similar strategy to clone the first IL-28A cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. By comparing the cDNA and its gene, we identified five introns and six extrons. So far, this is the only type I interferon gene containing introns, while the other type I IFNs encode within a single extron. The presence of multiple introns makes this gene more similar to IL-10 gene family. Interestingly, the IL-28A receptor shares one subunit with IL10 (IL-10R&#x003b2;). We know that IL-10 and type I interferons play a different role during the host immune responses to viral infections. The presence of introns generally subjects the gene to an additional gene expression control. According to Kotenco et al., the IL-28A is predominantly expressed in the heart, liver and spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Whether the introns play any role in such relatively tissue-restricted expression remains to be investigated.</p><p>After cloning this gene, we then showed that the gene product, IL-28A, has similar biological properties as other type I interferons. IL-28A resembles type I IFNs in its ability to induce anti-HCV activity through JAK-STAT signaling pathway. As we have shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, IL-28A activates both STAT1 and STAT3. The IL-28A-mediated antiviral activity is dose-dependent. Both the recombinant and the gene product produced in liver cells are effective, though the effective dose of the recombinant IL-28A is much higher than the other type I interferons. Similar results were recently reported by other laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>We further analyzed the expression of ISGs using a RT-PCR approach. Interestingly, at least one ISG cannot be induced by IL-28A, while it can be readily induced by IFN&#x003b1;. Moreover, by testing the effect of interferons on cap-mediated translation and HCV IRES-mediated translation, our preliminary data showed that IL-28A appears to have a selective activity to inhibit HCV-IRES-mediated translation, while it did not affect cap-mediated translation. This observation is consistent with the fact: even at higher dose (1000 ng/ml), IL-28A did not exhibit antiproliferation activity in a human hepatoma cell line (data not shown). These data suggest that IL-28A seems to have at least some different biological activities as compared with IFN-&#x003b1;. Whether these differences can be employed to achieve therapeutic advantage remains to be determined.</p><p>As we have mentioned above, the receptor for IL-28A shares a common subunit with IL-10. Our previous study showed that IL-10 did not have direct antiviral activity in patients with chronic HCV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We asked the question whether the sharing of a receptor has any impact on IL-28A activity. Our data suggests that IL-10 does not have an antiviral effect in HCV replicon cells, nor does it have any interference with IL-28A antiviral effect. Thus, the significance of receptor sharing remains unknown.</p><p>Since IL-28A and other type I interferon use different receptor for signaling transduction, we next examined the combination effect of IL-28A and IFN-&#x003b1;. Interestingly, combination of IL-28A and IFN-&#x003b1; exhibited synergistic effect on JAK-STAT activation and anti-HCV activity. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, combination of 50 U IFN-&#x003b1; and 100 ng per milliliter IL-28A reduced HCV RNA by 40 folds, while individual IFN-&#x003b1; and IL-28A reduced HCV RNA by 10-fold and 6-fold, respectively. We do not know the precise mechanism of this synergistic effect, though the STAT1 activation shows the similar synergistic effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). It is possible that the activation of one receptor may have beneficial effect on the other receptor-mediated pathway. It is also possible that the common downstream molecules shared by both pathways can synergistically induced by these two interferons. This synergistic effect has a significant clinical implication. It is tempting to speculate that combination of these two reagents may have therapeutic benefit for HCV therapy, particularly in the setting of IFN resistance.</p><p>Type I interferons have an immunoregulatory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. One of the mechanisms is through induction of HLA class I antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We tested whether IL-28A has a similar activity. Human hepatoma cells have relatively lower HLA class I antigen expression comparing with normal hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Treatment of the hepatoma cells increased class I antigen expression through flow cytometric study. Not only this shows that the IL-28A has immunoregulator effect, but the fact that IL-28A can induce HLA class I antigen in tumor cells may implicate the role of IL-28A in tumor immune therapy. It would be interesting to see whether IL-28A is capable of promoting the host antitumor immunity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study shows the gene structure of IL-28A, its antiviral effect on HCV, its signaling transduction pathway, and the induction of ISGs. More importantly, we demonstrate the synergistic effect of IL-28A and IFN&#x003b1; on anti-HCV activity, which has a potential clinical application. IFN-&#x003b1; is currently used for the treatment for chronic HCV infection, HBV infection, and many malignant tumors, including hepatitis B, melanoma, hairy cell leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. IL-28A is a potential therapeutic agent to treat these clinical diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures, reagents and plasmids</title><p>The HCV subgenomic replicon cell line, GSB1, was a gift from Dr. Christopher Seeger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].
