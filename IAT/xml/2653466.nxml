The nascent polypeptide chains of these proteins enter the ER via a proteinaceous channel called the Sec61p complex and gain access to the secretory pathway. If the mature protein does not possess specific signals for retention in the ER the protein exits the ER and is transported to the Golgi complex. The protein then moves along the Golgi complex till it reaches the trans-Golgi region. From the trans-Golgi region the protein is either transported to endocytic organelles or to the plasma membrane.</p><p>The Sec61 translocon is a heterotrimer constituted by &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits. According to the crystal structure of the SecY complex from <italic>Methanococcus jannaschii</italic>, which is presumed to represent the fundamental structure of the Sec61 protein translocation channel at the ER, the &#x003b1; subunit, forms the actual channel. The &#x003b2; and the &#x003b3; subunits are associated with the channel on the periphery and are in contact with the lipid bilayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Data obtained from <italic>in-vitro </italic>experiments using liposomes reconstituted with individual components of the Sec61p channel indicate that Sec61&#x003b1; and &#x003b3; are necessary for the protein translocation per-se [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sec61&#x003b2;, on the other hand, is dispensable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In accordance with the <italic>in-vitro </italic>data, in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>mutating &#x003b1; and &#x003b3; subunits of Sec61p is lethal whereas mutating Sec61&#x003b2; results only in a mild temperature sensitive phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to the observations in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Sec61&#x003b2; is essential in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>; embryos homozygous for an allele with a P-element insertion before the transcription start site (<italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic>P1</italic></sup>) die at the end of embryogenesis, at stage 17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The <italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic>P1 </italic></sup>allele was used for generation of the maternal germline clones causing depletion of Sec61&#x003b2; protein from the ovaries. These flies produced embryos that died before stage 17 with the dorsal appendages completely or partially fused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This dorsal appendage phenotype indicates perturbations in the dorsal-ventral axis with increased ventralization of the oocyte. Mutations that inhibit the EGF receptor signalling during oogenesis are known to cause this phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The only known EGF receptor ligand in the oocyte is Gurken. Gurken protein is synthesized in the oocyte but signals to the EGF receptor on the surrounding follicle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Asymmetric signalling by Gurken to the follicle cells in the oocyte constitutes the first step towards formation of the dorsal-ventral axis in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This asymmetric signalling is initiated when the Gurken mRNA is exclusively localized to the posterior end of the oocyte during early stages of oogenesis and to the anterior-dorsal end of the oocyte during the later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Local translation of the mRNA results in synthesis of Gurken as a type I membrane protein in the ER. Like other members of the EGFR ligand family, transport of Gurken from the ER to the plasma membrane is highly regulated. An ER resident chaperone, Star, mediates the exit of Gurken from the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. During the transport through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane Gurken protein is cleaved within the trans-membrane region by action of a member of the Rhomboid (Rho) family of intra-membrane proteases, called Brother of Rhomboid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Cornichon ensures packaging of the Gurken protein in specialized COPII vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The soluble protein is secreted from the oocyte and interacts with the cognate receptor in the neighbouring follicle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we investigated the possibility that the dorsal appendage fusion phenotype observed in the embryos from the <italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic>P1 </italic></sup>germline clones is due to changes in the biosynthesis of Gurken. We analysed the localization of Gurken mRNA and Gurken protein in wild type and sec61&#x003b2; mutant egg chambers. We found that during different stages of oogenesis depletion of Sec61&#x003b2; from the oocytes results in reduced levels of Gurken at the plasma membrane and in the surrounding follicle cells. We also observed that reduced amounts of Sec61&#x003b2; protein does not affect the ER translocation of Gurken, majority of the Gurken protein can enter the ER and is successfully transported till the Golgi complex. Transport of Gurken protein beyond the Golgi complex is affected by lack of Sec61&#x003b2;. This defect seems to be specific for Gurken since transport of a control protein is not affected. We propose that Sec61&#x003b2; plays an essential role during later stages of Gurken transport to the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of Sec61&#x003b2; in wild type and <italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic>P1 </italic></sup>germline clones</title><p>The <italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic>P1 </italic></sup>allele has been reported to be a probable loss-of-function allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

The observed phenotype is strongly reminiscent of the dorsal-ventral axis defect found in the Gurken mutations. Asymmetric localization of the Gurken mRNA at the anterior-dorsal end of the ooycte is the first step towards establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It has been proposed that the Gurken mRNA is closely associated with the ER and an ER protein could anchor the mRNA at the anterior-dorsal end of the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>We therefore examined the localization of Gurken mRNA in the stage 10 egg chambers by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridisation. In wild type oocytes Gurken mRNA localizes to the anterior-dorsal end of the oocyte in close proximity to the oocyte nucleus as indicated in the cartoon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).

Thus, the <italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic>P1</italic></sup>germline clones show no apparent difference in the localization of Gurken mRNA in oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Germline clones of <italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic>P1 </italic></sup>allele show reduced levels of Gurken protein at the plasma membrane of the oocyte</title><p>Since the mRNA localization of Gurken was not affected by lack of Sec61&#x003b2;, we investigated whether lack of Sec61&#x003b2; affects the translation of Gurken mRNA or events in the transport of Gurken protein to the plasma membrane.</p><p>We performed immuno-fluorescence analysis on wild type egg chambers or germline clones of <italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic>P1 </italic></sup>using a monoclonal antibody generated using the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of the Gurken protein (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). The egg chambers were also stained with phalloidin, which binds actin localized below the plasma membrane and serves to delineate the plasma membrane. In stage 10 wild type oocytes Gurken protein localizes at the anterior-dorsal part of the oocyte in close proximity to the oocyte nucleus in precisely the same region as the mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The mutant stage 10 oocytes also stains positive for Gurken, with the protein localized in the anterior-dorsal end of the oocyte (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Upon analysis of the anterior-dorsal part of the oocytes at higher magnification we observed Gurken at two different locations in the oocyte, in punctuate structures in the cytoplasm between the plasma membrane and the nucleus and at the plasma membrane at the anterior-dorsal end of the oocyte, co-localizing with actin, directly opposite the follicle cells or the nurse cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In the oocytes derived from the germline clones of <italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic> P1 </italic></sup>the cytoplasmic pool of Gurken protein was observed at the anterior-dorsal part of the oocyte in punctuate structures similar to the wild type oocytes but the Gurken protein amount at the plasma membrane was drastically reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Reduction in Gurken amount occurs in the part of the plasma membrane that is in direct apposition to the follicle cells and the nurse cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the observed changes in Gurken localization observed were due to differences in the focal plane in view, we analysed series of optical sections from different depths of the wild type oocytes (Fig. 2E<sup>S1-S4</sup>) and the mutant oocyte (Fig. 2F<sup>S1-S4</sup>). In all cases Gurken protein is excluded specifically from the plasma membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of Gurken Protein in Stage 10 Egg Chambers of Wild type and <italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic>P1 </italic></sup>Germline Clones</bold>. <italic>Drosophila </italic>egg chambers of the indicated genotype, wild type, (WT) or egg chambers mutant for sec61&#x003b2;, (sec61&#x003b2;), stained for actin using labelled Phalloidin (blue) and Gurken (red).

Taken together, these results demonstrate that egg chambers from the <italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic>P1 </italic></sup>germline clones have reduced levels of Gurken protein at the plasma membrane of the oocyte and in the surrounding follicle cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Gurken protein is also mis-localized during early oogenesis</title><p>Gurken protein signals to the EGF receptor on the follicle cells at two different stages of oogenesis. During late oogenesis (stage 10&#x02013;11) Gurken signals to follicle cells at the anterior-dorsal end of the oocyte. During earlier stages of oogenesis (stages 6&#x02013;9) the oocyte nucleus and the Gurken mRNA are localized at the posterior part of the oocyte with Gurken protein signalling to the posterior follicle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In order to investigate the localization of Gurken during early oogenesis we co-stained egg chambers during stage 6&#x02013;9 of oogenesis with the anti-Gurken antibody and with phalloidin. The Gurken protein in the wild type egg chambers is localized in punctuate cytoplasmic structures towards the posterior part of the oocyte (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

We wanted to further characterise this defect and to test the actual process of ER translocation using HeLa cells. Previous studies have also utilized the mammalian cell cultures system for investigating trafficking of EGFR ligands. Gurken and other EGF ligands such as Spitz and Keren can be expressed and secreted in mammalian cells. The process requires Star for ER exit and Rho for proteolytic processing, thus in part recapitulating the trafficking of EGFR ligands as it occurs in the fly system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Upon co-transfection with Myc-tagged Star the position of the band is unchanged. When HA-tagged Rho is transfected, Gurken shows faster migration, which most likely represents the intra-membrane cleaved form of Gurken. Gurken is glycosylated as inferred from its sensitivity to Endo-glycosidase H, EndoH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, right panel). Sensitivity to EndoH is retained even when Star and Rho are transfected along with Gurken indicating retention in the ER. Based on this data we think in this cell type Star does not cause an extensive Gurken export from the ER and Rho is able to process the Gurken within the ER. Expression of Star and Rhomboid was confirmed by western blot analysis using the anti-Myc and anti-HA antibody respectively (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Gurken in HeLa cells</bold>.

As a control, a plasmid designed to generate a scrambled double stranded RNA oligo was also transfected. Three days after the initial transfection the cells were re-transfected with the Sec61&#x003b2; siRNA plasmid or the control siRNA plasmid, together with the expression plasmids for Gurken, Star and Rho. One day after the second round of transfections (and four days after the initial round of transfection) Sec61&#x003b2; protein is no longer detected by western blotting in cells transfected with the Sec61&#x003b2; siRNA plasmid, whereas cells transfected with the control plasmid retain normal level of Sec61&#x003b2; protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Expression of Star and Rho is confirmed by western blot analysis using the anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies respectively (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p><p>ER translocation of Gurken was investigated as follows: a pulse analysis using <sup>35</sup>S-methionine was performed and the cells were harvested for immuno-precipitation and western blotting. The actual process of translocation and availability of Gurken for post-translocational processing was determined by the extent of glycosylated protein. Correctly translocated Gurken would be glycosylated in the ER, on the other hand, conditions affecting translocation or downstream events would result in a species of Gurken that is unavailable for glycosylation.</p><p>The cell lysates after <sup>35</sup>S-methionine pulse were probed with antibody against the Gurken protein (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Gurken is visible in the processed, faster migrating form in control cell lysates and lysates with depeleted Sec61&#x003b2; protein. Gurken is EndoH sensitive in cells with normal and reduced Sec61&#x003b2; protein, hence glycosylated and present in the ER (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Guken protein was immuno-precipitated from control and Sec61&#x003b2; depleted cells; half of the immuno-precipitated sample was treated with EndoH and the other half was left untreated, both the samples were applied to SDS-PAGE. We observe that in lanes representing control and Sec61&#x003b2; depleted cells without EndoH treatment, the majority of Gurken protein runs as a single band along with minor lower molecular weight bands. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, left half). Majority of the Gurken protein is also glycosylated since after EndoH treatment it runs at lower molecular weight (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, right half). It is important to note that the relative ratios of the glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of Gurken protein (1 g and 0 g respectively) does not change in the absence of Sec61&#x003b2;. Thus, the translocation of Gurken into the ER and post-translocational processes such as glycoslation are not affected by the reduced level of Sec61&#x003b2;. These experiments also show that cleavage of Gurken is unaffected by reduced amounts of Sec61&#x003b2;, suggesting that Rho is translocated and functional (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).</p><p>Taking together the data from co-staining in the oocytes and experiments in HeLa cells it seems that Gurken translocation into the ER and its post-translational modifications remain unaffected by lack of Sec61&#x003b2;.

In order to investigate this further and we wanted to analyse the sub-cellular localization of Gurken in greater detail.

We therefore wanted to analyse the possible post-translocational steps in Gurken transport that could be affected by lack of Sec61&#x003b2;. Recent data suggests that Sec61&#x003b2; interacts with the components of the exocyst machinery in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The exocyst complex is a multi-protein vesicle-tethering complex localized at the plasma membrane that plays a role in polarised protein transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Directional transport of Gurken to the plasma membrane requires the exocyst complex. Germline clones of a hypomorphic allele of a subunit of the exocyst complex, sec5<sup>E13</sup>, shows lack of Gurken at the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic accumulation of Gurken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

Reduced Gurken signalling in these oocytes results in embryonic lethality with severe defects in anterio-posterior axis determination. The surprising observation made in our study was that the defect in Gurken transport to the plasma membrane occurs not during ER translocation but during a later step in the transport process.</p></sec><sec><title>Sec61&#x003b2; affects post-ER transport of Gurken to the plasma membrane</title><p>Having observed that the Gurken transport to the plasma membrane is affected in sec61&#x003b2; mutant oocytes we wanted to determine the step in the transport pathway that is affected by the absence of Sec61&#x003b2;. In the first set of experiments we investigated the possible role of Sec61&#x003b2; in ER translocation of Gurken using mammalian cells in culture. The mammalian cell system has been previously characterised to recapitulate the trafficking of EGFR ligands like Gurken and Spitz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Gurken is a transmembrane protein with a signal sequence and would require the Sec61 channel for the ER translocation. The ER translocation of Gurken, as determined by comparing the relative amounts of glycosylated and un-glycosylated <sup>35</sup>S Methionine labelled protein, was unaffected by the absence of Sec61&#x003b2;. We also observed that post-translocational events co-ordinated with translocation, such as glycosylation, remain unperturbed by the absence of Sec61&#x003b2;. Hence we confirm the previous observations that Sec61&#x003b2; indeed does not affect the ER translocation of Gurken. We also observed that the proteolytic processing of Gurken by Rho occurred even in the absence of Sec61&#x003b2;, suggesting an ER translocated and functional Rho.</p><p>Immuno-fluorescence data from oocytes revealed the cytosolic fraction of the Gurken protein in both wild type and sec61&#x003b2; mutant oocytes was intermingled with ER, as concluded from the co-staining with Boca, whereas the punctate Gurken structures contain the Golgi marker Lva. Similar results were obtained when Gurken was co-localized with Golgi marker, <italic>p{sqh-EYFP-Golgi}</italic>. Thus in the sec61&#x003b2; mutant oocytes Gurken is able to traffic till the Golgi complex, however further transport to the plasma membrane is impeded. The cytoplasmic punctuate organization of Gurken has been reported previously and shown to also contain dCOG, a component of the complex that tethers ER-derived vesicles to the Golgi membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is important to note that presence of the signal sequence suggests that Gurken most likely is co-translationally translocated into the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. If a delay in translocation due to lack of Sec61&#x003b2; was to occur this would result in concomitant delay in translation and would result in highly reduced amounts of the Gurken protein in the oocytes. In our studies the amount of protein in the wild type and mutant oocyte does not appear to be drastically different, thus providing additional evidence for normal ER translocation of Gurken in the absence of Sec61&#x003b2;.</p><p>Based on our data we think that Gurken transport to the plasma membrane occurs in two distinct steps. The first step is the translation of the localized Gurken mRNA followed by translocation into the ER and transport into the secretory pathway. Gurken is transported along the secretory pathway until it reaches the Golgi complex. This part of the Gurken transport process occurs independent of Sec61&#x003b2;. The second phase in the Gurken secretion is transport of Gurken from Golgi to the plasma membrane, which our results indicate, requires Sec61&#x003b2;.</p><p>As mentioned previously, there are two rounds of Gurken signalling during oogenesis. The first round of Gurken signalling occurs during the stage 7 of oogenesis, where Gurken signalling to the posterior follicle cells causes them to take the posterior fate. The follicle cells reciprocate the Gurken signalling from the oocyte by sending an as yet unknown signal back to the oocyte resulting in repolarization of the microtubule skeleton within the oocyte. This event is necessary for the migration of the nucleus to the anterior portion of the oocyte towards the later stages (stage 9) of oogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Although we observed the defect in the Gurken trafficking during the early stages of oogenesis we did not investigate the fate of the posterior follicle cells in the <italic>sec61&#x003b2;</italic><sup><italic>P1 </italic></sup>mutant oocytes. However, the migration of the nucleus to the anterior end of the oocyte was not affected, leading us to conclude that defect in Gurken trafficking at this stage does not result in a significant phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Sec61&#x003b2; beyond ER translocation during Gurken Transport</title><p>A hint at the post-ER function of Sec61&#x003b2; comes from two independent studies in mammalian cells in culture and in yeast. These studies report that Sec61&#x003b2; could physically and genetically interact with the members of the exocyst complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Exocyst is a complex of eight proteins that associate with the plasma membrane and localise to the regions of membrane addition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition it has also been reported that Gurken transport to the plasma membrane requires the exocyst complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Germline clones of a hypomorphic allele of Sec5 (<italic>sec5</italic><sup><italic>E13</italic></sup>), a subunit of the exocyst complex, results in accumulation of Gurken in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that Gurken transport requires the Sec61&#x003b2;-exocyst interaction and in absence of either of the two components Gurken is no longer transported to the plasma membrane. Various studies have indeed identified components of the exocyst at the ER, the interaction being cell and substrate dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We did not observe changes in the plasma membrane localization of Sec5 or presence of Sec5 at the ER in sec61&#x003b2; mutant oocytes. We believe that this is presumably due to the transient nature of the interactions and due to the fact that the exocyst contains sub-complexes that actually disassemble from the plasma membrane and Sec5 may not be part of this complex in the oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Sec61&#x003b2; required for a specific transport step</title><p>The critical role of Gurken in development has mandated several regulatory steps in biosynthesis. The highly polarized Gurken transport process begins by localization of the Gurken mRNA at the anterior-dorsal end of the oocyte; this step is necessary but not sufficient to achieve polar transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Local translation of Gurken at the anterior-dorsal end of the oocyte translocates it into a ER that spans the entire oocyte. Mechanisms exit in the secretory pathway to prevent diffusion of the Gurken protein during its transport from the extended ER to the plasma membrane; these include selection of defined ER exit sites, specific interactions with specific cargo receptors and interactions with the exocyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Transport along the secretory pathway involves export of Gurken protein from the ER a process mediated by Cornichon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In our study we observe that even in the absense of Sec61&#x003b2; Gurken could be exported to the Golgi. This indicates that Cornichon is functional in the oocytes. This data also suggests that Star, another ER export factor, is also functional in these ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It is important to note this since both these proteins are transmembrane proteins and the fact that they are able to mediate Gurken export out of the ER and hence are functional which indicates that Sec61&#x003b2; does not affect the ER translocation of Star or Cornichon. The next step in the Gurken secretion process is its cleavage by the protease Rho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. While we could not analyse the cleavage state of Gurken in sec61&#x003b2; mutant ovaries, data from experiments in cultured cells show that even in the absence of Sec61&#x003b2; Rho is indeed able to cleave Gurken. In this system we also observe that the majority of the Gurken protein retains the ER specific glycosylation indicating continued retention in the ER. It is, however, still a substrate for Rho dependent cleavage. Processing of Gurken in the ER has previously been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In mediating the traffic of different membrane proteins Sec61&#x003b2; seems to have a specific role in Gurken transport. The specificity of the role is illustrated by the observation that Yolkless does not require Sec61&#x003b2; for plasma membrane transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The role of Sec61&#x003b2; can be compared to that of Cornichon for Gurken transport and Boca for traffic of the LDL family of proteins. Both these protein like Sec61&#x003b2; are needed for the correct transport of individual proteins and appear to be present at an earlier stage of secretion. Gurken is retained in the oocyte in cornichon mutants although vitellogenesis proceeds normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Boca on the other hand is required for the trafficking of Yolkless and other LDL receptor family proteins but does not influence Gurken traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. All these factors are highly specific for certain proteins and do not seem to affect the general transport machinery. Although the role of Sec61&#x003b2; in Gurken transport seem to be indeed specific, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of an indirect effect where Sec61&#x003b2; affects translocation of a factor that is required in Golgi to plasma membrane transport of Gurken.</p><p>In development of an organism inter-cellular signalling occurs primarily by the interaction of transmembrane or secreted ligands with transmembrane receptors. Signalling is also initiated when secreted molecules interact with receptors at a considerable distance from the source of the secreted ligand. Therefore precise intra-cellular trafficking of secreted molecules, ligands and receptors is essential for proper signalling and thus development of the tissue. Signalling by the EGFR ligands is an example illustrating regulation during secretion. A detailed study is required to determine the exact role of Sec61&#x003b2; in secretion of signalling molecules, however what seems to be clear is that the function may not be restricted to the ER. In addition, as demonstrated in the present study, Sec61&#x003b2; appears to provide a fine-tuning in trafficking of specific ligands. This study also illustrates that use of a sensitive in-vivo assay like Gurken signalling in addition to in-vitro systems can provide greater insight into the process of protein translocation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Sec61 channel is the only known protein translocation channel in the ER and is conserved in evolution. In this study we have established the role of the &#x003b2; subunit of the channel during plasma membrane traffic of the TGF&#x003b1;-like growth factor, Gurken, during Drosophila oogenesis. Gurken signalling is responsible for early patterning in the embryo, absence of Sec61&#x003b2; and the subsequent defects in Gurken trafficking result in dorsalization of the embryo due to reduced Gurken signalling.

Confocal data were acquired as single images or image stacks of multi-tracked, separate channels with a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Design of siRNA Constructs in pSupressor</title><p>Sec61&#x003b2; siRNAs were designed and cloned into pSupressor as described in the manufacturer's protocols (Imgenex, San Diego).</p><p>The Sec61&#x003b2; oligo used was: TGTTCCAGTATTGGTTATGA</p><p>A scrambled sequence was used as a control: TTAATTTCTGGGAGCTTATG The sequence is identical to both human Sec61&#x003b2; genes, at the 5' untranslated region. The oligo contained an intervening sequence that forms the stem-loop structure in the RNA and includes a ScaI site for identification of recombinants. The oligo pair was annealed at 20 &#x003bc;M in annealing buffer (100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 2 mM magnesium acetate) at 95&#x000b0;C for 4 min, followed by incubation at 70&#x000b0;C for 10 min and slow cooling to room temperature. Forty picomoles of annealed oligos were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase before they were ligated into pSupressor vector digested by SalI and XbaI.</p></sec><sec><title>Transfection and biochemical analysis</title><p>HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and Penicillin and Streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfections in HeLa cells were done using Lipofectamine-2000 following the manufactures protocol (Invitrogen). 3 &#x003bc;g of each of the plasmid was used for per 10 cm cell culture petriplate containing 70&#x02013;80% confluent cells. After three days of the first transfection a second transfection was done using the same set of plasmids.</p><p>Cells were scrapped off the petriplates and lysis buffer was added [1% Triton, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, supplemented with protease inhibitory cocktail (Roche). SDS-PAGE and western blotting were done following standard protocols. Endoglycosidase H (Endo-H, New England Biolabs) treatment was done as per manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies used for western blotting were rabbit anti-<italic>Drosophila </italic>Sec61&#x003b2; (peptide used corresponds to amino acid 2&#x02013;10 of the Drosophila sequence, PAPPSSTSV-C), anti-human Sec61&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], anti-Gurken 1D12 (Hybridoma bank), anti-Myc and anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotech).</p><p>For pulse analysis, cells were depleted of endogenous methionine and cysteine by growing cells in DMEM without methionine and cysteine for two hours before incubation with 100&#x003bc;Ci of <sup>35</sup>S labeled methionine and cysteine per 10 cm petriplate. The cells were pulsed for 10 minutes, washed with PBS, scraped off the plates and lysis buffer was added. Proteins were immuno-precipitated, and applied to SDS-PAGE after treatment with Endo H treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AK conceived the project and did all the experiments.
