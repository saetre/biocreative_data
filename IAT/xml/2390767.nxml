MYC is thought to induce cancer through an exaggerated effect on these physiologic programs. Which of these genes are responsible for the ability of MYC to initiate and/or maintain tumorigenesis is not clear. Previously, we have shown that upon brief MYC inactivation, some tumors undergo sustained regression. Here we demonstrate that upon MYC inactivation there are global permanent changes in gene expression detected by microarray analysis. By applying StepMiner analysis, we identified genes whose expression most strongly correlated with the ability of MYC to induce a neoplastic state. Notably, genes were identified that exhibited permanent changes in mRNA expression upon MYC inactivation. Importantly, permanent changes in gene expression could be shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to be associated with permanent changes in the ability of MYC to bind to the promoter regions. Our list of candidate genes associated with tumor maintenance was further refined by comparing our analysis with other published results to generate a gene signature associated with MYC-induced tumorigenesis in mice. To validate the role of gene signatures associated with MYC in human tumorigenesis, we examined the expression of human homologs in 273 published human lymphoma microarray datasets in Affymetrix U133A format. One large functional group of these genes included the ribosomal structural proteins. In addition, we identified a group of genes involved in a diverse array of cellular functions including: BZW2, H2AFY, SFRS3, NAP1L1, NOLA2, UBE2D2, CCNG1, LIFR, FABP3, and EDG1. Hence, through our analysis of gene expression in murine tumor models and human lymphomas, we have identified a novel gene signature correlated with the ability of MYC to maintain tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The targeted inactivation of oncogenes may be a specific and effective treatment of cancer. However, how oncogene inactivation leads to tumor regression is not clear. Previously, we have shown that even the brief inactivation of the MYC oncogene can result in the sustained regression of at least some tumors. To understand the mechanism, we have utilized several novel genomic analyses to define a set of genes that strongly correlate with the ability of the MYC oncogene to maintain tumorigenesis. First, we generated a novel data set from microarray analyses of murine tumors that we analyzed by StepMiner to identify discrete step changes in gene expression after the inactivation or the reactivation of the MYC oncogene. Second, we utilized Boolean Network Analysis to further define the subset of genes highly correlated with MYC in human tumorigenesis. Third, we utilized ChIP analysis to demonstrate that in many cases the permanent changes of gene expression we uncovered were associated with changes in the ability of MYC to occupy the promoter locus. Our general strategy could be similarly utilized in other experimental model systems to understand how specific oncogenes contribute to the maintenance of tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Overexpression of MYC is one of the most frequent events in human tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Janz1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, it seems likely that changes in gene expression programs, rather than individual genes, account for the phenotypic consequences of MYC inactivation. Consistent with this notion, MYC has recently been shown to globally influence chromatin structure through histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Bouchard1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Frank1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have reported that MYC inactivation in tumors induces specific global changes in histone modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Wu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Although many MYC target genes have been identified in various cells or tissue contexts (summarized in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.myc-cancer-gene.org">http://www.myc-cancer-gene.org</ext-link>), it is hard to discern which of the many of MYC targets are associated with the ability of MYC to initiate and/or sustain tumorigenesis.</p><p>Many previous studies have examined changes in gene expression associated with the induction of MYC expression in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Dang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Dang2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Coller1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-OConnell1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Other groups have performed comparative analysis of gene expression profiles between murine constitutive MYC-induced tumors and human tumors in liver and prostate cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-EllwoodYen1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Lee1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Both of these analyses identified similarities in gene expression between MYC-induced tumor models and human tumors. Although revealing, these studies would not necessarily identify gene products that are responsible for the ability of MYC to induce tumorigenesis. We speculated that by analyzing gene expression profiles in tumors generated from conditional transgenic models would allow us to identify gene expression signature specifically associated with the ability of MYC to initiate and maintain tumorigenesis. We performed microarrays on mRNA samples from a time-course experiment with MYC inactivated and then reactivated in osteosarcoma. The expression data was then examined using the StepMiner algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Sahoo1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> to generate a list of genes associated with MYC-induced tumorigenesis in osteosarcomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000090-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The StepMiner algorithm analyzes microarray time courses by identifying genes that undergo abrupt transitions in expression level, and the time at which the transitions occur. Importantly, by ChIP we were able to demonstrate that permanent changes in gene expression were frequently associated with measurable alterations in the ability of MYC to bind to the promoter regions of these genes in osteosarcomas. Furthermore, gene expression profiles were compared between osteosarcomas and the previously published MYC conditional pancreatic tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Lawlor1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> to generate a common gene signature associated with MYC-induced tumorigenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000090-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Finally, Boolean analysis was used to further examine the correlation between levels of expression of this identified subset of genes among the published dataset of 7,171 human microarrays in U133A format. From this analysis, we were able to deduce a list of genes strongly correlated with the ability of MYC to maintain tumorigenesis.</p><fig id="pgen-1000090-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000090.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of our general strategy to define a gene signature associated with the ability of MYC to initiate and maintain tumorigenesis.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000090.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MYC Inactivation and Reactivation Induces Global Changes in Gene Expression Identified by the StepMiner Algorithm</title><p>The MYC induced osteosarcoma derived cell line, 1325, was grown <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Jain1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and treated with 20ng/ml of doxycycline in complete DMEM medium for various length of time to inactivate MYC expression.

Ribosomal genes could play important function in influencing protein translation and thus in this manner influence the ability of MYC to function as an oncogene. In this regard, it is notable that a recent study in Zebra fish identified some ribosomal protein genes as tumor-suppressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Amsterdam1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, it is not clear how ribosomal structural protein genes function as tumor-suppressors during tumorigenesis.</p><p>Interestingly, changes in the gene expression of ribosomal structural proteins, although observed in both our model of MYC induced osteosarcoma and lymphoma, were not seen in a model of pancreatic islet cell tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000090-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000090-g008">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Lawlor1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>). Thus, it is possible that ribosomal protein genes expression play a role MYC-induced tumorigenesis only in specific types of cancer. We are reassured of the likely importance of ribosomal gene products in MYC associated tumorigenesis for we were able to confirm that MYC and ribosomal structural proteins are highly correlated in human lymphomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000090.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000090.s005">S5</xref>). It remains to be directly determined if these ribosomal genes are playing a role in MYC induced tumorigenesis.</p><p>Genes that we identified as most strongly correlated with MYC-induced tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000090-g009">Figure 9</xref>) in mice are involved in diverse biological processes such as transcription regulation, RNA processing, proliferation, fatty acid transport and cell signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000090-g011">Figure 11</xref>).

However, we recognize that it is very unlikely that any of the individual genes we identified are sufficient alone to explain the ability of MYC to initiate or maintain tumorigenesis. Rather it is highly likely that it is a constellation of gene expression changes that are responsible for the ability of MYC to maintain tumorigenesis.</p><p>We can now offer a possible explanation for why the brief inactivation of MYC can result in the permanent loss of the ability of MYC to sustain tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Jain1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. MYC inactivation appears to result in permanent changes in the ability of MYC to function as a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000090-g012">Figure 12</xref>). Recently, we have shown that MYC inactivation induced chromatin modifications associated with cellular senescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Wu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The particular structural state of chromatin has been shown to influence the ability of MYC to bind to specific promoter loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Guccione1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, our results illustrate that upon MYC inactivation there were permanent changes in the ability of MYC to bind to the promoters of specific gene loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000090-g007">Figure 7</xref>). It remains to be determined the mechanism of these changes in chromatin structure. One possibility is that MYC itself is contributing to changes in chromatin structure through global changes in chromatin modifications, which seems an attractive possibility based upon the work from many laboratories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Wu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Knoepfler1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Frank2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Regardless of the mechanism, our results point to the fact that the genes that MYC can regulate are different in different cellular contexts and that this appears to have a direct bearing on when MYC overexpression results in a neoplastic phenotype. We note that we could not explain all of the permanent changes in gene expression based upon differences in MYC binding to promoter loci. Thus, it is likely there are additional mechanisms by which MYC's ability to regulate gene expression has been altered.</p><fig id="pgen-1000090-g012" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000090.g012</object-id><label>Figure 12</label><caption><title>An illustration for a possible mechanism for permanent changes of gene expression upon MYC inactivation in osteosarcomas.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000090.g012"/></fig><p>One of the biggest challenges in understanding how MYC contributes to tumorigenesis has been to address the conundrum that MYC has both direct and indirect influence on the expression of so many different genes and these genes are involved in a multitude of biologic functions. Many of these genes may not be relevant to how MYC overexpression contributes to tumorigenesis. Here we have illustrated by using a defined transgenic mouse model that exhibits conditional tumorigenesis such that upon MYC inactivation tumor cells permanently loses a neoplastic phenotype that we can define a specific gene list that is specifically correlated with MYC's ability to maintain tumorigenesis. To perform this analysis we combined two novel methods of gene expression analysis, the StepMiner and the Boolean analysis, as a powerful strategy to perform an unbiased comparative analysis of microarray data from conditional MYC-induced tumor models and all the available published human data with Affymetrix U133A format. Our strategy may be generally useful for the identification of gene signatures associated with the ability of specific oncogenes to initiate and sustain tumorigenesis and the identification of potential new therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture, Doxycycline Treatment, and Rate of Protein Synthesis</title><p>Osteosarcoma-derived cell line 1325 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000090-Jain1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> were cultured with DMEM medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS, 1&#x00025; Pen/Strep, L-Glutamine, and non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen).
