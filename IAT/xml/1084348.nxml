In some muscle diseases, progressive loss of muscle function may be due at least in part to a decreasing rate of repair that becomes insufficient to replace lost myofibers. The mononucleate cells in skeletal muscle include the relatively abundant muscle satellite cells and their myoblast progeny, as well as infiltrating inflammatory cells and the much less numerous muscle stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In this study, we examine how different subsets of muscle-derived mononucleate cells are affected in the diseased skeletal muscles of laminin-&#x003b1;2-deficient (<italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) and dystrophin-deficient (<italic>mdx</italic>) mice. We examined these two diseases because both the extracellular laminin-&#x003b1;2 and the intracellular dystrophin proteins interact with the dystroglycan complex of membrane proteins, yet the pathologies of the two diseases are significantly different.</p><p>Mice lacking laminin-&#x003b1;2 due to mutations in the <italic>Lama2 </italic>gene have greatly shortened lifespan, poor muscle growth, and poor muscle regeneration compared to normal littermates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Laminin-&#x003b1;2 is a subunit of the basement membrane component known as merosin (or laminin 2/4) and is highly expressed in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice are a model for the severely disabling human disease, primary laminin-&#x003b1;2-deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy Type 1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which is also known as merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>mdx </italic>mice carry a point mutation in the dystrophin gene that leads to loss of functional dystrophin protein. Muscle pathology in 2&#x02013;4 month old <italic>mdx </italic>mice is characterized by widespread muscle fiber degeneration and regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Unlike <italic>Lama2</italic>-null mice, <italic>mdx </italic>mice have almost normal life spans and their muscles show evidence of continuing, successful regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The human disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, is also caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene.</p><p>For this study, we classified mononucleate cells derived from skeletal muscles based on expression of two cell surface proteins: Sca-1 and CD45. Sca-1 (<underline>S</underline>tem <underline>c</underline>ell <underline>a</underline>ntigen 1) was first described as a hematopoietic stem cell marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and subsequently found to be expressed by a rare subset of the mononucleate cells in skeletal muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. CD45 is a cell surface tyrosine phosphatase found on all nucleated cells of hematopoietic origin and is also found on rare muscle-derived cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The expression patterns of these two proteins define four subsets of cells. The double-negative subset includes muscle satellite cells and their myoblast progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The double-positive subset includes cells that appear to be multi-potential stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>subset includes infiltrating inflammatory cells; and different subsets of this heterogeneous group of cells are found in dystrophin-deficient and laminin-&#x003b1;2-deficient muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>- </sup>subset includes cells with myogenic and endothelial potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies suggested that satellite cells and their myoblast progeny have higher than normal proliferation in <italic>mdx </italic>muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], but proliferation rates in <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscles had not been well studied. In addition, it was known that injury induced by cardiotoxin leads to an increase in the CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells in skeletal muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. No previous studies, however, had examined how dystrophin-deficiency and laminin-&#x003b1;2-deficiency might alter the proliferation and composition of different subsets of muscle-derived mononucleate cells. In this study, therefore, we examined proliferation rates and compositions of the Sca-1 and CD45 defined subsets of skeletal muscle cells. Our results show that dystrophic muscles (both <italic>mdx </italic>and <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) have a similarly increased percentage of CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells compared to muscles of wild-type mice. Furthermore, we found that most cell subsets in <italic>mdx </italic>muscles <italic>in vivo </italic>had increased proliferation relative to normal muscles, whereas most cell subsets in <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscles had lower than normal proliferation. The contrasting proliferation profiles of the different subsets of mononucleate cells in dystrophin-deficient and laminin-&#x003b1;2-deficient muscles may explain aspects of the distinct pathologies of the two diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice, breeding, and genotyping</title><p>For dystrophin-deficient muscles, we used mice of the C57BL/10ScSn-<italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup>/J genotype (<italic>mdx</italic>); and as a normal muscle control for the dystrophin-deficient mice, we used C57BL/10ScSn mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor ME). For laminin-&#x003b1;2-deficient muscles, we used mice that carry a targeted LacZ insertion that inactivates the <italic>Lama2 </italic>gene which encodes laminin-&#x003b1;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This targeted allele is termed <italic>dy-W </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Heterozygous <italic>Lama2</italic><sup><italic>dy</italic>-<italic>W</italic>/+ </sup>mice were a gift of Dr. Eva Engvall (Burnham Institute, La Jolla CA). Breeding of these heterozygotes in our laboratory was used to obtain homozygous, laminin-&#x003b1;2-null (<italic>Lama2 </italic><sup>-/-</sup>) progeny, as well as heterozygous (<italic>Lama2</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) and normal (<italic>Lama2</italic><sup>+/+</sup>) littermates. Littermates were genotyped by analysis of the <italic>Lama2</italic><sup><italic>dy</italic>-<italic>W </italic></sup>targeted mutation and the wild-type allele by PCR of DNA obtained from tail biopsies as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Muscles from normal littermates served as controls for <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscles. The <italic>Lama</italic><sup><italic>2dy</italic>-<italic>W</italic>/<italic>dy</italic>-<italic>W </italic></sup>homozygotes express only very small amounts of a truncated laminin-&#x003b1;2 that lacks domain VI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and they have a severe neuromuscular disease in which about most mice die by 6 weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Boston Biomedical Research Institute.</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle cell isolation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting</title><p>To prepare cells for FACS, <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>(n = 3 at 3 weeks old), <italic>mdx </italic>(n = 2 at 4 weeks old or n = 3 at 7.5 week old), and the appropriate normal control mice (n = 2 for 4 week old controls and n = 3 for 3 week and 7.5 week old controls) were injected intra-peritoneally with 100 &#x003bc;l of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (BrdU Flow Kit, BD Biosciences) solution (1 mg/ml in PBS) at 24 hours and again at 16 hours before sacrifice. Limb muscles were dissected, cleaned, and thoroughly minced. The tissue was digested in 0.2% Pronase (Calbiochem) in HBSS at 37&#x000b0;C for one hour and successively passed through nylon mesh filters with cut-offs of 100 &#x003bc;m, 40 &#x003bc;m, and 10 &#x003bc;m. After the final filtering, cells were re-suspended in 3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in PBS. Biotinylated Sca-1 antibody (E13-161.7) and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated CD45 antibody (clone 30-F11) (both from Pharmingen, San Diego CA) were added to the cells at a concentration of 2 &#x003bc;g/ml, and the cells were incubated on ice for one hour. Cells were washed in PBS and incubated with the secondary detecting reagent, allophycocyanin (APC)-streptavidin, at 1 &#x003bc;g/ml for 20 minutes on ice. After three additional washes in PBS, the cells were fixed for 30 minutes with a DPBS buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde and the detergent saponin, then washed and stored overnight in staining buffer (from the BrdU flow kit) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum.</p><p>The following day, cells were refixed as above, treated with 300 &#x003bc;g /ml DNase for one hour at 37&#x000b0;C, incubated for 20 minutes with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated anti-BrdU antibody at a 1:50 dilution of the stock solution provided with the kit, and stained with 20 &#x003bc;l of a DNA binding dye, 7-amino-actinomycinD (7-AAD) (BrdU flow kit) for 1 hour. Separate aliquots of cells were stained with appropriate isotype control antibodies and used as negative controls. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a dual-laser cell sorter (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) to determine the distribution and proliferation dynamics of the muscle-derived cells. Cell Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Debris was first gated out by analyzing particle morphology based on side and forward scatter. <italic>In vivo </italic>proliferation was determined by analyzing the percent of all the cells that incorporated BrdU. Also, we determined the percent of cells within each sub-population that were BrdU positive.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Comparison among groups was done by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and individual differences between pairs was determined by unpaired two-tailed t-test performed with the Instat program (v2.03, GraphPad, San Diego CA). Statistical analyses were done either using raw data (prior to conversion to percentages) or using arcsin-transformed percentage data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Differences among the disease groups or between diseased and normal controls was considered significant when p &#x02264; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We used FACS analysis to identify subsets of the mononucleate cells that reside in skeletal muscle and then determined how the distribution of cells across the subsets was affected by disease. We identified the cell subsets based on expression or lack of expression of two cell surface markers: CD45 and Sca-1. Thus, we partitioned the muscle-derived cells into four subsets: Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup>, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>-</sup>, Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/Cd45<sup>+ </sup>and Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>-</sup>. Cells for sorting were obtained from muscles of <italic>mdx </italic>mice and their 10ScSn normal controls at 4 weeks and 7.5 weeks after birth and from muscles of <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and normal littermates at 3 weeks after birth. The respective myopathies are well in progress at these times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It was not possible to analyze older <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice for Sca-1 and CD45 expression, as most died by 5&#x02013;6 weeks of age and the small muscles did not consistently provide sufficient cells for the necessary FACS analyses.</p><p>We found that cells from muscles of the two types of normal control mice that we used (C57Bl/10ScSn at 4 and 7.5 weeks old for <italic>mdx </italic>and C57BL/6 at 3 weeks old for Lama 2<sup>-/-</sup>) had similar distributions of cells across the four cell subsets (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In all healthy muscles, the majority (&#x0003e;75% of the total) of mononucleate cells were negative for both Sca-1 and CD45. As noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], satellite cells and their myoblast progeny form multinucleate myotubes in culture, are Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>-</sup>, and thus are included in this double-negative subset. We confirmed this result, because we found that (i) the double-negative cells at the time of isolation also expressed CD34, as expected for quiescent satellite cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; (ii) &#x0003e;98% of the double-negative cells expressed desmin, an intermediate filament protein found in proliferating satellite cells, after 3 days in culture; and (iii) the double-negative cells were able to form myotubes in culture when switched to low serum medium (not shown). The rarest mononucleate cells (&#x0003c;1.5% of the total) in healthy muscles were those that expressed both Sca-1 and CD45. The remaining two cell subsets were more abundant than the double-positive cells, but still much less abundant than the double-negative cells. Cells that expressed Sca-1 but not CD45 amounted to 2.5 &#x02013; 12% of the total in healthy muscles; and cells that expressed CD45 but not Sca-1 amounted to 4.7 &#x02013; 8.3% of the total. The two Sca-1<sup>+ </sup>subsets were more abundant in the 3 and 4 week old than in the 7.5 week old healthy muscles.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The composition of mononucleate cells was altered in <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>mdx </italic>diseased muscles compared to healthy muscles.

The changes in the percentage of cells in each subset were similar for cells derived from <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>mdx </italic>muscles.</p><p>In particular, the rarest subset of double-positive CD45<sup>+</sup>/Sca-1<sup>+ </sup>cells composed a significantly higher percentage of the mononucleate cells in diseased muscles (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The percentage of double-positive cells was increased 3&#x02013;5X in diseased compared to healthy muscles. As one example, the double-positive cells amounted to 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.4% of the total cells from diseased Lama2<sup>-/- </sup>muscles, but only 1 &#x000b1; 0.4% of the cells from healthy C57BL/6 muscles (n = 3, P &#x0003c; 0.03).</p><p>The subset of CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells that did not express Sca-1, which was moderately abundant in healthy muscle and includes inflammatory cells, also accounted for a higher percentage of the total mononucleate cells in diseased muscles than in normal muscles (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In particular, the Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells accounted for a 5 &#x02013; 8X higher percentage of the mononucleate cells in diseased than in healthy muscles. As one example, the 7.5 week old <italic>mdx </italic>muscles had a 5.7-fold increase in Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells compared to healthy control muscle (28.9 &#x000b1; 3.6% of the cells in <italic>mdx </italic>samples <italic>vs</italic>. 5.1 &#x000b1; 0.2% in control muscles; n = 3, P &#x0003c; 0.01). These increased percentages reflect the increased numbers of inflammatory cells that are known to occur in the skeletal muscles of these disease models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>inflammatory cells are known to be heterogeneous (<italic>e. g</italic>., macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, B-cells, T-cells; all of which are Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup>); and the subsets of inflammatory cells that are present differ between dystrophin-deficient and laminin-&#x003b1;2-deficient muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Because these different subsets of inflammatory cells have been well-characterized in dystrophin-deficient and laminin-&#x003b1;2-deficient muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we did not re-examine this heterogeneity for this study. The increased percentage of CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells in diseased muscles was accompanied by a significantly decreased percentage of cells in the most abundant double-negative subset, whereas the percentage of cells in the Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>- </sup>subset was unchanged by disease (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Thus, in both dystrophin-deficient and laminin-&#x003b1;2-deficient diseased muscles, the double negative cells, which included satellite cells and their myoblast progeny, became relatively less abundant, whereas cells expressing the hematopoietic marker CD45 became relatively more abundant. As in previous studies, however, the absolute number of Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>- </sup>cells (muscle precursor cells) obtained from a given amount of <italic>mdx </italic>muscle was considerably larger than the number obtained from the same amount of control muscle, whereas fewer muscle precursor cells were obtained from <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>than control muscles. For example, in one experiment using muscles from 5&#x02013;6 week old <italic>mdx </italic>and control mice, healthy control muscles yielded 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>double-negative cells per gram (the number of cells that can be obtained decreases with increasing age), whereas <italic>mdx </italic>muscles yielded many more at 4.8 &#x000b1; 3.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>double-negative cells per gram (ave. &#x000b1; SD, n = 4). In contrast, in an experiment using muscles from 3 week old <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and control mice, we obtained 2.6 &#x000b1; 0.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>double-negative cells per gram of control muscle, but only 1.6 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>double-negative cells per gram of <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscle (ave. &#x000b1; SD, n = 3). Thus, the similar increases in the percentage of CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells in the two diseases occurred despite the different directions of change in total cell numbers.</p><p>Though both <italic>mdx </italic>and <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscles showed similar increases in CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells, the two diseases showed opposite changes in mononucleate cell proliferation. In muscles of the two control strains (C57Bl/6J, the control for <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscles; and C57BL/10ScSn, the control for <italic>mdx </italic>muscles), there was a similar several-fold decrease in BrdU incorporation from 3&#x02013;4 weeks to 7.5 weeks after birth, which is consistent with the slowing of muscle growth found during this postweaning period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). At both 4 weeks and 7.5 weeks after birth, BrdU incorporation was significantly higher in <italic>mdx </italic>than in control muscles of the same age (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In <italic>mdx </italic>muscles at 7.5 weeks after birth, for example, the percentage of all mononucleate cells that incorporated BrdU during 24 h <italic>in vivo </italic>was 6.9 &#x000b1; 2.6%, which was significantly higher than 1.9 &#x000b1; 1.1% that incorporated BrdU in the 10ScSn control muscles of the same age (n = 3, p &#x0003c; 0.05) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Consistent with this general increase of proliferation in <italic>mdx </italic>muscles, three of the four Sca-1/CD45 subsets of muscle-derived <italic>mdx </italic>cells showed increased BrdU incorporation, indicating a greater number of proliferating cells compared to normal controls.

In our study, we subdivided muscle-derived stem cells on the basis of expression or lack of expression of Sca-1, which is commonly used to purify hematopoietic stem cells, and CD45, which is a pan-hematopoietic cell marker. Neither Sca-1 nor CD45 is expressed by muscle satellite cells and their myoblast progeny (muscle precursor cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], whereas muscle-derived cells with hematopoietic potential are almost all CD45<sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Though the distribution of cells among the four cell subsets did not significantly change during early postnatal (3 to 7.5 weeks) development in normal muscles (compare controls in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), there was a significant shift in the distribution profile in response to muscle disease. Specifically, diseased muscles had a large increase in the percentage of cells in both CD45<sup>+ </sup>subsets, <italic>i. e</italic>., Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>and Sca-1-/ CD45<sup>+ </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The double-positive Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells were likely putative stem cells with hematopoietic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], whereas the Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells included the heterogeneous group of inflammatory cells. The increase in CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells was accompanied by a decrease in the double-negative Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>- </sup>cells, which included satellite cells and their myoblast progeny. Though the double-negative cells were usually the most abundant subset, we found that the Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>inflammatory cells became the most abundant subset in younger four week old <italic>mdx </italic>muscles, which is consistent with the rapid myofiber degeneration at this age.</p><p>A previous study showed that double-positive Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells also increase during regeneration of injured muscle and that a small proportion of the double-positive cells from injured muscle, unlike those from uninjured muscles, give rise to myogenic cells in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Diseased muscles tend to undergo extensive degeneration followed by attempted regeneration. At least initially, regeneration is largely successful in <italic>mdx </italic>muscles but abortive in <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Because the double-positive Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells increased in both types of diseased muscle (this study), it is likely that, as in injured muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], these cells play a role in attempted muscle regeneration.</p><p>In contrast to the similar increases in CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells in both types of diseased muscles, the mononucleate cells in <italic>mdx </italic>and <italic>Lama-2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscles showed opposite changes in proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>, with proliferation increased in <italic>mdx </italic>muscles but decreased in <italic>Lama-2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscles compared to healthy control muscles.</p><p>Total cell proliferation in <italic>mdx </italic>muscles was known to be elevated relative to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Here we examined proliferation in subsets of the muscle mononucleate cells and found that, consistent with the increase in overall proliferation, a higher than normal percentage of cells in three of the four <italic>mdx </italic>subsets incorporated BrdU. Both the double-negative cells, which included satellite cells, and the double-positive cells with hematopoietic potential, showed increased proliferation. Only cells of the Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>subset failed to show increased BrdU incorporation in <italic>mdx </italic>muscles; and these were likely to be mostly inflammatory cells (<italic>e. g</italic>., macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, T-cells; all of which are Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup>) which do not have hematopoietic stem cell potential but are known to migrate into and thus accumulate in diseased muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The increased percentage of proliferating <italic>mdx </italic>cells <italic>in vivo </italic>is likely due to the altered environment in <italic>mdx </italic>muscles which includes increased levels of growth factors; increased extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin which can promote myoblast proliferation; and perhaps decreased levels of growth inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Whether cells in different subsets respond to the same or different growth regulators remains to be determined.</p><p>In <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscles, overall BrdU incorporation was significantly decreased compared to that in healthy control muscles. BrdU incorporation was decreased in every <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cell subset except the rare double-positive Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>subset that includes cells with hematopoietic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The decrease could have arisen if, relative to normal cells, the <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells had longer cell cycles or lower probability of initiating replication from G<sub>0</sub>, if there was more cell death among dividing than non-dividing <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], or if some combination of these occurred. The relative lack of <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscle cell proliferation could in part explain why regeneration is relatively unsuccessful in laminin-&#x003b1;2-deficient muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], though other mechanisms such as increased apoptosis of both myoblasts and newly formed myofibers are also likely to be important.</p><p>Laminin-&#x003b1;2 is expressed in skeletal muscle myoblasts and myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] where it promotes the survival of satellite cells <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>as well as myoblast fusion and myotube formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We found that the most abundant, double-negative subset of muscle cells, which includes muscle precursor cells, showed significantly less BrdU incorporation in <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscles. It is likely, therefore, that laminin-&#x003b1;2 not only promotes survival of myotubes as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] but also influences division of muscle precursor cells as early as three weeks after birth, which is a time when extensive myofiber growth occurs in normal muscles. A recent study has demonstrated that laminin-2 (&#x003b1;2, &#x003b2;1, &#x003b3;1) improves proliferation of an epithelial cell line through an integrin/ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. A similar mechanism could occur in skeletal muscle cells, because merosin, of which laminin-&#x003b1;2 is a component, influences the level of expression and localization of &#x003b1;7&#x003b2; 1D integrin at the sarcolemma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and a lack of laminin-&#x003b1;2 could, therefore, disrupt merosin/integrin-mediated signals that regulate proliferation.</p><p>Pathogenesis follows distinct courses in <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>mdx </italic>mice, as well as in humans with corresponding diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Nonetheless, CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells are similarly increased in both mouse diseases. The role of the double-positive Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells in muscles needs to be defined, perhaps by tracing fates of their progeny; and the likely heterogeneity within the cell subsets we studied should be explored. For example, one study with a specific mAb suggested that satellite cells are &#x0003c;15% of the mononucleate cells in healthy, post-weaning skeletal muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], suggesting that there might be heterogeneity within the double-negative Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>- </sup>cell subset which we and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] found to contain more than half of the mononucleate cells and to contain satellite cells. Some differences between studies might be expected because assessment of cell type percentages likely depends on the particular enzymes used for tissue dissociation, the antibodies and staining protocols used, and the selection of fluorescent cut-off limits for cells sorting. Despite these caveats, the general agreement between our study of healthy <italic>vs</italic>. diseased muscles and an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] of healthy <italic>vs</italic>. cardiotoxin-injured muscles provides confidence in the conclusion that the CD45<sup>+ </sup>cell subsets become relatively more abundant in both injured muscles and in the two types of diseased muscles analyzed here.</p><p>Further experiments in which particular cell subsets have their fates determined by lineage tracking or are experimentally increased or decreased, perhaps by specific growth factors or conditional ablation, could determine how the changes in cell subsets that we observed here may affect pathogenesis. The Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>- </sup>cell subset, for example, has been reported to contain cells with myogenic and endothelial lineage potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Inhibition of apoptosis ameliorates myopathology and produces a several-fold increase in lifespan of <italic>Lama2-null </italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and could affect mononuclear cell subsets. That not only Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>- </sup>cells (which included satellite cells), but also other cell subsets, showed opposite changes of proliferation in <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>mdx </italic>muscle, suggests that growth requirements may be shared among the different subsets of cells. In addition, the relatively poor proliferation of <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>cells may be one of the mechanisms underlying the lack of successful regeneration in <italic>Lama2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>muscles.
