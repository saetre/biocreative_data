Null mutation of the PRL receptor (R) gene leads to female sterility due to a complete failure of embryo implantation. Pre-implantatory egg development, implantation and decidualization in the mouse appear to be dependent on ovarian rather than uterine PRLR expression, since progesterone replacement permits the rescue of normal implantation and early pregnancy. To better understand PRL receptor deficiency, we analyzed in detail ovarian and corpora lutea development of PRLR-/- females. The present study demonstrates that the ovulation rate is not different between PRLR+/+ and PRLR-/- mice. The corpus luteum is formed but an elevated level of apoptosis and extensive inhibition of angiogenesis occur during the luteal transition in the absence of prolactin signaling. These modifications lead to the decrease of LH receptor expression and consequently to a loss of the enzymatic cascades necessary to produce adequate levels of progesterone which are required for the maintenance of pregnancy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ovary</kwd><kwd>fertility</kwd><kwd>physiology</kwd><kwd>prolactin receptor</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Prolactin (PRL) is a multifunctional hormone involved in diverse processes such as luteal function and thus maintenance of the pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and has long been known for its luteotropic actions in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Hormonal responsiveness in the mammalian ovary involves complex cellular processes that are essential for organ function and which can be deleterious if inappropriately orchestrated. After ovulation, subsequent luteinization leads to the formation of the corpus luteum, which is an endocrine gland of limited lifespan. This resulting corpus luteum is a highly vascularized endocrine organ producing progesterone, essential for uterine preparation and maintenance of pregnancy. The granulosa cells remaining in the postovulatory follicle undergo luteinization, which involves exit of the cells from the cell cycle, cellular hypertrophy, acquisition of steroidogenic morphology, and expression of cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that female mice homozygous for a disruption of PRL receptor (PRLR) gene are infertile due to a failure of implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PRL mediates its action via a single receptor, which is present in the corpus luteum during pregnancy and is also expressed in the uterus later in the pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The PRL receptor is thus a key component regulating ovarian function and governing the regulation of progesterone secretion and, in fact PRL may trigger an early signal to induce the maintenance of the corpus luteum.</p><p>In rodents, semi-circadian surges of PRL secretion are induced by cervical stimuli, which are believed to be responsible for the conversion of the corpus luteum of pregnancy (CLP) from the corpus luteum (CL) of the cycle. The CLP secretes a sufficient progesterone amount to maintain pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The factors affecting sterility of PRLR-/- mice were attributed to multiple causes, in particular to the absence of sufficient progesterone to support implantation and subsequent placental development and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Since the corpus luteum is the unique source of progesterone production in rodents, progesterone administration is able to rescue preimplantation egg development and embryo implantation in PRLR-/- female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>To better understand PRL receptor deficiency, we analyzed in detail follicular development, the ovulation process and the subsequent expression of specific mRNAs of enzymes involved in steroid production using RT-PCR and <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization, in a time-dependent manner, during the first stages of early pregnancy of PRLR-/- females. The present study provides new evidence to support the importance of prolactin for survival of the luteal cells in pregnant mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental animals</title><p>Wild type and PRLR-/- female mice (129/Sv) were generated by intercrosses of heterozygous mice (PRLR+/-).

In contrast, PRLR-/- ovaries cells expressed very low levels of cyclin D2. Although initially decreased by LH, p27 did not reach high levels during the course of luteinization which was curtailed in this model. We also examined the expression of p21 in wild-type ovaries. It paralleled those of p27 but was not detectable in PRLR-/- ovaries (not shown). Therefore, ovulation induced rapid changes in the expression of p21, as well as cyclin D2 and p27, during the terminal differentiation of granulosa cells to luteal cells. This transition was greatly compromised in -/- ovaries.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>PRL has been shown to have a dual role in luteal function in the rat, with many studies demonstrating that PRL has a luteotrophic action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] but that it can also induce luteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. During pregnancy PRL and placental lactogens bind to the PRLR, and thus PRLR deficiency appears to be the best model to study the crucial action of PRL on the corpus luteum. Our investigations have lead us to conclude that although PRL is essential for maintenance of the corpus luteum during gestation, it is not necessary during folliculogenesis nor for ovulation and CL formation.</p><p>Irregular mating patterns of half of the PRLR-/- females indicating an alteration of estrous cyclicity have been previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We show here no alteration of the rhythmic periodicity of the estrous cycle on a pure genetic background of these mice suggesting that the regulatory mechanisms of estrogen synthesis are not impaired and that the absence of the PRL surge does not affect the length of luteal phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, the amount of oocytes recovered just after ovulation was not altered indicating that PRL deficiency does not preclude the presence of FSH and LH receptors, nor limit minor factors required for appropriate pituitary hormone responsiveness, providing strong evidence for an absence of a direct role of PRL in the mechanisms of ovulation.</p><p>Previous investigations demonstrated that PRL exhibited dual roles, leading to DNA degradation in rat corpora lutea at proestrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] while acting as an anti-apoptotic agent in functional CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Cells of PRLR-/- CL failed to organize appropriately and underwent dramatic apoptosis, clearly demonstrating the anti apoptotic role of PRL in agreement with a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Proliferation of endothelial cells is required for the neovascularization during luteal development which results in the corpus luteum's extensive capillary network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the rat, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] it has been shown that PRL secretion, induced by mating leads to increased endothelial cell proliferation in the CL of pregnancy. Its survival beyond diestrus depends on PRL stimulation and it is associated with an increase in luteal size and vascularization. In the PRLR-/- CL, such a vascularization failed to develop and thus the presence of the PRLR appears to be crucial for the induction of vascular factors.</p><p>The PRLR mediates LHR mRNA expression and thus plays an essential role in progesterone production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The signaling mechanism by which PRL increases the LHR expression is still not known. We demonstrated that in the complete absence of PRL signaling, LHR mRNA expression failed to increase. The changes in LH receptor mRNA parallel those in LH binding activity during ovarian cell differentiation, indicating that regulation of LH receptor mRNA is a major determinant in the expression of LH receptor numbers in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The luteinization process involves exit of the cells from the cell cycle, cellular hypertrophy, acquisition of steroidogenic morphology, and expression of cytochrome P450scc. It has been reported that in order for estradiol or LH to cause cholesterol accumulation in the cycling CL, previous exposure to lactogens is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] although PRL alone can increase luteal levels of cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This is not the rate-limiting step in progesterone secretion <italic>in vivo </italic>because HDL receptor knockout mice, which are infertile, secrete normal amounts of progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As a consequence of the low level of LHR expression, numerous enzymes involved in steroidogenesis and known to be under LH control such as StAR, P450scc, 3-&#x003b2; HSD are severely reduced. Since StAR is a key of steroidogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the StAR deficient female exhibit a markedly decreased level of circulating progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Moreover it has been shown that the human 3&#x003b2;-HSD promoter is activated by PRL through the Stat 5 response element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] demonstrating that PRL has the ability to regulate expression of a key human enzyme gene (type II 3&#x003b2;-HSD) in the progesterone biosynthetic pathway. The outcome of direct or indirect controls via PRL or LH on steroidogenic enzymes is an absence of progesterone synthesis. However, even if progesterone biosynthesis does occur in PRLR-/- mice, it could be rapidly metabolized to 20&#x003b1;-dihydroprogesterone since in the absence of PRL signaling, we demonstrated an activation of the 20&#x003b1; HSD enzyme. One possible mechanism of action of PRL in CL may be modulation of the cell cycle. Progression through the cell cycle is orchestrated by successive activation of cyclin-dependent kinases which are regulated by specific cyclins as well as inhibitors. The LH surge induces exit from the cell cycle not only by elevating the levels of cell-cycle inhibitors, such as p27 and p21 but by completely down regulating the activator, cyclin D2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Luteal cells then remain arrested in a non-proliferative state throughout the existence of the functional CL. Cdk4 has been also reported to be critical for luteal function, and some redundant protein(s) can compensate for the absence of Cdk4 in proliferation of granulosa cells).)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the absence of PRL signaling, our results show that luteal cells failed to express p27 at high levels as luteinization occurs. P27 deficient females exhibit granulosa cell hyperplasia and a failure of luteinizing cells to withdraw from the cell cycle and produce factors necessary to support implantation and early pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. But in these mice, the circulating level of progesterone is maintained and it was proposed that growth arrest was not required for the differentiation of luteal cells to a progesterone producing state, but that it might be required to properly regulate other luteal functions. Indeed low levels of progesterone in PRLR-/- are independent of the proliferative state and the accumulation of corpora undergoing regression expressing high levels of 20&#x003b1; HSD would further contribute to a decrease in the levels of progesterone.</p><p>The Stat5 proteins, major mediators of the PRL pathway, are essential for the development of functional corpora lutea in the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], this is consistent with the critical role that PRL has on ovarian function also based on female infertility of PRL and PRLR deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The disruption of the p27 gene results in ovarian defects similar to those observed in Stat 5-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that PRL regulates p27 expression and that this expression is critical for inducing the differentiation of luteal cells for the formation of functional corpora lutea.</p><p>In situ hybridization studies have shown that IGFBP3 mRNA is highly expressed after ovulation in CL and selectively localized to some cell types making this protein as a CL functional marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We showed that IGFBP3 mRNA expression was greatly decreased in PRLR-/- mice confirming the possible role of endothelial IGFBP-3 in controlling angiogenesis and cell responses as described in the human CL by autocrine/paracrine mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) deficient mice are also infertile because of impaired formation of corpus luteum due to an absence of semicircadian surges of PRL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This mouse model again underlines the importance of PRL signaling in the maintenance of the corpus luteum. Further analysis of these different mouse models should reveal the molecular targets of PRL in the ovary, since the mechanism induced by PRL which leads to luteal cell survival regulation involves intermediate molecules still to be identified.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Philippe Monget for polyclonal antibody to P450scc and helpful discussions and Dr. David Flint for reading the manuscript.
