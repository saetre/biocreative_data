In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, recombinant zinc finger domains of Smuc specifically bound to CAGGTG and CACCTG E-box motifs (CANNTG). Because basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix transcription factors (bHLH) bind to the same E-box sequences, we examined whether Smuc competes with the myogenic bHLH factor MyoD for DNA binding. Smuc inhibited the binding of a MyoD&#x02013;E12 complex to the CACCTG E-box sequence in a dose-dependent manner and suppressed the transcriptional activity of MyoD&#x02013;E12. When heterologously targeted to the thymidine kinase promoter as fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, the non-zinc finger domain of Smuc acted as a transcriptional repressor. Furthermore, overexpression of Smuc in myoblasts repressed transactivation of muscle differentiation marker Troponin T. Thus, Smuc might regulate bHLH transcription factors by zinc finger domains competing for E-box binding, and non-zinc finger repressor domains might also confer transcriptional repression to control differentiation processes.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x987ec70.0x9520df0" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no.

They bind to the specific nucleotide sequence CANNTG, called the E-box motif, by highly conserved C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> type zinc finger domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c4">4</xref>) and suppress the transactivation of downstream target genes. The E-box is also the consensus binding site for the basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix transcription factors (bHLHs) which participate in cell differentiation processes of various tissues and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c5">5</xref>). Thus, the Snail-related proteins function as regulators of a complex gene activation cascade.</p><p>Several Snail family members have been reported among several species. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, two <italic>Snail-</italic>related genes, <italic>Snail</italic> and <italic>Escargot</italic> have been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c6">6</xref>). <italic>Snail</italic> is indispensable to mesoderm formation during development, because Snail suppresses the differentiation of neuroectoderm by repressing the proneural genes <italic>sim</italic> and <italic>rho</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c6">6</xref>). <italic>Escargot</italic> is required for the development of imaginal histoblasts and fusion of tracheal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c8">8</xref>). In the developing nervous system, Escargot inhibits the transcriptional activities of the proneural bHLH factors <italic>achaetescute</italic> and <italic>daughterless</italic> via competition for one of the E-box binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c9">9</xref>).</p><p>In higher vertebrates, murine <italic>Sna</italic> and <italic>Slug</italic> and chick <italic>cSnR</italic> have been identified as Snail family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c13">13</xref>). They contain highly conserved C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> type zinc finger domains and are expressed in early embryos. <italic>Sna</italic> is expressed in the mesoderm and somites of early mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c11">11</xref>). Although its role in early embryogenesis has not been elucidated, Sna has been suggested to suppress the transcriptional activities of bHLH proteins E47 and Mash2 in trophoblast development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c14">14</xref>). Slug induces cell migration in the epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition, mesoderm formation and neural crest cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c9">9</xref>). Antisense inhibition of <italic>Slug</italic> impairs fibroblast growth factor-induced scattering and hepatocyte growth factor-mediated tubular morphogenesis of epithelial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c15">15</xref>). <italic>cSnR</italic> is expressed in the chick right-hand lateral mesoderm. Antisense disruption of its function randomizes the asymmetrical body organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c15">15</xref>). These three proteins have a highly conserved N-terminal domain. This conservation is also found in another zinc finger protein, Gfi1, which immortalizes IL-2-dependent T&#x000a0;cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c16">16</xref>). Therefore, this domain is called the SNAG (<underline>Sna</underline>il&#x0002f;<underline>G</underline>fi1) domain and is thought to play roles in nuclear targeting and transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c16">16</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we searched for a <italic>Snail</italic>-related gene in developing mouse embryos and adult organs and identified a novel <italic>Snail</italic>-related gene <italic>Smuc</italic> (<underline>S</underline>nail-related transcription factor of <underline>mu</underline>scle <underline>c</underline>ells). Smuc was highly expressed in adult skeletal muscle and thymus in addition to the developing embryos. Smuc bound to particular E-box sequences with high affinity and inhibited E-box-dependent transactivation by the MyoD&#x02013;E12 complex in C2C12 cells. Therefore, Smuc might function as a regulator of differentiation processes by mechanisms similar to other Snail family members.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>RNA isolation</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from skeletal muscle of adult B6 mice (S.L.C., Shizuoka, Japan) by the guanidine thiocyanate&#x0002f;phenol&#x0002f;chloroform method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c17">17</xref>) and from mouse embryos with Trizol (Gibco BRL).

We isolated an expected ~550 bp DNA fragment from the PCR product of adult skeletal muscle and subcloned it into pKRX-<italic>Xcm</italic>1. Among 20 clones analyzed, two contained a novel cDNA sequence encoding a zinc finger domain. This PCR fragment was used as a probe to screen a mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library. About 500 000 phage plaques were screened and three positive clones were identified. Sequence analyses and sizes of these inserts indicated that they overlapped. The longest cDNA insert was analyzed in detail. The size of the cDNA was 1882 bp and comparable to that of the major transcript detected by northern blot analysis. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA indicated that this clone contained an open reading frame of 864 bp encoding a 287 amino acid protein with the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c34">34</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f1">1</xref>). The deduced amino acid sequence contained five C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger domains in its C-terminal half, the structure of which is similar to that of Snail family members. The novelty of the sequence was confirmed by BLAST search analysis of the GenBank database. We designated this novel gene <italic>Smuc</italic> (<italic>Snail-</italic>related in <underline>mu</underline>scle <underline>c</underline>ells).</p><p>The amino acid sequence indicated that Smuc was highly homologous to mouse Sna and Slug. Amino acid identities between Smuc and Sna and Slug were 43 and 47&#x00025;, respectively. However, in the zinc finger domains, the identities were 75 and 80&#x00025; to Sna and Slug, respectively. In addition to the zinc finger motifs, these three proteins show sequence conservation in their N-terminal ends, particularly in the first seven amino acid residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f1">1</xref>). Another feature noted in Smuc is abundant proline residues in the N-terminal half (14&#x00025;), which is also found in other members of the Snail family. These results indicate that <italic>Smuc</italic> is a new member of the vertebrate Snail family and most related to mouse Slug.</p><p>As predicted by PSORT II analysis, Smuc was localized to the nucleus, which was confirmed by co-localization of a GFP&#x02013;Smuc fusion protein and nuclear staining by Hoechst 33258 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue distribution of <italic>Smuc</italic> mRNA</title><p>To examine the expression patterns of Smuc in mice, northern blot analyses were performed. To avoid possible cross-hybridization to other mRNA species encoding zinc finger proteins, a region encompassing nucleotides 1&#x02013;540 of the <italic>Smuc</italic> cDNA was used as a probe. In adult mice, the skeletal muscle and thymus were the dominant place for <italic>Smuc</italic> expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f2">2</xref>A). Much weaker signals were detected in the heart, lung and spleen. The size of the <italic>Smuc</italic> mRNA was estimated to be 1.9 kb and several larger transcripts were also detected in the thymus, probably due to unprocessed transcripts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f2">2</xref>A). In developing embryos, <italic>Smuc</italic> was also expressed in embryonic day 7 (E7) mouse embryos, and higher expression was observed in later developmental stages (E15 and E18) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f2">2</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding property of Smuc</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> Snail, Escargot and mouse Sna proteins have been shown to bind E-box sequences of DNA by their zinc finger domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c14">14</xref>). We examined whether Smuc also has an ability to bind E-box motifs by the highly conserved zinc finger domains among the family. EMSA assays were performed with a GST fusion protein, GST&#x02013;Smuc-Zf, which contains five zinc finger domains of Smuc (amino acids 142&#x02013;287). Oligonucleotide probes with the CAGGTG E-box sequence (SMU and MCK1) were first examined because CAGGTG is the core sequence for high affinity binding of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Snail and Escargot. As expected, GST&#x02013;Smuc-Zf bound specifically to these oligonucleotide probes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f3">3</xref>A).</p><p>To elucidate the specificity of Smuc&#x02013;DNA interaction, the same experiment was performed with different E-box oligonucleotides containing various core sequences. Among the oligonucleotide probes which represent the upstream E-box sequences of various genes, GST&#x02013;Smuc-Zf bound only to the oligonucleotides with CACCTG or CAGGTG core sequences but not to other oligonucleotides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f3">3</xref>B). To further confirm the specificity of the target sequences, the MCK2 probe was mutated only in the internal dinucleotides of the E-box sequence. GST&#x02013;Smuc-Zf bound with high affinity only to the probes that contained CACCTG and CAGGTG sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f3">3</xref>C). The preferential binding of Smuc zinc finger domains to CACCTG and CAGGTG motifs is similar to that of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Snail and Escargot, suggesting conservation of targets of transcriptional regulation by <italic>Snail</italic>-related genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Smuc and MyoD compete for a common DNA binding site</title><p>It is well known that myogenic bHLH factors such as MyoD bind to E-box sequences and strongly induce transcriptions of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c5">5</xref>). The E-box sequences CACCTG and CAGGTG, with which Smuc specifically interacts, are motifs often found in muscle-specific gene promoters, including muscle creatinine kinase (MCK). These findings raise the possibility that Smuc interferes with MyoD binding to E-box motifs. To confirm this possibility, the ability of Smuc to inhibit MyoD binding to the E-box was examined. <italic>In vitro</italic> translated MyoD&#x02013;E12 heterodimer was incubated with a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled MCK2 oligonucleotide probe containing the CACCTG sequence in the presence of various amounts of GST&#x02013;Smuc-Zf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f4">4</xref>A). GST&#x02013;Smuc-Zf inhibited MyoD&#x02013;E12 complex binding to the CACCTG sequence dose-dependently. In another experiment, GST&#x02013;Smuc-Zf was displaced from the E-box by the addition of increasing amounts of MyoD&#x02013;E12 complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f4">4</xref>B). These results suggest that Smuc and MyoD&#x02013;E12 compete for the same E-box site. Similar competition results were obtained with Myogenin&#x02013;E12 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Non-zinc finger region of Smuc as a repressor domain</title><p>Many transcription factors have been shown to contain distinct functional regions, serving as DNA-binding, activation or repressor domains. The zinc finger domain of Smuc was shown to act as a DNA-binding domain. We further examined if the non-zinc finger domain of Smuc might serve as a repressor or activation domain in C2C12 cells, by targeting this domain to the heterologous tk promoter as fusion proteins with the GAL4 DBD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f5">5</xref>A). When the whole non-zinc finger domain of Smuc (amino acids 1&#x02013;148) was expressed with the GAL4 DBD and targeted to the GAL4 binding sites upstream of the tk promoter, luciferase activity was repressed to 17&#x00025; of the control. About 20 N-terminal amino acids, termed the SNAG domain, are conserved among vertebrate Snail family and Gfi1 proteins. The SNAG domain of Gfi1 has been shown to be sufficient for transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c16">16</xref>). A GAL4 fusion protein which lacked the conserved N-terminal amino acids among Smuc, Slug and Sna (amino acids 24&#x02013;148) led to 50&#x00025; suppression, suggesting some importance of this region. However, when only the conserved N-terminal amino acids were expressed as a GAL4 fusion protein, they did not confer transcriptional repression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f5">5</xref>B). Therefore, the non-zinc finger domain of Smuc as a whole possesses repressor activity and the N-terminal region is important but not sufficient to mediate this repression.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional regulation by Smuc</title><p>Smuc was shown to bind to E-box DNA sequences, thereby competing with MyoD&#x02013;E12. Because MyoD is a powerful transcriptional activator by binding to E-box motifs, this competition might lead to repression of the transcriptional activity of MyoD. This possibility was examined in C2C12 cells by the luciferase assay using pE7-luc as a reporter plasmid. Transfection of pCMV-MyoD and pCMV-E12 induced expression of luciferase, and co-transfection of the Smuc expression vector repressed this transactivation by MyoD&#x02013;E12 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f6">6</xref>). In this assay expression of only Smuc did not augment the basal luciferase activity (data not shown). This result suggested a repressive effect of Smuc on E-box-dependent transactivation of downstream genes by myogenic bHLHs.</p></sec><sec><title>Smuc suppresses the expression of Troponin T in myoblasts</title><p>In myogenesis, bHLH transcription factors function as cell fate determinants and differentiation inducers by E-box-dependent activation of muscle-specific downstream genes. Therefore, repression of the transcriptional activity of MyoD by Smuc might interfere with the differentiation of muscle cells. To evaluate this, we overexpressed Smuc in C2C12 myoblasts and its inhibitory effect on differentiation to muscles was examined. pNLS-LacZ was used to detect the cells that incorporated exogenous DNA. After 4 days culture in differentiation medium, differentiation of C2C12 cells into myocytes was determined by counting cells positive for Troponin T expression among the LacZ-positive cells. Only 7&#x00025; of Smuc-expressing C2C12 cells differentiated to muscles, while 27&#x00025; of mock-transfected cells differentiated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f7">7</xref>A and B). An inactivator of bHLH transcription factors, Id2, tested as a positive control, inhibited the differentiation of myoblasts more potently (&#x0003c;1&#x00025;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f7">7</xref>B). These results suggest that Smuc represses the differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and that Smuc could regulate myogenic bHLHs in muscle cell differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we cloned a novel Snail family protein, Smuc, from adult mouse skeletal muscles and analyzed its function. This protein belongs to the Snail family, a subfamily of the zinc finger transcription factors, the members of which play important roles in various differentiation processes during development of many species, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> and higher vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c6">6</xref>). Smuc could bind DNA at E-box sequences with high specificity in EMSA analyses. Smuc competed with MyoD&#x02013;E12 heterodimer in binding to the same E-box sequence. Moreover, the non-zinc finger domain of Smuc acted as a repressor when heterologously targeted to the tk promoter. Consistent with this, Smuc suppressed transactivation by MyoD&#x02013;E12 heterodimers in luciferase assays in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, overexpression of Smuc in C2C12 myoblasts inhibited their terminal differentiation into myocytes. These results suggest that Smuc is a regulator of E-box-dependent differentiation processes.</p><p>The deduced amino acid sequence of Smuc indicates five C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> type zinc finger domains in its C-terminal half (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f1">1</xref>). This region is highly homologous to members of the Snail family. Because mouse Sna contains only four zinc finger domains, and Slug contains five, Smuc is more closely related to Slug. Furthermore, more than half of the about 20 N-terminal amino acid residues are well conserved among mouse Sna, Slug and Smuc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f1">1</xref>). This conservation is also found in Snail-related proteins of other species such as chick and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c2">2</xref>), suggesting some important role of the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c16">16</xref>).</p><p>Smuc is localized in the nucleus and binds DNA at the E-box sequences present in the promoter region of MCK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f3">3</xref>A), similarly to other Snail family members. Detailed analyses by EMSA with oligonucleotides containing different E-box sequences indicate specificity of Smuc. Smuc bound to only two sequences, CACCTG and CAGGTG, but not to those with other E-box motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f3">3</xref>B and C). Because <italic>Drosophila</italic> Snail and Escargot bind to the E-box sequence CAGGTG with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c9">9</xref>), and mouse Sna to the CACCTG E-box site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c14">14</xref>), it is conceivable that these two E-box motifs are the consensus core target sequences for Snail family members. On the other hand, it is well known that E-box sequences are also the consensus binding sites of bHLHs such as MyoD and E2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c35">35</xref>). This raised the possibility that Smuc competes for binding to E-box sequences with bHLHs. In fact, Smuc competed for the binding site with MyoD in EMSA analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f4">4</xref>). Moreover, the non-zinc finger domain of Smuc possesses a repressor activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f5">5</xref>). In luciferase assays, E-box-mediated transactivation induced by the MyoD&#x02013;E12 complex was suppressed by Smuc in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f6">6</xref>). Smuc inhibited terminal differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, a process which is activated by myogenic bHLHs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f7">7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c35">35</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that Smuc can inhibit the function of bHLHs by the zinc finger domains competing for their common E-box binding sites. Smuc also mediates inhibition through a repressor domain located in the non-zinc finger region.</p><p>Generally, bHLHs bind to a wide range of E-box core sequences and induce transactivation, although there is some preference for the internal dinucleotides. MyoD, for example, binds not only to CACCTG and CAGGTG but also to other E-box motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c5">5</xref>). Since Smuc binds only to CACCTG and CAGGTG E-box sequences, competition between bHLHs and Smuc for DNA binding is limited to a subset of E-box sequences. Therefore, Smuc is not a general inhibitor of bHLHs and regulates a subset of target genes of bHLHs, the promoter of which has an E-box sequence CACCTG or CAGGTG. Examples of bHLH inhibitors specific to a subset of E-box motifs have been reported. ZEB is a non-Snail homeodomain&#x0002f;zinc finger transcriptional regulator with zinc finger domains in both its C- and N-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c37">37</xref>). &#x003b4;-EF1 is another zinc finger protein with a homeodomain between the zinc finger motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c38">38</xref>). Both of them have been shown to bind specifically to the core sequences CAGGTG and CACCTG, and suppress the activities of bHLHs. Therefore, in terms of specificity for target E-box motifs, Smuc is similar to ZEB and &#x003b4;-EF1.</p><p>In addition to these inhibitory factors which have specificity for their targets, there exist different inhibitory molecules of bHLHs in terms of their structures and functions. Id, an inhibitor of DNA binding&#x0002f;differentiation, is an example of such molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c39">39</xref>). It possesses HLH domains but lacks the basic region that is important for DNA binding. Heterodimerization of Id with bHLH such as E12 results in the formation of an inactive heterodimer and causes the sequestration of bHLHs. Thus, Id negatively regulates activities of bHLHs at the protein level without any specificity for downstream genes. Orchestration of bHLHs and these regulatory molecules would be important for the proper execution of developmental programs and for the functional regulation of organs and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c40">40</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to Gfi1, the N-terminal conserved amino acids of Smuc are important but not sufficient for repressor activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd125f5">5</xref>B). However, the whole non-zinc finger domain of Smuc contains repressor activity. This raises the possibility that transcriptional repression by Smuc might be mediated by a dual mechanism: competition with bHLH transcription factors for the E-box motif by the zinc finger domains and the repressor activity conferred by the non-zinc finger region. It should be determined if the non-zinc finger repressor domain of Smuc might interact with the recently identified co-repressors, CtBPs, which are important in transcriptional repression by <italic>Drosophila</italic> Snail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c42">42</xref>).</p><p>Although we have demonstrated an <italic>in vitro</italic> function of Smuc, its physiological function <italic>in vivo</italic> is still unclear. In the adult, <italic>Smuc</italic> mRNA is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and thymus, as demonstrated by northern blot analysis. The heart, lung and spleen also express the gene at a lower level. Collectively, skeletal muscle and the cardiovascular and immune systems are sites of <italic>Smuc</italic> expression. Development and the functions of all of these tissues are well known to be regulated by bHLHs. In adult skeletal muscle, MyoD and Myogenin are reported to regulate the contents of contractile proteins in fast and slow skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c43">43</xref>). Moreover, lymphocyte development is dependent on bHLHs such as E2A and HEB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd125c45">45</xref>). Smuc, therefore, may participate in the functional regulation of bHLHs in these organs. During embryogenesis, on the other hand, <italic>Smuc</italic> is detected in E7 mouse embryos by northern blot analysis and shows increased expression in embryos at later stages. This embryonic expression implies that Smuc is involved in pattern formation and cell differentiation processes. Further studies such as detailed <italic>in situ</italic> expression analysis in both embryos and adult tissues and gene targeting are required to elucidate the biological functions of Smuc.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd125f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Amino acid sequence of Smuc compared with those of mouse Sna (6,7) and mouse Slug (8).
