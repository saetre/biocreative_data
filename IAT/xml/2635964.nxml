Up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members has been shown to suppress cell death in pre-clinical models of human cancer and is implicated in human tumor progression. Previous gain-of-function studies in the RIP1-Tag2 model of pancreatic islet carcinogenesis, involving uniform or focal/temporal over-expression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, demonstrated accelerated tumor formation and growth. To specifically assess the role of endogenous Bcl-x in regulating apoptosis and tumor progression in this model, we engineered a pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell-specific knockout of both alleles of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> using the Cre-LoxP system of homologous recombination. Surprisingly, there was no appreciable effect on tumor cell apoptosis rates or on tumor growth in the <italic>Bcl-x</italic> knockout mice. Other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members were expressed but not substantively altered at the mRNA level in the <italic>Bcl-x</italic>-null tumors, suggestive of redundancy without compensatory transcriptional up-regulation. Interestingly, the incidence of invasive carcinomas was reduced, and tumor cells lacking Bcl-x were impaired in invasion in a two-chamber trans-well assay under conditions mimicking hypoxia. Thus, while the function of Bcl-x in suppressing apoptosis and thereby promoting tumor growth is evidently redundant, genetic ablation implicates Bcl-x in selectively facilitating invasion, consistent with a recent report documenting a pro-invasive capability of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> upon exogenous over-expression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>For all cancerous lesions to increase in mass and malignant potential, cell proliferation must outstrip cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Hanahan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. To this end, human tumors engage or disengage a variety of pathways to escape or minimize apoptosis. The necessity to down-modulate apoptosis also stems from the fact that activating mutations in oncogenes, as well as overexpression of wild-type oncogene alleles, evoke not only hyperproliferation, but also cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Spandidos1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Lowe1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Activation of apoptosis in response to oncogene-induced hyperproliferation has been described in a variety of genetically engineered mouse models of cancer, and in particular in two models of pancreatic neuroendocrine islet cell cancer. In one such model, RIP1-Tag2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Hanahan2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Christofori1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, SV40 T-antigens are constitutively expressed in the &#x003b2;-cells of the endocrine pancreas under control of the rat insulin promoter, resulting in a multistage pathway to invasive carcinoma that is stochastic in nature and temporally protracted. At 2&#x02013;3 weeks of age, the normal post-natal developmental proliferation of islet cells tapers off, and in adult mice there is a relatively slow turnover of &#x003b2;-cells, with a low proliferation rate offset by a low apoptotic rate, which results in a very modest increase in &#x003b2;-cell mass with age. In contrast, the &#x003b2;-cells of RIP1-Tag2 islets begin hyperproliferating at 3&#x02013;4 weeks of age along with a concomitant activation of apoptosis. An early study reported that apoptosis peaked at the angiogenic islet stage but was significantly down-modulated in tumors, suggesting that resistance to cell death was a critical step of tumor development from angiogenic islet precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Naik1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. A more recent study of this model has shown that down-modulation is not always the case, in that late-stage tumors (including invasive carcinomas) in the current backcross generations typically have apoptotic rates similar to those of angiogenic islets, suggesting a more subtle phenomena at play in expansive tumor growth (ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Lopez1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>). Two well-defined suppressors of apoptosis have been identified in this model: functional inactivation of p53 via large T-antigen expression, and up-regulation of the survival factor IGF-II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Efrat1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Christofori2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Genetic studies involving crosses to an IGF-II null allele indicated that it largely functions as a survival factor in this model, in that absence of IGF-II evoked much increased (5&#x000d7;) apoptotic rates in hyper-proliferative lesions, and the small tumors arising had a less malignant cellular phenotype; notably, the proliferation rate remained unchanged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Christofori2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Naik2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A demonstration that anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family can modulate cell-death in this model came from experimental over-expression of <italic>Bcl-x<sub>L</sub></italic> in &#x003b2;-cells via the rat insulin promoter (<italic>RIP-Bcl-x<sub>L</sub></italic>), which resulted in suppressed apoptosis and an increase in tumor burden, along with a general &#x0201c;acceleration&#x0201d; of the tumor pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Naik1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, the same RIP-<italic>Bcl-x<sub>L</sub></italic> transgene has also been shown to suppress apoptosis in another mouse model of islet cell carcinoma, in which a myc fusion protein, myc<sup>TAM</sup>, was expressed in the &#x003b2;-cells under the control of the rat insulin promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Pelengaris1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Myc<sup>TAM</sup> is only active in the presence of tamoxifen, allowing for inducible and reversible gene expression. Postnatal treatment of mice with tamoxifen results in a rapid induction of myc<sup>TAM</sup> expression concomitant with hyper-proliferation of the &#x003b2;-cells. Interestingly, this hyper-proliferation was accompanied by massive &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis that resulted in islet involution within 6&#x02013;10 days. Over-expression of <italic>Bcl-x<sub>L</sub></italic> via the same <italic>RIP-Bcl-x<sub>L</sub></italic> transgene suppressed this apoptosis, resulting in an increase in &#x003b2;-cell mass and a rapid progression to invasive carcinomas. Thus, in two different transgenic mouse models of islet cell carcinoma, elicited by two functionally distinct oncoproteins, over-expression of <italic>Bcl-x<sub>L</sub></italic> suppresses apoptosis, resulting in accelerated tumor formation. The results indicate that the apoptosis observed in these tumor types is, at least in part, mediated by the mitochondrial death pathway. In this report, we explore the role that endogenous Bcl-x plays in modulating apoptosis and tumor growth in the RIP1-Tag2 model via targeted deletion of the gene in the oncogene-expressing &#x003b2;-cells using the Cre/loxP system.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bcl-x expression in RIP1-Tag2 islet cell carcinogenesis</title><p>In situ hybridization with a pan-isoform probe to pancreatic tissue sections from RIP1-Tag2 mice previously suggested that <italic>Bcl-x</italic> mRNA was modestly up-regulated in tumors relative to precursor lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Naik1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

No obvious difference in islet size, distribution, or number was observed in a double-blind examination of these sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004455-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The results imply that &#x003b2;-cell development and islet morphogenesis were substantively normal in the absence of Bcl-x function, although subtle physiological effects cannot be excluded by this analysis.

Thus, deletion of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> in the &#x003b2;-cell compartment of these tumors resulted in a &#x0223c;90&#x00025; reduction of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> expression, thereby confirming that the preponderance of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> expression in RIP1-Tag2 tumors is &#x003b2;-cell in origin and that Cre was efficiently deleting <italic>Bcl-x</italic> without apparent phenotypic consequence. The residual <italic>Bcl-x</italic> expression likely originates from the stromal component of the lesions (principally vascular and immune cell types), although we cannot formally rule out the possibility that these tumors are oligo-clonal, and that some of the residual <italic>Bcl-x</italic> mRNA is derived from relatively rare &#x003b2;-cells harboring non-recombined <italic>Bcl-x</italic> alleles. To determine whether the significant reduction of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> mRNA observed in bcl-x &#x0201c;KO&#x0201d; tumors resulted in a commensurate reduction in Bcl-x protein levels, we carried out a Western blot analysis on lysates from 5 independent <italic>RIP1-Tag2;RIP-Cre</italic>; <italic>Bcl-x<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> tumors. Consistent with the PCR-based analysis of recombination and the quantitative RT-PCR analysis of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> mRNA levels, Bcl-x protein levels were significantly reduced compared to wild-type (w.t.) tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004455-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating Cre-mediated deletion of the <italic>Bcl-x</italic> locus in the vast majority of beta cells of <italic>RIP1-Tag2;RIP-Cre</italic>; <italic>Bcl-x<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> tumors.

Together, the data support the conclusion that Bcl-x does not have a central role in modulating tumor apoptosis in this pathway, and that its function is either non-essential, redundant, and/or readily compensated for by other genes, such as other anti-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family.</p><fig id="pone-0004455-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004455.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title><italic>Bcl-x</italic> expression is ablated in the majority of <italic>RIP1-Tag2</italic>; <italic>RIP-Cre</italic>; <italic>Bcl-x<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> tumors.</title><p>(A) Efficient recombination of <italic>Bcl-x</italic> in <italic>RIP1-Tag2</italic>; <italic>RIP-Cre</italic>; <italic>Bcl-x<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> tumors.

Based on the quantitative RT-PCR experiments presented in this study, a potential source of functional redundancy is Bcl-w, which appears to be expressed at significantly higher levels than Bcl-2, A1, Mcl-1 and Boo in both normal islets and lesional stages of the RIP1-Tag2 tumor pathway.</p><p>Our results are consistent with a recent study demonstrating that Bcl-2 is not strictly required for the development of <italic>myc</italic> induced lymphomas in Eu-myc transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Kelly1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similarly, in contrast to the loss of function studies presented above, forced over-expression of <italic>bcl-x<sub>L</sub></italic> via a RIP7-<italic>Bcl-x<sub>L</sub></italic> transgene has a profound effect on RIP1-Tag2 tumorigenesis, in that tumor progression is accelerated and tumor burden increased in the double transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Naik1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This augmentation of tumorigenesis is accompanied by a significant decrease in the apoptotic rate.

This histopathological implication is supported by experiments with islet tumor cell lines lacking Bcl-x expression. The Bcl-x-null cells exhibited a decreased capability to invade under conditions mimicking hypoxia; in contrast, when the same cells were assayed in normal conditions, their invasiveness was comparable to Bcl-x proficient cancer cells. This result suggests that while endogenous Bcl-x expression may be redundant under normal conditions, it can play a distinct role in stressed conditions (e.g. hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, chemotherapy).</p><p>Our findings implicating Bcl-x in invasion are notable in light of a recent study by Du et al., who reported a significant increase in the incidence of invasive carcinomas in RIP1-Tag2 mice engineered to focally over-express Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> via retrovirus-mediated somatic gene transfer into neoplastic lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Du1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, this mode of up-regulating Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> did not affect the incidence of apoptotic cells in the tumors, in contradistinction to the aforementioned study in which the RIP-Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> transgene produced a decreased apoptotic index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Naik1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>; such phenotypic differences may be explained by differences in the uniformity, timing or levels of expression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (the effect of the transgene-mediated over-expression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> on tumor invasion was not assessed in this earlier study). Our current investigation now provides additional, complimentary data to that of Du et al in regard to this emergent function for Bcl-x, by demonstrating that endogenous Bcl-x, in the absence of overt over-expression, can influence tumor invasion.</p><p>Therapeutics that engage programmed cell death in tumor cells have promise for the treatment of cancer.

Collectively, the data suggest that activity among the pro-survival Bcl-2 family members is, in certain settings, functionally redundant, and that tumor cells utilize multiple Bcl-2 family members for survival and proliferation. The prediction follows that treatment of the RIP1-Tag2 mice with pan-Bcl inhibitors will disrupt tumor growth if indeed, (as expected) these genes cooperate in modulating the propensity for apoptosis as an intrinsic barrier to tumorigenesis. It will be of additional interest to ascertain whether such Bcl inhibitors can also restrict tumor invasion and malignancy, endpoints that could be of relevance in the clinical setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Real-time Q-PCR Analysis</title><p>Quantitative PCR was performed essentially as in Elson et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004455-Elson1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> In brief, RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNase Easy as per manufacturer's instructions.
