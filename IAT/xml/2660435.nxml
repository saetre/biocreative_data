In contrast to these published methods, we here describe a strategy to identify T cells that respond to any antigen and track the fate of these activated T cells. We constructed a retroviral double-reporter construct with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and a far-red fluorescent protein from <italic>Heteractis crispa</italic> (HcRed). LTR-driven EGFP expression was used to enrich and identify transduced cells, while HcRed expression is driven by the CD40Ligand (CD40L) promoter, which is inducible and enables the identification and cell fate tracing of T cells that have responded to infection/inflammation. Pax5 deficient pro-B cells that can give rise to different hematopoietic cells like T cells, were retrovirally transduced with this double-reporter cassette and were used to reconstitute the T cell pool in RAG1 deifcient mice that lack T and B cells. By using flow cytometry and histology, we identified activated T cells that had developed from Pax5 deficient pro-B cells and responded to infection with the bacterial pathogen <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>. Microscopic examination of organ sections allowed visual identification of HcRed-expressing cells. To further characterize the immune response to a given stimuli, this strategy can be easily adapted to identify other cells of the hematopoietic system that respond to infection/inflammation. This can be achieved by using an inducible reporter, choosing the appropriate promoter, and reconstituting mice lacking cells of interest by injecting gene-modified Pax5 deficient pro-B cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Characterization of the immune response is central to an understanding of processes underlying infection/inflammation.

Combined with cell surface and intracellular phenotyping, it is highly specific and sensitive. However, this technique does not lend itself to histology and only single specificities can be analyzed. Cytokine-based techniques allow the simultaneous analysis of immune responses to several antigenic epitopes, but have the disadvantage of being indirect and prone to variability. More recently, the use of transgenic mice in which activated CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are tagged utilizing the Cre/lox strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005115-Jacob1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005115-Maris1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, has allowed characterization of activated CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. However as this approach relies on expression of Cre by a specific promoter, it is irreversible. Indeed, Cre expression, even if transiently expressed during development or due to endogenous infections, results in permanently tagged CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells upon lox P recombination. Consequently, tagged CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells could represent a pool of cells, including cells where Cre was transiently expressed during development or during intrathymic selection; T cells responding to antigens from gut flora or nutrients; and T cells responding to the infection/inflammation under investigation.</p><p>Notably, these cumulative effects can impair characterization of memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells as they would represent a fraction of all activated and non-activated CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells rather than those T cells that specifically responded to infection/inflammation under investigation.</p><p>Here we describe a strategy to identify activated T cells, utilizing Pax5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pro-B cells retrovirally transduced with a double-reporter cassette to reconstitute the T cell pool in RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This strategy not only allows T cell responses to be analyzed irrespective of antigen specificity, but also permits identification of all activated T cells responding to infection/inflammation. Pax5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pro-B cells have a developmental block at the early pro-B cell stage but retain self-renewal and lymphomyeloid potential and, with different efficiencies, give rise to almost all cells of the hematopoietic system with the exception of B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005115-Rolink1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005115-Schaniel1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the latter case, not only T cells but any cell that expresses CD40L is stained and assessment depends on specificity of the antibody used against CD40L. In the strategy used here, changing the promoter driving HcRed expression and reconstituting mice lacking a specific hematopoietic cell by injecting gene-modified Pax5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pro-B cells, allows the identification and cell fate tracing of those reconstituted cells responding to defined stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reconstitution of the T cell pool in RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>As a first step, we reconstituted the T cell pool in Rag1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with gene-modified Pax5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells.

In contrast to EGFP the tetrameric HcRed complex is excluded from the nucleus and exclusively localizes to the cytoplasm. Upon HcRed expression, EGFP expression is downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005115-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>) as evidenced by the absence of green fluorescence in the nucleus of HcRed<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. This results from the fact that once active, the CD40L promoter interferes at the transcriptional level with expression of the upstream EGFP gene driven by the retroviral LTR. Activation of T cells following <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection was specific since not all cells in the spleen became HcRed<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>,as shown by nuclear counter-staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005115-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>).

By using a double-reporter system, transduced cells could be enriched using flowcytometry based on a constitutively expressed EGFP gene. These enriched cells were then used to reconstitute the T-cell pool in T cell deficient RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, thus increasing specificity and concomitantly reducing background signals during <italic>in situ</italic> detection of activated T cells. Indeed, Pax5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pro-B cells were shown to give rise to other hematopoietic cells beside T cells, such as dendritic and NK cells. However, these cells are unlikely to develop in RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice due to competition with already established endogenous cells of the same lineage. Although CD40L expression has been reported on cells other than activated T cells the preferential development of T cells from Pax5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pro-B cells in RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice means that HcRed expression by the double-reporter system specifically reports the presence of activated T cells only.</p><p>In contrast to the Cre/lox strategy published by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005115-Jacob1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005115-Maris1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> where all activated cells are permanently tagged, our strategy is specific: cells where the CD40L promoter may have been active at an earlier time point do not contribute to the pool of cells expressing HcRed during infection. Indeed, HcRed expression would have been downregulated in such cells in absence of a continued stimulus. Hence only activated T cells recently responding to an infection will show HcRed expression.</p><p>Although we demonstrated qualitative identification of responding cells on the basis of the double-reporter strategy, a quantitative analysis of cell populations expressing HcRed can be achieved using a flow cytometer equipped with an appropriate laser to detect cells expressing HcRed. Alternatively other combinations of fluorescent proteins can be used allowing multi-parameter cytometry.</p><p>The double-reporter construct is designed such that when the CD40L promoter is active, there is transcriptional interference of the LTR-driven EGFP expression. This interference results in EGFP-specific transcripts without a polyadenylation signal, which consequently becomes rapidly degraded. In contrast, transcription initiated at the CD40L promoter results in stable transcripts that terminate with a polyadenylation signal. When CD40L promoter is inactive, LTR-driven transcription terminates at the end of the construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005115-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>) and is polyadenylated resulting in stable mRNA. In the absence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream of HcRed, only EGFP will be translated from these transcripts. As EGFP was initially used to sort cells containing the retroviral construct, its subsequent expression or lack thereof does not affect identification of HcRed-expressing cells. In fact, the presence of those few cells showing EGFP in the nuclei and absence of HcRed in cytoplasm improves discrimination between activated and non-activated transduced cells and furthermore confirms that expression of HcRed is not leaky.</p><p>The strategy presented here, when combined with <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon microscopy of lymphoid organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005115-Ng1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> offers a powerful tool for the detailed analysis of infection-induced T cell activation, This includes dynamics and site/location of activation and allows the analysis of interaction of activated cells with other cells of the immune system.</p><p>In addition, since Pax5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pro-B cells can give rise to many other hematopoietic lineages, the strategy used in this study can be modified to identify different cells of the hematopoietic system responding to infection, and is only limited by the availability of the appropriate promoter and availability of mice lacking cells of interest.</p><p>In summary, we have used gene modified Pax5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, which retain self-renewal and lymphomyeloid potential, to reconstitute the T cell pool in T and B cell deficient Rag1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The double reporter retroviral construct, in retrovirally transduced Pax5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, allowed the identification of transduced cells through constitutive EGFP expression and the identification and cell fate tracing of activated T cells that responded to infection through the CD40L driven HcRed expression.

After polymerization at this temperature, 3-&#x000b5;m sections were cut using a rotation microtome (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) and analyzed with a Leica DMRB microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM 1200 camera. For EGFP detection we used L5 filters with a maximum excitation band pass (BP) of 480/40 dichroic 505 and maximum emission BP of 527/30. For HcRed we used a Y3 filter with a maximum excitation BP of 535/50 dichroic RKP 565 and maximum emission BP of 610/75.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank A.G. Rolink and F.
