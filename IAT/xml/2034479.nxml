Using RNA&#x02013;protein cross-linking and directed site-specific proteolysis (DSSP), we have established that the N-terminal zinc finger of yLuc7p contacts the pre-mRNA in the 5&#x02032; exon in a region close to the cap. Modifying the pre-mRNA sequence in the region contacted by yLuc7p affects splicing in a yLuc7p-dependent manner indicating that yLuc7p stabilizes U1 snRNP&#x02013;pre-mRNA interaction, thus reminding of the mode of action of another U1 snRNP component, Nam8p. Database searches identified three putative human yLuc7p homologs (hLuc7A, hLuc7B1 and hLuc7B2). These proteins have an extended C-terminal tail rich in RS and RE residues, a feature characteristic of splicing factors. Consistent with a role in pre-mRNA splicing, hLuc7A localizes in the nucleus and antibodies raised against hLuc7A specifically co-precipitate U1 snRNA from human cell extracts. Interestingly, hLuc7A overexpression affects splicing of a reporter <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, our data suggest that the formation of a wide network of protein&#x02013;RNA interactions around the 5&#x02032; splice site by U1 snRNP-associated factors contributes to alternative splicing regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Splicing of most polII transcripts is required prior to their export out of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The spliceosome is the macromolecular complex responsible for this intricate process. Early spliceosome assembly events are target of regulatory factors that alter splice site choice and/or modulate splicing activity, constituting a widespread mechanism of gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Interestingly, processes as diverse as meiosis in yeast, dosage compensation in fruit flies or programmed cell death in humans are regulated in this manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>).</p><p>Spliceosome assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> is initiated by formation of stable complexes containing U1 snRNP, pre-mRNA and non-snRNP factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In yeast, the earliest known splicing complexes are called commitment complexes because their formation targets the pre-mRNA substrate to the splicing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The mammalian E complex is the counterpart of the yeast commitment complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). During the formation of commitment complexes, U1 snRNA base pairs with the intron and exon sequences flanking the 5&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>), whereas the cap-binding complex (CBC) binds to the pre-mRNA cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In addition, several protein components of the U1 snRNP make contacts with the pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). These protein&#x02013;RNA contacts stabilize pre-mRNA&#x02013;U1 snRNP interaction and affect 5&#x02032; splice site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Like its metazoan counterparts, the yeast U1 snRNP contains two classes of proteins: the Sm proteins shared with the U2, U4 and U5 snRNPs and the U1 snRNP-specific proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Interestingly, homologs of all three mammalian U1 snRNP-specific proteins (U1-A, U1-C and U1-70K) can be found in the yeast complex (Mud1p, yU1-C and Snp1p, respectively). However, the yeast U1 snRNP contains in addition seven specific proteins (Snu71p, Snu65p, Snu56p, Prp39p, Prp40p, Nam8p and yLuc7p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Among these proteins, only for Nam8p has been described a mammalian homolog, the apoptotic factor TIA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>We identified yLuc7p as component of the U1 snRNP by means of biochemical purification (referred to as Snu30p in our previous study) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and through a genetic screen causing synthetic lethality with CBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Analysis of yLuc7p mutants revealed that the composition of yeast U1 snRNP was altered in these strains and that the corresponding extracts were unable to support any of the defined steps of splicing unless supplemented with recombinant wild-type yLuc7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In addition, splicing of introns with non-consensus 5&#x02032; splice site or branchpoint sequences was defective in yLuc7p mutant strains. For reporters containing two competing 5&#x02032; splice sites, a loss of efficient splicing of the cap proximal splice site was observed in yLuc7p-deficient cells, analogous to the defect seen in strains lacking CBC. These results lead Fortes <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) to suggest that the loss of yLuc7p disrupts a U1 snRNP&#x02013;CBC interaction normally contributing to 5' splice site recognition.</p><p>Using a combination of RNA&#x02013;protein cross-linking, and a strategy we called Directed Site-Specific Proteolysis (DSSP), we have now shown that yLuc7p contacts specifically exon 1 of the pre-mRNA through the first of its two zinc finger motifs. Modification of the RNA sequence contacted by yLuc7p affects the pre-mRNA splicing efficiency in a yLuc7p-dependent manner. Our data suggest that interaction of yLuc7p with the upstream exon stabilizes the pre-mRNA&#x02013;U1 snRNP interaction. This is reminiscent of the mode of action of Nam8p, which facilitates intron recognition by binding to intron sequences following the 5&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). To assess whether the function of yLuc7p in splice site selection is conserved, we identified putative human homologs and cloned cDNAs encoding two of them (hLuc7A and hLuc7B2, respectively). Both proteins have RE and RS repeats characteristic of splicing factors. In addition, they have two zinc finger motifs similar to those present in yLuc7p and characteristic of RNA-binding proteins. By using antibodies raised against hLuc7A we show that this protein localizes in the nucleus of HeLa cells. Interestingly, these antibodies specifically precipitate U1 snRNA from HeLa extracts. Furthermore, overexpression of hLuc7A in HeLa cells affects splice site selection of an adenovirus E1A reporter, directing splicing selection towards the most 5&#x02032; distal site. Our results demonstrate that hLuc7A is a new U1 snRNP-associated splicing factor. In addition, our data support the formation of a wide network of protein&#x02013;RNA interactions around the 5&#x02032; splice site by U1 snRNP associated-factors. This network allows for modulated 5&#x02032; splice recognition and contributes thereby to alternative splicing regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>All yeast strains derive from the wild-type MGD353-13D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).

The yLuc7p-HA-TEV-protA fusion inserted in a centromeric LEU2 plasmid was introduced by plasmid shuffling in a strain carrying a disrupted chromosomal copy of LUC7 to give strain BSY1069. An isogenic wild-type strain expressing the yLuc7p-protA fusion was constructed in parallel and named BSY1067. The deletion of the first zinc finger of yLuc7p (fusion yLuc7p-&#x00394;ZF-protA) was built following the same strategy, yielding strain BSY1077.</p><p>All the RP51A derivatives used in cross-linking reactions were synthesized with a specific activity of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> Ci/mol as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).

In order to obtain constructs Ex5&#x02032;U (plasmid pBS1983), Ex3&#x02032;U (pBS1982) and IntU (pBS1985), the sequence including from the T7 promoter to the EcoRV site from plasmid pBS195 was cloned by PCR between the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pUC19. The EcoRV site present in pBS195 was substituted by a PvuII site since this site lacks Ts upstream the site of cleavage and therefore no Us are incorporated upon transcription. These constructs were linearized prior to transcription with PvuII.</p><p>To analyze commitment complex assembled in mRNAs containing Ex5&#x02032;U, Ex3&#x02032;U and IntU sequences, we cloned by PCR the sequence between the EcoRV and the DdeI sites from plasmid pBS195 downstream of the XbaI site of each construct.</p><p>Plasmid pBS983 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) was used to build the reporters used in splicing assays.

These motifs have been shown to act in other proteins as RNA-binding modules. Thus we tested whether yLuc7p binds the pre-mRNA in commitment complexes. We synthesized P<sup>32</sup>-internally-labeled WT-B pre-mRNA, a derivative of the RP51A intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) with 4-thio-U substituted for normal U. This RNA was used to assemble commitment complexes in an extract prepared from a yeast strain expressing yLuc7p fused at its C-terminus with the <italic>Staphyloccocus aureus</italic> protein A (yLuc7p-protA, this modification has no phenotypic consequence). Subsequently, the reactions were UV irradiated, treated with RNase T1 and immunoprecipitated by using IgG-coupled beads. Cross-linked proteins present in the precipitate were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and identified by autoradiography. As a positive control we used Nam8p-protA, a protein known to contact the pre-mRNA in the intron downstream from the 5&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Nam8p&#x02013;protA cross-linked to the functional WT-B pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, lane 1). The corresponding signal was strongly reduced when we used the 5&#x02032;SSmut pre-mRNA (lane 2), which contains a mutation in the 5&#x02032; splice site sequence (GUAU<underline>a</underline>U instead of GUAUGU) known to impair commitment complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, lane 3, shows the pattern of cross-linking obtained when an extract from a yLuc7p&#x02013;protA tagged strain was used in commitment complex formation with the WT-B pre-mRNA. A protein migrating with the expected size of yLuc7p&#x02013;protA cross-links to the pre-mRNA. This band was only detected when 4-thio-U substituted RNA was used for cross-linking (data not shown). Further experiments confirmed the identity of this protein as yLuc7p&#x02013;protA (data not shown). The cross-linking signal is reduced to background level when the 5&#x02032;SSmut substrate is used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, lane 4) suggesting that it is meaningful in terms of splicing. These results indicate that yLuc7p contacts the pre-mRNA during commitment complex formation. Similar results have been reported for other yeast U1 snRNP proteins such as Nam8p.

In addition, Ex5&#x02032;U contained U residues in the 5&#x02032; half of exon 1 (nucleotides &#x02212;42 to &#x02212;19, where &#x02212;1 is the nucleotide adjacent to the 5&#x02032; splice site, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), Ex3&#x02032;U contained U residues in the 3&#x02032; half of exon 1 (nucleotides &#x02212;18 to &#x02212;1) and IntU contained U residues in the intron region (nucleotides +1 to +66) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Because 4-thio-U residues are essential for the detection of yLuc7p cross-linking to the pre-mRNA, appearance of a cross-linked species with one of these substrates would identify the region of contact between yLuc7p and the pre-mRNA. Cross-linking to all three substrates would indicate that yLuc7p contacts the pre-mRNA at the 5&#x02032; splice site itself. Control experiments demonstrated that these substrates, in the context of wild type, branchpoint and 3&#x02032;splice site sequences (Materials and Methods section) formed commitment complexes with the same efficiency (Supplementary Figure 1). Commitment complexes were assembled in extracts containing yLuc7p&#x02013;ProtA, yLuc7p&#x02013;TAP and Nam8p&#x02013;TAP (the latter containing fusions of yLuc7p or Nam8p to the TAP tag) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and cross-linking reactions were carried out as before. yLuc7p&#x02013;TAP cross-linked specifically to the Ex5&#x02032;U substrate but not to the Ex3&#x02032;U or IntU pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, compare lanes 3, 7 and 8). Consistently, yLuc7p-ProtA also cross-linked to the Ex5&#x02032;U substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, Nam8p&#x02013;TAP was only cross-linked to the IntU substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2), which was consistent with previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and demonstrated that this substrate was competent for cross-linking.</p><p>In order to confirm the identity of the cross-linked protein in the bands detected, half of the pellets in each cross-linking reaction were cleaved with the TEV protease. This enzyme specifically cleaves the TAP tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) releasing a &#x0223c;15-kDa ProtA fragment. As expected, the cross-linked species detected when we used Nam8p&#x02013;TAP or yLuc7p&#x02013;TAP tagged extracts were cleaved with the TEV protease (compare lanes 1 with 2, and 3 with 4). However, there was no difference in mobility between TEV-treated and untreated samples when extracts from yLuc7p&#x02013;protA were used (lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the cleavage observed was specific for the TAP tag and there are no other TEV sites within yLuc7p. Similarly, non-specific background bands were not affected by TEV protease treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, bands indicated with an asterisk). yLuc7p&#x02013;TAP, yLuc7p&#x02013;TAP cleaved by TEV protease, and yLuc7p&#x02013;ProtA migrated at different positions, consistent with their predicted relative molecular weights (compare lanes 3, 4 and 5). These data confirm unequivocally the identification of the cross-linked species as yLuc7p. Moreover, this experiment demonstrates that, during commitment complex formation, yLuc7p contacts the 5&#x02032; half of exon 1 in the WT-B pre-mRNA, a region that in this construct is within 23 nt from the 5&#x02032; cap.</p></sec><sec><title>yLuc7p binds the pre-mRNA with its first zinc finger</title><p>Zinc finger motifs have been shown to act as DNA or RNA-binding modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Since yLuc7p has two zinc finger motifs, we wanted to know whether yLuc7p contacts the pre-mRNA through any of its zinc finger motifs. For this purpose, we adapted a strategy originally described for topological studies of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). We reasoned that insertion of a TEV protease cleavage site in a non-conserved loop at the surface of the yLuc7p protein would result in the synthesis of a functional protein. This would then allow DSSP of this polypeptide after cross-linking and identification of the peptide covalently linked to the radiolabeled RNA fragment. We first inserted the sequence coding for an HA epitope tag and a TEV site in regions predicted from phylogenetic comparison to be in a variable loop exposed on the surface of the yLuc7p protein and located between the two putative zinc fingers. These fusions were engineered in the context of a yLuc7p&#x02013;ProtA fusion and next tested to determine whether they were functional and if they fully complemented a yLuc7p deletion. One such fusion, named here yLuc7p&#x02013;HA-TEV&#x02013;protA, was selected for further studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Western blot of extracts obtained from this strain showed that yLuc7p&#x02013;HA-TEV&#x02013;protA is stable in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 2). Commitment complex reactions were assembled using extracts derived from this strain and from the parental yLuc7p&#x02013;protA strain. Samples were UV irradiated, immunoprecipitated with IgG-coupled beads and split in two. One half was treated with TEV protease while the other half was mock-treated. Proteins were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Both yLuc7p&#x02013;protA and yLuc7p&#x02013;HA-TEV&#x02013;protA cross-linked efficiently to pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 5 and 6). No effect was observed after TEV treatment of the yLuc7p&#x02013;protA sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, compare lanes 5 and 9). However, after TEV treatment, yLuc7p&#x02013;HA-TEV&#x02013;protA releases a fragment which is cross-linked to the pre-mRNA and has a mobility of &#x0223c;18 kDa, corresponding to the size of the N-terminal half of yLuc7p plus the HA tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lane 10). Reproducible cross-linking to the C-terminal half (approximate MW 30 kDa) was not observed even though a weak and diffuse band with slower mobility (possibly a degradation product, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> with an asterisk) was sometimes detected. This result demonstrates that the N-terminal part of yLuc7p cross-links to the pre-mRNA. Although our results suggest that in these conditions no interaction occurs through the C-terminal half of yLuc7p, due to the presence of the spurious band migrating close to 30 kDa in some of our experiments, we cannot exclude the possibility that the second zinc finger may bind cooperatively aiding in the U1snRNP&#x02013;pre-mRNA interaction. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>yLuc7p cross-links the pre-mRNA through its first zinc finger.

Cells expressing this protein as the sole source of yLuc7p were viable, indicating the first zinc finger is not essential. Western blot experiments showed that the protein lacking the first zinc finger was stable in yeast extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 3). Interestingly, cross-linking of the pre-mRNA to this protein was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 8 and 12). This lack of cross-linking was not due to problems with that particular sample since all samples cross-linked with similar efficiency as shown before immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;4). Altogether these results demonstrate that yLuc7p makes contacts with the pre-mRNA through its first zinc finger.</p></sec><sec><title>The sequence of the pre-mRNA region where yLuc7p binding affects the efficiency of splicing in a yLuc7p-dependent way</title><p>Non-conserved sequences surrounding the 5&#x02032; splice site have been shown to be very important for efficient splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Given that yLuc7p makes contacts with the pre-mRNA in a non-conserved region, we wanted to know whether the sequence in that region affected splicing efficiency and whether yLuc7p was involved in this process. For this purpose we turned to a sensitive assay based on the alternative choice between two 5&#x02032; splice sites competing for a single 3&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The reporters used in this experiment had two duplicated 5&#x02032; splice sites and upstream of each one (nucleotides &#x02212;15 to &#x02212;35, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) we introduced three different sequences: a sequence rich in Gs (G sequence), a sequence that could potentially form a hairpin, (H sequence) and a sequence with high content in As (A sequence). The resulting reporters were named using a two-letter code, where the first letter represents the sequence preceding (nucleotides &#x02212;35 to &#x02212;15, where &#x02212;1 is the last nucleotide of exon 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) the upstream 5&#x02032; splice site, and the second letter represents the sequence preceding the downstream 5&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). According to this nomenclature the construct named GH has a G-rich sequence preceding the upstream 5&#x02032; splice site and a potential hairpin sequence preceding the downstream 5&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). These constructs were introduced into isogenic yLuc7p&#x02013;protA and yLuc7p&#x02013;&#x00394;ZF strains. Splicing efficiency was then examined by analyzing &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity that reports usage of the upstream versus the downstream 5&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, changing the sequence of the pre-mRNA had important effects in the efficiency of splicing. The G-rich sequence was preferred over the A-rich sequence (10-fold difference, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, compare lanes 9 to 11 and 15 to 17, note the logarithmic scale), and the potential hairpin H-sequence had an intermediate effect (compare, for example, lanes 7, 9 and 11). These effects are lost in the yLuc7p&#x02013;&#x00394;ZF background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, compare odd with even lanes for each construct) indicating that activation was mediated, at least to a significant extent, through the first zinc finger of yLuc7p. We conclude that the non-conserved sequence contacted by yLuc7p has an effect in splicing efficiency and that yLuc7p, through interaction with its first zinc finger, can modulate this effect. Although these results suggest that the primary factor determining splice site selection in this context is yLuc7p, we cannot exclude contribution of yLuc7p-independent effects to the observed splicing phenotype. Thus it is possible that additional factors, by contacting the pre-mRNA in the same region, could act together with Luc7p to modulate splice site selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Two proteins with extended sequence homology to yLuc7p are expressed in human cell lines</title><p>Database searches revealed expressed sequence tags (ESTs) corresponding to three human proteins sharing extended homology with yLuc7p (hLuc7A, hLuc7B1 and hLuc7B2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

However it is possible that some other proteins interacting loosely and/or non-stoichiometrically with the U1 snRNP are not detected after the purification process. In order to know whether hLuc7A associates to U1 snRNP, we performed immunoprecipitation of HeLa nuclear extracts with antibodies against hLuc7A and assayed for the presence of U1 snRNA in the pellets. As positive control we used antibodies against the U1 snRNP protein, U1-A. As negative control an antibody that recognizes POP1, an RNase MRP component, was used. U1-A antibodies precipitated U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, lane 11). However, only background is seen with POP1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, lane 10).

To further demonstrate a role for hLuc7A in pre-mRNA splicing, we decided to analyze the effect of overexpression of hLuc7A on splicing of a reporter <italic>in vivo</italic>. We used the system where HeLa cells are co-transfected with an adenovirus E1A reporter and overexpress SF2, which activates splicing from proximal (13s) sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). We then analyzed the effect of co-transfected hLuc7A on splicing.

The 13s, 12s and 9s mRNAs derived from splicing are shown.

Therefore overexpression of hLuc7A switched 5&#x02032; splice site utilization towards the more distal site, an effect similar to that produced by hnRNPA1.

We previously showed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) that Nam8p, a U1 snRNP component, binds the pre-mRNA during commitment complex formation in a region directly downstream of the 5&#x02032; splice site, where it stabilizes pre-mRNA&#x02013;U1 snRNP interaction and helps in the formation of commitment complexes. We also showed that changes in the pre-mRNA sequence introduced in the non-conserved region contacted by Nam8p produced a striking Nam8p-dependent effect in splice site recognition and selection. Thus, Nam8p by stabilizing U1 snRNP&#x02013;pre-mRNA interaction modulates splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We now propose that yLuc7p acts in a similar way. yLuc7p contacts non-conserved sequences in the exon, and in the specific context of our synthetic constructs, in a region within 23 nt from the cap. We also showed that this contact occurs mainly through its first zinc finger. Interestingly, similarly to what happens with Nam8p, changes in the non-conserved pre-mRNA sequence bound by yLuc7p affect splice site selection, and this effect is dependent on the presence of its first zinc finger too. Fortes <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) showed that extracts from yLuc7p mutant strains display defects in all steps of splicing <italic>in vitro</italic>, and these defects can be rescued by adding recombinant yLuc7p. They also showed that yLuc7p mutants exhibit reduced splicing activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that yLuc7p is required for CBC&#x02013;U1snRNP interactions. Based on our data, and in agreement with the data from Fortes <italic>et al.</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), we propose a model where yLuc7p contacts the pre-mRNA in a region close to the cap, where it is more likely to establish an interaction with CBC. yLuc7p acts by binding the pre-mRNA upstream the 5&#x02032; splice site and stabilizing pre-mRNA&#x02013;U1 snRNP interaction in commitment complexes. Therefore, yLuc7p could directly or indirectly interact with CBC and mediate the CBC effect in splice site selection. Zhang and Rosbash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) showed that another U1snRNP component, U1-C, contacts the pre-mRNA and stabilizes its interaction with the U1snRNA. Altogether, yLuc7p, U1-C, Nam8p, CBC and maybe other U1 snRNP proteins (ySnp1p/U1-70K, SmD1, SmD3 and Snu56p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) would interact with the pre-mRNA and produce a network of protein&#x02013;RNA interactions keeping the pre-mRNA stably bound to the U1 snRNP.</p><p>yLuc7p has two zinc finger motifs. We show that the first one cross-links the pre-mRNA and it is required for yLuc7p splicing activity. What is then the role for the second zinc finger? The U1 snRNP particle purified from a yLuc7p mutant strain appears completely disrupted, missing several proteins and it is inactive in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). It is possible that yLuc7p acts as a bridge between the pre-mRNA and the U1 snRNA through its two zinc fingers, the first one binding to the pre-mRNA and the second one binding to U1 snRNA. We tried to generate a yeast strain lacking the second zinc finger but we did not succeed. Diploid cells integrated the mutation but after sporulation none of the spores harboring the deletion were viable. This indicates that the integrity of the second zinc finger is necessary for viability. Perhaps it is required to keep a minimal structure of the U1 snRNP. It is also possible that the second zinc finger contributes to stabilize globally the snRNP&#x02013;pre-mRNA interaction by cooperatively helping the first zinc finger bind the pre-mRNA. Further experiments will be necessary to clarify this point.</p><p>Three U1 specific proteins co-purify with human U1 snRNP (U1-A, U1-C and U1-70k) and all three have counterparts in yeast U1 snRNP. In contrast, yeast U1 snRNP has seven additional proteins (Snu71p, Snu65p, Snu56p, Prp39p, Prp40p, Nam8p and yLuc7p). However, a human homolog has been described only for Nam8p, the apoptotic factor TIA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Here we demonstrate that hLuc7A is a new splicing factor, homolog to yeast yLuc7p. Human hLuc7A is a nuclear protein expressed in several human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Importantly, antibodies against hLuc7A specifically precipitate U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), indicating that it is a <italic>bona fide</italic> U1snRNP component. Interestingly, hLuc7A affects splice site selection by activating splicing from the distal 5&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Supporting our results, a recent report identified the new SR protein, SRrp53, as a protein interacting with hLuc7A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In addition, hLuc7A was purified with the supraspliceosome, a macromolecular complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that hLuc7A is a new splicing factor.</p><p>hLuc7 has three isoforms (hLuc7A, hLuc7B1 and hLucB2) derived from different genes, suggesting that it could be tissue specific or developmentally regulated. ESTs analysis shows that the pre-mRNA for hLuc7A undergoes alternative splicing, although we do not know yet the biological meaning of this variability. It is possible that hLuc7B1 and hLuc7B2 are also regulated by alternative splicing. The abundance of isoforms present in mammalian cells is remarkable when compared to the simplicity of the yeast system. This underscores the degree of complexity in the regulation of splicing in mammalian systems.</p><p>hLuc7A has a C-terminal tail rich in Asp, Ser and Arg repeats. These repeats are present in the splicing factors known as SR proteins where they have been shown to act as protein&#x02013;protein interaction modules, or to influence RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions. The SR repeats in hLuc7A could act by recruiting other splicing factors to the pre-mRNA, or by stabilizing U1snRNP&#x02013;pre-mRNA interactions. The fact that hLuc7A does not co-purify with human U1 snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) indicates that it remains loosely associated to this particle. This situation allows for more flexibility in the regulation of splice site selection. Thus, hLuc7A could first bind the pre-mRNA independently from U1 snRNP and, perhaps through interaction with U1-70k (via their RS domains) or by direct binding to U1 snRNA, could subsequently recruit the U1 snRNP to form the E-complex. In this sense, hLuc7A would act in a similar way than TIA-1, the human homolog of yeast Nam8p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Interestingly, human and yeast Luc7p share 50% identity in the zinc finger region suggesting that the mechanism of action might be similar. More experiments will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank I.
