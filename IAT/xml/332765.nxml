Specifically-primed reverse transcription products were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and then cloned into a mammalian expression plasmid. Candidate clones were identified by restriction analysis and then functionally tested by transfection into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, selecting for methotrexate-resistant colonies. Sequence analysis of the cDNA clones demonstrated the substitution of tryptophan (TGG) in place of the wild-type phenylalanine (TTC) at codon 31. Sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA extracted from the drug-resistant L5178Y cells confirmed the tryptophan codon at position 31. Transfection of mammalian tissue culture cells with expression plasmids containing the trp31 DHFR sequence resulted in substantial methotrexate-resistant colony formation. Recombinant trp31 DHFR enzyme activity expressed in stably-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells was approximately 20-fold less sensitive to methotrexate inhibition than wild-type mouse DHFR enzyme activity. We conclude that the cloned Trp31 DHFR sequence encodes an enzyme substantially resistant to methotrexate which confers a drug-resistance phenotype to cells in which it is expressed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0273-a" xlink:role="7027"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0275-a" xlink:role="7029"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0271.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7025"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0272.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7026"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0273.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7027"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0274.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7028"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0275.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7029"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0276.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7030"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0277.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7031"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00207-0278.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7032"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
