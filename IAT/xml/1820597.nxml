The distribution of CLIC1 in normal tissues is largely unknown and conflicting data have been reported regarding the cellular membrane fraction in which CLIC1 resides.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>New antisera to CLIC1 were generated and were found to be sensitive and specific for detecting this protein. These antisera were used to investigate the distribution of CLIC1 in mouse tissue sections and three cultured cell lines. We find CLIC1 is expressed in the apical domains of several simple columnar epithelia including glandular stomach, small intestine, colon, bile ducts, pancreatic ducts, airway, and the tail of the epididymis, in addition to the previously reported renal proximal tubule. CLIC1 is expressed in a non-polarized distribution in the basal epithelial cell layer of the stratified squamous epithelium of the upper gastrointesitinal tract and the basal cells of the epididymis, and is present diffusely in skeletal muscle. Distribution of CLIC1 was examined in Panc1 cells, a relatively undifferentiated, non-polarized human cell line derived from pancreatic cancer, and T84 cells, a human colon cancer cell line which can form a polarized epithelium that is capable of regulated chloride transport. Digitonin extraction was used to distinguish membrane-inserted CLIC1 from the soluble cytoplasmic form of the protein. We find that digitonin-resistant CLIC1 is primarily present in the plasma membrane of Panc1 cells. In T84 cells, we find digitonin-resistant CLIC1 is present in an intracellular compartment which is concentrated immediately below the apical plasma membrane and the extent of apical polarization is enhanced with forskolin, which activates transepithelial chloride transport and apical membrane traffic in these cells. The sub-apical CLIC1 compartment was further characterized in a well-differentiated mouse renal proximal tubule cell line. The distribution of CLIC1 was found to overlap that of megalin and the sodium-phosphate cotransporter, NaPi-II, which are markers of the apical endocytic/recycling compartment in proximal tubule.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The cell and tissue specific patterns of CLIC1 expression suggest it may play distinct roles in different cell types. In certain polarized columnar epithelia, it may play a role in apical membrane recycling.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>A variety of distinct chloride channel activities have been described that carry out many essential roles in organismal physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Disruption or disregulation of chloride conductances are central to several well-described disease processes, perhaps most notably, cystic fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although the proteins responsible for some chloride conductances have been described, there are still multiple physiologically important chloride channel activities for which the molecular basis is not yet understood. Identification of the proteins responsible for these "orphan" channel activities will be an important step in more fully understanding ion transport physiology in health and disease.</p><p>CLICs are a closely related family of chloride channel proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In mammals, the family consists of six genes named CLICs one through six. The CLIC family is defined by a conserved, approximately 230 amino acid core sequence which comprises the C-termini of all known CLICs. Sequences amino-terminal to the core region are divergent both in sequence and in size. The highly conserved CLIC domain has no homology to other known chloride channel proteins; however it does show low but significant homology to the family of glutathione-S-transferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Evidence that CLICs are chloride channels comes from a variety of experiments and systems. Exogenous expression of CLIC1, 3, 4, and 5 have all been reported to result in the appearance of novel chloride channel activity using a variety of expression and assay systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Conclusive proof that a purified CLIC can function as a channel was first presented for CLIC1. Expression of CLIC1 in bacteria followed by purification to apparent homogeneity was shown to yield a distinct channel activity when reconstituted in phospholipid membranes, demonstrating unequivocally that CLIC1 alone, without any other subunits or regulatory proteins, functions as an anion-selective channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>CLIC proteins have biochemical properties which are quite unusual for ion channels. Unlike most other ion channels, CLIC proteins exist in cells both as integral membrane proteins and as soluble, cytoplasmic proteins. <italic>In vitro</italic>, soluble aqueous CLIC1 has been shown to insert directly into pre-formed phospholipid membranes, with this spontaneous insertion leading to active channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>To date, papers from three independent research groups have reported observations of channel activity associated with purified recombinant CLIC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. While each group finds channels that can be inhibited by IAA-94, there is little consensus regarding single channel properties including single channel conductance, ion selectivity, lipid dependence, and effects of oxidation. In particular, Tulk <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] report a single channel conductance of more than twice the magnitude of that reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, estimates of the ratio of chloride to potassium permeabilities ranges from very high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] through intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] to very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Each group used somewhat different methods, but the basis for these discrepancies in observed fundamental properties of the protein remains unexplained.</p><p>Although CLIC1 clearly can function as a channel <italic>in vitro</italic>, the role of CLIC1 in normal physiology remains uncertain and the membrane fraction in which it primarily resides has not been clearly identified. Based on a staining pattern in CHO cells, it was initially proposed that CLIC1 is a channel of the nuclear membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our initial studies in cultured human cells revealed a pattern of punctate staining throughout the cytoplasm with little nuclear localization, leading us to propose that CLIC1 could be a channel of intracellular cytoplasmic organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Subsequently, single channels consistent with CLIC1 have been reported on the plasma membrane of cells and the correlation of expression with cell cycle stage has led to the proposal that CLIC1 may be involved in cell cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. One significant problem confounding prior studies of subcellular distribution of CLIC1 is the observation that CLICs are present in cells both as a membrane-inserted, integral membrane protein, and as a soluble, apparently cytoplasmic protein. In some cell types, the soluble CLIC1 is significantly more abundant than the membrane-associated form. Thus, cell staining techniques which do not distinguish between soluble and membrane-associated CLIC may lead to erroneous conclusions.</p><p>An important clue to the role of a protein is its distribution in normal cells and tissues. CLIC1 had previously been shown to be abundant in apical membranes of renal proximal tubule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], in a cytoplasmic distribution in placental trophoblast epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and in the acrosomal region of mature spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In order to address this question further, we have explored the distribution of expression of endogenous CLIC1 in a variety of mouse tissues using immunohistochemical techniques. In this paper, we show that CLIC1 is expressed in the apical domain of a variety of simple columnar epithelia as well as in a non-polarized distribution in the basal cell layer of some stratified squamous epithelia, and is present diffusely throughout skeletal muscle fibers. We further investigated subcellular localization of CLIC1 in three distinct cell lines using dual-label confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. To distinguish between membrane associated and cytoplasmic CLIC1, we used digitonin extraction prior to fixation to selectively solubilize cytoplasmic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In Panc1 cells, a relatively undifferentiated non-polarized cell line which expresses abundant CLIC1, we find that the characteristic intracellular punctate staining pattern previously reported is due to digitonin-extractable, presumably cytoplasmic, CLIC1, while the majority of the digitonin-resistant CLIC1 colocalizes with plasma membrane markers. In T84 cells, a highly polarized colonic epithelial cell line, CLIC1 expression is polarized to the apical domain of the cell, reproducing the polarized expression observed in normal tissues. The extent of apical polarization is enhanced in response to stimulation of the cells with forskolin, which activates transepithelial chloride transport in these cells via a CFTR-mediated mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Unlike in Panc1 cells, the pattern of distribution in T84 cells is not significantly altered by extraction with digitonin. Double label experiments indicate that the mass of the digitonin-resistant CLIC1 does not precisely colocalize with the apical plasma membrane but is immediately below it. In MPTC, an immortalized mouse kidney proximal tubule cell line, the distribution of CLIC1 intersects with that of both megalin and NaPi2, markers of the apical membrane endocytic/recycling compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>We conclude that CLIC1 is widely expressed in a specific set of epithelial and non-epithelial cell types where it shows tissue- and cell-specific patterns of subcellular localization. The data suggest CLIC1 may play different roles in various cells, one of which may be to contribute to endocytosis and/or recycling of the apical plasma membrane in certain polarized epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of antibodies raised against CLIC1</title><p>The affinity-purified 1089 antisera, AP1089, and the mouse monoclonal antibody, 9F5, were used to probe western blots of bacterial cell lysates expressing glutathione-S-transferase (GST) or GST fusion proteins containing full length human CLIC1, CLIC4, and CLIC5A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). A fusion protein of the predicted size is the most abundant protein in each lane and is easily seen on a Coomassie Blue stained gel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Both AP1089 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and 9F5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) only recognize the CLIC1 fusion protein. In protein preparations from mouse kidney, Panc1 cells or HELA cells, AP1089 recognizes a single band with apparent molecular weight of 34,000 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Overexpression of human CLIC1 in HELA cells using a vaccinia-driven expression system leads to this band becoming more prominent without the appearance of any other band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, lane 4). Similarly, the monoclonal antibody 9F5 recognizes a single protein with apparent molecular weight of 34,000 in Panc1, T84, and mouse kidney proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Of note, both CLIC4 (running at about 31,000 molecular weight) and CLIC5B (running at about 65,000 molecular weight) are expected to be present in mouse kidney and are not recognized by the antibody while CLIC1 is robustly detected. Finally, AP1089 and 9F5 give identical patterns when used to stain Panc1 cells either without or with digitonin extraction (see figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> below). Thus, we conclude that both AP1089 and monoclonal 9F5 are specific for CLIC1.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of antibodies</bold>. <bold>A. </bold>Lysates of bacteria expressing glutathione-S-transferase (GST, lane 1) or GST-CLIC1 (lane 2), GST-CLIC4 (lane 3) or GST-CLIC5 (lane 4) fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue.

Cells fixed directly with PLP and stained with the AP1089 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) showed the typical intracellular punctuate staining pattern that we had reported previously using a different CLIC1 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. There is negative staining of the nucleus in most cells, indicating that staining of the cytoplasm is more intense than staining of the nucleus. To characterize the staining patterns further, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained simultaneously with both the polyclonal rabbit AP1089 and the monoclonal mouse 9F5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The two antibodies give essential identical staining patterns with nearly perfect colocalization. Double staining for CLIC1 with AP1089 and with monoclonal antibodies specific for markers of the endoplasmic reticulum (BiP), the Golgi apparatus (Golgi 58 K protein), lysosomes (Lamp1), and trans-Golgi network (TGN46) all failed to show any significant colocalization (not shown).</p><p>The staining pattern of CLIC1 must result from superimposed distribution of the soluble and membrane-inserted fractions of the protein. We were concerned that the distribution of the abundant cytoplasmic CLIC1 might be obscuring the distribution of the less abundant membrane-inserted form of the protein. The non-ionic detergent, digitonin, has been reported to solubilize selectively cytoplasmic proteins while leaving membrane-inserted proteins in place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To determine whether we could use digitonin to remove selectively non-membrane-associated CLIC1 from cells, Panc1 cells were grown on plastic culture dishes and extracted with 0.004% (w/v) digitonin at room temperature for two minutes. Soluble and membrane fractions were then prepared from the cells by centrifugation. Two micrograms of soluble protein or 8.5 &#x003bc;g of membrane protein were blotted and probed for CLIC1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Clearly, digitonin extraction removes the soluble CLIC1 from these cells without significantly removing the membrane-associated CLIC1.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Digitonin extraction selectively removes soluble CLIC1 from Panc1 and T84 cells</bold>.

The resulting staining pattern is weaker than with non-digitonin extracted cells, requiring more sensitive detection settings to obtain an image. However, the staining pattern is markedly greater than and different from matched preparations stained with control antibody (not shown). After digitonin extraction, the prominent intracellular punctate staining pattern has disappeared, leaving a fainter wispy peripheral localization of the residual staining, plus some staining of a circular structure suggestive of the nucleus. Digitonin-extracted cells were also double stained with both anti-CLIC1 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).

Thus digitonin-resistant CLIC1 could conceivably represent cytoskeletal rather than membrane distribution. In contrast to digitonin, Triton X-100 has been reported to solubilize both cytoplasmic and membrane protein while leaving the cytoskeleton intact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To distinguish whether the digitonin-resistant CLIC1 represents membrane or cytoskeletal association, we compared the distribution of CLIC1 in cells which had been extracted with digitonin with that in cells which had been extracted with Triton X-100. Panc1 cells were grown on coverslips and subjected to a two minute extraction with 0.004% (w/v) digitonin or a five minute extraction with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. The cells were then fixed and processed as usual and stained with the AP1089 antibody for CLIC1 and with a monoclonal pan-anti-cytokeratin antibody to label the intermediate-filament cytoskeleton. Results are shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. Clearly both the digitonin and Triton X-100 extractions leave the cytoskeleton intact while the Triton X-100 extraction completely eliminates the peripheral plasma membrane CLIC1 staining seen in the digitonin extracted cells. We conclude that the peripheral CLIC1 staining represents CLIC1 in the plasma membrane and not associated with the cytoskeleton. Of note, some of the punctuate intranuclear staining is Triton X-100 resistant, suggesting it may be associated with nuclear skeletal elements.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Differential extraction of CLIC1 from Panc1 Cells with digitonin and Triton X-100</bold>.

Digitonin extraction did appear to decrease the diffuse faint staining between the more intensely stained discreet structures. Although there was clearly some colocalization, the level of the most intense staining for CLIC1 either with or without digitonin extraction was slightly below the most intense staining level for WGA, suggesting that the bulk of the digitonin-insoluble CLIC1 is not in the plasma membrane itself, but congregated immediately below it.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of digitonin extraction on distribution of CLIC1 in T84 cells</bold>.

We have been unable to identify this compartment further in T84 cells, but it is clear that many polarized epithelial cells have abundant subapical vesicles which are involved in endocytosis and recycling. To investigate whether CLIC1 may be in this compartment, we studied a mouse kidney proximal tubule cell line, MPTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Kidney proximal tubule cells are well suited for this purpose since several well characterized proteins are known to transit through the endocytic/recycling compartment in these cells. Megalin, a multi-specific scavenging receptor for many components of the glomerular filtrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and NaPi-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the sodium-phosphate co-transporter, are two proteins which are known undergo endocytosis and, in the case of megalin, recycling to the plasma membrane in kidney proximal tubule cells. We grew MPTC cells on permeable supports under conditions to maximize differentiation. As in proximal tubule cells in intact kidney, these cells express abundant CLIC1 which shows a strongly apically polarized distribution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with rabbit polyclonal antisera to megalin or NaPi-II and costained with the 9F5 monoclonal antibody to CLIC1. Confocal images were collected from regions below the apical pole of the cells and are shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>. Clearly many of the punctuate structures that stain for megalin or NaPi-II also stain for CLIC1. However, there certainly are structures that stain for either megalin or NaPi-II but not for CLIC1, and structures that stain for CLIC1 but not for megalin or NaPi-II.

Our data sheds new light on possible roles for CLIC1 in different tissues and cell types.</p><p>Prior northern blot data indicated that CLIC1 is widely expressed throughout the body, with particularly strong signals in muscle, liver, and kidney. However, northern blot data only reflect the presence of mRNA and do not necessarily perfectly correlate with the steady state level of encoded protein. Furthermore, northern blots using RNA isolated from whole organs are necessarily silent regarding heterogeneity of expression among the cells of a given organ or subcellular location within individual cells. Thus, the data presented here represents a significant new contribution to knowledge of CLIC1 expression patterns.</p><p>We found CLIC1 expressed in three distinct patterns. First, in several simple columnar epithelia, CLIC1 is expressed in an apically polarized pattern. Tissues showing this pattern include the epithelia of airways, intrahepatic biliary ducts, gall bladder, pancreatic duct, surface epithelia of the glandular stomach, small intestine and colon, in addition to the previously described renal proximal tubule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A second pattern of staining is demonstrated by non-keratinizing stratified epithelia of the esophagus, and forestomach. In these tissues, the basal layer of cells express CLIC1 abundantly without clear subcellular specificity, although the prominence of staining of the periphery of the cells suggest CLIC1 may be present in plasma membrane. The epididymis, which is comprised of both columnar epithelial cells and basal cells, shows both patterns of staining. The basal cells stain throughout the organ, while only the tail of the epididymis exhibits staining of columnar cells. The third pattern of expression is found in the muscle cells of skeletal muscle. Here, CLIC1 is present throughout the cytoplasm.</p><p>Numerous tissues and cell types failed to stain for CLIC1. These cells may indeed express no CLIC1 at all, or they may express it at levels below the detection threshold of our staining method. These tissues include acinar secretory epithelia such as pancreatic acinar cells, subepithelial glands of lung and colon, and the submandibular salivary gland. Endocrine cells of the adrenal and the pancreatic islets failed to stain. Connective tissues surrounding each of the organs studied were consistently negative. Skin, spleen, smooth muscle of the gut, and the heart were all without significant staining for CLIC1.</p><p>These observations defy simple generalizations about CLIC1 expression. For example, the abundant expression in the rapidly dividing basal layer of the upper gastointestinal tract would be consistent with a role in cell cycle as previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], but its absence from the equally rapidly dividing basal layer in skin epithelium or in generative nodules in spleen, rule out a generally required role in this process. Likewise, CLIC1 is abundant in skeletal muscle, but its absence in smooth and cardiac muscle rules out an absolute requirement for this protein in a muscle-specific function. The existence of other closely related CLIC family members complicates the analysis. There may indeed be a necessary function played by a CLIC in these processes, but a family member other than CLIC1 may carry out the role in tissues where CLIC1 is not prominently expressed. A consistent common thread does run through the epithelia which demonstrate apically polarized expression: these are all columnar epithelia which carry out transepithelial transport of salt and water and which have abundant apical membrane trafficking. Thus it is possible that CLIC1 may be functioning as a chloride channel in the apical plasma membrane or subapical intracellular vesicles in these cells.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry can be very useful for identifying cells and tissues expressing a particular antigen, but the limited resolution makes detailed subcellular localization difficult to determine. To define the membrane compartments in which CLIC1 may reside more precisely, we used immuofluorescence studies of three distinct cell lines: Panc1 cells, a poorly differentiated, non-polarized cell line derived from a human pancreatic cancer; T84 cells, a well-differentiated, highly polarized cell line derived from human colon cancer; and MPTC cells, an immortalized kidney proximal tubule cell line derived from a mouse transgenic for temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen. All three of these cell types express CLIC1 abundantly.</p><p>In the non-polarized cell line, PLP fixation followed by staining for CLIC1 reveals abundant CLIC1 in the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern. However, the bulk of the CLIC1 is soluble and not membrane-associated, as reflected both by differential centrifugation and digitonin extraction. Digitonin extraction removes the punctate cytoplasmic staining, indicating that this pattern was due to the abundant soluble CLIC1. Much of the digitonin-resistant CLIC1 colocalizes with plasma membrane markers, indicating that the primary site of membrane-inserted CLIC1 in these cells is the plasma membrane. The observation that the peripheral digitonin-resistant CLIC1 is solubilized by Triton X-100 supports the interpretation that CLIC1 in this distribution is present as a membrane protein and not as a component of the cytoskeleton. The variability of staining intensity among cells in culture is consistent with the variation with cell cycle of plasma membrane activity attributed to CLIC1 as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Some of the digitonin-resistant CLIC1 colocalizes with the nucleus. However, it appears to be within the nucleus, not inserted into the nuclear envelope where one would expect CLIC1 if it were functioning as a nuclear membrane channel. Since the low concentration of digitonin used in these studies is not expected to permeabilize the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], it remains possible that the residual nuclear CLIC1 observed following digitonin extraction is soluble rather than membrane-associated.</p><p>T84 cells showed a pattern of CLIC1 distribution quite different from that of Panc1 cells. These cells express CLIC1 in a distinctly apically polarized distribution, and this polarized expression is exaggerated following exposure to forskolin. In comparison to Panc1 cells, a larger fraction of CLIC1 is membrane-associated, both by differential centrifugation and by resistance to digitonin extraction. Furthermore, digitonin extraction does not dramatically alter the staining pattern of CLIC1 in T84 cells. Double-labeling experiments using a marker of the apical plasma membrane confirm that the polarized distribution of membrane-inserted CLIC1 is enhanced by treatment with forskolin and that the digitonin-resistent CLIC1 is not in the apical plasma membrane itself, but is concentrated immediately below it. The data indicate that the bulk of membrane inserted CLIC1 in T84 cells is in subapical membrane vesicles.</p><p>MPTC cells also show apically polarized distribution of CLIC1 which mirrors the distribution of CLIC1 in proximal tubule cells in intact kidneys. In these cells, the distribution of CLIC1 intersects with that of both megalin and NaPi-II, identifying at least a portion of the CLIC1-positive vesicles as components of the apical endocytic/recycling compartment. Endocytic and recycling vesicles are known to contain a chloride conductance which plays an important role in vesicular acidification which in turn is critical for orderly membrane traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

Whether CLIC1 also plays a role as a chloride channel in this pathway remains to be determined. However, it does at least appear to be physically present in a fraction of the vesicles along this pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CLIC1 expression exhibits tissue- and cell type-specific patterns, both in the extent of expression and in subcellular distribution. In non-polarized cells such as basal epithelial cells of upper gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscle, and cultured Panc1 cells, CLIC1 is expressed in a non-polarized distribution that appears to be throughout the cytoplasm. In the cultured cell model of non-polarized cells, the majority of the CLIC1 is present in a soluble form in the cytoplasm, while the membrane-inserted fraction of CLIC1 is primarily in the plasma membrane. In contrast, in some polarized epithelial cells, the expression of CLIC1 is strongly polarized to the apical domain. Using the cultured cells as a model, a larger fraction of the total CLIC1 is membrane-inserted; the membrane-inserted form of the protein is not primarily in the plasma membrane, but in subapical membranes vesicles which do not colocalize with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or trans-Golgi network, but which do partially colocalize in with a subset of the apical endocytic/recycling compartment. Whether CLIC1 contributes to the chloride conductance and regulation of acidification of vesicles along this pathway remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-CLIC1 fusion protein was produced in bacteria, purified to apparent homogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and used to raise both a rabbit polyclonal antisera and a mouse monoclonal antibody, using the services of Cocalico, Inc., Reamstown, PA.

Panc1 cells were grown in DMEM (low glucose) with 10% fetal calf serum. T84 cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM (low glucose) and Hamm's F12 with 5% newborn calf serum. All media was supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin. For staining, Panc1 cells were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated glass cover slips and grown for at least two days prior to fixation. T84 cells were seeded at near-confluence on Collagen I-coated Millicel CM culture plate inserts (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and maintained in culture for 2&#x02013;3 days after reaching apparent confluence. Vaccinia-driven expression of CLIC1 in HELA cells was as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>MPTC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] were derived from an otherwise normal mouse that is transgenic for a temperature sensitive SV40 large T antigen (Immortomouse, Charles River Labs, Wilmington MA).

For staining, the cells were grown to confluence in propagation medium, then switched to differentiation media and incubated for 2&#x02013;3 days at 39&#x000b0;C. Differentiation medium for the basal chamber was the same as propagation medium except for the addition of 1 nM T3 and the omission of epithelial growth factor and interferon. Differentiation medium for the apical chamber was identical to basolateral differentiation medium except for the omission of fetal bovine serum. Care was taken so that the volume of medium in the apical chamber of a 0.6 cm<sup>2 </sup>filter did not exceed 150 &#x003bc;l.</p></sec><sec><title>Staining mouse tissue sections</title><p>Fresh organs from normal young adult mice were rinsed with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 135 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0), submerged in Tissue Tek embedding solution, and frozen in a dry ice/2-methyl butane bath. Five micron thick sections were obtained. Individual sections were thawed and immediately fixed with methanol at -20&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated by incubation with a 4:1 mixture of methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 minutes at room temperature. Sections were blocked by incubation in PBS-fg (PBS with 5% goat serum, 0.02% fish gelatin) for 1 hour at room temperature, and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in a humidified chamber.
