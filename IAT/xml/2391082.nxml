One such sliding clamp is PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), which forms a ring-shaped trimeric complex and is well known for its roles in DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. However, PCNA has been shown to also be involved in other processes including cell cycle control and DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Additional evidence suggests that PCNA may play roles in chromatin remodeling, RNA transcription, and tissue differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>Another ring-like complex called GINS (go, ichi, ni, san) has recently been described in diverse organisms including <italic>Saccharomyces cerivisiae</italic> and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Four evolutionarily conserved components, Sld5, Psf1 (i.e., partner of Sld5 1), Psf2, and Psf3, comprise the GINS heterotetramer. Studies have shown that GINS binds to the pre-RC in a cdc45-mediated and CDK-dependent manner, and the presence of GINS components is required for DNA synthesis to occur in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts. The ring-like structure and specific interactions suggest that GINS, like PCNA, acts as a sliding clamp for DNA polymerase epsilon to promote initiation and continued elongation during DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we found that <italic>Psf2</italic> (<italic>partner of Sld5 2</italic>) is significantly upregulated during the process of lens regeneration (a phenomenon also known as cornea-lens transdifferentiation) in the frog, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, expressed sequence tag (EST) &#x0201c;H145&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. In situ hybridization during embryonic stages revealed a tissue-specific <italic>Psf2</italic> expression pattern including expression in both the developing retina and lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref> and see the more thorough description in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]). Interestingly, the spatial expression of <italic>Psf2</italic> differs from that of the other GINS components. Moreover, <italic>Psf2</italic> expression does not simply coincide with embryonic tissues that exhibit the highest rates of cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Likewise, these patterns of expression do not entirely match those of PCNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. These observations indicate that various factors involved in DNA replication are deployed in different embryonic tissues and could have other functions. One report demonstrated that <italic>Psf2</italic> expression is activated in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], and this gene also appears to play a role in chromosome segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>].</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Embryonic expression of <italic>Psf2</italic>. <bold>A</bold>: An example of a whole mount in situ hybridization pattern showing localization of <italic>Psf2</italic> in specific embryonic tissues (stage 33) is shown.

For immunological detection of lens proteins, primary cross-absorbed rabbit anti-lens antibody and goat anti-rabbit-rhodamine secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) were used, as described in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Other specimens were stained in Harris hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific, Hanover Park, IL) following published protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Some lenses were measured using a filar micrometer, and lens diameters were recorded for each serial section to calculate the volume.

A rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 S10P antibody (histone H3 phosphorylated at serine 10, kindly provided by Dr. Craig Mizzen, University of Illinois-Urbana, Urbana, IL) was used to identify proliferating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. This antibody labels nuclei during prophase through the anaphase of mitosis. Slides were dewaxed in xylene, allowed to air dry, and rehydrated in PBT (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20). Slides were then blocked in 5% dry milk in PBS for at least 2 h and incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 S10P antibody (1:500) for at least 2 h. After washing six times in PBT, slides were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) in darkness for at least 1 h followed by six washes in PBT before mounting in 80% glycerol with 20% PBS and a 1:10,000 dilution of Hoechst 33342 to label all nuclei (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).</p><p>Due to the relatively low number of mitotic cells contained within the eye (e.g., nuclei labeled for phospho-histone H3 S10P) and the need to derive a significant set of measurements, labeled cells were counted in every serial section that contained eye tissues (i.e., the retina and lens) for each specimen examined. Five specimens injected with Psf2MO that exhibited the typical severe phenotype and five specimens injected with CONMO that exhibited the typical normal phenotype were examined. In each case, the control eyes (formed on the uninjected sides) and the contralateral eyes (formed on the morpholino-injected sides) were compared. Stage 36 embryos were selected because the differentiated eye phenotypes are readily apparent and <italic>Psf2</italic> is expressed in the retina and lens at that stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Lens and retinal areas were then determined for three random sections of each eye using the measure function in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</ext-link> by tracing the outlines of these structures. These areas were then used to determine the total volumes of the lens and retina by an ellipsoid volume formula derived by McKenney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>], modified to account for unequal spacing between the three sections used. An estimate of the total number of cells per unit volume of the retina and lens was then derived by counting all Hoechst 33342-labeled nuclei in three random sections containing lens tissue and six random sections containing retinal tissue for each specimen. These data were used to calculate the fraction of anti-H3 S10P positively stained cell nuclei in the retina and lens tissues for comparisons between control uninjected, Psf2MO injected, and CONMO injected cases. The standard deviation of the fraction of phospho-histone H3 S10P positive cells was calculated to evaluate the range and significance of each data set. The fractions of positively stained cells between Psf2MO cases and CONMO cases were compared using the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of cell death via TUNEL assay</title><p>The whole-mount TUNEL staining protocol was adapted from reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] with all washes and incubations performed with constant agitation.

Briefly, embryos were rehydrated in PBS, washed in PBT (0.2% Tween 20 in PBS), washed again in PBS, and washed in 1X terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Recombinant TdT (Promega, Madison, WI) was added at a concentration of 150 U/ml with 0.5 &#x000b5;M digoxigenin dUTP (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and embryos were incubated overnight at room temperature. The reaction was terminated in PBS with 1&#x000a0;mM EDTA at 65&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and then washed with PBS at room temperature. The detection and chromogenic reactions were adapted from Harland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Embryos were washed in PBT/BSA (PBS, 20&#x000a0;mg/ml BSA, 0.1% Triton-X; Sigma) and blocked in PBT/BSA with 20% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Embryos were further incubated overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase antibody (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) that was diluted 1:2000 in PBT/BSA with 20% goat serum. Reactions were washed at least four times with PBT/BSA at room temperature and washed briefly with alkaline phosphatase (AP) buffer, then the stain was developed using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrates. The reaction developed at room temperature for 30 min and was terminated by washing in AP buffer, and embryos were refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature to stabilize the staining pattern. Embryos were washed in 100% methanol and rehydrated in PBS. Using clear glass vials, embryos were bleached of their own natural pigmentation using 4% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1&#x02013;2 h on a fluorescent light box, washed briefly in PBS, and then dehydrated with 100% methanol. Specimens were cleared in 2:1 benzyl benzoate/benzyl alcohol (BABB) for whole mount examination and then washed in three changes of 100% methanol and finally transferred to 100% xylene for embedding and sectioning as described above for histological analysis.</p><p>The number of TUNEL positive cells in these tissues was much greater, and therefore, estimates of the fractions of TUNEL positive cells in the retina and lens tissues were assessed by examining random sections through the eyes in control, uninjected embryos and morpholino-injected embryos. Control eyes formed on the uninjected sides and contralateral eyes formed on the MO-injected sides were examined in five specimens injected with Psf2MO (exhibiting the typical severe phenotype) and five specimens injected with CONMO (exhibiting the typical normal phenotype) at stage 36. For each embryo, three random sections from the uninjected side and three random sections from the morpholino-injected side were examined. Sections were selected that contained both retina and lens tissue. In each section, all TUNEL positive nuclei and all Hoechst 33342-labeled nuclei were counted separately for the lens and the retina. These data were used to obtain an estimate of the fraction of TUNEL positive cells in the retina and lens tissues for comparisons between the control, uninjected cases, the Psf2MO cases, and the CONMO injected cases. As above, the standard deviation of the fraction of TUNEL positive cells was calculated to determine the range and significance of each data set. Likewise, the fractions of positively stained cells between Psf2MO cases and CONMO cases were compared using the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test; p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>Psf2</italic> expression: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis</title><p>The spatio-temporal expression pattern of <italic>Psf2</italic> has already been described for embryonic stages 14&#x02013;37 as well as during the process of lens regeneration in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]).

A very small, baseline level of eye defects was also seen in uninjected control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>).

These findings indicate that the significant levels of developmental defects detected in Psf2MO-injected cases cannot be simply attributed to the injection procedure or to non-specific cytotoxicity of the morpholinos.</p><p>When Psf2MO was localized to non-eye tissues, additional malformations were observed. For example, the overall size of the developing brain was reduced on the injected side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A,D-E,H-I</xref>). Sections through these specimens revealed that the CNS on the morpholino-injected side contained fewer cells and even lacked a definitive proliferative (ventricular) zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A,D-E</xref>). The otic vesicles were reduced or absent on the Psf2MO side as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4H-I</xref>). The incidence of eye defects was rare when Psf2MO was targeted to non-eye tissues, and this frequency was no higher than that observed in uninjected or CONMO-injected control embryos (data not shown).

Unfortunately, in our hands, this antibody failed to display a band of expected size in western blots using control, uninjected embryos (21,325 Da).</p><p>As an alternative approach, the specificity of the morpholino knockdown was verified by RNA rescue. Specifically, a cloned DNA variant was designed to generate an altered form of synthetic rescue RNA encoding full-length functional Psf2 protein (see Methods). RNA rescue represents a highly stringent test for specificity as the experiments rely on the functional capacity of the injected RNA. Cells were co-injected with both lissamine-tagged Psf2MO and the altered Psf2 rescue RNA (altPsf2 RNA) at different concentrations. The co-injection of altPsf2 RNA with Psf2MO significantly reduced the overall frequency and severity of eye defects in a dose dependent fashion (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3P-R</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3S-U</xref>).

To examine this, we combined morpholino injections with reciprocal transplantation of the presumptive lens ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). Embryos were co-injected at the four-cell stage to produce severe eye defects (e.g., phenotypes seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3K,Q</xref>). Injected embryos were raised to stage 14, and those with proper GFP expression in the presumptive retina and lens were used for reciprocal presumptive lens ectoderm transplants with uninjected control embryos (see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). Specimens were then raised to stage 36 and scored for eye and lens defects. Larvae with morpholino-containing donor tissue were scored for the presence of GFP in tissues derived from the donor transplant (i.e., the lens and head ectoderm), and morpholino-containing hosts were examined for GFP in the retina. Those that met the above conditions with transplants correctly located over the eye were sectioned and subsequently analyzed for the presence of lens proteins using the anti-lens antibodies.

The fraction of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the Psf2MO-injected cases compared to the CONMO-injected cases (p=0.011). Apoptotic cells were seen throughout the retina but predominantly located within the differentiating neuronal layers. A slight increase in the level of apoptosis was also seen in the lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9G</xref>) where the fraction of apoptotic cells in the lens differed significantly between Psf2MO-injected and CONMO-injected cases (p=0.03) but not when compared to the uninjected controls (p=0.07). Increases in the level of apoptosis were also noticed in the pharyngeal region and the gut (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9A</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9C</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9F</xref>). However, not all tissues that express <italic>Psf2</italic> exhibited these increases. For instance, there was no noticeable difference in the level of apoptosis in the somitic mesoderm in the trunk and tail following a pattern that mirrors the distinct repeated (striped) Psf2 mRNA expression pattern seen in this tissue (for instance, compare the whole mount expression pattern shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>, and those more specifically described by Walter and Henry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], to the TUNEL staining patterns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9A-B,D-E</xref>).</p><fig id="f8" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Effects of Psf2MO and CONMO injections on cell proliferation in the neural retina and lens. <bold>A</bold>-<bold>H</bold>: Transverse sections of eyes in Psf2MO-injected and CONMO-injected embryos show corresponding pairs of differential interference contrast and fluorescence micrographs.

They are stable and effective quite late in development (into the early tadpole stages in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]). The morpholino knockdown studies reported here clearly demonstrate an important role of <italic>Psf2</italic> in the development of the eye. Other defects were also observed in brain tissues where <italic>Psf2</italic> is also normally expressed. When <italic>Psf2</italic> morpholino was targeted to non-eye tissues, defects were not observed in the eye above the low levels of background minor defects seen in uninjected or CONMO-injected embryos. These results demonstrate that the defects seen in the eye are directly correlated to the presence of Psf2MO in those progenitors. Furthermore, co-injection of rescue altPsf2 RNA with Psf2MO significantly reduced both the frequency as well as the severity of the defects observed versus those seen using comparable morpholino dosages without altPsf2 RNA (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). These observations corroborate the specificity of the <italic>Psf2</italic> morpholino knockdown effects in this study.</p><p>In situ hybridization analysis shows that <italic>Psf2</italic> is expressed in the anterior CNS of neurula stage embryos particularly in the region of the forebrain and presumptive retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. During the later stages of optic cup development, <italic>Psf2</italic> expression continues in the lens and optic cup and more intensely in the ciliary marginal zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. The latter has been shown to be the site of proliferative activity responsible for increased growth of the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. Other tissues also express <italic>Psf2</italic> including the pharyngeal mesoderm and paraxial mesoderm within the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref> and see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]). Interestingly, there were no significant differences noted in the level of proliferation in the retina or the lens following injections with Psf2MO. On the other hand, there were elevated levels of apoptosis particularly in the retina. Apoptotic cells were mainly seen in the differentiating layers of the retina. This may imply that <italic>Psf2</italic> is required at some level for the differentiation or survival of retinal cells. Although elevated levels of apoptosis were also detected in other tissues that express <italic>Psf2</italic> (including the forebrain and the pharyngeal region) following Psf2MO injections, we did not observe similar increases in the paraxial mesoderm of the tail. These findings suggest that <italic>Psf2</italic> may be important for only a subset of tissues that express this gene. These observations could also be related to differences in the translation of the protein or to redundant effects of other related factors such as PCNA.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of <italic>Psf2</italic> in optic cup development and lens induction</title><p>Lens formation is normally directed by two phases of induction including an early phase that occurs during gastrulation (stages 10.5&#x02013;19) and a late phase that occurs when the developing optic vesicle contacts the presumptive lens ectoderm (stages 19+; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]). Furthermore, the presumptive lens ectoderm also provides reciprocal signals for proper morphogenesis of the optic cup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic roles of particular genes in the development of retinal and lens tissues. Reciprocal transplants using control, uninjected tissues and those affected by <italic>Psf2</italic> morpholino knockdown demonstrate a key role of <italic>Psf2</italic> in retinal development and a secondary, indirect function for <italic>Psf2</italic> in lens induction.</p><p>The results of the reciprocal transplant experiments indicate that the presence of CONMO in the presumptive lens ectoderm (PLE) does not adversely affect lens development beyond that normally attributed to this type of surgery. Only slight reductions in both the frequency of lens formation and the volume of the lens were observed. In fact, the results of these control experiments are comparable to those reported by Henry and Grainger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>] for transplantation experiments involving non-morpholino-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the results of experiments using Psf2MO are quite different and demonstrate an intrinsic role for <italic>Psf2</italic> in the development of the retina. In the transplants involving Psf2MO-injected retinal tissue, the retinas exhibited dysmorphogenesis similar to those observed in the initial injection morpholino experiments using comparable doses. In contrast, the transplants involving normal retinal hosts and <italic>Psf2</italic>-injected donor presumptive lens epithelium generally resulted in the hosts forming well differentiated retinas. A slight decrease in eye size overall can be attributed to the transplantation surgery as discussed above. Considering that the retinas are not malformed or degenerated, knockdown of <italic>Psf2</italic> in the lens does not appear to appreciably disrupt the ability of the lens to produce inductive signals or to direct retinal development.</p><p><italic>Psf2</italic> was also found to have an intrinsic role in the development of the lens, albeit to a lesser extent than within the retina. <italic>Psf2</italic> morpholino-containing presumptive lens ectoderm (stage 14), transplanted to the lens forming a region of equivalent-stage uninjected hosts, formed properly-differentiated lenses at a frequency consistent with both CONMO injected and uninjected control transplants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]). This demonstrates that the presumptive lens ectoderm, even with diminished Psf2 function, is still able to receive and respond to the inductive signals from an unaffected optic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7L,N</xref>). These lenses were, however smaller in size compared to the control, contralateral lenses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7K-M</xref>). The difference in lens size between the Psf2MO lenses (average of 48.0% of normal size) and the controls (e.g., using the control morpholino resulting in lenses average of 79.5% of normal size; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>) indicates that <italic>Psf2</italic> may play an intrinsic role for full development of the lens. These data coincide with our observations that the levels of apoptosis increased slightly in lenses derived from Psf2MO-injected cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9G</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments demonstrate that lenses fail to form normally when the retina is perturbed via <italic>Psf2</italic> knockdown. Unlike the transplants involving Psf2MO donors, transplants of uninjected stage 14 presumptive lens ectoderm to stage 14 hosts that were injected with Psf2MO resulted in a marked reduction in both lens formation frequency and lens quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7E,G</xref>). Henry and Grainger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>] showed that when any further inductive signaling to stage 14 presumptive lens ectoderm is curtailed, the ectoderm is unable to consistently form lens tissue. None of the cases formed lens tissue when the presumptive lens ectoderm was explanted, and only 15% of the cases formed lens tissues when the anterior neural plate tissue that included the retinal rudiments was removed. When <italic>Psf2</italic> function is perturbed in the optic cup, proper retinal development is inhibited. Consequently, the optic vesicle is unable to produce key inductive signals required for normal lens development (i.e., the late phase of lens induction is compromised).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Psf2</italic> expression is not directly correlated with embryonic patterns of cell proliferation</title><p>Recent analyses have examined the expression of a variety of cell cycle regulatory and DNA replication genes (e.g., <italic>cdk2</italic>, <italic>cyclin E</italic>, <italic>cdc45</italic>, <italic>PCNA</italic>, <italic>Sld5</italic>, <italic>Psf1</italic>, <italic>Psf2</italic>, and <italic>Psf3</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. Although many of these genes are expressed together in neural tissues, each one exhibits unique spatial domains within other tissues. For instance, <italic>Psf2</italic> is expressed only in a subset of tissues including the somitic mesoderm, the pharyngeal arches, the otic vesicles, the anterior CNS, and the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. These findings are somewhat unexpected as genes important for DNA replication, cell cycle control, and cell division are generally thought to be expressed ubiquitously within developing organisms.</p><p>Proliferation patterns have been determined in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos using BrdU incorporation to monitor DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>] and anti-phospho-histone H3 S10P antibodies to detect mitotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. These studies reveal high levels of proliferation in the developing central nervous system and lesser degrees of cell division in the epidermal ectoderm. As mentioned above, the expression patterns of various DNA replication factors are spatially restricted and do not necessarily correlate with all sites of proliferation within the developing embryo. This suggests that several of these genes including <italic>Psf2</italic> may have roles beyond that of DNA replication and cell proliferation.</p><p>The activity of GINS (comprised of <italic>Psf1</italic>, <italic>Psf2</italic>, <italic>Psf3,</italic> and <italic>Sld5</italic>) appears to be analogous to that of PCNA, a trimeric sliding clamp, which also binds to a variety of DNA polymerases. Although PCNA is involved in DNA replication, several studies suggest that it may indeed function in different capacities. These roles not only include aspects of cell cycle control and DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] but may also include roles in differentiation and transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. Evidence such as this emphasizes the delicate balance between cell proliferation and fate determination that is required for proper development. Studies in which a cell&#x02019;s ability to exit the cell cycle was perturbed have demonstrated shifts in cell fate from those normally anticipated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>]. Perturbing <italic>Psf2</italic> activity in the retina may likewise alter the cells&#x02019; usual exit from proliferation, forcing them to either remain in an undifferentiated state, proceed along an incorrect determination pathway, or undergo apoptosis, depending on the extrinsic and intrinsic factors available at that stage of development. This may therefore disrupt the inductive potential of the retina and subsequently alter the development of the lens.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by NIH/NEI research grant EY09844 to J.J.H.
