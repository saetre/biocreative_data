However, regulation of SMRT stability remains largely unexplored. We show that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 interacts with SMRT both in vitro and in mammalian cells. This interaction requires the WW domain of Pin1 and SMRT phosphorylation. Pin1 regulates SMRT protein stability, thereby affecting SMRT-dependent transcriptional repression. SMRT phosphorylation at multiple sites is required for Pin1 interaction, and these sites can be phosphorylated by Cdk2, which interacts with SMRT. Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of SMRT is required for Pin1 binding and decreases SMRT stability, whereas mutation of these phosphorylation sites abrogates Pin1 binding and stabilizes SMRT. Finally, decreases in SMRT stability occur in response to the activation of Her2/Neu/ErbB2, and this receptor functions upstream of both Pin1 and Cdk2 in the signaling cascade that regulates SMRT stability and cellular response to tamoxifen.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CHX, cycloheximide; DBD, DNA-binding domain; DN, dominant negative; HDAC, histone deacetylase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; N-CoR, nuclear receptor corepressor; PPIase, peptidyl-prolyl isomerase; PR, progesterone receptor; pS-P, phospho-Ser-Pro; pT-P, phospho-Thr-Pro; RD, repression domain; SMRT, silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor; WCE, whole cell extract; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) and nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) are two closely related transcriptional corepressors that were isolated in a search for factors that mediate transcriptional repression by nuclear hormone receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen and Evans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horlein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sande and Privalsky, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seol et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ordentlich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 1999</xref>).

In addition to nuclear hormone receptors, SMRT and N-CoR also participate in diverse signaling pathways through interactions with a variety of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goodson et al., 2005</xref>) and are required for normal mammalian development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jepsen et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2007</xref>). Corepressors have been shown to be involved in several human diseases, most notably breast cancers and acute promyelocytic leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Privalsky, 2004</xref>). The regulation of N-CoR stability has been implicated in several normal and aberrant cellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perissi et al., 2004</xref>); however, the mechanism of SMRT stability regulation has not been clearly defined.</p><p>SMRT contains at least three different types of functional domains. Near the N terminus are two Swi/Ada/N-CoR/TFIID motifs in addition to two receptor interaction domains near the C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Privalsky, 2004</xref>). SMRT also contains at least four independent repression domains (RDs; I&#x02013;IV). Because diverse proteins are recruited to these RDs, we sought to identify novel regulators of SMRT by using RDs III and IV as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. We identified the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, Pin1, as a SMRT-interacting protein.</p><p>Pin1 is comprised of an N-terminal protein-binding WW domain and a C-terminal peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yeh and Means, 2007</xref>). The WW domain of Pin1 binds preferentially to phospho-Ser-Pro&#x02013; (pS-P) or phospho-Thr-Pro (pT-P)&#x02013;containing peptide sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ranganathan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yaffe et al., 1997</xref>), and the enzyme domain also preferentially isomerizes the prolyl bond after pT-P or pS-P. Pin1 is frequently localized to nuclei and serves as a regulatory protein for a variety of proteins associated with transcription, including cyclin E1, c-Myc, p53, SRC-3, and the retinoic acid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zacchi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zheng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeh et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brondani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Drogen et al., 2006</xref>). In the case of all of these transcription factors, the binding of Pin1 to a phosphorylated motif regulates the stability of its target protein. In this study, we characterize the interaction between SMRT and Pin1. We find that Pin1 binds to phosphorylated SMRT, identify the relevant protein kinase as Cdk2, and show that Cdk2 and Pin1 facilitate the degradation of SMRT. We also demonstrate that Cdk2 and Pin1 are required for ErbB2-mediated degradation of SMRT protein. Together, our data reveal a novel mechanism by which SMRT is regulated in cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SMRT interacts with Pin1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner</title><p>In a search for proteins that may regulate SMRT activity, yeast two-hybrid screens were performed using pGal4-SMRT (including RDs III and IV) as bait against a library derived from 17-d-old mouse embryos. Among the interacting clones, mouse Pin1 was isolated six times, with the longest insert encoding full-length Pin1. To test whether exogenous SMRT and Pin1 interact in mammalian cells, we used extracts of transfected mammalian cells for coimmunoprecipitations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Using &#x003b1;-HA antibodies, we were able to coimmunoprecipitate FLAG-Pin1 with HA-SMRT (1,178&#x02013;1,823; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, lane 2), indicating that these proteins interact. This interaction was confirmed by showing that endogenous SMRT was able to bind GST&#x02013;Pin1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, lane 3) but not GST alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, lane 2). Because both Pin1 and 14-3-3 proteins interact with substrates in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yaffe and Elia, 2001</xref>), we tested whether 14-3-3 proteins were also able to interact with SMRT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).

Finally, Pin1 was also able to coimmunoprecipitate endogenous SMRT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, lane 3), whereas protein A beads alone were unable to do so (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, lane 2).

Pin1 associates with its interacting partners through the WW domain, a protein&#x02013;protein interaction module that has been shown to bind specifically to pS-P or pT-P dipeptide motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sudol et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yaffe and Elia, 2001</xref>). Mutations of Pin1 such as S16A/Y23A and R17A are unable to bind pS/pT-P motifs and thus abrogate this binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 1999</xref>). We generated these mutants of Pin1 as well as a C113A/A118T mutant that has decreased PPIase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shen et al., 1998</xref>) by site-directed mutagenesis, and yeast two-hybrid assays were used to determine whether the WW domain or isomerase activity is critical for SMRT interaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). SMRT (1,178&#x02013;1,823) fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) was cotransformed with wild-type (WT) Pin1 or one of these mutated forms of Pin1, fused to the Gal4 activation domain into yeast cells, and tested for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. C113A/A118T retained SMRT binding activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>, lane 3), suggesting that enzyme activity was not required for binding, whereas both WW domain mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>, lanes 4 and 5) failed to bind SMRT as indicated by loss of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activation. GST pull-down assays confirmed the yeast two-hybrid data by demonstrating that both WT Pin1 and the C113A/A118T enzymatic mutant bound HA-SMRT (1,178&#x02013;1,823; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>, lanes 2 and 3), but the S16A/Y23A and R17A WW mutants were unable to bind HA-SMRT (1,178&#x02013;1,823; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). Together, these data indicate that the integrity of the WW domain but not PPIase activity is essential for the Pin1&#x02013;SMRT interaction both in vitro and in yeast two-hybrid assays.</p><p>The importance of the WW domain of Pin1 for SMRT interaction suggested that phosphorylation of SMRT might be involved in this interaction. As an initial test of this hypothesis, extracts of HeLa cells expressing HA-SMRT (1,178&#x02013;1,823) were incubated with increasing concentrations of calf intestinal phosphatase before incubation with GST&#x02013;Pin1. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref> shows that phosphatase treatment of extracts dramatically reduced the association of SMRT with Pin1 in vitro (lanes 5 and 6). These data indicate that phosphorylation of SMRT is very likely to play a critical role in Pin1 binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Pin1 affects SMRT stability</title><p>To examine the functional significance of the SMRT and Pin1 association, we tested whether ectopic expression of Pin1 affected the transcriptional repressor activity of SMRT. Transient transfections showed that Gal4-SMRT (1,050&#x02013;1,823) potently repressed basal transcription of a Gal4 reporter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, lane 1), but coexpression of Pin1 reduced SMRT repression activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4). Because Pin1 compromised SMRT repressor activity, we hypothesized that Pin1 might modulate SMRT-mediated repression by affecting its steady-state levels, as has been shown for other nuclear targets of Pin1. To test this possibility, SMRT (1,012&#x02013;2,507) and Pin1 were coexpressed in CV-1 cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, expression of Pin1 had a negative, dose-dependent effect on SMRT protein levels. We also evaluated the effect of Pin1 on the expression of endogenous SMRT by immunofluorescence microscopy. SMRT levels were significantly decreased in cells transfected with FLAG-Pin1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, compare c with f), whereas the levels of the closely related corepressor N-CoR did not change (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C, i and l</xref>). We confirmed these observations using siRNA targeting Pin1. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref> shows that when endogenous Pin1 levels were decreased by siRNA, endogenous SMRT protein levels increased (lanes 2 and 3), whereas HDAC3 levels showed negligible differences.

Because ectopic expression of Pin1 affected SMRT protein levels, we next examined the effect of the Pin1 mutants on SMRT protein levels. To test this, FLAG-SMRT (1,178&#x02013;1,823) was cotransfected into cells with or without WT or mutant forms of HA-Pin1.

Additionally, it is likely that a Pin1-dependent decrease in SMRT protein levels is responsible for the loss of repression activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and E</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the effect of ectopic Pin1 on SMRT, we used Pin1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeh et al., 2006</xref>).

Interestingly, knockdown of Pin1 led to increases in c-Myc and PR transcription, whereas Cdk2 knockdown increased PR transcript levels. These data indicate that SMRT is critical for ER&#x003b1;-dependent gene repression in response to tamoxifen. Because tamoxifen suppresses cell proliferation of BT-474 cells, we also examined whether knockdown of SMRT, Pin1, or Cdk2 affected proliferation rates. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref> shows that knockdown of SMRT increased cell proliferation when compared with siControl, whereas Cdk2 showed a slight decrease in cell proliferation compared with the control.

Pin1 requires an intact WW domain and phosphorylation of SMRT for this interaction. Cdk2 phosphorylates SMRT at consensus Cdk motifs to generate Pin1-binding sites and consequently targets SMRT for degradation, the latter also requiring the PPIase activity of Pin1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref>). Consistent with these observations, activation of Her2/Neu/ErbB2 promotes SMRT degradation, whereas inhibition of Her2/Neu/ErbB2 stabilizes SMRT. These data suggest a concerted regulation of a transcriptional corepressor initiated by extracellular stimuli functioning to activate a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor.</p><p>In tamoxifen-responsive breast cancer cells, tamoxifen-bound ER&#x003b1; recruits corepressor complexes to inhibit ER&#x003b1;-target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fleming et al., 2004</xref>). Decreased levels of corepressors correlate with acquired tamoxifen resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lavinsky et al., 1998</xref>), whereas high expression of coactivators favors an agonist effect for tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shang and Brown, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shou et al., 2004</xref>). Overexpression of SMRT or N-CoR promotes the antagonist activity of tamoxifen in transient transfection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jackson et al., 1997</xref>). The antiproliferative activity of tamoxifen therefore depends on the relative abundance of corepressors and coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2000a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fujita et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, both SMRT and N-CoR are required for the antiproliferative effects of tamoxifen in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keeton and Brown, 2005</xref>). Additionally, certain coactivators such as AIB1/SRC-3 have been shown to be up-regulated in ErbB2-positive breast tumors, which would further disrupt the corepressor/coactivator ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Osborne et al., 2003</xref>), and it is interesting that SRC-3 turnover is also regulated by Pin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yi et al., 2005</xref>) and reversible phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). Here we show that SMRT protein levels can be modulated by the oncogene Her2/Neu/ErbB2 to alter the ratio of corepressors to coactivators, thereby elucidating part of the potential mechanism underlying tamoxifen resistance and aberrant transcriptional regulation in breast cancers.</p><p>Our studies clearly demonstrate that SMRT has distinct functions from N-CoR, as knockdown of SMRT is sufficient to desensitize cells to tamoxifen-mediated inhibition of PR and c-Myc expression and cell growth. Furthermore, overexpression of Pin1 in MCF-7 cells decreases SMRT protein levels but not N-CoR. Indeed, recent studies show that these two corepressors can be targets of different cellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jepsen et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jonas and Privalsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2006</xref>), including growth factor signaling, DNA damage response, and normal mammalian development, and likely regulate some nonoverlapping genes. As mentioned previously, knockdown of both SMRT and N-CoR is required to overcome the antiproliferative effects of tamoxifen in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keeton and Brown, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, N-CoR protein levels are decreased in tamoxifen-resistant tumors from a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lavinsky et al., 1998</xref>). This indicates that a global decrease in corepressor expression is required for breast cancer progression and that there is an analogous pathway leading to the accelerated degradation of N-CoR in ErbB2-positive/tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers. It is probable that ErbB2-positive/tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers exploit a normal cellular pathway leading to the degradation of SMRT.</p><p>Pin1 has been shown to collaborate with several kinases to modulate protein stability, including MAPK, GSK3&#x003b2;, Cdk1, and Cdk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ryo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeh et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pastorino et al., 2006</xref>). Our observation that Cdk2 phosphorylates SMRT to regulate its abundance supports the idea that Pin1 exerts diverse functions in different signaling pathways. We hypothesize that compartmental and temporal regulation of the association between Pin1 and its targets fine tunes Pin1 activity. For example, several Pin1-mediated degradation pathways are likely to be cell cycle dependent, as multiple cell cycle regulatory proteins are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yeh and Means, 2007</xref>). It will be highly informative to explore whether SMRT protein levels are regulated in a cell cycle&#x02013;dependent manner, as has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 1999</xref>). Like SMRT, N-CoR also contains seven consensus Cdk phosphorylation sites. However, of the three sites identified here, only serine 1469 (S1469) is not conserved between SMRT and N-CoR. Intriguingly, S1469 is the phosphorylation site that does not change in response to Cdk2 overexpression. Therefore, it is likely that there are other kinases that may play a role in this complex regulatory pathway.</p><p>Pin1 is thought to be an important regulator of tumorigenesis and is overexpressed or underexpressed in different tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mantovani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yeh and Means, 2007</xref>); thus, it can potentially act as either an oncogene or a tumor-suppressor gene, depending on cellular context. ErbB2 activation stimulates Pin1 transcription, and in turn Pin1 stimulates the transformative properties of ErbB2-positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryo et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, although activation of ErbB2 decreases SMRT protein levels in BT-474 cells, Pin1 knockdown does not affect SMRT levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). However, knockdown of Pin1 sensitizes cells to tamoxifen-mediated repression of c-Myc and PR expression without affecting BT-474 cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, E and F</xref>). These data suggest that Pin1 may affect tamoxifen sensitivity through other pathways independent of controlling SMRT protein levels.</p><p>Pin1 is capable of promoting both stabilization and degradation of several target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yeh and Means, 2007</xref>); however, in many cases, the mechanisms underlying these opposing activities remain largely unexplored. In the case of c-Myc, Pin1 promotes a conformational change that allows rapid dephosphorylation of a specific threonine residue that is required for the binding of a ubiquitin E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeh et al., 2004</xref>). In other cases, the conformational switch to certain prolyl isomers (cis or trans) also makes the target protein better substrates for particular E3 ubiquitin ligases (and therefore better substrates for degradation) or protein phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Drogen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yeh and Means, 2007</xref>). Proteins such as c-Myc, cyclin E, and SRC-3 use a common Pin1-interacting motif to facilitate turnover by the E3 ligase Fbw7. As this motif does not exist in SMRT, it is likely that a different E3 ligase may be involved. Thus, identification of components of the degradation machinery responsible for Pin1- and Cdk2-dependent SMRT degradation warrants further investigation and may reveal potential new therapeutic targets for treatment of certain breast cancers.</p><p>Phosphorylation of SMRT by Cdk2 may participate in some integral aspect of cell cycle regulation. Certain genes required for cell cycle progression may require removal or degradation of SMRT from their promoters in order for cells to proliferate. Another interesting hypothesis is that SMRT may play roles other than that of a corepressor as recent studies have indicated, including involvement in DNA damage repair pathways and cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, it will be important to explore other potential regulators of SMRT stability and activity that may play a role in human development and disease generation or progression. Our observation that cyclin E coimmunoprecipitated SMRT but not Cdk2 is intriguing. This could be caused by the inaccessibility of the epitope by cyclin E antibodies. Alternatively, but not exclusively, these data suggest that the association of cyclin E with SMRT is independent of Cdk2. It will be interesting to further investigate the functional significance of the association between SMRT and cyclin E.</p><p>The ability of Pin1 to control SMRT protein levels appears to be cell type dependent, as Pin1 knockdown significantly increases SMRT protein steady-state levels in HeLa but not in BT-474 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of Cdk2 increases SMRT protein levels in both HeLa and BT-474 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). These observations suggest that Cdk2 may use Pin1-dependent or -independent pathways to promote SMRT degradation. ErbB2 activation stimulates Cdk2 activity, and knockdown of Cdk2 significantly increases steady-state levels of SMRT proteins and blocks ErbB2-mediated SMRT degradation, indicating that Cdk2 is an integral component in the ErbB2-dependent SMRT degradation pathway. Notably, knockdown of Cdk2 abolishes ErbB2-activated gene expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>) and cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref>). Our data favor an oncogenic role for Cdk2 in SMRT destabilization and suggest that decreases in SMRT protein levels correlate with relief in gene repression and increases in proliferation, both indicators of tamoxifen resistance, whereas increases in SMRT levels correlate with tamoxifen sensitivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast methods</title><p>Yeast two-hybrid screens and assays were performed using standard methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kao et al., 2000</xref>).
