The recirculation of monocytes in mice with ocular inflammation but not controls was found to depend on the selectin CD62-ligand (CD62L) and on CD44. Not only was rolling efficiency ablated or markedly reduced in antibody-treated mice, but most of the labeled monocytes also disappeared from the circulation within seconds, anti-CD44&#x02013;treated monocytes homing to the lymph nodes and anti&#x02013;CD62L-treated monocytes homing to the spleen. Our data indicate that, although PSGL-1 has a partial role in the transmigration of monocytes into the inflamed retina, CD62L has a key role in regulating recruitment of monocytes to lymphoid tissue from the blood during inflammation and that CD44 is required to maintain CD62L<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes within the circulation during inflammation. This effect was systemic, because sequestered monocytes accumulated in mesenteric as well as draining cervical lymph nodes, and inflammation dependent, because depletion of circulating blood monocytes was much reduced or absent in normal mice and accumulations of adoptively transferred monocytes in the lymphoid tissues did not occur.</p></abstract><contract-sponsor id="CS200" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nondifferentiated monocytes are known to circulate in the blood and tissues for up to 3 days, and during that time they are recruited to the tissues where they differentiate into macrophages or myeloid dendritic cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> Subsets of blood monocytes with differential migratory potential have been identified, and the capacity of monocytes to preferentially migrate to sites of inflammation has been linked to expression of the selectin CD62-ligand (CD62L), CC-chemokine receptor-2 (CCR-2) and CD14, whereas subsets that are CCR-2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD16<sup>+</sup> are recruited to tissues independently of inflammatory stimuli to become resident monocyte macrophages or myeloid dendritic cells (DCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> More recently, we have shown that differentiation and recruitment of the inflammatory subset is independent of local inflammatory stimuli, requiring monocyte conditioning or differentiation over time within the circulation. Bone marrow&#x02013;derived monocytes (BM-Mo's), transferred intravenously to mice with established ocular inflammation, required 24 to 48 hours of in vivo conditioning before being able to roll on endothelium efficiently and migrate into the inflamed retina. This capacity to roll and migrate was largely lost after 72 hours in the circulation. In the retina, adoptively transferred, in vivo conditioned monocytes differentiated into CD11c<sup>+</sup>, B220<sup>+</sup> DCs and F4/80<sup>ve</sup> macrophages, indicating that a permissive endothelium alone is not sufficient for active recruitment of monocytes from the blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup></p><p>Understanding the processes involved in mononuclear myeloid cell trafficking has considerable importance both for targeting antigen-pulsed DCs used as vaccines and for the control of inflammatory diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> Recruitment of mononuclear myeloid cells from the blood to the tissue and from the tissue to lymph nodes is controlled by adhesive interactions between the cell and the vascular or lymphatic endothelium. The mechanisms involved in recruitment of leukocyte subsets from the blood to the tissues and lymphoid organs have been extensively studied, primarily in in vitro model systems under defined molecular conditions. Multiple molecules, constitutively expressed or induced under inflammatory conditions, have been identified as playing a role in monocyte adhesion and diapedesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> The multistep paradigm that has emerged invokes weak interactions by selectins that allow leukocyte rolling on vascular endothelium that initiates an adhesion cascade. This is triggered by chemokines and results in firm adhesion and spreading of the monocyte on the endothelium through regulation of avidity of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-integrins and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-integrins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> Fast rolling is mediated by CD62L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> and is regulated by vessel wall shear stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup> Rolling through E- or P-selectin is slower, but it is also shear stress&#x02013;dependent when rolling on P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> This dependence on shear stress is believed to limit leukocyte interactions in the center of vessels or in vessels with very high or very low wall shear stress, and the steady rolling generated enables the leukocyte to receive crucial activating stimuli from the endothelium. Some overlapping and redundancy appears to exist in the system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup> and mechanisms controlling monocyte trafficking to a Th1-type inflammatory lesion under physiologic conditions of flow in vivo are not known.</p><p>Using experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) as a model inflammation, we have been able to demonstrate mechanisms controlling specific T-lymphocyte subset rolling, sticking, and transendothelial cell migration within normal and diseased neurovascular postcapillary endothelial venules where shear stress levels are relatively high (I.C., H.X., A.M., et al, manuscript submitted 2002).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></sup> A reduction in shear stress in retinal veins from approximately 30 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> to 20 dyn/cm occurs up to 24 hours before leukocyte infiltration, and rolling and sticking efficiencies are negatively correlated with wall shear stress, providing a good model for studying leukocyte subset trafficking in vivo during inflammation. In this study we focus on the kinetics of monocyte trafficking in vivo and in particular on the role of CD44 that is implicated in primary adhesive interactions between leukocytes and endothelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></sup> and has a major role in leukocyte homing in EAU,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></sup> as well as CD62L and PSGL-1 that have been shown to account for at least 90% of leukocyte rolling in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref></sup> In addition to mediating monocyte infiltration of the inflammatory site, we show for the first time that CD62L has a key role in regulating recruitment of monocytes to lymphoid tissue from the blood during inflammation and that CD44 is also required to maintain CD62L<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes within the circulation during inflammation. Unexpectedly, this effect was systemic because distant as well as draining lymph nodes were involved and inflammation specific, because no sequestration of the adoptively transferred, in vivo conditioned monocytes to lymphoid tissues was observed in normal mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and retinal inflammation model</title><p>Eight- to 12-week-old wild-type C57BL/6 mice and homozygous C57BL/6 mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of a chicken &#x003b2;-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus enhancer were maintained in the Medical Research Facility at Aberdeen University.

The retinal vasculature is imaged through the intact cornea, and adoptively transferred leukocytes may be tracked as they enter through the retinal artery, traverse the capillary network, and exit through the retinal vein. Mice are unharmed by the procedure and can be rescanned over several days if necessary. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of 0.4 mL/kg Hypnorm (Janssen-Cilag, Antwerp, Belgium) and 1 mL/kg diazepam (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Gloucester, United Kingdom) intraperitoneally. EGFP<sup>+</sup> BM-Mo cells (8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) in 150 &#x003bc;L phosphate-buffered saline were injected into the tail vein. After 48 hours to allow in vivo conditioning to an inflammatory phenotype, SLO images were recorded simultaneously on Videotape (S-VHS) and digitally at 25 frames per second.

Rolling leukocytes and those not interacting with the endothelium were counted in each venule. Rolling cells were defined as those cells with a velocity below the critical velocity. The rolling efficiency was calculated as the percentage of rolling fluorescent cells among the total number of fluorescent cells entering a venule.

Other mechanisms proposed include regulation of function through activation and sulfation of the adhesion molecule or changes in cell-surface expression through down-regulation or shedding. Previous studies have indicated that T-cell trafficking is controlled by surface expression of CD62L and CD44. High surface expression of CD62L, characteristic of naive T cells, is lost during inflammation as CD44 is up-regulated. Equally, CD62L is less important in inflammatory T-cell recruitment than in lymph node homing. We therefore analyzed the expression of CD62L, CD44, PSGL-1, and LFA-1 on circulating EGFP monocytes recovered from the circulation of EAU mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C) and normal control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D) after 3 days of mAb treatment. CD44 expression (Geo-MFI) was very much lower on monocytes from all groups of EAU mice than with normal mouse groups, suggesting that monocyte transmembrane CD44 was lost during inflammation. Treatment with the mAbs had relatively minor effects on the surface expression of the adhesion molecules examined. Statistical analysis showed some significant differences. Treatment with CD62L mAb reduced CD44 expression and treatment with PSGL-1 mAb increased LFA-1 expression on monocytes from EAU but not control mice. However, whether these changes were sufficient to exert physiologic effects is in doubt because Geo-MFI changes did not mirror in vivo functional changes observed in earlier experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Differential trafficking is known to be required for the localization of effector leukocyte subsets, either to sites of inflammation or to lymphoid tissues, and tissue-specific chemokine expression and receptor signaling was identified as providing specificity to endothelial traffic signals, raising the concept of molecular codes specific for particular disease processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> Previously, we have shown that a permissive endothelium alone is not sufficient to recruit monocytes from the circulation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> but data we present here support the concept of differential monocyte trafficking in vivo in steady state and inflammation, with specific roles identified for CD62L and CD44 in maintaining monocytes within the circulation during inflammation. Blockade of CD62L caused retention of monocytes within the spleen, whereas blockade of CD44 caused retention of monocytes within the lymph nodes. Surprisingly, this effect was inflammation specific because blockade of CD62L and CD44 had no apparent effect on the ability of monocytes to recirculate in normal mice. These observations are also consistent with a role for CD62L and CD44 in directing circulating monocytes to other nonlymphoid tissues such as bone marrow in the absence of inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref></sup> Identifying signals controlling monocyte differentiation and function in inflammation versus steady state will be important for identifying disease-associated therapeutic targets that do not affect normal protective immunity.</p><p>For monocytes, 2 major subsets have been identified with differing chemokine and adhesion molecule expression that govern trafficking potential to inflammatory sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> Recently, we showed that acquisition of the inflammatory monocyte phenotype is a time-limited property of monocytes independent of external inflammatory signals. Bone marrow&#x02013;derived monocytes adoptively transferred into normal mice recirculated freely for at least 72 hours, and viable monocytes could be found in both lymph nodes and spleen throughout the sampling period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> When injected into mice with EAU, adoptively transferred monocytes did not migrate into the inflamed retinal tissue until 24 to 48 hours after transfer, despite repeated trafficking through inflamed retinal vessels. This time frame coincided with the acquisition of maximum rolling efficiency and maximal expression of CCR-2 and LFA-1 by monocytes. These data indicate that an inflamed endothelium and associated chemokine and cytokine microenvironment are not sufficient to recruit circulating monocytes, and new monocytes leaving the bone marrow require in vivo conditioning over a defined time period before switching to a phenotype that enables homing to inflammatory sites. In the experiments described here, we have included a 48-hour in vivo conditioning period to allow inflammatory monocyte maturation or differentiation before taking SLO measurements or administering mAb treatments to examine mechanisms controlling monocyte recirculation and homing to an inflammatory site in vivo.</p><p>The main physiologic function of selectins is to allow high-affinity rolling interactions between leukocytes and the endothelium under flow, mediating signal transduction and firm adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref></sup> For these experiments we examined the role of CD62L because it is expressed by most monocytes and has been implicated in mediating inflammatory monocyte migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> PSGL-1 was also chosen as the interaction between P- and E-selectin and PSGL-1 induces changes in integrin function and increased adhesion of monocytes to endothelium in vitro,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref></sup> but to date there is no record of its role in mediating monocyte function in delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) inflammation in vivo. CD44 was also included in this study because both CD44 and its ligand hyaluronan are up-regulated in the EAU eye,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> and, although implicated in lymphocyte function in both in the uveitic eye and other DTH models, no specific role for CD44 in monocyte trafficking has been identified. Antibodies to CD11a were included to confirm that LFA-1 has no role in monocyte adhesion and diapedesis in vivo in our model, and it provided a useful additional negative control for our assays. VLA-4 has been implicated in monocyte trafficking in other models, but inclusion of this integrin was considered beyond the scope of this study because VLA-4 was shown not be involved in monocyte attachment under flow,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref></sup> and is not specifically up-regulated in retinal venules in EAU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup></p><p>Our experiments show that, although PSGL-1 has a partial role in regulating monocyte migration into the inflamed retina, CD62L and CD44 were absolutely required for effective monocyte trafficking to the retina in EAU. The accumulation of monocytes in the spleens of CD62L mAb&#x02013;treated EAU but not control mice is unexplained. Immunostaining of lymph nodes and spleens from normal and EAU mice showed no obvious differences in the expression of CD44 or CD62L (data not shown). This is perhaps not surprising because in this organ-specific inflammatory model, the focus of inflammation is limited to the retina of the eye. The restriction of EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells to the subcapsular region of the lymph nodes in MEL-14&#x02013;treated mice is consistent with a defect in the ability of these cells to traverse high endothelial venule (HEVs), particularly during inflammation. In contrast, the spleen has no HEVs so in MEL-14&#x02013;treated animals monocytes were able traffic freely through this tissue.</p><p>MEL-14 mAb at high concentrations (100 &#x003bc;/mouse) were reported to affect cell trafficking, particularly of lymphocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref></sup> but a dose of 30 &#x003bc;g/mouse per day appeared to have no significant effect on monocyte trafficking in our control mice. Sialomucin (CD43) as well as CD62L is involved in monocyte migration into lymph nodes from the blood by HEVs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup> and our data would indicate that CD62L is not necessary or largely redundant in monocyte trafficking in the normal mouse, consistent with data from L-selectin&#x02013;deficient mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref></sup> The inflammation-specific nature of sequestering would imply that monocyte-expressed CD62L or its endothelial cell&#x02013;expressed ligands have undergone modification in response to the EAU inflammatory response in the host, allowing the adhesive interactions necessary for monocyte adhesion and migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref></sup> Our previous observation that rolling is an acquired characteristic of adoptively transferred CD62L<sup>+</sup> monocytes in mice with EAU and that inflamed endothelium alone does not permit monocyte rolling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> would suggest that it is monocyte-expressed ligand changes as well as endothelial cell&#x02013;expressed ligand changes that are critical for rolling. Flow cytometric analysis of CD62L expression on monocytes retrieved from the circulation of normal and untreated EAU mice showed no significant differences in CD62L expression (percentage and geo-MFI; data not shown), indicating that factors other than receptor density may determine L-selectin&#x02013;dependent monocyte rolling.</p><p>CD44-deficient mice also show no obvious immunologic defects until challenged with infection or inflammation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref></sup> and posttranslational modification of CD44 can alter function at different stages of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></sup> Our data are therefore consistent with previous studies that have suggested that CD44 is not important for normal T-cell trafficking to lymph nodes and that physiologic changes associated with inflammation alter hierarchy of adhesion molecule function to allow selective recruitment of T cells to lymphoid or inflammatory site, and is the first indication that CD44 also has a specific role in monocyte trafficking during inflammation. Although distribution of monocytes in the MEL-14&#x02013;treated mice can be rationalized as an effect on MEL-14&#x02013;dependent trafficking at the HEVs, the reduced numbers of EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the spleens are more difficult to understand. CD44 clearly has a role in trafficking, particularly during inflammation, and monocytes were able to enter the spleen rapidly after adoptive transfer in IM7-treated mice. The localization of large numbers of these cells both with the red pulp and around the marginal zone at 30 minutes after transfer and later loss in inflammation could have 2 explanations: (1) the cells were targeted for clearance; (2) the cells became sequestered in another compartment (such as the bone marrow). We believe the second explanation is more likely because IM7 is widely used as a blocking antibody in functional studies, cells were not found in the lungs or liver in any number, and the simple clearance of antibody opsonized cells would be independent of inflammation.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that the mechanisms controlling monocyte recirculation through peripheral and lymphoid tissues by the blood alters during inflammation, and we also show that the effect is systemic. Differential trafficking is known to be required for the selective recruitment of naive or effector T cells either to sites of inflammation or to lymphoid tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref></sup> Our data suggest that differential trafficking of monocytes also occurs during inflammation and that regulation of ligand density or posttranslational modification of CD44 and CD62L may be involved. Thus, posttranslational modification of CD44 is required to maintain monocytes within the circulation during inflammation and mediate homing to the inflammatory site, and CD62L may be less important during inflammation but necessary for recruitment to the lymph node. PSGL-1 was also shown to be involved in monocyte rolling and recruitment to an inflammatory site. The SLO data also support our earlier hypothesis that monocytes must undergo maturation and differentiation in the circulation before they acquire the ability to roll on inflamed endothelium and that changes in monocyte receptor function are crucial events that enable inflammatory monocytes to traffic to the site of inflammation. To date there is little information on monocyte trafficking in vivo during inflammation. This study highlights the dynamic relation between CD44 and CD62L in controlling monocyte trafficking in vivo. Understanding the mechanisms controlling differential trafficking of immature and inflammatory monocytes as well as naive and effector T cells will be required for effective control of chronic inflammation in the future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>An Inside <italic>Blood</italic> analysis of this article appears at the front of this issue.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.
