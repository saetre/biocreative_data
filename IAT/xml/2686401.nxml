We developed fluorescence microscopy and computational strategies to directly measure mitochondrial fission and fusion frequencies and their effects on mitochondrial morphology in cultured neurons. We found that the rate of fission exceeds the rate of fusion in healthy neuronal processes, and, therefore, the fission/fusion ratio alone is insufficient to explain mitochondrial morphology at steady state. This imbalance between fission and fusion is compensated by growth of mitochondrial organelles. Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> increases the rates of both fusion and fission, but more important for explaining the longer organelle morphology induced by Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is its ability to increase mitochondrial biomass. Deficits in these Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>&#x02013;dependent mechanisms may be critical in neuronal dysfunction during the earliest phases of neurodegeneration, long before commitment to cell death.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases and other human maladies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wallace, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dimauro and Schon, 2008</xref>). Mitochondria are actively transported through axons and dendrites, and can localize at synapses, where they may contribute critical functions required for proper neuronal activity such as ATP production, calcium handling, and the biosynthesis of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate, the neurotransmitter glutamate, and other metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nicholls and Ferguson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verstreken et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boldogh and Pon, 2007</xref>). Mitochondria can also contribute to programmed cell death, and Bcl-2 family members are well-known regulators of the mitochondrial step during apoptotic death, a late-stage event that can occur long after deterioration of critical neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bredesen, 2008</xref>). Attention has been focused primarily on the mechanisms by which anti- and pro-death Bcl-2 family proteins interact with each other to regulate outer mitochondrial membrane permeability during apoptosis, superseding the study of Bcl-2 proteins in healthy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Cory, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basanez and Hardwick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chipuk and Green, 2008</xref>). However, there is growing evidence that Bcl-2 proteins influence mitochondrial morphology and localization in healthy cells, and can modulate synaptic activity in healthy neurons, potentially influencing the initial steps in neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fannjiang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jonas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karbowski et al., 2006</xref>). The mechanisms by which Bcl-2 family proteins alter neuronal function could be linked to their effects on mitochondrial fission and fusion, dynamic processes that are increasingly linked to neuronal function and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Detmer and Chan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knott et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A balance between fission and fusion is generally thought to determine mitochondrial morphology in both healthy and dying cells, which is consistent with elegant genetic studies in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shaw and Nunnari, 2002</xref>). The proteins that carry out mitochondrial fission and fusion are best characterized in yeast, but the mammalian homologues identified thus far appear to operate by similar mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okamoto and Shaw, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoppins et al., 2007</xref>). The fission factor Drp1/DLP1/Dnm1 is a large GTPase that is recruited to mitochondria via membrane-anchored proteins that may include Fis1 and Mff to form complexes that decorate the mitochondrial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schauss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008</xref>). Regulated in part by posttranslational modifications, it appears that fission occurs when GTP-bound Drp1 oligomerizes, constricts organelles, and dissociates upon GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoppins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knott et al., 2008</xref>). Distinct dynamin-like GTPases, including Mfn2 (mitofusin 2) on the outer membrane and Opa1 (optic atrophy-1) on the inner membrane, mediate fusion of two mitochondria into a single organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cerveny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Detmer and Chan, 2007</xref>). Genetic mutations in these mitochondrial fusion factors cause human neuropathies and have been linked recently to brain lesions and stroke, and a mutation in Drp1 was described in an infant with fatal abnormal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zuchner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Waterham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chung et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The antiapoptotic mammalian Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, and its <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> counterpart CED-9, localize to mitochondria and are required for normal development of the nervous system and other compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Motoyama et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shaham and Horvitz, 1996</xref>). Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and CED-9 were previously implicated in facilitating mitochondrial fusion through an interaction with Mfn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delivani et al., 2006</xref>). However, a role for Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and CED-9 in mitochondrial fission is also supported by the interaction of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> with Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2008</xref>) and by genetic studies in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jagasia et al., 2005</xref>). Although Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is abundantly expressed in healthy adult neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krajewski et al., 1994</xref>), the effects of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> on mitochondrial dynamics in neurons are largely unexplored.</p><p>In addition to its role in healthy neurons, Drp1 also makes an important contribution to the mitochondrial fission/fragmentation that is characteristic of apoptotic mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breckenridge et al., 2003</xref>). Drp1 and its homologues in flies, worms, and yeast can also enhance cell death, which implies a conserved pro-death function of Drp1/Dnm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fannjiang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jagasia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goyal et al., 2007</xref>). This function of Drp1 may involve Bcl-2 family proteins such as proapoptotic Bax and Bak, which also promote fragmented mitochondrial morphologies during apoptosis and colocalize with both Drp1 and Mfn2 on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karbowski et al., 2002</xref>). In sharp contrast to dying cells, Bax and Bak promote mitochondrial fusion in healthy cells and protect against neuronal cell death under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fannjiang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karbowski et al., 2006</xref>). In yet another twist, CED-9, the essential anti-death Bcl-2 protein in worms, can also promote Drp1-dependent cell death in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jagasia et al., 2005</xref>), and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> can be detrimental to synaptic transmission based on the ability of ABT-737, a small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, to inhibit hypoxia-induced synaptic rundown in the squid stellate ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hickman et al., 2008</xref>). These seemingly conflicting results could imply that fission/fusion factors and Bcl-2 family proteins coregulate a delicately balanced process.</p><p>Drp1-mediated fission may facilitate cell survival by producing new mitochondria and removing damaged sections of mitochondria that are promptly degraded, whereas excessive fission mediated by Drp1 after a death stimulus may promote mitochondrial dysfunction, damage, or accelerated degradation. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the fission function of Drp1 is biochemically distinct from its cell death function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassidy-Stone et al., 2008</xref>). Less clear are the detailed mechanisms involved in Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>&#x02013;induced, Drp1-dependent mitochondrial localization to presynaptic boutons that facilitate synaptic activity in dendrites and axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To date, rates of mitochondrial fission and fusion have been inferred indirectly from diffusion rates of fluorescence within the mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karbowski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Twig et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">2008</xref>). However, these methods could not be applied to mitochondria in long neuronal processes because changes in mitochondrial fluorescence intensity are primarily a function of organelle transport out of the field of interest rather than organelle shape changes. Therefore, we developed methods to directly monitor and quantify fission and fusion events in live neurons expressing mitochondria-targeted photoactivatable GFP (mtPA-GFP). We found that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> increases the rates of both fission and fusion, but its ability to increase mitochondrial length/mass is key to explaining mitochondrial morphology. Thus, fission and fusion are integrated with the control of mitochondrial mass (biogenesis and degradation) to determine mitochondrial morphology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> increases mitochondrial length in cortical neurons</title><p>Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is a critical survival factor, as <italic>bcl-x</italic> knockout mice die by embryonic day &#x0223c;12.5 (E12.5), with excess neuronal and hematopoietic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Motoyama et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, to examine the role of endogenous Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> on mitochondrial morphology in neurons, we generated conditional knockouts (cKOs) in which exons 1 and 2, which encode the N-terminal 81% of the Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> protein, were conditionally deleted in early postmitotic neurons of the hippocampus and the brain cortex (except for interneurons) beginning at &#x0223c;E12.5.

Cortical neuron cultures were prepared from mouse embryos generated from heterozygous crosses, as <italic>bcl-x</italic> cKO mice are infertile. Cells from individual embryos were plated separately at two different densities to compensate for explantation-induced neuronal loss of cKO neurons (see Materials and methods).

For example, Bax and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> were found to increase fusion of mitochondria in healthy cells using FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delivani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karbowski et al., 2006</xref>). FRAP assesses mitochondrial connectivity based on the speed with which fluorescent molecules within mitochondria refill a &#x0201c;bleached&#x0201d; area from neighboring fluorescent (unbleached) areas over several minutes to hours. More rapid recovery provides evidence of connectivity within a single mitochondrial structure. An alternative strategy for assessing mitochondrial fusion is to measure over 1&#x02013;2 h the diffusion of mitochondrial photoactivated GFP away from a small subcellular region containing one or multiple fluorescent mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karbowski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Twig et al., 2008</xref>). However, in long neuronal processes, changes in fluorescence intensity will more likely reflect movement of mitochondria out of the region of interest rather than fluorescence diffusion rates within a mitochondrial network, thereby compromising analysis by these methods. Therefore, to quantify mitochondrial fusion and fission events in neurons, we devised a strategy for DrOF by counting individual fission and fusion events in real time, combined with computational analyses.</p><p>To quantify fission and fusion events via DrOF, primary rat cortical neurons were cotransfected with mtRFP and with mtPA-GFP, a variant of <italic>Aequorea victoria</italic> GFP that fluoresces upon photoactivation at 405 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002</xref>).

This low rate of fusion implies that estimates based on counting apparent mitochondrial encounters are likely to dramatically overestimate mitochondrial fusion rates.

If each Drp1-binding site is equally likely to become a fission site, and if the number of binding sites is proportional to mitochondrial length as suggested, then longer mitochondria, such as those observed with Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> or dnDrp1<sup>K38A</sup>, should exhibit proportionately more fissions. That is, long mitochondria should undergo more fission events simply because they are longer, even if Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and dnDrp1<sup>K38A</sup> have no impact on the density of Drp1-binding sites or their fission efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>).

Furthermore, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>&#x02013;induced fission was Drp1-dependent, as dnDrp1 abolishes the effects of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and further suppresses basal fission. These findings further suggest that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> regulates the fission function of Drp1, rather than a distinct function of Drp1 (e.g., a cell death activity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>), which is consistent with reports that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and CED-9 bind and activate the GTPase activity of Drp1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 2008</xref>).

However, if fission and fusion are the sole determinants of mitochondrial morphology, then at steady state, their rates should be equal because theoretically a fission/fusion ratio &#x0003e;1 would lead to an unlimited increase in the number of very small organelles. Conversely, a fission/fusion ratio &#x0003c;1 would ultimately lead to a single fused organelle, as occurs in yeast lacking the gene for Dnm1/Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shaw and Nunnari, 2002</xref>). However, neither of these situations was observed in healthy neurons or in cell lines stably expressing Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (unpublished data). HeLa cells overexpressing Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> were found to display cell-to-cell differences, with cells exhibiting either fused or fragmented mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheridan et al., 2008</xref>). However, we did not observe excessively skewed fusion, fission, or length parameters between individual neurons. Therefore, because the rate of fission was significantly greater than the rate of fusion under all conditions analyzed by DrOF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>), mitochondrial morphology at steady state cannot be explained solely by adjusting a balance between fission and fusion.

Therefore, to satisfy the conservation of total mitochondrial numbers per cell under steady-state conditions, it is necessary to invoke an alternative mechanism for eliminating the extra mitochondria generated by fission that occurs above the rate of fusion. Because mitochondrial organelles are apparently degraded by a lysosomal pathway called mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kanki and Klionsky, 2008</xref>), it is reasonable to assume that organelle degradation balances the discrepancy between fission and fusion rates. For example, in neurons overexpressing Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, the ratio of fission/fusion is 4:1, resulting in a net gain of three mitochondria that presumably must be degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>, left). Although mitochondrial degradation is required to conserve mitochondrial numbers, it also causes another imbalance caused by a net loss of mitochondrial mass (degradation without biogenesis). Therefore, to satisfy the conservation of mitochondrial mass at steady state, at least a portion of the mitochondrial organelles in a cell must grow in size by the exact same amount that is lost through degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>, right).</p></sec><sec><title>Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> increases mitochondrial biomass</title><p>Although Bcl-2 family proteins are not known to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, we considered the possibility that the increase in mitochondrial length in neuronal processes was due in part to increased mitochondrial biomass induced by Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>. Mitochondrial biomass was estimated by calculating the total mitochondrial length (sum of all mitochondria) in a given length of dendrite. This was achieved by multiplying the mean mitochondrial length (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>) by the density of mitochondrial organelles in dendrites. The number density of mitochondria was determined by counting the number of organelles (marked with mtRFP) per length of dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>).

However, as supported by the work described in this paper, Bcl-2 proteins may have additional mitochondrial functions in healthy, long-lived cells. We took advantage of the linear (one-dimensional) topology of neuronal processes to directly assess the effects of mitochondrial fission and fusion on mitochondrial morphology in healthy neurons. Although these results generally agree with results from indirect methods and morphology studies suggesting that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> can increase either fusion or fission of mitochondria, quantification of fission and fusion rates revealed unexpectedly that fission exceeds fusion with or without Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> by up to sixfold, with fusion occurring in only 16% of mitochondria per hour. Therefore, other parameters that include mitochondrial biogenesis and degradation must be invoked to compensate for this fission/fusion imbalance to maintain mitochondrial number at steady state. These studies also suggest that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> may affect mitochondrial shape through regulating mitochondrial biomass independently of fission&#x02013;fusion mechanisms.</p><p>The terms fission and fusion are often used to describe morphologies rather than the underlying processes of organelle fission and fusion. This study predicts that a fission/fragmented mitochondrial phenotype does not equate with a higher fission/fragmentation rate, or even a lower fusion rate, because a lower growth/elongation rate could potentially be the responsible parameter. In our case, paradoxically, longer mitochondria are observed even when the fission rate is increased by Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Furthermore, it is conceivable that cells with opposite mitochondrial morphologies (connected vs. fragmented) could both have higher total mitochondrial mass/content. For example, although Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> can increase mitochondrial content of cells under conditions where the mitochondria are elongated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> may also increase mitochondrial content under conditions where Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> induces a more fragmented morphology (at least in the axons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, mitochondrial fragmentation can correlate with cell death resistance or sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Norris and Youle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheridan et al., 2008</xref>). Although mitochondrial morphology changes may be separable from cell death mechanisms, we venture that they are related, but that their relationships are not yet clear.</p><sec><title>Integrating mitochondrial fission, fusion, biogenesis, and degradation</title><p>By definition, if Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> increases biogenesis of mitochondrial organelles, as suggested by these studies, there must be a compensatory increase in mitochondrial degradation to maintain the newly established steady-state levels in neurons and other cell types expressing Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (thereby preventing eventual filling of the entire cell with mitochondria; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>). Perhaps this compensatory degradation is also facilitated by Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>&#x02013;induced Drp1-dependent fission based on the observation by others that a mitochondrial fission event can lead to depolarization and degradation of one of the two daughter mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Twig et al., 2008</xref>). Theoretically, we would expect to observe mitochondrial degradation in neuronal processes during the time-lapse studies based on our predicted rates of degradation, but this was not the case. A possible explanation is that mitochondria may be transported back toward the cell body or elsewhere for degradation. Alternatively, we missed these events after fission because one of two daughter mitochondria often migrated out of the field within 15 min, as newly generated mitochondria were often transported more rapidly away from a less mobile &#x0201c;parent&#x0201d; mitochondrion, irrespective of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> status.</p><p>An alternative explanation for increased biomass with Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is inhibition of mitochondrial degradation. Mitophagy could be inhibited by Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> through an interaction with Beclin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pattingre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maiuri et al., 2007</xref>), though we did not observe an increase in mitochondrial numbers in neuronal processes with Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Even if Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is a direct inhibitor of mitochondrial degradation, eventually this must be compensated by a matched decline in biogenesis to satisfy steady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>). This decline in the normal turnover (potentially of damaged organelles), plus the compensatory decline in biogenesis, seems unlikely to explain the beneficial effects of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in neurons. However, a reduced turnover of healthy mitochondria could also conserve energy. Like many dynamic cellular processes, there are likely to be regulatory feedback mechanisms at each control point (fission, fusion, biogenesis, and degradation) to compensate for imbalances in the system. As a consequence, it is challenging to dissect the underlying cause of any disturbance to the balance, as perturbation of any one parameter will trigger adjustments to one or more of the other parameters followed by reestablishment of new steady-state conditions. Furthermore, it remains possible that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> could modulate the balance of these parameters in either direction depending on metabolic needs.</p><p>Although dnDrp1<sup>K38A</sup> inhibited mitochondrial fission as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>), it unexpectedly also increased the fusion rate, similar to Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>). If we assume that Drp1 does not directly mediate fusion (supported by yeast genetics), then we must invoke indirect effects to explain this observation. Drp1 is predominantly cytosolic, and a fraction of Drp1 cycles on and off mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smirnova et al., 1998</xref>), presumably to maintain steady-state fission rates. Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is increased under certain conditions, such as after an apoptotic stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, Drp1 has been shown to cocluster at mitochondrial fission sites with the mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn2, at least at the resolution of microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karbowski et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, dnDrp1<sup>K38A</sup> could conceivably interfere with the ability of endogenous Drp1 to compete with Mfn2 at shared docking points, thereby removing restrictions on Mfn2-mediated fusion. In an alternative scheme, faster mitochondrial transport would increase the number of times mitochondria encounter one another, and if the rate of encounters is proportional to the rate of fusion, then dnDrp1<sup>K38A</sup> (or Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>) could potentially increase fusion by increasing rates of transport. However, we did not detect significant differences in the proportion of stationary mitochondria, or the proportion of mitochondria undergoing fast transport (&#x0003e; 0.5 &#x000b5;m/s) with dnDrp1<sup>K38A</sup> and/or Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (unpublished data). Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> has also been reported to interact with Mfn2 independently of Drp1 by coimmunoprecipitation and, therefore, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> may directly stimulate mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delivani et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluating mitochondrial dynamics and their physiological consequences</title><p>It is difficult to directly compare the rates of mitochondrial fission and fusion events to published methods that measure fluorescence diffusion.

Nevertheless, others have found lower rates in postmitotic cells compared with their proliferating counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jendrach et al., 2005</xref>). However, we only rarely observed coupling between mitochondrial fusion and fission, in contrast to results in COS7 and INS1 cells, where a fission event frequently occurred within 100 s after a fusion event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Twig et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondrial morphology changes have long been associated with energetic status, but the mechanistic connections between mitochondrial energetics and mitochondrial morphology remain unclarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benard and Rossignol, 2008</xref>). Depletion or inhibition of Drp1 was found to impair respiratory capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Twig et al., 2008</xref>), to cause a depletion of mitochondria from nerve terminals in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verstreken et al., 2005</xref>), and to reduce the number of synapses and dendritic spines in cultured mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>It is conceivable that the effects of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> on mitochondria in healthy cells also contribute to its potent anti-death activity by fortifying the energetic capacity of both dividing and nondividing cells, thereby improving the chances of cell survival upon receiving a toxic insult or apoptotic death stimulus. Although we cannot rule out an indirect effect of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> on mitochondrial dynamics that stems from an underlying primary effect on energetics, a direct role for Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is supported by several studies of Bcl-2 family proteins interacting with mitochondrial dynamin-like fission and fusion factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delivani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brooks et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2008</xref>). These effects of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> on mitochondrial shape could also involve binding and inhibiting pro-death Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bax and Bak, though Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> apparently has Bax/Bak-independent pro-survival activities based on Bax/Bak nonbinding mutants of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> that retain pro-survival function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng et al., 1996</xref>). Conversely, because Bax and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> both increase mitochondrial length in healthy cells, it is also possible that they act cooperatively to alter one or more of the parameters that regulate steady-state mitochondrial shape.</p><p>Because mitochondria are apparently not synthesized de novo, mitochondrial fission is necessary for production of new mitochondria.

These functions may explain in part why Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is required for neuronal survival during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Motoyama et al., 1995</xref>).
