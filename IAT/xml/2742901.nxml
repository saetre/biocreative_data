Eight nuclear proteins as potential targets for enterovirus 71 (EV71) 3C protease (3C<sup>pro</sup>) cleavages were identified by 2D electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF analysis. Of these proteins, CstF-64, which is a critical factor for 3&#x02032; pre-mRNA processing in a cell nucleus, was selected for further study. A time-course study to monitor the expression levels of CstF-64 in EV71-infected cells also revealed that the reduction of CstF-64 during virus infection was correlated with the production of viral 3C<sup>pro</sup>. CstF-64 was cleaved <italic>in vitro</italic> by 3C<sup>pro</sup> but neither by mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup> (in which the catalytic site was inactivated) nor by another EV71 protease 2A<sup>pro</sup>. Serial mutagenesis was performed in CstF-64, revealing that the 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage sites are located at position 251 in the N-terminal P/G-rich domain and at multiple positions close to the C-terminus of CstF-64 (around position 500). An accumulation of unprocessed pre-mRNA and the depression of mature mRNA were observed in EV71-infected cells. An <italic>in vitro</italic> assay revealed the inhibition of the 3&#x02032;-end pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation in 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extract, and this impairment was rescued by adding purified recombinant CstF-64 protein. In summing up the above results, we suggest that 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage inactivates CstF-64 and impairs the host cell polyadenylation <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as in virus-infected cells. This finding is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that a picornavirus protein affects the polyadenylation of host mRNA.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Many viruses contain specific proteases that are essential for processing their own viral proteins. For an efficient replication within their hosts, on the other hand, viruses also utilize these proteases to cleave a number of key host proteins and hijack cellular machineries. In this study, host proteins are identified as the substrates for enterovirus 71 viral protease by adopting a proteomic strategy. Enterovirus 71 infection is highly associated with neurological complication and mortality in an era when poliovirus has been controlled by vaccination. Investigating the host substrates for enterovirus 71 protease may shed light on the viral&#x02013;host interaction, ultimately providing further insight into the pathogenesis of EV71 infection. We found that 3C protease (3C<sup>pro</sup>) cleaved CstF-64, the latter a cleavage stimulation factor in host polyadenylation machinery. 3C<sup>pro</sup> is known to enter host nucleus, whereas the replication of the virus occurs in cytoplasm. While its role in nucleus has been thought to inhibit host transcription, we found that 3C<sup>pro</sup> may inhibit host-cell gene expression at host 3&#x02032;-end pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation steps. Consequently, less polyadenylated host mRNA is synthesized and more cellular resources, such as the translation factors, would be available for viral RNA expression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) belongs to the family of <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, to which poliovirus also belongs. EV71 infection usually causes childhood herpagina or exanthema, which is also called hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Acute EV71 infection may also cause a severe polio-like neurological disease and significant mortality. EV71-related neurological complications include aseptic meningitis, brainstem and/or cerebellar encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), myocarditis, and rapid fatal pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, which have been observed during outbreaks in Taiwan, mainland China, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, western Australia, the United States, and Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Ho1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-AbuBakar2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Numerous host machineries are affected by picornaviral infection, including host cap-dependent translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Etchison1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Rose1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Clark1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Clark2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Viral proteases are responsible for inhibitory effects. Picornaviruses typically encode two viral proteases, 2A<sup>pro</sup> and 3C<sup>pro</sup>, which are important for viral polypeptide processing. The major catalytic sites of type I poliovirus and EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> are His40, Glu71, and Cys147 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Hammerle1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Li1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, the identification of other cellular proteins that are cleaved by EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup> in nuclei is of interest, as it may help us to understand unknown viral-host interactions during EV71 infection. In this work, a novel nuclear factor, CstF-64, that is cleaved by EV71 3C<sup>pro</sup>, is identified.</p><p>Poly(A) tails are important for both cellular mRNA and picornaviral mRNA. The poly(A) tail in eukaryotic cells is suggested to confer mRNA stability, promote the translational efficiency of mRNA, and the transport mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Ford1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Wickens1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, poly(A) for picornaviruses is obtained differently from that for host cells. The poly(A) tail of picornaviruses is encoded by the genome, copied into a 5&#x02032; poly(U) tract in the negative sense form, then back into a poly(A) tail during the virus RNA replication cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-DorschHasler1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Polyadenylation of most eukaryotes involves a series of steps. Prior to poly(A) synthesis, a polyadenylation signal located at the 3&#x02032; end of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) must be recognized by multiple factors such as cleavage factors I and II (CF I and II), cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) complex, which causes endonucleolytical cleavage at the site of polyadenylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Zhao1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Colgan1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

The recombinant EV71 wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup> or mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup> were then added to nuclear extracts from SF268 cells. Following incubation for 4 hours at 37&#x000b0;C, the reactions were subjected to 2D electrophoresis. The experiments were performed six times and the results were analyzed using PDquest 7.0 (Bio-rad). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> presents one of these six 2D electrophoresis experiments. Proteins that appeared in the mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated reactants but in at least half of the amounts of the wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated reactants, based on silver staining, were regarded as potential targets. From the six pairs of gels in these 2D gel experiments, eight proteins that yielded similar results at least three times were selected. These proteins were then identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and the results were summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000593-t001">Table 1</xref>.

The amount of CstF-64 in SF268 nuclear extract dramatically declined following incubation with wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, lane 3), and the intact form of CstF-64 was clearly detected in mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extract (lane 2). One potential cleavage product of 55 kDa was also detected using CstF-64 antibody in wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>-incubated nuclear extract (lanes 3, 6 and 9, indicated by &#x0002a;). CstF-64 levels in nuclear extracts from other cell lines, RD and HeLa cells, also declined upon incubation with wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup> and the cleavage pattern is similar to that in SF268 nuclear extracts. (Compare lanes 6 and 9 with results for mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extracts in lanes 5 and 8). The wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>-induced CstF-64 reduction in nuclear extract depends on dose of recombinant 3C<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;7). The intensities between the full-length CstF-64 and its 55 kDa cleavage product were not the same as expected. This discrepancy is attributed to that later in the experiments, the cleavage sites were mapped to position 251 and multiple positions close to the C-terminus (around position 500) of CstF-64. The cleavage of CstF-64 at positions around 500 produce a product of 55 kDa, which contains another 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage site at its Gln251. When position 251 was mutated (Gln to Ala), the mutant CstF-64 was cleaved into a 55 kDa product with the same intensity as that of full-length CsfF-64. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> shows a band faster than 24 KDa (lane 2, 5 and 8), which we speculate is a cleavage product from a degraded form of CstF-64. The degraded form of CstF-64 might contain the cleavage sites for 3C<sup>pro</sup> as well as the CstF-64 antibody recognition sites. Therefore, western blot analysis detected the cleaved product from the degraded form only in mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup>, but not in wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extract because the cleavage destroyed the antibody recognition of CstF-64.

They are Gln251, corresponding to the predicted cleavage site in the region of amino acid 250, and residues Gln483, 496, 505, 510, 515 at around the amino acid position 500 on CstF-64.

Since two cleavage sites around the amino acids positions 250 and 500 of CstF-64 were estimated, cleavage at position around 250 is expected to produce a product of &#x0223c;55 KDa.

To identify the other cleavage sites around the amino acid position 500 of CstF-64, CstF-64(Q251A) was further mutated at the Gln483, 496, 505, 510 and 515 amino acids into Ala (Q483A, Q496A, Q505A, Q510A and Q515A, respectively). The results indicate that CstF-64(Q251A) peptides with single mutations on these potential cleavage sites are not completely resistant to wild-type (WT) 3C<sup>pro</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;18).

Moreover, the cleavage pattern was examined in a mutant CstF-64 (CstF-64-5 m), in which all Gln/Gly sites around position 500 were mutated.

A FLAG-CstF-64 with Q251A mutation was transfected into EV71-infected cells and the results indicated the accumulation of 55 kDa products but no 30 KDa product was detected (data not shown), suggesting that the 55 kDa component was an intermediate cleavage product when 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleaved CstF-64 at an amino acid position &#x0223c;500. The production of multiple 55 kDa bands in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000593-g003">Figs. 3A and B</xref>) was also observed, explaining the multiple cleavage sites around the amino acid position 500 of CstF-64.

However, C147S mutation rendered EV71 lethal. Alternatively, transcripts derived from EV71 infectious clones, i.e. wild-type versus C147S mutant, were transfected into cells to examine how they affect cellular pre-mRNA processing and polyadenylation. In wild-type transcript -transfected cells, CstF-64 was cleaved and cellular pre-mRNA processing was inhibited (data not shown), the same phenomenon was observed in EV71 virus-infected cells. However, in C147S mutant transcript -transfected cells, no cleavage occurred in CstF-64 and no effect on cellular pre-mRNA processing was observed, which is similar to the results in mock-infected cells. Still, no detectable viral protein (mature 3C<sup>pro</sup>) was found. We believe that phenomenon is owing to that C147S mutation destroys the proteolytic activity of 3C<sup>pro</sup> and inhibits viral protein processing and maturation. Therefore, we can not conclude that the C147S mutant in EV71-infected cells impairs the viral inhibition of cellular pre-mRNA processing.</p><p>CstF-64 reportedly contains at its N-terminal an RNA-binding domain and a hinge domain, which are responsible for the reorganization of RNA and its binding to CstF-77 or other factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Takagaki2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000593-Hatton1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

After the nuclear extracts had incubated with 3C<sup>pro</sup> and precipitated using 20&#x00025; trichloroacetic acid (TCA), the sample was dissolved in 8 M Urea, 2&#x00025; CHAPS, 0.5&#x00025; IPG buffer (Amersham Bioscience) and bromophenol blue. These samples were loaded on a cup-loading system (Amersham Biosciences). Isoelectric focusing was performed at 45,000 Vh in a stepwise fashion (1500 V, gradient for 2 hours; 4000 V, gradient for 3500 V.hours; 8000 V, step-on-hold until the end) in Immobiline Drystrip IEF gels with the range of pH 3&#x02013;10 (Amersham Biosciences). For SDS-PAGE, the IEF gels were loaded on gels with graded acryamide conc. of 9&#x00025; to 16&#x00025;. Proteins on 2D electrophoresis gels were visualized by silver staining and the results were scanned as TIF files. Protein spots on scanned gels were analyzed using PDquest v7.0 (Bio-rad) software. Six pairs of gels with a similarity of over 60&#x00025; were selected for further analysis. Spots that appeared in the mutant 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extracts disappeared or became at least 50&#x00025; smaller upon silver staining of the wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>-treated nuclear extracts were selected as the potential target substrates for wild-type 3C<sup>pro</sup>. Following this selection strategy, proteins that yielded similar results to each other more than three times were identified by in-gel digestion and analyzed by Bruker Ultraflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Mass lists were performed peptide mass fingerprinting by Biotool 2.0 software and the algorithm of Masscot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com">http://www.matrixscience.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p>RD cells were seeded onto 22 mm diameter coverslips to 80&#x00025; confluence and were infected with enterovirus 71 (strain 4643/TW/1998) at a multiplicity of infection of 40.
