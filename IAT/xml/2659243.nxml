Here we demonstrate that &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 mediates anti-apoptotic cytoprotective signaling stimulated by a typical 7-transmembrane receptor the angiotensin ATII 1A receptor, expressed endogenously in rat vascular smooth muscle cells or by transfection in HEK-293 cells. Receptor stimulation leads to concerted activation of two pathways, ERK/p90RSK and PI3K/AKT, which converge to phosphorylate and inactivate the pro-apoptotic protein BAD. Anti-apoptotic effects as well as pathway activities can be stimulated by an angiotensin analog (SII), which has been previously shown to activate &#x003b2;-arrestin but not G protein-dependent signaling, and are abrogated by &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 small interfering RNA. These findings establish a key role for &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 in mediating cellular cytoprotective functions by a 7-transmembrane receptor and define the biochemical pathways involved.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grants <grant-num>HL16037</grant-num> and <grant-num>HL70631</grant-num>.

Their binding to the receptor sterically inhibits receptor coupling to G protein leading to inactivation of effectors such as second messenger generating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). Besides this classical function, recently accumulating evidence has revealed novel functions of &#x003b2;-arrestins as signal transducers in various signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Among other processes, &#x003b2;-arrestins have been suggested to play a role in regulation of cell death, but this area has been controversial and largely devoid of mechanistic insight. There have been reports implicating &#x003b2;-arrestins in both pro- and anti-apoptotic responses as well as in non-apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). For example, it has been shown that stimulation of a number of 7TMRs including the <italic>N</italic>-formyl peptide receptor induces apoptosis in &#x003b2;-arrestin 1/2 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and that reintroduction of either &#x003b2;-arrestin-1 or -2 completely prevents this apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Conversely, &#x003b2;-arrestins also have been reported to mediate cell death. &#x003b2;-Arrestin-2, particularly a dephosphorylated form, has been shown to facilitate inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation in response to UV, leading to promotion of UV-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p><p>Bcl-2 family proteins are known to determine the outcome of an intrinsic apoptotic process initiated by release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and apoptotic factors from the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). BAD, a BH3-only protein is one of the &#x0201c;death-promoting&#x0201d; members of the Bcl-2 family and its pro-apoptotic activity is regulated primarily by phosphorylation at several sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Survival factors induce BAD phosphorylation via several protein kinase signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Phosphorylated BAD associates with 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasm, preventing translocation of BAD to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) and its interaction with the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). These proteins, freed from BAD, in turn associate with two other pro-apoptotic proteins, BAX and BAK. Such association prevents aggregation of these pro-apoptotic proteins on the mitochondrial membrane, stopping cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release and consequently inhibiting apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>).</p><p>Recently several 7TMRs have been shown to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK cascade and PI3K-AKT pathways in a &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). In particular, it has been demonstrated that &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated ERK activation by angiotensin II type 1A (AT<sub>1A</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>), vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), parathyroid hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>), and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) is G protein-independent. Furthermore, we have previously found that &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated ERK activation is quite distinct in its temporal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) and spatial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>) patterns from ERK-activated via G protein-dependent stimulation. In the case of AT<sub>1A</sub>R-mediated ERK activation in receptor-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, for example, the G protein-dependent activation is rapid, quite transient (peak at 2-5 min), and leads to nuclear translocation of the activated ERK. In contrast, &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-dependent ERK activation is slower, quite persistent, and entirely confined to the cytoplasm, particularly to endosomal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Such differences in ERK activation strongly imply that there must be subsets of ERK targets and physiological outcomes differentially regulated through &#x003b2;-arrestin <italic>versus</italic> G protein-dependent mechanisms. In the case of AKT activation, stimulation of 7TM protease-activated receptors with thrombin has been shown to activate AKT in a &#x003b2;-arrestin-1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Stimulation of the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor also has been shown to activate AKT in several cell types including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) although it has not been determined whether &#x003b2;-arrestins are involved in this signaling.</p><p>Accordingly, the studies reported here were undertaken to examine the role of &#x003b2;-arrestin in 7TMR-regulated apoptosis and to determine the downstream pathways mediating this regulation in a physiologically relevant non-transfected cellular receptor system. For this purpose, we chose the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor in rat VSMCs.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Materials</italic>&#x02014;[Sar<sup>1</sup>,Ile<sup>4</sup>,Ile<sup>8</sup>]AngII (Sar-Arg-Val-Ile-Ile-His-Pro-Ile) (SII) was synthesized as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>).

Eight to 90% confluent early passage (&#x0003c;5) VSMCs were transfected with siRNA using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the modified manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 60 &#x003bc;l of the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent was added to 300 &#x003bc;l of the medium-199 and 20 &#x003bc;g of siRNA was added to 400 &#x003bc;l of the medium. Both solutions were allowed to stand 5-10 min at room temperature and mixed by inversion. Following a 15-20-min incubation at room temperature, the entire transfection mixture was added to VSMCs in a 100-mm dish containing 5 ml of the fresh, serum-free medium. After cells were incubated for overnight at 37 &#x000b0;C, an additional 5 ml of the medium with 20% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin/streptomycin were added to the dish. Following an additional incubation for 24 h, cells were divided into 6-well plates or 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) for further procedures. For DNA transfection into VSMCs in either 35-mm glass bottom dishes or 6-well plates, the Lipofectamine LTX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was used with the PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

We and others have previously found that &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 is the isoform that mediates AT<sub>1A</sub>R-activated ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>), which is potentially an anti-apoptotic pathway. We have also found that &#x003b2;-arrestin-1 functionally opposes this signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). Consequently, we used VSMCs to explore the role of &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 in regulating apoptosis. We first monitored the effects of AngII stimulation on the activation of caspase-3 (cleavage of procaspase-3) induced by apoptotic challenges in VSMCs transfected with either control or &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNAs. We used 100 n<sc>m</sc> AngII to obtain maximal responses in this assay. It has been previously reported that AngII-stimulated ERK activation reaches maximal levels with this concentration in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing AT<sub>1A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). Apoptotic stimulation by either hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) or etoposide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>) dramatically increases the level of cleaved caspase-3 in control VSMCs. The levels of cleaved caspase-3 induced by such apoptotic stimuli were reduced to &#x0223c;50% by AngII pretreatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Next, we examined the effects of siRNA-mediated &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 knock-down on AngII-promoted protection from caspase-3 cleavage. Depletion of &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 not only leads to increases (up to &#x0223c;150%) in the induction of cleaved caspase-3 levels by treatment with hydrogen peroxide or etoposide, but also eliminates AngII-mediated decreases in these levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). On the other hand, knocking-down &#x003b2;-arrestin-1 leads to decreases in apoptotic reagent-induced caspase-3 cleavage even in the absence of stimulation with AngII, which is similar in extent to the protection observed in AngII-treated control cells. Stimulation with AngII results in no significant further protection in cells knocked down for &#x003b2;-arrestin-1 (data not shown). These results suggest an essential role of &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 in AngII-stimulated protection from caspase-dependent apoptotic processes.</p><p>Because the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from mitochondria is one of the key upstream events for the coordinated activation of caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>), we next examined effects of AngII stimulation on the hydrogen peroxide-induced redistribution of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> in control or &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNA-transfected VSMCs. In the absence of an apoptotic challenge, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> is well distributed within cytoplasmic, mitochondrial networks in control cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>upper left panel</italic>). Treatment with hydrogen peroxide leads to the rearrangement of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> into a cytoplasmic dotted pattern in cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>upper middle panel</italic>). Hydrogen peroxide-induced redistribution of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> is largely reversed by prior stimulation with AngII (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>upper right panel</italic>). These staining patterns of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> are, in all cases, superimposed with that of the Mito-Tracker, a mitochondrial marker (supplemental Fig. S1), confirming that the changes in the staining patterns of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref> indeed represent mitochondrial remodeling. Mitochondrial rearrangement and fragmentation have been observed in apoptotic cells, especially when apoptosis has been induced by pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). Depletion of &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 has no effect on mitochondrial network organization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>lower left panel</italic>), and does not alter the pattern of fragmentation observed after hydrogen peroxide treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>lower middle panel</italic>). However, unlike control siRNA-transfected cells, pre-stimulation with AngII fails to reverse the hydrogen peroxide-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNA-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>lower right panel</italic>). These results further support an important role for &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 in mediating AngII-stimulated anti-apoptotic activity.</p><p>To further validate these findings, we measured DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of cell death, in VSMCs transfected with either control or &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNAs. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>F</italic></xref>) or etoposide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>G</italic></xref>) causes a 4-6-fold increase in DNA fragmentation. In control siRNA-transfected cells, pre-stimulation with AngII reduces (by &#x0223c;40%) the extent of DNA fragmentation induced by both reagents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>). On the contrary, we did not observe decreases in DNA fragmentation after prestimulation with AngII in &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNA-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>), mirroring the situation observed with caspase-3 activation. In the case of &#x003b2;-arrestin-1 knock-down, effects on DNA fragmentation also mirror the effects observed with caspase-3 cleavage (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 is crucial for AngII-stimulated protection of VSMCs from apoptotic cell death.</p><p>To establish whether the &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-dependent AT<sub>1</sub>R-mediated inhibition of apoptotic processes can be accomplished in the absence of G protein activation, we stimulated VSMCs with an AngII analog, [Sar<sup>1</sup>,Ile<sup>4</sup>,Ile<sup>8</sup>]AngII (SII). This mutant form of AngII was previously shown not to activate G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>H</italic> and <italic>I</italic></xref>, stimulation of the cells with SII leads to significant decreases (35-45%) in the levels of cleaved caspase-3 upon hydrogen peroxide or etoposide treatment. The extent of DNA fragmentation induced by these reagents is also reduced to a similar extent upon prestimulation with SII (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>J</italic></xref>). The extent of SII-stimulated decreases (30-45%) in both assays is similar to those evoked by AngII stimulation (40-50%).

These include the ERK1/2 MAPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>) and AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Because both ERK and AKT signaling are reported to exert cytoprotective actions, we examined their possible involvement in the anti-apoptotic effects of AngII on VSMCs. Here we demonstrate that in VSMCs stimulated with AngII, ERK1/2 are activated, and this is significantly reduced by siRNA-mediated knock-down of &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>A</italic>-<italic>C</italic></xref>). The reduction is observed only after a 2-min stimulation, suggesting that, as previously shown in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>), prior to that time activation proceeds exclusively through G protein-dependent mechanisms. Ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) is a well known downstream kinase for ERK signaling and it mediates a variety of physiological responses including anti-apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). Furthermore, RSK is activated by phosphorylation in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>) where ERK activated by &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent mechanisms is confined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Moreover, our recent high throughput proteomics screening using the stable isotope labeling amino acid in cell culture method have revealed that the level of p90RSK phosphorylation is increased by SII stimulation in HEK-293 cells expressing the AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">3</xref> Accordingly, we next tested whether phosphorylation of p90RSK occurs upon stimulation with AngII and whether this is mediated by &#x003b2;-arrestin-2. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>, the kinetic pattern of AngII-stimulated p90RSK phosphorylation, particularly at ERK sites Thr<sup>359</sup>/Ser<sup>363</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>), is similar to that for ERK activation. In control siRNA-transfected cells, p90RSK phosphorylation also reaches a maximal level at 5 min after stimulation although it lags slightly behind ERK activation (compare 2-min points in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>C versus E</italic>) and decreases gradually over 20 min. Silencing &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 expression leads to rapid and transient p90RSK phosphorylation, also similar to ERK activation. These results suggest that ERKs activated through both &#x003b2;-arrestin-2- and G protein-dependent pathways can phosphorylate RSK. However, &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-mediated phosphorylation of p90RSK is much slower and more prolonged than that due to activation of the &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-independent pathway, which is presumably G-protein-mediated.</p><p>RSK is also known to have many downstream targets mediating numerous physiological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). One such target is the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and its phosphorylation by RSK is known to inhibit its pro-apoptotic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Accordingly, we next examined phosphorylation of BAD at Ser<sup>113</sup> (known to be a preferred RSK site) in VSMCs. In these cells, &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 RNA interference interestingly leads to almost complete attenuation in AT<sub>1</sub>R-mediated BAD phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that AngII-induced RSK phosphorylation by ERK is partially mediated by &#x003b2;-arrestin-2- (especially &#x0003e;2 min) and G protein (&#x0003c;2 min)-dependent pathways. Nonetheless, it is predominantly RSK activated through the &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-mediated pathway that phosphorylates BAD upon activation of the AT<sub>1</sub> receptors in VSMCs.</p><p>To further validate the &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-dependent nature of the AT<sub>1</sub>R-mediated activation of the ERK/p90RSK/BAD cascade, we stimulated the VSMCs with SII, which cannot activate G protein signaling. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>H</italic> and <italic>I</italic></xref>, SII stimulates both p90RSK and phosphorylation of BAD at the RSK site, thus confirming the G protein independence of these responses.</p><p>Another kinase that is known to phosphorylate and inactivate BAD leading to anti-apoptotic effects is AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Moreover, &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated activation of AKT has been demonstrated for 7TM protease-activated receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) as well as for the receptor tyrosine kinase insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Accordingly, we tested the ability of AngII to promote phosphorylation of the stimulatory site, Ser<sup>473</sup>, of AKT in the VSMCs. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>J</italic> and <italic>K</italic></xref>, time-dependent phosphorylation was observed, which was inhibited by &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNAs at times later than 2 min of stimulation, indicating that this process is mediated in part by &#x003b2;-arrestin-2.</p><p><italic>RSK- and AKT-mediated Phosphorylations of BAD Are Essential for AngII-stimulated Cell Protection</italic>&#x02014;Our data suggest that RSK- and/or AKT-mediated phosphorylation of BAD might be a molecular mechanism that is responsible for the &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-mediated anti-apoptotic effects of AngII on VSMCs. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effects of the RSK inhibitor SL0101 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, which is known to block AKT activation, on AngII-induced anti-apoptosis in VSMCs. Treatment with either SL0101 or LY294002 completely ablates the ability of AngII to protect against etoposide-induced apoptosis as assessed by either caspase-3 cleavage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>) or DNA fragmentation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref> shows that LY294002 blocks AngII-induced activation of AKT as assessed by phosphorylation of AKT Ser<sup>473</sup>, and SL0101 blocks phosphorylation of BAD at the RSK site, BAD Ser<sup>113</sup>. These results strongly support the thesis that &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 mediates AngII-stimulated cell protection by regulating RSK- and AKT-mediated phosphorylation of BAD. Moreover the concerted activation of both pathways appears to be necessary because blockade of either alone completely eliminates the anti-apoptotic effect.</p><p>To directly test whether RSK- and AKT-mediated phosphorylation of BAD are required for the anti-apoptotic actions of AngII, we studied the nature of overexpressed wild-type and phosphorylation-deficient mutants of BAD in VSMCs. We used the two mouse mutants BAD S112A and BAD S136A that are defective in RSK- and AKT-mediated phosphorylation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type BAD in the VSMCs leads to a typical apoptotic pattern of mitochondrial fragmentation as visualized by cytochrome <italic>c</italic> staining, whereas cells that do not express BAD show an intact mitochondrial architecture (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>). Essentially identical images were obtained with the two mutant forms of BAD (supplemental Fig. S2), confirming the abilities of all these three forms of BAD to induce apoptosis upon overexpression.</p><p>Next we examined caspase-3 activation in cells expressing the three BAD constructs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>). Despite relatively inefficient (&#x0003c;10%) transfection of the cells, robust increases in the levels of cleaved caspase-3 were observed in all cases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>). In this system, AngII stimulation leads to partial but significant (&#x0223c;30%) decreases in these levels in cells overexpressing the wild-type BAD, whereas such reductions are not observed in cells expressing BAD S112A or BAD S136A (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>G</italic></xref>). These results support the conclusion that RSK- and AKT-mediated phosphorylation of BAD are required for AngII-stimulated, &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-mediated cytoprotective processes. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the findings shown above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A</italic>-<italic>D</italic></xref>) that both activities of RSK and AKT are essential for AngII-stimulated protection from apoptotic stimuli.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of silencing</bold> &#x003b2;<bold>-arrestin-2 expression on ERK-RSK-BAD phosphorylation as well as AKT activation in response to AngII in rat VSMCs.</bold><italic>A-G</italic>, indicated siRNA-transfected VSMCs were serum-starved for &#x0223c;24 h and then stimulated with 100 n<sc>m</sc> AngII at 37 &#x000b0;C for the indicated periods.

Accordingly, we wished to determine the effects of &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-mediated phosphorylation of BAD on its binding to Bcl-xL and 14-3-3. However, we were unable to detect the interaction of these proteins expressed at physiological levels in VSMCs with our co-immunoprecipitation assay. Alternatively, we found that we were able to perform such experiments with these proteins endogenously expressed in HEK-293 cells expressing the AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor. However, such experiments are only relevant to the situation in VSMCs if the signaling pathway we have identified in the VSMCs also operates in the HEK-293 cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>A</italic>-<italic>C</italic></xref>, in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with a plasmid expressing the AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor, AngII provokes a protracted activation (assessed by phosphorylation of Thr<sup>359</sup>/Ser<sup>363</sup>) of p90RSK. Two different &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>) inhibit this response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), but only at times after 5 min of stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). In contrast, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Ro31-8425 or GF109203X, which has been shown in HEK-293 cells to block G protein-dependent ERK activation by AngII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>), inhibits the early component of p90RSK activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). Confirming that virtually all of the AngII-induced phosphorylation of p90RSK at Thr<sup>359</sup> and Ser<sup>363</sup> is mediated by ERK, the MEK inhibitor U0126 completely abolishes the p90RSK phosphorylation response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). These patterns of sensitivities to PKC blockade and &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNA directly parallel our previous findings for AngII-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>).</p><p>Despite this evidence that &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-mediated ERK activation accounts for only the later (&#x0003e;5 min) occurring phosphorylation of p90RSK, the data in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>, suggest that, as in the VSMCs, almost all of the downstream phosphorylation of BAD by RSK is mediated by the pool of p90RSK, which is activated through &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent ERK. After &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNA transfection, there is almost complete loss of the AngII-stimulated BAD phosphorylation at Ser<sup>75</sup>, the homologous site of Ser<sup>113</sup> in human BAD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). As expected, virtually all the BAD phosphorylation at this site is also blocked by the selective RSK inhibitor SL0101 and MEK inhibitor U0126 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>). Because PKC inhibitors have been shown to efficiently block RSK, which belongs to the same AGC kinase family as PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>), their effects on BAD phosphorylation could not be reliably studied.</p><p>To further validate the G protein-independent nature of the phosphorylation of p90RSK and BAD, we stimulated HEK-293 cells expressing the AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor with SII. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>, this stimulation leads to prolonged increases in both p90RSK and BAD phosphorylation. Taken together, results in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> confirm that the AT<sub>1</sub>R-&#x003b2;-arrestin-2-ERK-p90RSK-BAD pathway delineated in rat VSMCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) is also operative in HEK-293 cells.</p><p>&#x003b2;<italic>-Arrestin-2 Regulates Interactions of BAD with Its Partners upon AngII Stimulation</italic>&#x02014;As noted above, the dynamic interactions of BAD with its partners regulate the pro-apoptotic function of BAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). Our results demonstrate that BAD phosphorylation by RSK is mediated predominantly by &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-dependent signaling (Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2<italic>G</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4<italic>E</italic></xref>) and also suggest that its phosphorylation by AKT is partially dependent on &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>K</italic></xref>). Accordingly, we examined BAD interactions with its partners at their endogenous levels upon AngII stimulation in control or &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNA-transfected HEK-293 cells stably expressing AT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. Stimulation with AngII leads to a significant increase in the amount of BAD present in 14-3-3 protein immunoprecipitates in control cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). In parallel, the quantity of the 14-3-3 protein co-immunoprecipitated with BAD is augmented by AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). AT<sub>1A</sub>R-mediated increases in the interaction of BAD with 14-3-3 shown by both BAD and 14-3-3 immunoprecipitation are eliminated in &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNA-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>A-D</italic></xref>). Conversely, we found that AngII stimulation decreases the interaction of BAD with Bcl-xL. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic></xref>, show the reduced amount of Bcl-xL in BAD immunoprecipitates upon AngII stimulation in control cells. This reduction is not observed in &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNA-transfected cells. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>G</italic> and <italic>H</italic></xref>, show that in the HEK-293 cell lysates used in these experiments, AngII-stimulated BAD phosphorylation at the RSK site (Ser<sup>75</sup>) is completely abolished by &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 siRNA, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that activation of AT<sub>1</sub> receptors leads to a &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-dependent increase in BAD interaction with 14-3-3 and a decrease in its association with Bcl-xL, resulting in an anti-apoptotic signal. Moreover, the results strongly suggest that AngII-stimulated changes in BAD complex formation are mediated by p90RSK and AKT phosphorylation of BAD in a &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study shows that &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 plays a crucial role in AngII-stimulated anti-apoptotic responses and delineates the downstream biochemical pathways responsible for this AngII-stimulated, &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-mediated cytoprotection from apoptotic challenge. Upon stimulation with AngII, the pro-apoptotic protein BAD is phosphorylated through two signaling pathways, ERK-p90RSK and PI3K-AKT. Activation of both pathways appears to be &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-dependent. This &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-dependent BAD phosphorylation leads to increases in BAD-14-3-3 association and decreases in the interaction of BAD with Bcl-xL. Such changes in the association of BAD with its partners lead to attenuation of its pro-apoptotic function, resulting in AngII-stimulated protection from apoptotic challenges. There have been reports implicating &#x003b2;-arrestins in both pro- and anti-apoptotic responses as well as in non-apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). However, the biochemical pathways through which &#x003b2;-arrestins mediate these responses upon 7TMR activation have not been delineated. The results reported here establish a downstream molecular mechanism by which &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 mediates anti-apoptosis in response to activation of the physiologically important AT<sub>1</sub> receptor in a non-transfected natural cell, VSMC.</p><p>&#x003b2;-Arrestin-mediated, but G protein-independent, activation of ERK1/2 has been a focus of study for the functions of &#x003b2;-arrestins as signal transducers for 7TMR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). In the case of AT<sub>1A</sub>R-mediated ERK activation, it has been demonstrated that upon activation of the receptor, &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 scaffolds the components of the ERK cascade, Raf-1, MEK1, and ERK1/2, into the receptor complex, leading to activation of ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). In addition, we have previously shown that &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-dependent activation displays distinct temporal and spatial patterns from those due to G protein-dependent activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). In particular, ERK activated via the &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-dependent pathway is confined to the cytoplasm, whereas ERK activated via G proteins translocates into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). These distinct patterns strongly suggest that the substrates of ERK activated via &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-mediated signaling may be largely cytoplasmic. Cytoplasmic ERK activity appears to be important in the regulation of cell morphology, migration, and viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). However, very little is known about how phosphorylation of cytoplasmic ERK substrates, downstream of &#x003b2;-arrestin signaling, regulates cellular responses. The only known example is the very recent finding that &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-mediated ERK activation by the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor leads to an increase in protein synthesis via activation of a downstream kinase, Mnk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). The present study reveals anti-apoptosis mediated by BAD phosphorylation as another downstream response of &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated ERK signaling stimulated by a 7TMR. These results thus expand our understanding of the roles of &#x003b2;-arrestin in determining the physiological outcomes of signaling initiated from 7TMRs.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Kinase activities of both RSK and AKT as well as BAD phosphorylation are required for AngII-promoted cellular protection in rat VSMCs.</bold><italic>A-D</italic>, serum-starved VSMCs were incubated with either 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> SL0101 for 2 h or 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> LY294004 for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C before stimulation with AngII and following etoposide treatment. <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic>, contents of pro- and cleaved caspase-3 were visualized (<italic>A</italic>), and the amounts of cleaved caspase-3 were determined (<italic>C</italic>) as described in the legend to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.

These include other MAPKs, JNK3, and p38 as well as c-Src, PI3K, AKT, and RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Most of these molecules have been shown to be involved in regulation of apoptosis. In the case of AKT for example, it has been reported that deficiency of &#x003b2;-arrestins 1 and 2 leads to loss of AKT activation and anti-apoptotic effects following insulin-like growth factor 1 stimulation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Although there has been a report showing &#x003b2;-arrestin-1-dependent AKT activation in response to thrombin mediated through 7TM protease-activated receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), its function in apoptosis was not studied. Our present data show that stimulation of the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor leads to AKT activation in a &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>J</italic> and <italic>K</italic></xref>). Our results also demonstrate that the activity of PI3K, the upstream kinase of AKT, is required for AngII-stimulated protection from apoptotic challenges in VSMCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). As described above, &#x003b2;-arrestin might regulate apoptotic processes through multiple mechanisms. In fact, the present study indicates that &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 mediates the anti-apoptotic response to AngII through two different pathways, ERK-RSK and PI3K-AKT.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p>&#x003b2;<bold>-Arrestin-2 also mediates the ERK-RSK-BAD phosphorylation cascade upon stimulation of the AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor stably expressed in HEK-293 cells.</bold><italic>A-E</italic>, cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and serum starved for &#x0223c;6 h.

RSK is a well known ERK substrate and mediates signals to many cellular responses, including cell survival, through phosphorylation of its downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). One such target is BAD, which RSK phosphorylates at serine 113 (in the case of rat BAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). In addition to RSK, PKA and AKT have been considered as putative upstream kinases for BAD phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). Nonetheless, our data show that inhibition of either ERK or RSK, but not PI3K activities completely abolishes phosphorylation of BAD at this site following activation of the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor (Figs. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3<italic>B</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4<italic>E</italic></xref>). Such data clearly demonstrate that BAD phosphorylation at Ser<sup>113</sup> in response to AT<sub>1</sub> receptor activation is mediated through the ERK-RSK pathway. In addition to the ERK-RSK-BAD pathway, our data show that blockade of the PI3K-AKT pathway also eliminates AngII-stimulated anti-apoptosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). However, this PI3K/AKT-dependent anti-apoptotic effect must be mediated through phosphorylation of BAD at a different site, <italic>e.g.</italic> Ser<sup>136</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>) or possibly phosphorylation of other targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that knocking-down &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 expression leads to almost complete inhibition in RSK-mediated phosphorylation of BAD following AT<sub>1</sub> receptor activation (Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>), suggesting that this process may be entirely &#x003b2;-arrestin-2-mediated. These results are quite interesting in view of the previous and present findings that ERK activation in response to stimulation of the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor is mediated both by independent &#x003b2;-arrestin-2- and G protein-mediated signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). The data presented here also show that activation of p90RSK, the kinase that transfers signals from activated ERK to BAD phosphorylation, is mediated through these two pathways (Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that PKC activity is essential for G protein-dependent, but not &#x003b2;-arrestin-mediated signaling to ERK activation following stimulation of the AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). There have been reports that PKC is involved in RSK-mediated BAD phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>), implying that G protein-dependent signaling might be involved. However, we found that SII, a mutant ligand that fails to activate G proteins, induces BAD phosphorylation by RSK (Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2, <italic>H</italic> and <italic>I</italic></xref>, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>) as well as promotes anti-apoptotic effects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>H</italic>-<italic>J</italic></xref>). This strongly supports the contention that AT<sub>1</sub>R-mediated BAD phosphorylation via the ERK-RSK pathway in VSMCs as well as HEK-293 cells is G protein-independent. Furthermore, we have previously shown that restriction of activated ERK to the cytoplasm, where BAD resides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), is one of the striking characteristics of &#x003b2;-arrestin-, but not G protein-dependent ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Consequently, AT<sub>1</sub>R-induced phosphorylation of BAD by RSK provides an example of how an appreciation of the distinct characteristics of &#x003b2;-arrestin <italic>versus</italic> G protein signaling can illuminate issues of apparent &#x0201c;compartmentalization&#x0201d; of cellular signaling events.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of</bold> &#x003b2;<bold>-arrestin-2 knocking down on AngII-induced interaction of BAD with its partners in AT<sub>1A</sub>R-stably expressing HEK-293 cells.</bold> Cells were transfected with either control (<italic>CTL</italic>) or &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 (&#x003b2;<italic>arr2</italic>) siRNA.

Several previous findings support this idea.
