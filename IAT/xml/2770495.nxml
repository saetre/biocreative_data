Many viruses exploit the cellular ubiquitin system to facilitate viral replication. In fact, herpes simplex virus (HSV) encodes a ubiquitin ligase (E3) and a de-ubiquitinating enzyme to modify the host's ubiquitin system. We have previously reported HSV type 2 (HSV-2) tegument protein UL56 as a putative adaptor protein of neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 4 (Nedd4) E3 ligase, which has been shown to be involved in protein sorting and trafficking.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we visualized and characterized the dynamic intracellular localization of UL56 and Nedd4 using live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence analysis. UL56 was distributed to cytoplasmic vesicles, primarily to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and trafficked actively throughout the cytoplasm. Moreover, UL56 relocalized Nedd4 to the vesicles in cells transiently expressing UL56 and in cells infected with HSV-2. We also investigated whether UL56 influenced the efficiency of viral replication, and found that extracellular infectious viruses were reduced in the absence of UL56.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data suggest that UL56 regulates Nedd4 and functions to facilitate the cytoplasmic transport of virions from TGN to the plasma membrane and/or release of virions from the cell surface.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The ubiquitin system is a key regulatory mechanism for a variety of cellular processes: protein turnover, protein sorting and trafficking, signal transduction and cell-cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Ubiquitination is executed by a hierarchical cascade of three types of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin ligases (E3s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The human genome encodes more than 600 putative E3 ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], which primarily provide substrate specificity. There are two main groups of E3 ligases: really interesting novel genes (RING) and homologous to E6AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) proteins. The neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 4 (Nedd4) family, comprised of nine members, is one of the main HECT E3 protein families. They are characterized by a unique domain architecture, with an amino-terminal C2 domain, two to four protein-protein interacting WW domains and a carboxyl terminal catalytic HECT domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Viruses depend heavily on functions provided by their host cells as intracellular parasites, and as such, have evolved diverse strategies to exploit the biology and biochemistry of hosts for their benefits. The ubiquitin system is one of the mechanisms exploited by many viruses; it is involved in viral assembly and release, viral transcriptional regulation, viral immune invasion and the suppression of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Regarding viral assembly and release, several Nedd4 family E3 ligases act to link the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system and viral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The ESCRT system helps to sort cargo into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), a type of endosomes, and might also participate in the biogenesis of MVBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In fact, the ESCRT system is reportedly exploited by many enveloped RNA and DNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Some viruses encode their own E3 ligases, de-ubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and adaptor proteins to modify the host's ubiquitin system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encodes a ubiquitin ligase (ICP0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and a DUB (UL36) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition to these two proteins, the HSV type 2 (HSV-2) tegument protein UL56 was identified as a putative adaptor protein of Nedd4 E3 ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Nedd4 is phosphorylated and degraded in wild-type HSV-2-infected cells in a UL56-dependent manner. UL56 interacts with Nedd4 and increases the ubiquitination of Nedd4, however UL56 itself is not ubiquitinated. Despite reports demonstrating interactions between UL56 and Need4, the role of this interaction in viral replication remains unclear.</p><p>HSV is a large, enveloped, double-stranded-DNA virus, which can cause various mild and life-threatening diseases, including herpes labialis, genital herpes, keratitis, encephalitis and neonatal herpes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The HSV genome encodes at least 74 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Approximately half of the genes are accessory genes: genes not essential for viral replication in cell-culture system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The HSV accessory gene <italic>UL56</italic>, or a homologue, is encoded by most members of the <italic>Alphaherpesvirinae </italic>family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Interestingly, HSV type 1 (HSV-1) <italic>UL56 </italic>has been shown to play an important role in pathogenicity <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], although little is known about its molecular mechanisms. HSV-2 UL56 is a 235-amino acid, carboxyl-terminal anchored, type II membrane protein that is predicted to be inserted into the viral envelope so that the amino-terminal domain is located in the virion tegument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this topology, UL56 is predicted to have a 216-amino acid cytoplasmic domain containing three PY motifs, which are important for its interaction with Nedd4 E3 ligase. UL56 has also been shown to associate with two other proteins: KIF1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the neuron-specific kinesin; and HSV-2 UL11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], a tegument protein that has dynamic membrane-trafficking properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It is also involved in the envelopment and egress of viral nucleocapsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These interactions suggest that UL56 may be involved in vesicular transport in neurons, or viral envelopment and egress, however, the role and function of UL56 in viral replication and pathogenicity are still unknown.</p><p>In this study, to elucidate the biological role and function of HSV-2 UL56, and its interaction with E3 ligase Nedd4, we visualized and characterized the dynamic intracellular localization of UL56 and Nedd4 using live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence analysis. Furthermore, we investigated whether UL56 influenced the efficiency of viral replication by comparing growth properties of wild-type HSV-2 with those of UL56-deficient HSV-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>UL56 shows dynamic localization and relocalizes Nedd4</title><p>We first explored the dynamics of Nedd4 and UL56 localization using live cell confocal microscopy. Nedd4 carboxyl-terminally tagged with EGFP (Nedd4-EGFP) and/or UL56 amino-terminally tagged with mRFP (mRFP-UL56) were transiently expressed in cells to visualize their distribution and movement. As previously observed in fixed cells, Nedd4-EGFP was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> [movie 1]) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. mRFP-UL56 was detected in a vesicular pattern and the puncta moved around the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> [movie 2]). mRFP-UL56 puncta varied in size and moved in the different directions and at the different speeds. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> shows frames of a time-lapse movie of mRFP-UL56 trafficking in the protruding portion of the cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>; additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> [movie 3]). Puncta displayed rapid movements in both the minus- and plus-end-directions, sometimes interrupted by stationary periods, and could be observed to merge, separate or change direction. The accumulation of puncta in the tip of the protrusion indicated a mild preference for plus-end-directional movement. mRFP-UL56AY, mutant UL56 with mutations of all three PY-motifs (PPXY to AAXY), showed similar distribution and movement to those of mRFP-UL56 (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>UL56 shows dynamic localization and relocalizes Nedd4</bold>.

Coexpression of mRFP-UL56 with Nedd4-EGFP markedly reduced the EGFP-signal but not the mRFP-signal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), suggesting that the stability of Nedd4-EGFP was changed in the presence of mRFP-UL56. mRFP-UL56 was distributed in a vesicular pattern, similar to cells expressing mRFP-UL56 alone. Moreover, the subcellular distribution of Nedd4-GFP was markedly changed in the presence of mRFP-UL56, such that Nedd4-GFP now showed a vesicular distribution and colocalized with mRFP-UL56, and in some instances showed a filamentous distribution near the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E-1</xref>). A substantial portion of Nedd4-GFP in the vesicular pattern colocalized with mRFP-UL56, while only small portion of mRFP-UL56 colocalized with Nedd4-GFP. As was the case for mRFP-UL56 singly expressing cells, the majority of puncta positive only for mRFP-UL56 displayed continuous movement in cells that coexpressed Nedd4-GFP. Most punctuate structures positive for both Nedd4-GFP and mRFP-UL56 were less motile than those with mRFP alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E-2</xref>, open arrowheads). Some punctuate structures with both proteins moved as fast as mRFP-UL56 puncta (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E-2</xref>, filled arrowheads). Overlap between the localization of Nedd4-GFP and mRFP-UL56 was not stable; the pattern of overlap changed rapidly, and even merge or separation of the two proteins was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E-3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E-4</xref>). Nedd4-GFP and a part of mRFP-UL56 colocalized to punctate structures also in the peripheral region of the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>); the punctuate structures showed similar kinetics to those of puncta near the nucleus.</p><p>On the contrary, Nedd4-GFP, when co-expressed with mRFP-UL56AY, remained largely diffuse in the cytoplasm. Only several Nedd4-GFP puncta were detected and they colocalized with mRFP-UL56AY (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). We have previously reported that Nedd4 colocalizes with UL56 but only partially with UL56AY in fixed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which is consistent with these observations. Live cell imaging showed more clearly the difference of Nedd4 distribution between in UL56- and in UL56AY-expressing cells than immunofluorescence analysis of fixed cells.</p></sec><sec><title>UL56 localizes to the Golgi complex, trans-Golgi network and early endosomes in cells transiently expressing UL56</title><p>We next sought to determine detailed intracellular localization of UL56 using immunostaining. UL56 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in a vesicular pattern with accumulation in the perinuclear region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In order to identify the punctuate structures localized by UL56, cells transiently expressing UL56 were stained for Golgi-, trans-Golgi network (TGN), or endosomal marker proteins. Transient expression of UL56 caused no apparent change in the localization of marker proteins except rab7; rab7 was concentrated in the perinuclear space to a greater extent in UL56-expressing cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). UL56 only partially colocalized with Golgi58K, a marker for the Golgi complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and GM130, a marker for <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In contrast, a substantial portion of UL56 colocalized with TGN46, a marker for TGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], suggesting that UL56 predominantly localizes to TGN. We also tested for constitutitve proteins of the coated vesicle adaptor protein complex (AP): &#x003b3;-adaptin, a marker for AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]; &#x003b4;-adaptin, a marker for AP-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Both AP-1 and AP-3 localizes to TGN and endosomes, with AP-3 localizes more to endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. UL56 colocalized with both &#x003b3;-adaptin and &#x003b4;-adaptin, albeit greater colocalization with &#x003b4;-adaptin, suggesting that UL56 localizes to the endosomal compartment as well as TGN. As expected, UL56 partially colocalized with EEA1, a marker for early endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. UL56 did not colocalize with rab7, a marker for late endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], or CD63 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], a marker for late endosomes/MVBs. These data suggest that UL56, if expressed alone, is predominantly present in TGN and partially in Golgi complex and early endosomes.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>UL56 localizes to cytoplasmic vesicular structures in transiently UL56-expressing cells</bold>.

Cells transiently expressing Nedd4-EGFP were infected with wild-type HSV-2 (strain186) or UL56-deficient HSV-2 (&#x00394;UL56Z). In cells infected with wild-type HSV-2, Nedd4-EGFP remained diffuse in the cytoplasm in the early-phase of viral replication (3 h postinfection), as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> (top panels). The localization began to change around 5-6 h postinfection, such that Nedd4-EGFP accumulated in the perinuclear region.

Viral proteins interact with both viral and cellular proteins, thus other viral proteins can influence UL56 distribution directly or indirectly.</p><p>UL56 accumulated in the perinuclear region with vesicular distribution in the cytoplasm at 6 h postinfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), and increased both in the perinuclear region and in the peripheral region at 9 h postinfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The pattern of the intracellular distribution of UL56 in infected cells was similar to that in cells transiently expressing UL56. However, UL56 accumulated more distinctly in the perinuclear region and spread to lesser extent in the peripheral region in infected cells. UL56 colocalized partially with Golgi58K and GM130 in the perinuclear region, and predominantly with TGN46. Infections changed distributions of some marker proteins. Golgi58K and GM130 were in part dispersed around the perinuclear region in infected cells.

Infection caused Nedd4-GFP to accumulate in the perinuclear region, and in addition, Nedd4 was also distributed in a vesicular pattern in the peripheral of the cytoplasm. The distribution pattern of UL56 in cells transiently expressing Nedd4-GFP was not different from that in Nedd4-GFP-non-expressing cells. Nedd4-GFP markedly colocalized with UL56 and TGN46 after 6 h postinfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). However, Nedd4-GFP showed little colocalization with CD63; Nedd4-GFP, similar to UL56, colocalized with CD63 in very few vesicles only at 9 h postinfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). If HSV-2 exploited MVBs and/or late endosomes for assembly or release of virions, and if Nedd4 and UL56 were involved in the process, a greater amount of Nedd4 and UL56 should colocalize with CD63 as the infection proceeds. However, little colocalization was observed between CD63 and either UL56 or Nedd4 even at 12 h postinfection.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Nedd4 and UL56 colocalized to trans-Golgi network in HSV-2 infected cells</bold>.

In the previous study, we analyzed single-step growth kinetics of 'whole' viruses, which contained both extracellular- and intracellular-infectious virions. However, it is possible that UL56 plays a role in the intracellular transport and/or release of virions after formation of infectious virions. We thus investigated single-step growth kinetics of extracellular viruses in this study, and found that extracellular &#x00394;UL56Z showed statistically significant decreases in titers compared to wild-type viruses: at 12 h postinfection there was a 67.9% decrease, p = 0.02; at 24 h postinfection there was a 75.2% decrease, p &#x0003c; 0.001; at 36 h postinfection there was a 64.1% decrease, p = 0.04 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In contrast, regarding the 'whole' viruses, there was no statistically significant difference in growth between wild-type virus and &#x00394;UL56Z. These data suggest that, although infectious virions were produced in cells infected with &#x00394;UL56Z as efficiently as in those with wild type virus, virions were not efficiently transported and/or released from the cells infected with &#x00394;UL56Z.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Extracellular infectious viruses are decreased in the absence of UL56</bold>.

Moreover, UL56 relocalized the E3 ligase Nedd4 to the vesicles both in cells transiently expressing UL56 and in cells infected with HSV-2. We have also demonstrated that the amount of extracellular infectious viruses were reduced in the absence of UL56, suggesting a role for UL56 in the transport and/or release of virions.</p><p>The observation of vesicular distribution and active trafficking of UL56 supports the hypothesis that UL56 is involved in vesicular transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. UL56 relocalized Nedd4, a cytosolic E3 ligase, to vesicles. The unstable overlap between the localization of UL56 and that of Nedd4 suggests that the interaction of the two proteins is dynamic and transient. Given that Nedd4 participates in many cellular trafficking activities including protein sorting and viral budding, UL56 can regulate the function of Nedd4 by recruiting Nedd4 to substrates, without affecting its activity. Interestingly, Nedd4 family-interacting protein 2 (NDFIP2, N4WBP5A), a regulatory protein of Nedd4 family members, has been reported to relocalize Nedd4 to vesicular structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. NDFIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and NDFIP2 (NDFIPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and UL56 have several characteristics in common: transmembrane domains; three cytoplasmic PY motifs; interact with Nedd4; enhance the ubiquitination of Nedd4. Although NDFIPs are involved in membrane trafficking through MVB machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], UL56 showed no apparent localization to late endosomes/MVBs.</p><p>Newly synthesized HSV nucleocapsids exit from the nucleus by budding at the inner nuclear membrane and subsequently translocate into the cytoplasm by fusion of the primary envelope with the outer nuclear membrane. In the cytoplasm, nucleocapsids acquire additional teguments and then obtain their final envelope by budding into cytoplasmic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. TGN has been shown to be involved the generation of the final virion envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Primary localization of UL56 to TGN suggests that UL56, a tegument protein which is predicted to be inserted the envelope, is incorporated into virions at TGN. Trafficking of virions from TGN to the cell surface has not yet been elucidated. The MVB pathway is proposed as a possible pathway, because ESCRT machinery has been shown to facilitate HSV-1 final envelopment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In the present study, either UL56 or gG showed little or no localization to late endosome/MVBs. Therefore, our finding does not support the view that HSV uses the MVB pathway, but is consistent with a report that no HSV-1 particles are observed in MVBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. HSV might exploit the ESCRT system in a different way from that of cells. In fact, UL56 could be associated with ESCRT machinery in TGN, given that Nedd4 links viral proteins and the ESCRT system. Further investigation is needed to clarify the association between the ESCRT system and HSV-2 infection.</p><p>The growth kinetics of UL56-deficient virus gave rise to the view that UL56 functions in the transport and/or release of virions. UL56 is predicted to leave 216 amino acids out of 235 total amino acids in the tegument layer of virions and in the cytoplasm in infected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Active trafficking of transiently expressed UL56, which represents UL56 inserted into vesicular membranes in infected cells, leads us to propose the following model for UL56 function in viral replication. UL56 protruding from the limiting membrane of virion-containing vesicles to the cytoplasm interacts with other cellular and/or viral proteins, which are involved in membrane trafficking, transport or membrane fusion. This interaction facilitates the transport and/or release of virions. Nedd4 may also be involved in this process. In addition, our data on the growth kinetics of UL56-deficient virus do not exclude the possibility that UL56 functions in envelopment of nucleocapsids, because redundant viral proteins can cover some defects of UL56-deficient virus. The mechanism of tegumentation, final envelopment of nucleocapsids, transport and release of virions remains unclear despite many attempts, partially due to the high redundancy of viral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>A model of maturation, transport and release of HSV-2 virions</bold>. After exit from the nucleus, nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm acquire additional teguments and obtain the final envelope by budding into trans-Golgi network (TGN). Vesicles containing virions are transported to the cell surface and release virions by fusion with the plasma membrane. In the TGN, UL56 is incorporated into virions or remains in the limiting membrane of the vesicles. UL56 protrudes into the cytoplasm from the membrane of vesicles containing virions, and interacts with proteins which are involved in membrane trafficking, transport or membrane fusion. This interaction facilitates the transport and/or release of virions. Nedd4 can play some role in this process via its interaction with UL56.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-6-168-7"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides new insights into the function of HSV-2 UL56 in regulating E3 ligase Nedd4 and also in viral replication.
