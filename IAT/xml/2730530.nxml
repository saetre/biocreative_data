NMDA receptor (NMDAR)&#x02013;dependent LTD, an extensively studied form of LTD, involves the endocytosis of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) via protein dephosphorylation, but the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. We show here that a regulated interaction of the endocytic adaptor RalBP1 with two synaptic proteins, the small GTPase RalA and the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95, controls NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis during LTD. NMDAR activation stimulates RalA, which binds and translocates widespread RalBP1 to synapses. In addition, NMDAR activation dephosphorylates RalBP1, promoting the interaction of RalBP1 with PSD-95. These two regulated interactions are required for NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis and LTD and are sufficient to induce AMPAR endocytosis in the absence of NMDAR activation. RalA in the basal state, however, maintains surface AMPARs. We propose that NMDAR activation brings RalBP1 close to PSD-95 to promote the interaction of RalBP1-associated endocytic proteins with PSD-95-associated AMPARs. This suggests that scaffolding proteins at specialized cellular junctions can switch their function from maintenance to endocytosis of interacting membrane proteins in a regulated manner.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Neurons adapt over time in order to dampen their response to prolonged or particularly strong stimuli. This process, termed long-term depression (LTD), results in a long-lasting decrease in the efficiency of synaptic transmission. One extensively studied form of LTD requires the activation of a specific class of receptors known as NMDA glutamate receptors (NMDARs). A key molecular event initiated by NMDA receptor activation is the stimulation of protein phosphatases. Another key event is internalization via endocytosis of synaptic AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs). However, the mechanism by which protein dephosphorylation is coupled to AMPAR endocytosis has remained unclear. Here, we help to define this mechanism. We show that endocytic proteins, including RalBP1, are widely distributed in neurons under normal conditions. Upon NMDAR activation, the small GTPase RalA becomes activated and binds to RalBP1, resulting in the translocation of RalBP1 and RalBP1-associated endocytic proteins to synapses. At the same time, RalBP1 becomes dephosphorylated, which promotes its binding to the postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-95, a protein that itself associates with AMPARs. This concerted recruitment of endocytic proteins to the vicinity of AMPARs results in AMPAR endocytosis. On the basis of our data, we propose a model in which dual binding of RalBP1 to both RalA and PSD-95 following RalBP1 dephosphorylation is essential for NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis during LTD.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Long-term depression (LTD), a long-lasting activity-dependent decrease in synaptic strength, has been implicated in brain development, learning and memory, drug addiction, and mental retardation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000187-Malenka1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, RalBP1 knockdown in cultured neurons, or RalBP1 inhibition by overexpression of POB1 CC or phosphomimetic RalBP1 (TE), decreases NMDA-induced GluR2 endocytosis. RalBP1 knockdown in slice culture reduces LTD. Reduced RalBP1 expression in RalBP1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice suppresses LFS-induced LTD.

Activated RalA binds and translocates RalBP1 to dendritic spines. NMDA-induced AMPAR endocytosis is suppressed by knockdown of RalA, and inhibition of RalA by overexpression of RalBD and RalA (S28N). In slice culture, RalBD overexpression suppresses LTD.</p><p>How does RalA activation contribute to NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis? A straightforward possibility is that activated RalA binds and translocates RalBP1 and RalBP1-associated endocytic proteins to synapses, where target AMPARs are located. In addition, RalA-dependent translocation of RalBP1 to synapses might bring RalBP1 close to PSD-95, facilitating their predicted interaction and mediation of NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis. A previous study has reported that PP1 is recruited to synapses in response to NMDAR activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000187-Morishita1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, LTD-inducing NMDAR activation would seem to bring both enzyme (PP1) and substrate (RalBP1) together at synapses, enabling their functional interaction. RalA does not seem to affect other RalBP1 functions; in particular, the ability to interact with other proteins such as PSD-95 and POB1 is unchanged by RalA binding to RalBP1 (K.H., M.K., and E.K., unpublished data).</p><p>An important question for future study would be to determine how NMDAR activation leads to the activation of RalA.

These results suggest that NMDAR might activate RalA via Rap1.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>RalA and RalBP1 Act in Concert to Mediate NMDAR-Dependent AMPAR Endocytosis</title><p>Our data indicate that RalA and RalBP1 act together to mediate NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis. NMDAR activation induces both RalA activation and RalBP1 dephosphorylation. Spine translocation of RalBP1 induced by RalA is further enhanced by NMDA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000187-g004">Figure 4</xref>), which results in dephosphorylation of RalBP1. Therefore, synaptic localization of RalBP1 seems to be mediated by a dual mechanism involving the regulated binding of RalBP1 to both RalA and PSD-95; these processes require RalA activation and RalBP1 dephosphorylation, respectively.</p><p>Our data also indicate that both RalA and RalBP1 are necessary and sufficient to mediate NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis. In support of this, RalA activation combined with RalBP1 binding to PSD-95 is sufficient to reduce surface AMPAR levels in the absence of NMDAR activation; it also occludes the NMDA-induced reduction in surface AMPAR levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000187-g008">Figure 8</xref>). However, RalA alone (RalA G23V alone or RalA G23V cotransfected with RalBP1 &#x00394;C) or RalBP1 alone (RalBP1 WT cotransfected with RalA WT) is not sufficient to reduce surface AMPAR levels. In addition, RalA G23V alone does not occlude the NMDA-induced reduction in surface AMPAR levels. The requirement for these two mechanisms&#x02014;RalA activation and RalBP1 dephosphorylation&#x02014;in NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis suggests that these two events may function as a dual-key mechanism that protects against AMPAR endocytosis under conditions in which only a single criterion is fulfilled.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Hippocalcin, RalBP1, and RalA</title><p>Hippocalcin, which binds calcium as well as AP2 (&#x003b2;2 adaptin), is translocated to the synaptic plasma membrane via the calcium-myristoyl switch to mediate NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis during LTD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000187-Palmer2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. RalBP1 is similar to hippocalcin in that it directly interacts with AP2 (&#x003bc;2 subunit), but it differs from hippocalcin in that it does not have a calcium-sensing activity. Another difference between hippocalcin and RalBP1 is that RalBP1 can be dephosphorylated by NMDAR activation.</p><p>An interesting question is whether and how these two pathways (hippocalcin and RalBP1), which are calcium-dependent and phosphatase (PP1)-dependent, respectively, act together to mediate NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis during LTD. Both hippocalcin and RalBP1 interact with AP2, so it is possible that AP2 may function as a point of crosstalk or convergence between the two pathways. It is conceivable that AP2 and AP2-associated endocytic proteins may be more efficiently translocated to the synaptic plasma membrane by interacting with both hippocalcin and RalBP1.</p><p>Lastly, our study has two general implications. Our study provides the first specific mechanism for the general question of how the interaction of activated RalA with RalBP1 is coupled to the endocytosis of target membrane proteins. That is, in our case, the direct interaction of dephosphorylated RalBP1 with a scaffolding protein that is coupled to target membrane proteins. Secondly, our results suggest that scaffolding proteins can switch their functions from the maintenance to regulated endocytosis of interacting membrane proteins. This principle may be applicable to diverse scaffolding proteins that are in association with membrane proteins including receptors, channels, transporters, and adhesion molecules.</p><p>In conclusion, our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that the dual and regulated binding of RalBP1 with RalA and PSD-95 mediates AMPAR endocytosis during NMDAR-dependent LTD. Possible directions for future studies include investigation of detailed upstream and downstream mechanisms of this regulated tripartite interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>cDNA Constructs</title><p>Full-length RalBP1, human (aa 1&#x02013;655) and rat (aa 1&#x02013;647) amplified from brain cDNA libraries (Clontech), and RalBP1 variants (&#x00394;C, aa 1&#x02013;651 and T653E; human) were subcloned into GW1 (British Biotechnology), pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech), p3XFLAG-CMV-7.1 (Sigma), and YFP-FKBP (from Tobias Meyer).

Picrotoxin (100 &#x000b5;M) was used to inhibit IPSCs. EPSCs were evoked (0.05 Hz) with ACSF-filled glass pipette (0.3&#x0223c;0.5 M&#x003a9;) placed in stratum radiatum. Mean AMPAR/NMDAR currents were obtained by averaging 30&#x02013;40 traces recorded at the holding potential of &#x02212;70 mV or &#x0002b;40 mV. NMDAR currents were isolated by NBQX (20 &#x000b5;M). mEPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of &#x02212;60 mV with TTX (1 &#x000b5;M) in ACSF. For extracellular recordings, submerged slices were evoked at 0.05 Hz with a stimulation intensity that yields a half-maximal response. Homosynaptic LTD was induced by delivering 900 stimulations (1 Hz), and LTP was induced by four episodes (0.1 Hz) of TBS. mGluR-dependent LTD was induced by paired-pulse stimulation (50 ms interstimulus interval) repeated at 1 Hz for 15 min (for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000187-g005">Figure 5</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000187-Huber1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, or by DHPG application (for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000187-g010">Figure 10</xref>).
