Surprisingly, we found that RUNX3 expression level in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues, which is one of the most common types of human cancer, was higher than that in normal tissues by a previously published microarray dataset in our preliminary study. Therefore, here we examined the oncogenic role of RUNX3 in HNSCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Frequent RUNX3 expression and its correlation with malignant behavior were observed in HNSCC. Ectopic RUNX3 overexpression promoted cell growth and inhibited serum starvation-induced apoptosis and chemotherapeutic drug induced apoptosis in HNSCC cells. These findings were confirmed by RUNX3 knockdown. Moreover, RUNX3 overexpression enhanced tumorsphere formation. RUNX3 expression level was well correlated with the methylation status in HNSCC cells. Moreover, RUNX3 expression was low due to the methylation of its promoter in normal oral epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our findings suggest that i) RUNX3 has an oncogenic role in HNSCC, ii) RUNX3 expression observed in HNSCC may be caused in part by demethylation during cancer development, and iii) RUNX3 expression can be a useful marker for predicting malignant behavior and the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs in HNSCC.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>RUNX3/AML2/PEBP2C/CBFA3 is a transcription factor and one of the Runt-related (RUNX) family.

As shown in recent report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-SaltoTellez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, epidermal cells also showed RUNX3 expression in its nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, upper panel). We also examined the RUNX3 expression in colon cancer. In colon cancer, RUNX3 is thought to be a tumor suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

In normal oral mucosal tissues, only a few epithelial cells in basal layer slightly expressed RUNX3 in their nuclei, and most epithelial cells did not express (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, middle panel). Lymphocytes infiltrating into normal oral mucosa showed RUNX3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, lower panel). Immunopositivity of RUNX3 in lymphocytes was used as a positive control of staining. On the other hand, most cancer cells expressed RUNX3 in their nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We also confirmed that nuclear expression of RUNX3 by using nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction of HNSCC cell lines, indicating no protein mislocalization (data not shown).

These findings made us hypothesize that <italic>RUNX3</italic> might be silenced by methylation in adult oral epithelial cells. Oral mucosal tissue usually contains connective tissue and infiltrating lymphocytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g002">Figure 2A</xref> (lower panel), lymphocytes infiltrating into normal oral mucosa showed RUNX3 expression. Therefore, we used primary cultured epithelial cells obtained from normal oral epithelium in this study for avoiding contamination of lymphocytes. In similar to immunohistochemical studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), 4 primary cultured epithelial cells obtained from normal oral epithelium (#1&#x02013;#4) did not express RUNX3 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that expression level of RUNX3 is low or absent in adult normal oral epithelium.

Interestingly, RUNX3 overexpression enhanced cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). At 6day, number of RUNX3 overexpressing cells was remarkably higher than that of control cells. Although we examined migration and invasion, RUNX3 overexpression did not promote migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005892.s004">Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, increased population corresponding to sub-G1 after serum starvation was observed only in control cells, but not in RUNX3 overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). To demonstrate whether this increment of sub-G1 detected in control cells after serum starvation is due to apoptosis, the level of apoptosis was assessed by using annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Annexin V/propidium iodide double-positive cells were observed in 1.8&#x00025; of RUNX3 overexpressing cells, while in 21.7&#x00025; of control cells, indicating that RUNX3 overexpression inhibited serum starvation induced apoptosis. To confirm these phenotypes, we examined the knockdown of RUNX3 in Ca9-22 cells, which showed RUNX3 overexpression and were resistant to serum starvation-induced apoptosis. For knockdown of RUNX3, we used three different siRNAs (si-RUNX3-1, si-RUNX3-2 and si-RUNX3-3) and their cocktail. RUNX3 expression was remarkably silenced by si-RUNX3-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005892.s005">Figure S3A</xref>). Therefore, we used si-RUNX3-1 for the following studies. RUNX3 siRNA transfection reduced the expression of RUNX3 mRNA and protein in Ca9-22 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

HNSCC cell line, HOC621 cells with lower expression of RUNX3 mRNA were treated with growth factors including TGF-&#x000df;1, IGF, EGF, bFGF and PDGF-AA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005892.s008">Figure S6A</xref>). Among these growth factors, EGF significantly enhanced RUNX3 expression in HOC621 cells. EGF enhanced RUNX3 expression in concentration and time dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005892.s008">Figure S6B</xref>). However, RUNX3 expression was not induced by growth factor stimulation in other HNSCC cells without RUNX3 expression due to methylation (data not shown). Moreover, we examined the expression of EGF and EGFR and compared with RUNX3 expression. Interestingly, EGF expression was well correlated with RUNX3 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005892.s008">Figure S6C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>RUNX3 is inactivated in more than 80&#x00025; of human gastric cancer by CpG island hypermethylation, protein mislocalization and point mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Li1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Kim1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, it has been reported that reduced expression of RUNX3 was observed in various cancers including bladder, liver, colon and lung cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Kim1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Yanada1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, gastric mucosa of Runx3-null mice develops hyperplasia due to the stimulated proliferation and suppressed apoptosis of epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Li1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, RUNX3 acts as a tumor suppressor in various cancers. In this study, we confirmed the low expression of RUNX3 in various cancer cell lines by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Expression level of RUNX3 was well correlated with methylation status, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Cheng1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Lau1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. By immunohistochemistry, RUNX3 expression was observed in normal colon mucosa, while cancer cells did not express RUNX3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005892.s003">Figure S1</xref>). Contrary to these tumors, here we found oncogenic roles for RUNX3 in HNSCC. It recently has been shown that RUNX3 overexpression was observed in basal cell carcinoma of skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-SaltoTellez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This distinct role in HNSCC and skin basal cell carcinoma may be accounted for by the pathogenesis of both types of cancer, which arise from squamous epithelium. In fact, RUNX3 frequency of RUNX3 positive cells is low in adult skin and oral mucosa, while most cancer cells expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g002">Figure 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-SaltoTellez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Overexpression of RUNX3 has previously been associated with functional mutations or protein mislocalization in breast, gastric and bladder tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Ito2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Kim1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, functional mutations or protein mislocalization were not found in HNSCC, indicating that RUNX3 is fully functional in HNSCC cells. All members of the RUNX family, most notably Runx2, are known to promote tumorigenecity in mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Cameronm1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Yanagida1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, RUNX3 overexpression promoted cell proliferation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g005">5B</xref>, RUNX3 overexpression or knockdown affected to the cell growth from 4 day after plating. Therefore, RUNX3 may be involved in allowance for high cell density in addition to stimulation of cell growth. Moreover, RUNX3 overexpression inhibited serum starvation induced apoptosis and chemotherapeutic drug induced apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> in HNSCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g004">Figures 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g005"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g006">6</xref>). Interestingly, RUNX3 overexpression promoted tumorigenesis, demonstrated by tumorsphere formation assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005892.s006">Figure S4</xref>). These findings may be implicated in RUNX3 related malignant behaviors of HNSCC including invasiveness and metastasis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005892-t001">Table 1</xref>). Comparing the gene expression profile between control and RUNX3 overexpressing HNSCC cells revealed that several genes were selectively up-regulated and down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005892.s002">Table S2</xref>). CXCL14, IGFBP2 and EphA4 receptor were up-regulated, and fibronectin 1 was down-regulated in RUNX3 overexpressing HNSCC cells. Although CXCL14 suppresses tumor growth in some type of cancer, CXCL14 is involved in invasion of pancreatic cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Wente1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, IGFBP-2 is a highly sensitive marker of malignant progression in different tumors and potentially involved in anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis during cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Hoeflich1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. EphA4 receptor also promotes cancer cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Iiizumi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, classification into gene ontology categories according to involvement in different biological processes showed that several genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle were up-regulated by RUNX3 overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005892.s007">Figure S5</xref>). It is interesting to examine the correlation between RUNX3 and these molecules. The findings identified by microarray analysis may help future experiments for clarifying the detailed role of RUNX3 in the development of HNSCC.</p><p>DNA methylation plays an important role in the establishment and maintenance of the program of gene expression. The pattern of 5-methylcytosine distribution in the genome is unique for each cell type and is established in embryogenesis as a result of balance between DNA methylation and demethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Razin1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Razin2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. It recently has been revealed that Runx3 is expressed in the tongue and palate epithelium of mouse embryos and Runx3 expression disappears in newborn mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Lau1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we also confirmed that Runx3 expression was observed in tongue epithelium of embryo, but not in adult tongue epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, we demonstrated that <italic>RUNX3</italic> methylation of its promoter region was observed in normal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g003">Figure 3H and 3I</xref>), suggesting that RUNX3 may be silenced by methylation in adult normal oral epithelium. However, there may be another possibility, such as transcriptional modulation by traditional activators or repressors, in addition to the regulation of RUNX3 expression by methylation. Moreover, methylation of its promoter region was observed in HNSCC cells without RUNX3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). Therefore, these findings indicate that RUNX3 expression in HNSCC may be caused by demethylation during cancer development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005892-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In malignant tumor, the level of general demethylation and the frequency of demethylation increase with tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-GamaSosa1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Kim3">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, and demethylation of individual CpG dinucleotides located in C-MYC, Ha RAS, and ERB-A1 proto-oncogene was revealed in human tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Borrello1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005892-Lipsanen1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

We treated growth factors such as TGF-&#x000df;1, IGF, EGF, bFGF, and PDGF-AA in HNSCC cells with RUNX3 expression and found that EGF enhanced RUNX3 expression.
