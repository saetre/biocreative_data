Caused by total or partial trisomy of chromosome 21, it appears associated with more than 80 clinical traits, including typical facial features, anomalies of the intestinal tract, muscular hypotonia, increased risk of leukemia, congenital heart defects and mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c3">3</xref>). Currently, despite remarkable efforts, the molecular basis of DS is not well understood. According to the gene-dosage effect hypothesis, the imbalance of a single gene or group of genes in the trisomic region is responsible for a particular DS feature. This could be either a direct or an indirect effect, through the altered expression of genes located on other chromosomes. A direct approach to the molecular basis of DS involves the identification and functional characterization of chromosome 21 genes. To this end, the recent completion of the 21 chromosome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c4">4</xref>) was a crucial contribution and has allowed the subsequent identification and systematic expression analysis of many chromosome 21-gene orthologs in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c6">6</xref>). A promising alternative strategy aims to identify differentially expressed genes irrespective of their chromosomal location. In this respect, reported methodologies include subtractive hybridization (SH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c11">11</xref>), serial analysis of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c12">12</xref>), differential display PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c14">14</xref>) and micro-array based analyses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c15">15</xref>). To date, several differentially expressed genes in DS individuals have been reported. Some of them are located on chromosome 21, such as Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (<italic>SOD1</italic>), encoding a key enzyme in the metabolism of oxygen free radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c17">17</xref>), and the gene for the amyloid precursor protein (<italic>APP</italic>), implicated in DS-associated early-onset Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c18">18</xref>). Others that have shown altered expression in DS have been located on other chromosomes, such as <italic>TRX</italic> (involved in cell oxidative status), <italic>XRCC1</italic> (repair functions) and dynamin (neural tissue development) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c19">19</xref>). Recently, another approach to identify differentially expressed genes based on a transcriptome analysis of a partial trisomy 16 mouse model of DS was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c20">20</xref>).</p><p>Mental retardation is a universal phenotypic feature of DS. Thus, we focused on differential gene expression in fetal brains and performed suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). Our results, verified by real-time PCR, clearly showed DS-associated overexpression of fatty acid-binding protein 7 (<italic>FABP7</italic>). This gene, also named brain fatty acid-binding protein (<italic>BFABP</italic>) or brain lipid binding protein (<italic>BLBP</italic>), had been previously characterized and located at 6q22&#x02013;23 by FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are small peptides (14&#x02013;16 kDa), previously named according to the tissue of origin. At least nine FABP forms, each encoded by a different gene, have been characterized (brain or retina, liver, heart or muscle, intestine, epidermis, adipocyte, ileum, myelin and testis). Most family members (including FABP7) show dual cytoplasmic and nuclear localization, thus supporting their involvement in the uptake, storage and/or delivery of fatty acids and retinoids into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c27">27</xref>). In particular, <italic>FABP7</italic> is expressed in radial glial cells and immature astrocytes of the developing central nervous system and later becomes restricted to the glia limitans, radial glial cells of the hippocampus and Bergmann glial cells in the adult mouse brain. This expression pattern is consistent with its predicted role in the organization and maintenance of the radial glial fiber system required for the correct migration of immature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c22">22</xref>). More recently, <italic>FABP7</italic> expression in a subtype of radial glial precursor cells during neuro- and glio-genesis in the developing cerebral cortex has been correlated to the fate of their progeny and considered a marker for multipotentiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c28">28</xref>). Besides, FABP7 shows high affinity for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the most abundant polyunsaturated long chain fatty acid in the brain phospholipid pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c29">29</xref>). Deficiencies in DHA cause severe and progressive neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c31">31</xref>).</p><p>To understand the molecular basis of <italic>FABP7</italic> overexpression in DS we have undertaken a functional analysis of its promoter region. In the <italic>Fabp7</italic> murine counterpart three distinct regulatory elements have been highlighted: a radial glial specific element (RGE, located at &#x02013;800 to &#x02013;300 bp); a sequence controlling <italic>Fabp7</italic> expression in dorsal root ganglion and notochord (DRGE, located at &#x02013;800 to &#x02013;1200 bp); a silencer for transcriptional suppression in dorsal spinal cord (DSCS, located at &#x02013;1200 to &#x02013;1600 bp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c32">32</xref>). The region spanning &#x02013;800 to &#x02013;300 bp is necessary and sufficient for developmentally regulated expression throughout the fetal CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c32">32</xref>), and it contains a hybrid Pbx/POU binding site (&#x02013;370 to &#x02013;362 bp), recognized by PBX-1, BRN-1 and BRN-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c33">33</xref>). PBX transcription factors (PBX1, PBX2 and PBX3) are homeobox proteins that form stable heterodimeric complexes with other homeobox-containing proteins, such as HOX and PREP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c41">41</xref>). Depending on the partner, the PBX-containing complexes display differential affinities for binding promoter motifs, even with antagonistic properties. Several genes, such as the urokinase plasminogen activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c35">35</xref>), somatostatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c37">37</xref>), glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c40">40</xref>) and alpha 2(V) collagen (<italic>COL5A2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c41">41</xref>) are regulated by PREP1/PBX heterodimeric complexes. Interestingly, the human <italic>PREP1</italic> (Pbx regulating protein 1) ortholog, named <italic>PKNOX1</italic> (Pbx/knotted homeobox1), is located on chromosome 21q22.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c43">43</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that the Pbx/POU binding site in the human <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter is conserved and we provide evidence of PKNOX1 involvement in <italic>FABP7</italic> transcriptional regulation, thus indicating a direct link between trisomy 21 and <italic>FABP7</italic> overexpression. DS brain abnormalities include functional disturbances in glial cells, delayed myelination and diminished neuronal density in the brain cortex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c44">44</xref>). As FABP7 function is necessary for neuro- and glio-genesis, particularly for the establishment of the glial fibers and the proper migration of immature neurons to cortical layers, we suggest that overexpression of <italic>FABP7</italic> may contribute to the DS-associated neurological disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Samples</title><p>Twenty-two male fetal half-brains obtained from pregnancy weeks 18&#x02013;23 were used in this study.

In the murine promoter, the region stretching from &#x02013;300 to &#x02013;800 bp is necessary and sufficient for developmentally regulated expression throughout the fetal CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c32">32</xref>). Two domains have been described within this region: a hormone-responsive element (HRE) and a Pbx/POU binding site (&#x02013;370 to &#x02013;362 bp).</p><p>Since the human genomic sequence of this promoter was then not available, an inverse PCR was devised to isolate and clone this genomic fragment. Genomic DNA was digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI, diluted and ligated to produce circular molecules. For the PCR, the reverse primer was complementary to the initial ATG codon, while the forward primer contained part of the first exon downstream the ATG. The PCR consistently amplified a 2.7-kb band, which was subsequently cloned and sequenced. The amplified fragment encompassed 1.8 kb of a sequence highly homologous to the <italic>Fabp7</italic> mouse promoter (the nucleotide sequence for the human <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter has been deposited in the GenBank database under GenBank accession no. AY070217) and 0.9 kb containing the first and second <italic>FABP7</italic> exons plus some intron sequences. The alignment between the human and mouse regions revealed that all the murine regulatory elements were conserved in the human promoter, including the presumptive Pbx/POU binding site at a similar location (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PKNOX1, a PBX partner, is overexpressed in DS</title><p>One of the reported PBX partners is encoded by the <italic>PKNOX1</italic> gene (<italic>PREP1</italic> in mice), located on chromosome 21q22.3. We postulated that if PKNOX1 binds and trans-activates the human <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter through a PBX/PKNOX1 complex, <italic>FABP7</italic> overexpression in DS brains will be directly correlated to the gene-dosage imbalance caused by the 21 trisomy. To test this hypothesis, we assessed <italic>PKNOX1</italic> overexpression in DS fetal brains, and performed the specific binding assay of PKNOX1 to the <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter.</p><p>Real-time PCR in eight male fetal brain samples (four disomic and four trisomic) showed 1.88-fold overexpression of <italic>PKNOX1</italic> in DS fetal brain samples with respect to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PKNOX1 binds weakly to the Pbx/POU motif of the <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter</title><p>We assessed PKNOX1 binding to the Pbx/POU site in the human <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter by <italic>in vitro</italic> EMSAs. To this end, recombinant PKNOX1 protein was purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> cells expressing a GST&#x02013;PKNOX1 fusion construct. In addition, we designed two probes derived from the <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f2">2</xref>): (i) a 30-bp ds oligonucleotide encompassing the Pbx/POU (ATCAATCtg) site (wt probe); (ii) the same sequence without the Pbx/POU target site (del probe, 21 bp).</p><p>A retarded band appeared only when high amounts (1.25 &#x000b5;g) of recombinant PKNOX1 were added to the binding mixture with the wt probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f3">3</xref>, lane 3). However, no bands were detected with the deleted Pbx/POU probe in the same conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f3">3</xref>, lane 6). These <italic>in vitro</italic> assays revealed that PKNOX1 binds to the reported site, but only under protein excess conditions. This is consistent with previous reports showing that, on their own, murine PREP1 (the PKNOX1 ortholog) and its PBX partners bind the DNA target weakly. In contrast, the formation of a PBX/PREP1 complex drastically increases the DNA-binding affinity of both subunits and broadens the DNA target selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c35">35</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PKNOX1 complexes from SH-SY5Y nuclear extracts bind to the Pbx/POU motif of the <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter</title><p>In order to provide the partners required for the formation of PKNOX1 complexes, nuclear protein extracts from human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were added to a new set of EMSAs. On their own, SH-SY5Y nuclear extracts produced retarded bands, indicating that they contained several proteins that could bind the probe. The two most prominent bands are indicated by arrows (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f4">4</xref>A, lane 3). The banding pattern was not affected when PKNOX1 was added to the binding mixture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f4">4</xref>A, lane 4 compared to lane 3), which could be explained by the presence of endogenous PKNOX1 in SH-SY5Y cells (as previously assessed by western analysis; data not shown). The specificity of the binding was confirmed by competition with cold Pbx/POU wt probe (at 100-, 1,000- and 10 000-fold molar excess) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f4">4</xref>A, lanes 5&#x02013;7) and the absence of competition with the non-specific GRE oligonucleotide (10&#x02009;000-fold molar excess) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f4">4</xref>A, lane 8). The oligonucleotide lacking the Pbx/POU site (del probe) did not compete out any of the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes, which highlighted the relevance of this 9-bp motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f4">4</xref>B).</p><p>Further EMSAs were performed to establish the contribution of PKNOX1 to the protein binding complexes. This was shown by preincubation of the binding mixture with an anti-PKNOX1 (anti-PREP1) antibody. This addition abolished the formation of the two specific complexes, while an unrelated antibody (anti-GST antibody) had no effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f4">4</xref>C). Again, the pattern was not affected by the addition of the del probe at 10 000-fold molar excess (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f4">4</xref>C, lane 7). Moreover, to confirm PKNOX1 binding to the 9-bp core of the Pbx/POU site, the wt and del probes were labeled and used in new EMSAs. The patterns obtained were compared in the presence or absence of the anti-PKNOX1 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f4">4</xref>D). As expected, if PKNOX1 specifically recognized this site, no retarded bands appeared with the del probe and addition of the anti-PKNOX1 antibody had no effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f4">4</xref>D, lanes 3 and 5).</p><p>Overall, these <italic>in vitro</italic> data support: (i) PKNOX1 binding to the Pbx/POU target of the <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter; (ii) that this binding is greatly enhanced by PKNOX1 assembling into a functional complex with partners of the nuclear extracts.</p></sec><sec><title>PKNOX1 trans-activates <italic>FABP7 in vivo</italic></title><p>Next, we analyzed the effect of PKNOX1 on the regulation of <italic>FABP7</italic> transcription. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were transiently co-transfected with a vector constitutively expressing recombinant PKNOX1 and also, a reporter construct bearing the luciferase gene under the control of the <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter. In addition, a &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter construct was added to the liposome&#x02013;DNA mixture to normalize the transfection efficiency. The ratio of the luciferase/&#x003b2;-gal activities allowed both comparison between samples and quantification of transcription trans-activation in arbitrary units. According to our data <italic>PKNOX1</italic> overexpression induced luciferase expression by 3.7-fold (statistical significance, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, Mann&#x02013;Whitney test) and therefore, PKNOX1 did trans-activate the <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f5">5</xref>). In addition, the deletion of the 9-bp Pbx/POU motif by site-directed mutagenesis decreased the trans-activation response of this promoter to PKNOX1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg396f5">5</xref>). It should be noted that the deletion of the Pbx/POU target increased the basal transcription of the promoter by 1.5-fold and, thus, the effect of the addition of PKNOX1 on the deleted promoter may appear higher than it really was &#x0005b;2.2-fold increase if compared to the wild-type promoter but only 1.4-fold if compared to the basal expression of the mutant promoter without added PKNOX1 (statistical significance <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, Mann&#x02013;Whitney test)&#x0005d;.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The search for differentially expressed genes is a promising strategy to explore the molecular basis of the DS pathogenesis. We focused on DS fetal brains because of the high prevalence of mental retardation, albeit with great differences in the level of severity, in affected individuals. The SSH approach revealed overexpression of <italic>FABP7</italic> (located at 6q22&#x02013;23) in DS fetal brains, which was further verified and quantified by real-time PCR (1.63-fold) in a total of 22 samples. These data support that, far from gross alterations in the transcription levels of a few specific genes, most differences between trisomic and disomic individuals stem from moderate changes in the expression of many genes, as reported in a partial trisomy 16 mouse model of DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c20">20</xref>).</p><p>Several data support the relevance of <italic>FABP7</italic> overexpression in mental retardation. First, FABP7 is involved in the development, establishment and maintenance of the nervous system, mainly setting the grounds for proper neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c22">22</xref>). Secondly, the expression of <italic>FABP7</italic> during neuro- and glio-genesis correlates with the fate of the progeny of radial glial precursor cells, since it is one of the markers that define multipotential precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c28">28</xref>). Thirdly, DHA is the putative ligand of FABP7 and, as already established, DHA deficiencies cause severe neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c31">31</xref>). Hence, we aimed at the functional characterization of the <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter to elucidate the molecular basis of its DS-associated overexpression. In particular, among the regulatory elements described on the murine promoter, we considered the Pbx/POU target site as the best candidate, because PBX factors form heterodimers with PREP1, whose human homolog gene, <italic>PKNOX1</italic>, is located on chromosome 21.</p><p>EMSAs with the recombinant PKNOX1 protein alone produced a weak band shift, and only under protein excess conditions, in accordance with previous reports showing that mouse PREP1 binds weakly to DNA and that high-affinity binding could only be attained when heterodimers with PBX and/or other partners were assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c35">35</xref>). The most revealing data were achieved when using neuroblastoma nuclear protein extracts, which express both endogenous PKNOX1 and the partners required for the binding complexes. Two main bands were detected, which were specifically competed by cold wt oligonucleotide but not by the mutated del probe, lacking the Pbx/POU binding site. Moreover, the addition of an anti-PKNOX1 antibody specifically disrupted the binding of these complexes, thus clearly implicating PKNOX1 involvement. Other reports have identified PREP1 as a partner in several DNA binding complexes when the same anti-PREP1/PKNOX1 antibody (sc-6245) was used to disrupt them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg396c40">40</xref>). Overall, these results are consistent with PKNOX1 specifically binding to the reported Pbx/POU site by assembling into at least two heteromeric complexes.</p><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> data were confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> by cell transfection assays, where <italic>PKNOX1</italic> overexpression increased transcription from the <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter by 3.7-fold. Again, specific binding of PKNOX1 to the Pbx/POU defined site was later confirmed, as the 9-bp target site deletion clearly decreased PKNOX1-dependent trans-activation. The finding that addition of PKNOX1 slightly trans-activated the mutant promoter suggests additional PKNOX1 target(s) in this promoter, without demeaning the relevance of the deleted site.</p><p>In summary, the <italic>in vitro</italic> EMSAs as well as the luciferase assays in live cells, strongly support a direct relationship between <italic>PKNOX1</italic>, at 21q22.3, and the <italic>FABP7</italic> expression, at 6q22&#x02013;23. PKNOX1 is known to interact with the PBX factors and the complexes formed regulate the expression of different genes. We here show the ability of PKNOX1 to bind to the Pbx/POU site at the <italic>FABP7</italic> promoter and, thus, regulate <italic>FABP7</italic> transcription. If PKNOX1 is a limiting factor in certain tissues, three allelic doses may significantly affect the level of transcription of target genes. To our knowledge, this is the first report directly relating the dosage imbalance of a particular chromosome 21 gene to altered expression of a downstream gene. As DS brains suffer from widespread abnormalities in neuronal cytoarchitecture and function (including disturbances in glial cell function, delayed myelination and diminished neuronal density in cortical layers), and FABP7 plays a crucial role in the establishment of the radial glial fiber system required for the migration of immature neurons to the brain cortex, we postulate that <italic>FABP7</italic> overexpression may contribute to, or even enhance the DS-associated neurological disorders.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg396f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Average expression of <italic>FABP7</italic> and other chromosome 21 genes (<italic>PKNOX1</italic>, <italic>SOD1</italic> and <italic>USP25</italic>) in control and DS fetal brains, as detected by real-time PCR.
