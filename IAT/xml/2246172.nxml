In our previous study, differential expression of peroxiredoxin 6 was found between the highly metastatic MDA-MB-435HM cells and their parental counterparts, MDA-MB-435 cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of peroxiredoxin 6 on the proliferation and metastatic potential of human breast cancer cells and their potential mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Expression of peroxiredoxin 6 in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231HM cells was investigated by RT-PCR, real-time PCR and western blot. A recombinant expression plasmid of the human peroxiredoxin 6 gene was constructed and transfected into MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells. The effects of peroxiredoxin 6 on the proliferation and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were investigated by the Cell Counting Kit-8 method, colony-formation assay, adhesion assay, flow cytometry and invasion assay <italic>in vitro</italic>. miRNA was used to downregulate the expression of peroxiredoxin 6.

Upregulation of peroxiredoxin 6 enhanced the <italic>in vitro </italic>proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. The enhancement was associated with decreasing levels of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 and increasing levels of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), Ets-1 (E26 transformation-specific-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and RhoC (ras homolog gene family, member C) expression.

The vast majority of these deaths are owing to metastasis. Although a number of significant advances have been made, the molecular mechanisms contributing to progression of breast cancer are poorly understood.</p><p>In our previous study, a novel breast cancer cell line that was derived from six cycles of pulmonary metastasis implantation into the mammary fat pad (MFP), designated MDA-MB-435HM (high metastasis (HM)), displayed significantly enhanced pulmonary metastatic potential compared with its parental counterparts, MDA-MB-435 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Recently, another novel, highly metastatic MDA-MB-231HM cell line, derived from MDA-MB-231 cells, was also established and maintained using the same methods. These cells provide appropriate model systems, with a similar genetic background, for the comparative study of the molecular events involved in pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer.</p><p>In the postgenome era, global strategies are being developed to identify new components of complex biological processes, such as tumor cell metastasis. Proteomics enable the analysis of thousands of modified or unmodified proteins simultaneously and has become increasingly popular for identifying biomarkers for early detection, classification and prognosis of tumors, in addition to pinpointing targets for improved treatment outcomes. Our institute had used this approach to identify eleven proteins differentially expressed between the MDA-MB-435HM cells and their parental counterparts, MDA-MB-435 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Some of these proteins, including peroxiredoxin (PRDX) 6, were not described previously in breast cancer metastasis. A significant association between PRDX6 staining and the presence of lymph-node metastasis in 80 breast cancer donors was also observed. However, we do not know whether PRDX6 is an instigator of metastasis or merely a correlative product during progression of breast cancer.</p><p>PRDX6 is a bifunctional 25 kDa protein with both GSH (Glutathione) peroxidase and phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>activities. PRDX6 is expressed in many organs, with a particularly high level of expression in the lungs; its peroxidase activity was first demonstrated for protein isolated from the ciliary body of the bovine eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Subsequently, a human cDNA that encodes this protein was identified by random cloning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The same protein was subsequently isolated from rat lung as a calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)-independent phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>. Studies with recombinant proteins confirmed both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and peroxidase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>PRDX6 is an important antioxidant enzyme and has a major role in lung phospholipid metabolism. Manevich and Fisher found that PRDX6 was stably overexpressed in cells protected against oxidative stress, whereas antisense treatment resulted in oxidant stress and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. They postulated that PRDX6 functions in antioxidant defense mainly by facilitated repair of damaged cell membranes through reduction of peroxidized phospholipids. The phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>activity of PRDX6 is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent and maximal at acidic pH. Inhibition of phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>activity results in alterations of lung-surfactant phospholipid synthesis and turnover. However, the role of PRDX6 in breast cancers remains unknown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and animals</title><p>Human MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were bought from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). The highly metastatic MDA-MB-231HM cell line was established by our institute. Both MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells were routinely maintained in Leibovitz's L-15 medium with 2 mM of L-glutamine at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of streptomycin. The medium was changed every 2 to 3 days, and cells were subcultured by treatment with 0.25% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) solution. Female athymic BALB/c-<italic>nu</italic>/<italic>nu </italic>mice, 4 to 6 weeks' old, were obtained from the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and housed in laminar-flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions, with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. All experiments on mice were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of National Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, MD, USA) for the care and use of laboratory animals. The study protocol was also approved by Shanghai Medical Experimental Animal Care Committee (China).</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR and western blot analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Reagent (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) and RT-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). Gene-specific primers for the human PRDX6 gene (forward, 5'-TCATGGGGCATTCTCTTCTC-3'; reverse, 5'-TCTTCTTCAGGGATGGTTGG-3'; 497 bps) were synthesized at Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering &#x00026; Technology Services Co. (Shanghai, China). PCR products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and imaged on an Alpha Image 950 documentation system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA, USA). All experiments were repeated at least three times, and the GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene (forward, 5'-GGGAGCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTC-3'; reverse, 5'-CCATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTC-3'; 353 bps) was chosen as an internal control.</p><p>To quantitatively determine the level of mRNA expression of the PRDX6, cDNA templates of the cells were amplified by real-time quantitative PCR. The reaction was performed using the DNA Engine Opticon&#x02122; 2 real-time PCR detection system (MJ Research, Watertown, MA, USA) with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes Inc, Eugene, OR, USA). GAPDH was chosen as an internal control. The Opticon&#x02122; 2 apparatus was used to measure the fluorescence of each sample in every cycle at the end of the extension, and the comparative threshold cycle (2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>cT</italic></sup>) method was used to enable quantification of the mRNA of these genes. All samples were run in triplicate. After PCR, a melting curve was obtained and analyzed.</p><p>Western blot analysis was performed according to the previous method, with some modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Briefly, proteins were extracted from the cultured cells and then quantitated using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), with BSA as a standard. Equal amounts of protein (50 &#x003bc;g) from different cells were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then incubated with mouse antihuman monoclonal antibodies against PRDX6 (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA, USA). Target proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and exposure to Biomax ML film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA). Images were captured by Alpha Image 950 documentation system and analyzed by NIH Image version 1.62 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The relative protein level in different cell lines was normalized to the signal intensity of &#x003b2;-actin, as an internal control.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of a human peroxiredoxin 6 expression vector and stable transfections</title><p>A human PRDX6 expression vector was constructed using the pcDNA&#x02122; 3.1 Directional TOPO<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Expression Kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To construct the human PRDX6 expression vector, the entire open-reading frame (ORF) of the human PRDX6 gene (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="D14662">D14662</ext-link>) was amplified from the recombinant plasmid vector pBlueScript II SK(+), in which the full-length KIAA0106 cDNA had been inserted (kindly provided by Professor Takahiro Nagase, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan) by PCR using high-fidelity Platinum<sup>&#x000ae; </sup><italic>Taq </italic>DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and specific primers (upstream, 5'-<underline>CACC</underline>ATGCCCGGAGGTCTGCTTCTC-3', with an added <italic>CACC </italic>underlined, according to the manufacturer's instructions; downstream, 5'-TTAAGGCTGGGGTGTGTAGCGGA-3'). The resulting construct was named 'pcDNA3.1D/PRDX6'. After identification by automated sequencing analysis, the recombinant DNA plasmids transfected breast cancer cells using Lipofectamine&#x02122; 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The positive colonies were selected in the presence of 800 &#x003bc;g/ml of Geneticin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Invitrogen) and identified by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. In this study, the clones in which the PRDX6 gene were successfully transfected were named 'MDA-MB-435/PRDX6' and 'MDA-MB-231/PRDX6', respectively. The cells only transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector were named 'MDA-MB-435/vector' and 'MDA-MB-231/vector'. The transfectants were used before passage 20 in all cases, to minimize the impacts of clonal diversification and phenotypic instability. For all functional and biological assays, cells between 70% and 90% confluence were used, with viability &#x0003e; 95%.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell-proliferation assay</title><p>Cell-proliferation assays were performed to analyze the proliferation potential of parental, empty vector and PRDX6-transfected cells by using Cell-Counting Kit (CCK)-8 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). The cells were harvested and plated in 96-well plates at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>cells/well and maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified incubator. At the indicated time points, 10 &#x003bc;l of the CCK-8 solution was added into the triplicate wells and incubated for 1.5 hours and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured to calculate the numbers of vital cells in each well.</p></sec><sec><title>Colony-formation assay</title><p>The colony-formation assay was performed to measure growth promotion by PRDX6 transfection, according to the previously reported protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], with some modifications.

After 10 days' incubation, the number of colonies (&#x02265;20 cells) was counted within a field at a magnification of &#x000d7; 200 under a light microscope. For each test, a total of five fields were selected at random and the numbers were averaged.

After incubation for 1 hour, the wells were washed twice with PBS. We used the wells that were seeded with corresponding cells 6 hours previously as the control. The CCK-8 was used to detect the optical density (OD) value of each well. The adhesive rate was calculated according to the following formula: rate = (the trial OD &#x000f7; the control OD) &#x000d7; 100%.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>invasion assays</title><p><italic>In vitro </italic>invasion assays were performed to analyze the invasive potential of parental, vector and PRDX6-transfected cells using a Matrigel&#x02122; invasion chamber (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA, USA), as described previously, with some modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Each well insert was coated with 100 &#x003bc;l of a 1:3 dilution of Matrigel&#x02122; in serum-free culture medium.

The cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 hours. The cell suspension was aspirated and excess Matrigel&#x02122; was removed from the filter using a cotton swab. Then, the filters were fixed in 10% formalin solution and stained with H &#x00026; E. Cells that had invaded through the Matrigel&#x02122; and reached the lower surface of the filter were counted under a light microscope at a magnification of &#x000d7; 200. Five fields should be counted for each sample.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA interference experiments</title><p>To further demonstrate the role for PRDX6 in the progression of human breast cancer, we used the RNA interference (RNAi) technique to downregulate PRDX6 expression using the BLOCK-iT&#x02122; Pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector Kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>The pcDNA&#x02122;6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR plasmid with a spectinomycin-resistance gene (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for cloning small synthetic oligonucleotides. Four different miR155-based PRDX6-targeting sequences were designed using Invitrogen's RNAi design algorithm online. These sequences are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. On the basis of the computer analysis, these inserted oligonucleotides would specifically bind homologous sites of PRDX6 mRNA and thus might interfere with PRDX6 expression in cultured cells. To identify successful construction of recombinant plasmids, the EmGFP (enhanced Emerald Green Fluorescent Protein) forward-sequencing primer (5'-GGCATGGACGAGCTGTACAA-3') and miRNA reverse-sequencing primer (5'-CTCTAGATCAACCACTTTGT-3') were designed to perform PCR.

Animals were divided into four groups: the parental, empty vector, PRDX6-transfected and pCMV-PRDX6 miRNA-672 (PRDX6 knockdown) groups. Each group had eight mice. MDA-MB-435 or MDA-MB-231 cells (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>or 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells, respectively) were injected orthotopically into the exposed axillary MFP of anesthetized athymic mice. The cells in PRDX6 knockdown groups were inoculated 4 weeks after transfection. Animals were monitored every 2 days for tumor growth and general health. The rate of primary tumor growth of different cells was determined by plotting the means of two orthogonal diameters of the tumors, measured at 7-day intervals. Animals were killed and autopsied at 8 weeks for MDA-MB-435 cells or 6 weeks for MDA-MB-231 cells postinoculation. The lungs used to evaluate the numbers of metastasis were fixed in Bouin's solution for 24 hours and then stored in 100% ethanol. When the lungs restored their inherent color, the white metastasis deposits could be assessed by macroscopic observation. To confirm the presence of lung metastases, sections were cut at 50 &#x003bc;m intervals and H &#x00026; E staining was performed.

In our institute, Li and colleagues have identified 11 proteins with significantly different expression levels in the high&#x02013;metastatic-potential MDA-MB-435HM cells and their lower-metastatic-potential parental counterpart by using a comparative proteomic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. PRDX6 is one of the proteins with different levels of expression.</p><p>PRDXs represent a superfamily of Se(selenium)-independent peroxidases and some studies have showed a significant relationship between the expression of PRDXs and breast cancer. Noh and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] reported that PRDX1, PRDX2 and PRDX3 were overexpressed in breast cancer tissues, suggesting that PRDXs had a proliferative effect and might be related to cancer development or progression. Karihtala and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] observed that staining for PRDX2 and PRDX6 was negative in half of breast cancer cases, whereas PRDX1, PRDX3, PRDX4 and PRDX5 showed stronger expression levels. They also found that expression of PRDX5 was significantly stronger if tumors were larger or had lymph-node metastases. Liu and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] reported that in a MDR (multidrug resistant) cell line MCF7/AdVp3000 the expression of PRDX6 was increased and the expression of PRDX2 was decreased, which suggested they might cause drug resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer. In addition, the overexpression of PRDX2, resulting in increased resistance of breast cancer cells to ionizing radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and involvement of PRDX in breast cancer resistance to docetaxel therapy were also observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The PRDX6 gene located at chromosome 1q2 consists of five exons and encodes a 25 kDa protein. There have been numerous reports documenting a link between PRDX6 and certain diseases, such as atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], sporadic Creutzfeldt&#x02013;Jacob disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and Pick disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, until now, there was little information about the role of PRDX6 in the metastasis of cancers, including breast cancer.</p><p>In the present study, we found that PRDX6 was upregulated in MDA-MB-231HM cells. These results are consistent with the previous results in MDA-MB-435HM cells, suggesting that expression of PRDX6 takes part in the process of invasion and metastasis of breast cancer. We also established the PRDX6-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines by stable transfection. Both transfected cell types exhibited the significantly enhanced proliferative potential compared with their parental cells. The results of adhesion and invasive assays <italic>in vitro </italic>also showed that PRDX6 could promote the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. This provided direct evidence that PRDX6 could enhance the invasive potential of breast cancer.</p><p>At first glance, our results seem to contradict some of the published literature regarding the relationship between PRDXs and cancers. Ouyang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] found that progression of prostate adenocarcinoma was correlated to the deregulation of antioxidants, including PRDX6, in Nkx3.1 mutant mice. They thought that the deregulation of antioxidants led to an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, ultimately, the initiation and progression of prostate carcinoma. This result was verified in some other studies. Neumann and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] found that mice lacking PRDX1 have a shortened lifespan partly owing to several malignant cancers, including breast cancer. de Souza and colleagues observed decreases in the expression of PRDX2 and PRDX6 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] in murine melanoma line Tm1 compared with Tm5 from nontumor cells.</p><p>However, some other studies showed upregulation of PRDX6 in malignant tumors. Karihtala and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] found that PRDXs, including PRDX6, were overexpressed in breast cancer. Quan and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] demonstrated that enhanced PRDX6 expression was strongly associated with bladder cancer development. Furthermore, overexpression of PRDX6 was found in malignant mesothelioma of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Why is there such disparity in the literature regarding PRDX6 expression in various studies? One possibility might be differences in cell types. Most of the reports about the downregulation of PRDXs originated from studies in murine malignant cells. Another possible explanation for increased PRDX levels in tumors would be that they were the results of responding to impending oxidative stress and that antiapoptotic features of PRDXs provided a growth advantage to tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It was probable that PRDXs were able to inhibit ROS-mediated physiological apoptosis, cause abnormal proliferation and thereby lead to tumorigenesis. However, for the deregulation of PRDXs in some malignant cells, a lack of PRDX led to an accumulation of ROS, which promoted carcinogenesis in all its stages, for example initiation, promotion and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Clearly, further studies should be done to explain these contradictions.</p><p>In the present study, we also used miRNA-induced gene silencing to further demonstrate the relationship between invasive potential and expression of PRDX6. A miRNA expression vector derived from a murine miR-155 sequence, which enables the expression of engineered miRNA sequences from Pol II promoters, was used to construct a PRDX6-targeting miRNA expression vector. Four different vectors, pCMV-PRDX6 miRNA-122, pCMV-PRDX6 miRNA-251, pCMV-PRDX6 miRNA-289 and pCMV-PRDX6 miRNA-672, were constructed in this study. We found that the expression of PRDX6 was significantly decreased in pCMV-PRDX6 miRNA-672 groups of breast cancer cells. To confirm their stable nature for future inoculation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated stable transfectants of PRDX6 knockdown and the obvious inhibition was observed at 3 months. We found that PRDX6 knockdown cells exhibited marked inhibition in invasive potential and the inhibition might be related to the regulation of uPAR, Ets-1, MMP-9, RhoC and TIMP-2 levels.</p><p>A crucial step during invasion and metastasis is the destruction of biological barriers, such as the basement membrane, which requires activation of proteolytic enzymes. Many studies have shown that enhanced production of members of the plasminogen activator pathway and MMP family contributed to tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The uPAR could regulate cell-surface-associated proteolysis by uPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and it was also involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration independent of the enzymatic activity of its ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In this study, we have demonstrated that upregulated expression of the uPAR, but not uPA, was associated with increased tumor cell invasion and metastasis in breast cancer by PRDX6. By contrast, downregulated expression of the uPAR was associated with decreased tumor cell invasion and metastasis.</p><p>MMP activity is tightly regulated by specific physiological inhibitors, TIMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The TIMP family comprises at least four distinct members: TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3 and TIMP-4. Ets-1 is a member of the Ets family of transcription factors. It has been reported that Ets-1 was overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies, including breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Because of its roles in the transcriptional regulation of MMPs, Ets-1 is a candidate mediator of cancer invasion and metastasis. In the present study, we demonstrated that the enhancement of invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells by PRDX6 was accompanied by upregulation of MMP-9 and Ets-1 expression and downregulation of TIMP-2 expression. However, no significant differences in expression of other members of the MMP and TIMP families were found among PRDX6-transfected, knockdown and parental cells. This suggested that the upregulation of MMP-9 might be stimulated by PRDX6 through activation of Ets-1 and deactivation of TIMP-2.</p><p>RhoC is a member of the Ras-homology family of small GTP(guanosine triphosphate)-binding proteins. Some studies have proved that RhoC had a key role in metastasis of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In this study, our results suggested that the effect of PRDX6 on the invasive and metastatic potential of breast cancer cells was mediated partially through regulation of RhoC expression.</p><p>In this study, we also demonstrated that PRDX6 enhanced orthotopic tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis in nude mice. By contrast, PRDX6 knockdown cells showed decreased ability in breast cancer growth, invasiveness, and metastasis. These changes were associated with regulation of MMP-9, Est-1, the uPAR, Rhoc and TIMP-2 proteins in xenograft tumors. All these results indicate that PRDX6 promotes breast cancer progression, partially through upregulation of uPAR, Ets-1, MMP-9 and RhoC expression and downregulation of TIMP-2 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified upregulation of PRDX6 in highly invasive and potentially metastatic MDA-MB-231HM breast cancer cells compared with their parental cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that overexpression of PRDX6 in breast cancer cells promoted their invasive and metastatic potential <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Conversely, experimental inhibition of PRDX6 expression decreased the invasive and potential potential of breast cancer cells, partially through regulation of uPAR, Ets-1, MMP-9, RhoC and TIMP-2 expression. These results are consistent with our previous hypothesis that PRDX6 expression contributes to cellular invasive and metastatic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BCA = bicinchoninic acid; bFGF = basic fibroblast growth factor; bp = base pair; BSA = bovone serum albumin; Ca<sup>2+ </sup>= calcium; CCK = Cell-Counting Kit; CO<sub>2 </sub>= carbon dioxide; ECL = enhanced chemiluminescence; EDTA = ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; Ets-1 = E26 transformation-specific-1; EmGFP = enhanced Emerald Green Fluorescent Protein; FBS = fetal bovine serum; GAPDH = glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GSH = Glutathione; H&#x00026;E = hematoxylin and eosin; HM = high metastasis; IGF = insulin-like growth factor; IGF-1R = IGF-1 receptor; MFP = mammary fat pad; miRNA, microRNA; MMP = matrix metalloproteinase; NIH = National Institutes of Health; OD = optical density; ORF = open-reading frame; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PRDX = peroxiredoxin; RhoC = ras homolog gene family, member C; ROS = reactive oxygen species; RNAi = RNA interference; RT-PCR = reverse-transcriptase PCR; Se = Selenium; TGF = transforming growth factor; TIMP = tissue inhibitor of MMP; TPM = tropomyosin; uPA = urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR = uPA receptor; VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XZC performed the experiments.
