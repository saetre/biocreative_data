Previously, we have shown using a yeast system that enzymatic function could be restored to I278T cystathionine &#x003b2;-synthase (CBS), a cause of homocystinuria, by treatments that affect the intracellular chaperone environment. Here, we extend these studies and show that it is possible to restore significant levels of enzyme activity to 17 of 18 (94&#x00025;) disease causing missense mutations in human cystathionine &#x003b2;-synthase (CBS) expressed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> by exposure to ethanol, proteasome inhibitors, or deletion of the Hsp26 small heat shock protein. All three of these treatments induce Hsp70, which is necessary but not sufficient for rescue. In addition to CBS, these same treatments can rescue disease-causing mutations in human p53 and the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene. These findings do not appear restricted to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, as proteasome inhibitors can restore significant CBS enzymatic activity to CBS alleles expressed in fibroblasts derived from homocystinuric patients and in a mouse model for homocystinuria that expresses human I278T CBS. These findings suggest that proteasome inhibitors and other Hsp70 inducing agents may be useful in the treatment of a variety of genetic diseases caused by missense mutations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Genetic diseases are often caused by missense mutations: single nucleotide changes that cause a single incorrect amino acid to be substituted into the underlying protein. Most missense mutations cause the encoded protein to fold incorrectly and therefore not function properly. Examples of missense mutation diseases include CBS deficiency, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, which are caused by alterations in the <italic>CBS</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic>, and <italic>MTHFR</italic> genes, respectively. In the work presented here, we show that it is possible to restore substantial enzymatic function to disease-causing human mutant CBS, p53, and MTHFR proteins by treatments that alter the intracellular folding environment. All of these treatments result in elevation of the Hsp70 protein, a molecular chaperone protein involved in helping proteins fold properly. One way to rescue mutant protein function is by using a drug that inhibits the function of the proteasome, the intracellular machine responsible for degrading misfolded proteins. Our findings suggest that drugs of this class may be potentially useful in the treatment of human genetic diseases caused by missense mutations.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Missense mutations are genetic alterations that result in the production of proteins with single amino acid changes and are an especially common cause of a variety of diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Stenson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Most disease causing missense mutations do not target key catalytic residues, but rather cause problems in protein folding. It is thought that missense mutations affect protein folding by &#x0201c;trapping&#x0201d; the protein in a non-functional intermediate state, preventing it from folding into its lowest-free energy native state. These trapped misfolded protein intermediates can either be degraded or form large molecular weight aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Bross1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In theory, treatments that could reverse these protein-folding defects and promote proper folding would be of great utility in the treatment of a wide variety of genetic diseases.</p><p>Three genetic diseases in which missense mutations are common include cystathionine &#x003b2;-synthase (CBS) deficiency, Li Fraumeni syndrome, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. CBS deficiency is an inborn error of sulfur metabolism characterized by very high levels of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy). CBS catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine with serine to form cystathionine and is the first step in the <italic>de novo</italic> production of cysteine. In healthy adults, tHcy concentration in plasma ranges from 5 to 15 &#x000b5;M, but untreated patients with CBS deficiency often have tHcy in excess of 200 &#x000b5;M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Kruger1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. CBS deficient patients suffer from various pathologies including arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, mental retardation, and dislocated lenses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Mudd1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The major cause of mortality in these patients is stroke. Treatments that lower tHcy such as B-vitamins, dietary methionine restriction, and betaine supplementation, can significantly reduce the incidences of vascular events in these patients despite the fact that post-treatment homocysteine levels are still several times higher than levels found in the normal population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Wilcken1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Yap1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Yap2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Mouse models for CBS deficiency also indicate that there is a threshold effect for tHcy toxicity and support the notion that a small increase in residual CBS activity may have large clinical benefits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Gupta1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a dominant cancer susceptibility syndrome disorder caused by missense mutations in the <italic>TP53</italic> tumor suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Varley1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

In general, <italic>TP53</italic> behaves as a classic tumor suppressor gene, with the tumors losing or inactivating the wild-type copy of <italic>TP53</italic>, resulting in expression of only the mutant form. Mutant forms of p53 tend to be stable, resulting in increased accumulation of protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Esrig1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Its biochemical function is to catalyze the formation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is the methyl-group donor for the subsequent reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase. Mutations in <italic>MTHFR</italic> are known to cause MTHFR deficiency. MTHFR deficiency symptoms include developmental delay, motor or gait abnormalities, seizures, and premature vascular disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Goyette1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the work described here, we have extended our observations by showing that treatments that induce Hsp70 can greatly increase enzymatic function from 17 additional mutant CBS proteins, as well as mutant forms of p53 and MTHFR. In addition we show that proteasome inhibitors can induce Hsp70 and that these drugs can greatly increase mutant CBS activity in human cells and in a mouse model of CBS deficiency. Our findings support the idea that drugs that induce Hsp70 may be useful in the treatment of genetic disorders caused by missense mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethanol and deletion of <italic>HSP26</italic> restores enzymatic activity to mutant human CBS</title><p>We initially examined the effect of ethanol on a panel of 17 additional missense <italic>CBS</italic> mutations found in homocystinuric patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Kraus1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, we prepared total cellular lysates from the strains grown in cysteine-supplemented media with or without ethanol and measured both the steady state level of each mutant protein by Western blot and CBS enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000807.s001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000807-t001">Table 1</xref>). We found that 4/17 (24&#x00025;) of the mutants exhibited significant growth and greatly increased CBS enzyme activity (8 to 50-fold) when grown in ethanol-containing media. Interestingly, like I278T, ethanol had a much more modest effect on steady state protein levels compared to enzyme activity, indicating that the treatment caused the specific activity of the enzyme to increase. Ethanol exposure also increased steady state Hsp70 levels, consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000807-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000807.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Functional rescue of mutant CBS by ethanol and <italic>hsp26&#x00394;</italic>.</title><p>(A) A stationary phase culture of yeast (WY35) transformed with a plasmid expressing the indicated human CBS allele was diluted 1&#x02236;1000 in SC&#x02013;Cys media with or without 4&#x00025; ethanol and grown at 30&#x000b0;C for 24 h.

When ethanol is added to the cultures, Hsp70 levels are induced and p53 and Hsp26 levels are reduced to wild-type levels, while hsp104 levels remain elevated.

To test this, we examined the effect of proteasome inhibitors on mammalian cells expressing mutant human CBS protein. We obtained four primary fibroblast lines and one EBV transformed lymphoblastoid line from five patients with CBS deficiency. Four of the five lines were from patients that were homozygous for a particular mutation (I278T, T353M, T262M, G307S), while one line was from a compound heterozygote (A114V/E302K). We then examined both steady state CBS protein and CBS enzyme activity in untreated and in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). MG132 was used in these experiments because it was found to be a more potent inducer of Hsp70 than bortezomib for these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000807.s007">Figure S7</xref>). In the absence of drug, three of the five lines (I278T, T253M, and A114V/E302K) had undetectable levels of CBS protein and all five lines had &#x0003c;1&#x00025; enzyme activity compared to a control primary human fibroblast line. Addition of MG132 resulted in restoration of steady-state CBS to wild-type levels in all five lines and caused a dramatic increase in enzyme activity (over 100-fold increase to 28 to 66&#x00025; of wt CBS) in three of the five lines (I278T, T353M, and T262M). Interestingly, the increase in enzyme activity in the T262M cells was not associated with increased T262M protein levels, again suggesting that the rescuing effect of proteasome inhibitors is not due to inhibition of mutant protein degradation. Consistent with this idea, we found that MG132 resulted in a two-fold increase in Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000807-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). With one exception, we note concordance in the behavior of mutants that were rescuable by proteasome inhibition in yeast and in patient fibroblasts. It is possible that the lack of rescue observed in the A114V allele may have to do with the cell line also having the E320K allele as well. In total, these results indicate that exposure of human cells to proteasome inhibitors can rescue enzymatic activity from several missense mutant CBS proteins.</p><fig id="pgen-1000807-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000807.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Functional rescue of mutant CBS by proteosome inhibitors in mammalian cells.</title><p>(A) Restoration of CBS enzyme activity in patient fibroblasts.

These treatments include addition of ethanol or proteosome inhibitor to the media, or deletion of the small heat shock protein <italic>HSP26</italic>. At least one of these treatments was able to dramatically increase enzyme or transcriptional activity in 17/18 (94&#x00025;) mutant CBS proteins, 19/25 mutant p53 proteins (76&#x00025;), and 1/2 mutant MTHFR proteins (50&#x00025;). Interestingly, different types of response to the different rescuing treatments were observed. Some mutants were rescued by all three treatments (e.g. I278T CBS), some by two of three treatments (e.g. T262M CBS), while others only responded to a single treatment (e.g. G307S CBS). These differences are probably not due to differential Hsp70 induction, as all three treatments result in similar levels of induction. We speculate that each of these different treatments may have unique effects on other molecular chaperones and that each treatment may produce a unique intracellular folding milieu. With regards to CBS mutants, we found that both pyridoxine responsive mutants (e.g. I278T) and non-responsive mutants (e.g. G307S) could be rescued.</p><p>Our findings support the view that most missense mutations primarily affect protein folding, as opposed to altering critical residues involved in specific catalytic or interaction sites. This agrees with biophysical studies of protein folding. As stated by DePristo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-DePristo1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> &#x0201c;The overwhelming conclusion from 20 years of mutation studies on protein stability is that most amino-acid replacements, at all sites in a protein result in large effects on &#x00394;G relative to the observed range of &#x00394;G values themselves.&#x0201d; It is also possible that in multi-domain proteins like CBS, mutations affect protein folding by trapping the protein in a non functional intermediate state due to the existence of a high kinetic barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Bross1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, a possible explanation for the effectiveness of chaperone manipulation is that chaperone complex either helps mutant proteins overcome rate-limiting kinetic constraints in the folding process or brings the trapped intermediate back to a folding competent state. Interestingly, in CBS, only one mutation, G116R, was not rescuable by any treatment. This mutation is located only three residues away from the lysine (K119) that binds the active site pyridoxal phosphate at the base of an alpha helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Meier1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus this change may be an example of a mutation that affects a key catalytic-site in the protein.</p><p>Our results also show that this is not a yeast-specific phenomenon. We were able to restore function to three of six mutant alleles present in fibroblast cells from CBS deficient patients by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. In addition, we showed that a 4.3-fold increase in CBS activity could be achieved with a single injection of bortezomib into mice expressing I278T CBS. Consistent with our findings, Mu <italic>et al.</italic> showed that MG-132 could increase residual glucocerebrosidase enzyme activity four-fold in cell lines containing the L444P variant associated with Gaucher disease, and that a combination of MG-132 and a chemical chaperone, 2-Acetamido-2-deoxynojirimycin, could increase residual activity five-fold in cells containing the Tay-Sachs disease causing &#x003b1;-hexosaminidase G269S mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Mu1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

One potential concern with drugs that manipulate the molecular chaperone environment is they may have potential adverse effects on the normal proteome, and thus create side effects that would preclude their use as drugs. While this is a possibility, it should be noted that Bortezomib is already an FDA approved drug that is used to treat multiple myeloma. The major noted toxicity is peripheral neuropathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Gilardini1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is unknown if the levels of Bortezomib used to induce changes in the chaperone environment would need to be as high as those used in chemotherapy. Furthermore, there is another proteasome inhibitor in clinical trials (PR-171) that does not exhibit a strong peripheral neuropathy effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Jagannath1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, there are at least two other drugs that are known Hsp70 inducers that have undergone successful phase I trials in humans including 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin and arimoclomol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Solit1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Cudkowicz1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, while there may be some risk in this approach, there is no reason <italic>a priori</italic> to believe that the benefits of restoring function to a mutant protein would not out weigh the potential side effects.</p><p>In addition to germline genetic diseases, the work described here may have relevance to the treatment of somatic genetic diseases such as cancer. Mutations in p53 are the most frequent genetic alteration in human cancer, and loss of p53 function is critical for tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Soussi1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Several pharmacologic chaperones that restore function to mutant p53 protein have been identified and these have been shown to effectively induce apoptosis in certain cells that express mutant p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Bykov1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Bykov2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings suggest that proteasome inhibitors may also effectively restore function to certain p53 alleles. Although bortezomib has been shown to inhibit cell growth and cause apoptosis in a large number of cancer cell lines, the IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations vary widely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Adams1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. No systematic study of the relationship between bortezomib sensitivity and the p53 status of tumor cells has been reported.</p><p>In summary, the data reported here shows that the functional effects of a majority of missense mutations in at least three human genes can be reversed by treatments that alter the intracellular molecular chaperone environment. Based on these results, we suggest that drugs that effect the intracellular chaperone environment may be useful in the treatment of a number of genetic diseases caused by missense mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains, plasmids, growth, and drug treatment</title><p>Yeast strains WY35 (&#x003b1; <italic>leu2 ura3 ade2 trp1 cys4</italic>::<italic>LEU2</italic>), LS1 (<italic>&#x003b1; leu2 ura3 ade2 trp1 cys4::LEU2 hsp26::KanMX</italic>) and LS3 (&#x003b1; <italic>leu2 ura3 ade2 trp1 cys4</italic>::<italic>LEU2 ssa2</italic>::<italic>KanMX</italic>) were generated as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Singh1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000807-Kruger2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.
