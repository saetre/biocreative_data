MENT, a protease inhibitor of the serpin superfamily, is able to undergo conformational change in order to effect enzyme inhibition. Here, we sought to investigate whether conformational change in MENT is &#x02018;fine-tuned&#x02019; in the presence of a bound ligand in an analogous manner to other serpins, such as antithrombin where such movements are reflected by a change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Using this technique, MENT was found to undergo structural shifts in the presence of DNA packaged into nucleosomes, but not naked DNA. The contribution of the four Trp residues of MENT to the fluorescence change was mapped using deconvolution analysis of variants containing single Trp to Phe mutations. The analysis indicated that the overall emission spectra is dominated by a helix-H tryptophan, but this residue did not dominate the conformational change in the presence of chromatin, suggesting that other Trp residues contained in the A-sheet and RCL regions contribute to the conformational change. Mutagenesis revealed that the conformational change requires the presence of the DNA-binding &#x02018;M-loop&#x02019; and D-helix of MENT, but is independent of the protease specificity determining &#x02018;reactive centre loop&#x02019;. The D-helix mutant of MENT, which is unable to condense chromatin, does not undergo a conformational change, despite being able to bind chromatin, indicating that the conformational change may contribute to chromatin condensation by the serpin.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <bold>M</bold>yeloid and <bold>E</bold>rythroid <bold>N</bold>uclear <bold>T</bold>ermination stage specific protein, MENT, is a member of the serpin superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Silverman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and is capable of inhibiting the papain-like cysteine proteases, cathepsins V and L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Irving1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Springhetti1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Inhibitory serpins are metastable molecules that utilise a conformational rearrangement to inhibit target enzymes: upon interaction with a protease, the solvent-exposed reactive centre loop (RCL) is cleaved, but remains covalently bound to the protease as an acyl enzyme intermediate as it inserts into the centre of the large central &#x003b2;-sheet (the A-sheet) to form an additional &#x003b2;-strand. In the final serpin-enzyme complex, the protease is trapped in a distorted, inactive conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Huntington1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>MENT is also a potent chromatin remodelling protein that is responsible for heterochromatin spreading and control of terminal cell differentiation in avian erythrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Grigoryev1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The regions of MENT primarily responsible for interaction with nucleosomal DNA is an interhelical extension termed the M-loop, and an area centred on the D- and E-helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-McGowan1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The genetic material of eukaryotic cells is packaged in the form of chromatin: a nuclear mass composed of DNA, histones and other associated protein. Controlling the level of compaction of chromatin is essential for the regulation of all cellular processes.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that there may be a relationship between the inhibitory activity of MENT and its role in condensing chromatin: (1) protease inhibition by MENT contributes to chromatin rearrangements <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Irving1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Bulynko1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>; (2) cathepsin V, a nuclear protease implicated in the control of the transcription factor CDP/CUX, is rendered susceptible to inhibition by MENT in the presence of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Ong1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>; and (3) MENT is able to form protein-protein bridges, mediated by the RCL, that may be important for chromatin remodelling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-McGowan1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the crystal structure of wild-type MENT, two residues of the RCL are inserted into the top of the A &#x003b2;-sheet. Most serpins characterised to date that exhibit such partial RCL insertion undergo co-factor mediated conformational shifts; for example antithrombin and heparin co-factor II both undergo RCL expulsion in the presence of heparin. Therefore, we have used DNA, both naked and nucleosome-bound, to investigate conformational change in MENT by measuring changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. It was found that soluble chromatin was able to induce conformational change in MENT in contrast to naked DNA that was unable to induce any change. To attempt to determine the basic structure required for a conformational change in MENT, we constructed mononucleosomes and found that this was the necessary structure required for a conformational change in the molecule. We further probed this conformational rearrangement by analysing the changes seen in key MENT binding mutants and deconvolution of the tryptophan emission spectra using single tryptophan variants of MENT.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MENT<sub>WT</sub> undergoes a conformational change in the presence of chromatin that is independent of the RCL sequence but dependent upon the M-loop and D-helix residues</title><p>The mechanism by which nucleosome arrays are folded into higher order structures remains somewhat obscure. While the structures of individual nucleosomes and chromatin remodelling proteins have proved essential to understanding chromatin structure, traditional crystallographic approaches to higher order chromatin structure determination have been hampered by a lack of homogeneity as well as mobility in higher order chromatin structures.

Excitation of the tryptophan residues in MENT<sub>WT</sub> at 295 nm revealed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity at a peak of 340 nm (typical of the tryptophan indole ring fluorescence) upon addition of chromatin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004727-t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the deleted M-loop variant (MENT<sub>&#x00394;Mloop</sub>), that is unable to properly interact with DNA or chromatin, showed no change in tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of chromatin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004727-t001">Table 1</xref>). MENT<sub>OV</sub>, a mutant in which the RCL had been replaced with that of the non-inhibitory serpin, ovalbumin, showed a comparable increase in fluorescence to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004727-t001">Table 1</xref>). These data indicate that the RCL sequence is not essential for the chromatin-induced conformational change in MENT, but the presence of the M-loop is. This was not totally unexpected as the M-loop is essential for DNA binding. However, the final key variant of MENT that we tested is a mutant that carries a triple mutation within the D-helix of the protein (MENT<sub>K99Q,R107Q,K109Q</sub> or MENT<sub>M3</sub>).

We repeated these experiments using the 207 bp mononucleosome positioning DNA fragment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Lowary1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These data confirmed that wild-type protein, MENT<sub>&#x00394;Mloop</sub>, MENT<sub>OV</sub> and MENT<sub>M3</sub> did not undergo a conformational change in the presence of mononucleosome positioning DNA alone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004727-t001">Table 1</xref>), despite the fact that all of the serpin variants except MENT<sub>&#x00394;Mloop</sub> were capable of binding the cofactor. We attempted to analyse the effect of the nucleosomal core histones on the fluorescence of MENT by the addition of soluble core histones isolated from chicken nuclei. The results indicated that there was no change in fluorescence (data not shown), however in the absence of DNA, histones form stable octamers only at 2 M salt concentration, hence under assay conditions, these results are indicative of a mixed population of octamer components and may not be conclusive.</p><p>Thus it appeared that the two major components of chromatin, DNA and histone proteins, were not capable of inducing a conformational change in MENT, in contrast to soluble chromatin. Previous studies have shown that the wild-type MENT protein shows a high affinity for binding to the DNA linker stem structure of mononucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-McGowan1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, thus we tested the ability of reconstituted mononuclesomes to induce a conformational change in MENT. The intrinsic tryptophan emission spectra for wild-type MENT indicated that there was a modest increase in fluorescence at 340 nm in the presence of mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004727-t001">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the MENT<sub>OV</sub> variant showed an equivalent conformational change to the wild-type protein, but the DNA binding mutant, MENT<sub>&#x00394;Mloop</sub> and the condensation mutant, MENT<sub>(M3)</sub>, decreased (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004727-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The spectral results for this mutant exhibited great variation in the results obtained (reflected by the significantly larger standard deviations of the replicates) and we presume that, like MENT<sub>&#x00394;Mloop</sub>, the effect noted is due to shielding of the tryptophans as a result of inappropriate nucleoprotein complex formation or a reduction in the formation of these complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Conformational flexibility of MENT</title><p>The positions of the tryptophan residues in the native wild-type MENT structure shows that two residues are located in the shutter region (W33 on the B-helix and W163 of the F-helix), one is located in the breach (W199, at the end of strand s3A) and W286 is located on the H-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004727-g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

Each variant gave an emission spectrum with lower fluorescence intensity than the wild-type protein. To determine the contribution of each of the tryptophan residues to the overall spectrum, we deconvoluted the spectrum obtained by subtracting each individual tryptophan spectrum from that of the wild type spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004727-g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The results indicated that W286 was the predominant contributor (72&#x00025;) to fluorescence in the wild type protein, followed by W163 (18&#x00025;). The W199 and W33 residues only had minor contributions of 9&#x00025; and 1.0&#x00025;, respectively.</p><p>Accurate deconvolution of the emission spectra requires that each tryptophan contribute independently to the emission spectrum. To determine if each tryptophan contributed independently to the emission spectrum of the wild type MENT protein, a comparison was made between the sums of the emission spectrum of the four mutants to that of wild type MENT. If the tryptophans did fluoresce independently of each other, the wild type spectrum should be identical to one-third of the sum of the four spectra of the single mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Meagher1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004727-g001">Fig 1C</xref>). This was indeed the case, confirming that each tryptophan residue in MENT fluoresces independently of the other three.</p><p>We measured the effect of chromatin on the spectrum of each tryptophan variant. Unfortunately, however, due to the dominance of W286 to the emission, deconvolution analyses of W33, W163 and W199 were not interpretable. The contribution of W286 to the conformational change of MENT in the presence of chromatin was calculated to be only 8.5&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004727-t002">Table 2</xref>), in comparison to the &#x0223c;25&#x00025; change observed with the wild-type protein. This indicates that the conformational change seen in MENT is not solely located in and around the H-helix and that the other three tryptophans located in the flexible breach and shutter regions must contribute to this change as well. Due to the dominant contribution of W286 to the overall spectra, further detailed mapping of the conformational change was not possible.</p><p>The inability of a D-helix (MENT<sub>M3</sub>) mutant to undergo any detectable conformational change suggests that it is possible that chromatin promotes RCL expulsion, in a similar fashion to the effect of heparin on antithrombin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Jin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Binding of the correct cofactor (the nucleosome rather than DNA) may allow the molecule to move, releasing the RCL from constraints, shifting the body of the entire molecule as the loop is expelled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Jin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Langdown1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in the event of RCL expulsion, we might expect the kinetics of MENT interaction with target proteases to be substantially altered in the presence of chromatin, as seen with antithrombin and Factor Xa for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Olson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, we have recently shown that the rate of inhibition of cathepsin V by MENT is significantly accelerated in the presence of DNA and also soluble chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Ong1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>; however, our investigation into the mechanism of this rate enhancement indicated that this change in inhibition was actually controlled by a change in the protease rather than the inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004727-Ong1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the precise structural effect of chromatin on MENT remains to be understood. This study has shown that nucleosomal DNA induces a conformational change in MENT that is dependent on correct binding to the M-loop and D-helix residues of the serpin. Although structural mapping studies were less informative than hoped, the results indicate that the A-sheet and RCL are likely to be involved. Interestingly, the D-helix mutant of MENT, which does bind DNA, but doesn't undergo conformational change, is unable to condense chromatin, suggesting that the conformational change induced in MENT may play a role in chromatin condensation carried out by this serpin.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Mutagenesis and analysis of MENT variants</title><p>Point mutations were introduced into the MENT<sub>WT</sub> gene using the QuikChange approach (Novagen) using oligonucleotides (GeneWorks).

The emission spectrum of buffer in the presence and absence of cofactor, which was used as a control, was subtracted from the protein emission spectra.
