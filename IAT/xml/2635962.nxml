This process is tightly regulated both spatially and temporally to establish the proper subcellular distribution of molecules for permitting various biological processes. Such regulation is especially important in neurons that have extremely polarized structures. The regulation of protein trafficking is known to be involved in both normal function and dysfunction of the nervous system.</p><p>Some proteins are known to show differential subcellular localization during distinct developmental stages.

APPL is a transmembrane protein that is cleaved for secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004466-Luo2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. It is transported to synapses at the mid-pupal stage, but it is mainly localized to cell bodies in adults.

In addition to APPL, our study also identified HIG and Sec23p as key molecules that are important to the function of YATA. HIG is another protein that shows differential localization to synapses during different developmental stages.

HIG is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is transported and secreted to synaptic clefts from the early stage of pupal synaptogenesis. Its subcellular distribution changes drastically in the pupal brain. At the mid-pupal stage (2&#x02013;3 days post-pupariation), HIG is transported from cell bodies to synaptic terminals. At the late-pupal stage (4th day post-pupariation), HIG is localized exclusively to cell bodies.</p><p>Secretory vesicles have coat structures made up of COPI, COPII and clathrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004466-McMahon1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

These data suggest that the mechanisms of protein localization mediated by neuronal YATA are essential for the homeostasis of the nervous system. Because the expression of <italic>yata</italic> was observed in the all of the examined developmental stages or tissues, its function in other tissues may also contribute to preventing premature lethality.</p><p>The mammalian NTKL (also referred as SCYL1, Scy1-like1 or CVAK90) is structurally similar to YATA. NTKL is implicated in clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004466-Schmid1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, NTKL was also found to be involved in the COPI-mediated retrograde trafficking from the Golgi to the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004466-Burman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Together with our data, these findings suggest that the regulation of protein localization is the evolutionally-conserved function of YATA and its related proteins in mammals, although the functional similarity between <italic>Drosophila</italic> YATA and mammalian NTKL remains to be further elucidated. Moreover, <italic>NTKL</italic> has been identified as a causative gene in the <italic>mdf</italic> mutant mouse that shows neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004466-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. These lines of evidence suggests the importance of the <italic>yata</italic>- or <italic>NTKL</italic>-dependent regulation of protein localization as the evolutionally-conserved mechanisms that are required for the neural homeostasis.</p><p>Our study revealed that subcellular localization of APPL is impaired in the pupal optic lobes and larval motor neurons. In the <italic>yata</italic> mutant brain, APPL was strongly accumulated in cell bodies. This accumulation was observed in perinuclear regions in many cells. Accumulation of APPL and reduced immunoreactivity of the anti-KDEL antibody showed a significant correlation. Thus the impaired trafficking of APPL and possibly other proteins may lead to dysfunction of basic cellular physiology or architecture, which might eventually cause cell death and tissue deterioration. Another observed cellular dysfunction of <italic>yata</italic> mutants is the accumulation of Sec23p, which was occasionally observed in the restricted regions of the pupal optic lobe. The reason why only restricted regions were affected is unclear and remains to be elucidated. It is noteworthy that <italic>yata</italic> mutant optic lobes show reduced volumes at day 0 (M. S., unpublished data), while central brain volumes are normal at day 0. Therefore, the accumulation of Sec23p may be related to the cellular dysfunction caused by the <italic>yata</italic> mutation, which may eventually result in cell death.</p><p><italic>yata</italic> mutants showed progressive vacuolization in the white-eyed retina, although it is not known if the retinal pathologies of <italic>yata</italic> mutants are caused by similar mechanisms to the brain. We examined the light-dependency of the eye vacuolization phenotype. In the constant dark condition, progressive vacuolization was found to be suppressed. These data suggest that active phototransduction is necessary for the development of progressive vacuolization in <italic>yata</italic> mutants. Mechanisms of phototransduction might participate in the degeneration of retinal cells, similarly to the previously identified <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants that show light-induced retinal degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004466-Knust1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, synaptic activity of the photoreceptor neurons might be involved. Further investigation is required together with examination of the involvement of APPL in the retinal phenotypes of <italic>yata</italic> mutants.</p><p>Our data identified APPL as the functional target molecule of YATA. Although <italic>Appl</italic> null mutant flies are viable and do not show drastic phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004466-Luo1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>yata</italic> deficiency phenotypes were more severely deteriorated by the additional ablation of <italic>Appl</italic>. The double mutants null for <italic>yata</italic> and <italic>Appl</italic> showed reduced brain volume at day 0 after eclosion, whereas both single mutants exhibited normal volumes at day 0. Conversely, the premature lethality and brain volume reduction at day 14 were improved by the neuronal overexpression of <italic>Appl</italic>.

Thus, our brain volume data indicate a dose-dependent genetic interaction between <italic>yata</italic> and <italic>Appl</italic>, and they suggest a functional relationship between these two genes, together with interactions that were observed in the lifespan phenotypes. It is noteworthy that a neuroprotective function of <italic>Appl</italic> has been previously suggested by the phenotype of the double mutant for <italic>Appl</italic> and <italic>l&#x000f6;chrig</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004466-Tschpe1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, the rescue of premature lethality was only partial. Because expression of <italic>hig</italic> also partially rescued the short lifespan phenotype of <italic>yata</italic>, and the subcellular localization of HIG was weakly affected in <italic>yata</italic> mutants (M. S., unpublished data), HIG and other unidentified target molecules of <italic>yata</italic> may also contribute to the mutant phenotypes caused by <italic>yata</italic>.</p><p>APPL is a homologue of mammalian Amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is one of the identified causative genes of familial Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004466-Hardy1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

On the other hand, mutation of <italic>Drosophila yata</italic> caused the accumulation of APPL in cell bodies, and this accumulation often overlapped with an ER marker. The accumulation of Sec23p, which is a component of the COPII coat of anterograde secretory vesicles traveling from the ER to the Golgi, was also observed in <italic>yata</italic> mutants.

Therefore, YATA and its structurally-related proteins in other species might have different cellular functions at distinct subcellular sites. Alternatively, YATA and its related proteins might have multiple cellular functions at several subcellular locations. Further analysis to identify the functional subcellular site of <italic>Drosophila</italic> YATA will be required.</p><p>The subcellular localization of APPL and HIG is regulated dynamically during different developmental stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004466-Torroja1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004466-Hoshino1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In late pupae, the expression of <italic>yata</italic> is downregulated when trafficking of HIG is suppressed.
