We initiated a study of myosin light chain 1 (MLC1) expression in cardiac tissue to determine whether MLC1 undergoes changes similar to those seen for MHC. We isolated a full length cDNA for the predominant MLC1 sequence in rat hearts. This gene is expressed in ventricular tissue at much higher levels than in atrial tissue. Based on its expression pattern and sequence homology, this cDNA encodes the rat ventricular MLC1 and has been named RVMLC1. RVMLC1 is expressed at very low levels in cardiac tissue during early development and is expressed abundantly after birth and in adult hearts. The expression of RVMLC1 was found not to change in the hearts of rats with renovascular hypertension.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0384-a" xlink:role="2760"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0385-a" xlink:role="2761"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0387-a" xlink:role="2763"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0388-a" xlink:role="2764"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0389-a" xlink:role="2765"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0377.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2753"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0378.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2754"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0379.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2755"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0380.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2756"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0381.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2757"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0382.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2758"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0383.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2759"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0384.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2760"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0385.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2761"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0386.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2762"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0387.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2763"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0388.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2764"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0389.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2765"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0390.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2766"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00124-0391.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2767"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
