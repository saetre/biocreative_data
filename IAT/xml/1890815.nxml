Substantial questions remain as to how these channels sense and respond to mechanical stress. Here we describe a set of mutants with alterations in their MscK channel protein. The mutants were detected fortuitously by their enhanced ability to modify the accumulation of quinolinic acid. Some amino acid changes lie in the putative pore region of MscK, but others affect sequences that lie amino-terminal to the domain aligning with MscS. We demonstrate that the alterations in MscK cause the channel to open more frequently in the absence of excessive mechanical stress. This is manifested in changes in sensitivity to external K<sup>+</sup> by cells expressing the mutant proteins. Single-channel analysis highlighted a range of gating behaviours: activation at lower pressures than the wild type, inability to achieve the fully open state or a modified requirement for K<sup>+</sup>. Thus, the dominant uptake phenotype of these mutants may result from a defect in their ability to regulate the gating of MscK. The locations of the substituted residues suggest that the overall gating mechanism of MscK is comparable to that of MscS, but with subtleties introduced by the additional protein sequences in MscK.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanosensitive (MS) channels play an important role in regulating turgor pressure in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Booth and Louis, 1999</xref>). When cells growing in hyperosmotic environments are shifted into hypoosmotic conditions (downshock), water flows through the cytoplasmic membrane causing a rapid increase in cell turgor pressure. MS channels in the membrane are gated by pressure such that they open at a level just below that which would cause significant damage to the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Levina <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). The non-specific release of solutes through the channels diminishes the driving force for water entry and thereby reduces turgor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Berrier <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>). Four kinds of MS channel activities have been identified in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and are defined either by their electrical conductance or by other properties: MscL, large conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Sukharev <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>); MscS, small conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Martinac <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>); MscK, potassium-dependent small conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Levina <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), and MscM, of mini conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Berrier <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). Conductance of the open state correlates with the pressure required to gate the channel, with MscM requiring least pressure and MscL the greatest. In addition to aiding survival of hypoosmotic shock, MS channels may play an important role during cell wall re-modelling upon entry to, and exit from, stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Stokes <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). These roles in cell physiology are underlined by the regulation of MS channel expression by osmotic stress and by stationary phase, with RpoS and other environmentally sensitive parameters controlling their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Stokes <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Schumann <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Considerable progress has been made on understanding the structural changes undertaken by MS channel proteins during the closed-to-open transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Sukharev, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Blount, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Strop <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). In the open state, MscS and MscL create transient pores of &#x0223c;11&#x02013;30 &#x000c5; diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Sukharev, 2002</xref>), which must close sufficiently to prevent H<sup>+</sup> from crossing the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Levina <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). The crystal structures of MscS from <italic>E. coli</italic> and MscL from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> have been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bass <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). While the precise states represented by these structures is still subject to debate, models have been generated for the gating transition based on these structures and on complementary genetic, biochemical, electrophysiological and biophysical analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Blount <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Moe <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Sukharev <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Perozo <italic>et al</italic>., 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). In these models, both proteins have hydrophobic seals that block the channel pore in the closed state, but they differ in their mechanism of opening. MscL helices undergo a major change in tilt within the plane of the membrane to effect the closed-open transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Sukharev <italic>et al</italic>., 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Perozo <italic>et al</italic>., 2002a</xref>). In contrast, MscS helices rotate and slide across the surface presented by the adjacent helix, which is a more subtle structural alteration and correspondingly the pore created is smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). A further significant difference between the two types of channels is that MscS possesses a large cytoplasmically located vestibule perforated by seven lateral and one axial portal, which may act as pre-filters for solutes that will exit from the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bass <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). It has been suggested that a smaller but equivalent structure may exist in MscL, but whereas this structure is static, there is evidence that changes in the MscS vestibule are dynamically coupled to the gating transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bass <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Koprowski and Kubalski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2003a</xref>).</p><p>MscS is part of a very large family of membrane proteins, not all of which exhibit MS channel activity (M.D. Edwards and I.R. Booth, unpublished). Multiple homologues are present in many organisms, suggesting the possibility of alternative functions for some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Levina <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). The largest MscS homologue in <italic>E. coli</italic> is the MscK channel (previously, the structural gene has been called <italic>aefA</italic> and <italic>kefA</italic>; throughout this article we refer to the gene as <italic>mscK</italic> and the protein as MscK), which is one of the largest members of the MS channel family (1120 amino acids). MscK has 11 transmembrane spans with an N<sub>OUT</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>IN</sub> organization, based on alkaline phosphatase fusion analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">McLaggan <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). A cleavable amino-terminal signal sequence places the first &#x0223c;450-residue domain in the periplasm. This is followed by the membrane domain that appears to consist of two subdomains of seven and four spans; the smaller of these domains corresponds to the MscS membrane domain and is followed by the carboxy-terminal domain (&#x0223c;190 residues). The last 257 amino acids of MscK exhibit significant sequence similarity to MscS (25% identity, 50% similarity; <sc>blast</sc> score 1e<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>), with the region of similarity covering the region most clearly resolved in the crystal structure of MscS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Levina <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bass <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). Electrophysiological analysis of MscK demonstrated that although the channel shares a similar conductance to MscS, its properties differ in several respects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). The MscK channel is less selective towards anions than MscS, is activated by slightly lower pressures and does not display the significant desensitization seen in MscS channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Levina <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Most significantly, however, activation of MscK in isolated patches requires both pressure and high concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> on the periplasmic side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Organization of MscK and MscS.

The <italic>mscK</italic> null mutant exhibits no strong growth phenotype alone, but leads to the complete loss of small MS channel activity in the presence of a <italic>mscS</italic> null mutation. The <italic>kefA2</italic> mutant allele in <italic>E. coli</italic> (strain RQ2) exhibits an unusual phenotype &#x02013; sensitivity to high external K<sup>+</sup> concentrations in the presence of compatible solutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">McLaggan <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Under these growth conditions, bacteria normally replace internal K<sup>+</sup> with betaine, which stimulates growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Booth <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>); in the mutant the exchange inhibits growth of the cells. Based on electrophysiological analysis, the mutant channel gated at lower pressures than its parent channel and no longer required high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). To date, genetic analysis of the structure and function of MscK has essentially been restricted to this single <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant, <italic>kefA2</italic>. This analysis would clearly benefit from availability of more mutant alleles.</p><p>This study reports the isolation of MscK mutants of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> as suppressers of a <italic>nadB</italic> mutation. The <italic>nadB</italic> gene encodes the first enzyme for the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of NAD but mutants at this locus can utilize external sources of pyridines as biosynthetic intermediates. Quinolinic acid (QA) can rescue this phenotype but only when it is provided at a high external concentration (10 mM), presumably because there is no specific mechanism for its transport. Genetic analysis identified mutations in <italic>mscK</italic> that facilitated uptake of QA, allowing <italic>nadB</italic> mutant cells to grow on low concentrations. The mutations found in <italic>Salmonella</italic> were introduced into the cloned <italic>E. coli mscK</italic> gene and their impact on cell physiology and electrophysiological signatures was determined. The two proteins are highly similar (89% identical, 95% similar by <sc>blast</sc>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Altschul <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>), with most of the significant differences lying in the signal sequence, making the <italic>E. coli</italic> protein a good test-bed for analysis of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> mutations. We demonstrate that they cause the MscK channel to exhibit altered gating, such that the channels are frequently open in the absence of applied hypoosmotic stress. We show that the changes in cell physiology associated with the mutations are consistent with this modified gating. The locations of the substituted residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>) suggest that the overall mechanism of pore formation in MscK is comparable to that of MscS but that the sequence differences generate distinct position-specific sensitivities to amino acid substitutions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of <italic>mscK</italic> alleles</title><p>From genetic screens for suppressers of a <italic>nadB</italic> mutation, common spontaneous mutants (<italic>pnu</italic>) arose that permitted growth of the <italic>S. typhimurium nadB</italic> mutant on 0.1 mM QA. Most of these mutants increased expression of the gamma amino butyrate permease (GabP), which can transport QA (H. Jeong and J. Roth, unpublished). However, one exceptional class proved to affect the <italic>mscK</italic> gene, suggesting that the altered channel protein allowed entry of QA.</p><p>Overall, 31 independent <italic>pnu</italic> mutants were isolated and assigned to groups <italic>pnuF</italic>*<italic>&#x02013;I</italic>* by genetic mapping and sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Jeong, 2003</xref>). The first characterized <italic>pnu</italic> mutation that later proved to affect the <italic>mscK</italic> gene was <italic>pnu</italic>*<italic>-189</italic>. Based on transductional linkage (41%) to this mutation, a Tn<italic>10</italic> insertion (<italic>zba-3799::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic>dTc) was isolated and mapped near the <italic>apt</italic> locus. Six <italic>pnu</italic>* isolates were co-transducible with this element and were called <italic>pnuH*</italic> alleles. A previously isolated Tn<italic>10</italic>dTc isolate (<italic>zbb-101::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic>dTc; strain TL1773), which maps close to <italic>apt</italic>, was transduced into <italic>pnuH*</italic> strains and was found to eliminate the capacity for growth on 0.1 mM QA. This insertion was found to be located between the +2235G and +2236T nucleotides of the <italic>S. typhimurium mscK</italic> gene, which encodes MscK, the potassium-dependent MS channel of small conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Levina <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Using <italic>mscK</italic>-specific primers, the individual point mutations were amplified and sequenced, revealing the affected residues to be R792P, L866Q, W909R, A918P and G924S (the R792P mutation was independently isolated twice) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Of the five different <italic>pnuH*</italic> point mutations three affected the region equivalent to the pore-forming transmembrane helix (TM3) of the MscS channel in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B and C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Levina <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) and adjacent to the previously characterized dominant <italic>kefA2</italic> allele, G922S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">McLaggan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). However, two mutations, R792P and L866Q, are situated amino-terminal to the pore region, with L866Q lying near the base of TM1 and R792P lying outside the sequences equivalent to MscS and thus defining a new region, specific to MscK, that affects channel behaviour.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sequence changes observed for <italic>pnuH</italic>* mutant alleles.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Nucleotide sequence</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strain</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genotype</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wild type</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mutant<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-1">a</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amino acid change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TT16290</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>pnuH183</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C<underline>A</underline>G</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Leu<sub>866</sub>Gln</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TT16294</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>pnuH187</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CGT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C<underline>C</underline>T</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arg<sub>792</sub>Pro</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TT16296</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>pnuH189</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TGG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>C</underline>GG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trp<sub>909</sub>Arg</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TT16297</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>pnuH190</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CGT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C<underline>C</underline>T</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arg<sub>792</sub>Pro</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TT16299</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>pnuH192</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GGC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>A</underline>GC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gly<sub>924</sub>Ser</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TT18216</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>pnuH255</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GCG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>C</underline>CG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ala<sub>918</sub>Pro</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf1-1"><label>a</label><p>The underlined base indicates the change in the DNA sequence.</p></fn><fn><p>DNA sequence and consequent amino acid changes associated with the <italic>pnu</italic> mutations at the <italic>mscK</italic> locus that confer the ability to grow in the presence of low concentrations of quinolinic acid.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In the course of isolating Tn<italic>10</italic> insertions near the <italic>pnuH*</italic> gene, we discovered an unlinked insertion (<italic>zac-3696::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic>dTc) that eliminated growth on 0.1 mM QA without altering the QA utilization phenotype of any other class of <italic>pnu*</italic> mutation.

Several of the altered MscK channel proteins caused growth inhibition of strain RQ2 on Na<sup>+</sup>-based high-osmolarity medium containing betaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). To clarify these effects the plasmids were introduced into <italic>E. coli</italic> strain MJF465 (MscL<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, MscS<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, MscK<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) and growth was investigated in low-osmolarity medium containing different K<sup>+</sup> concentrations (K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>20</sub>). The growth rate in such media is affected by the frequency of channel gating that can lead either to loss of K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis or to depolarization of the membrane. In K<sub>1</sub> medium, prior to addition of IPTG, the low-level expression of plasmids carrying the G992S mutation (i.e. G922S and L565Q/G922S) led to significant growth inhibition, whereas the other plasmids caused little or no change to the growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). Within 60 min of addition of IPTG (50 &#x003bc;M) growth was completely inhibited for cells expressing the G922S, L565Q/G922S, G924S and W909R mutations, whereas growth of cells expressing the wild-type, L565Q, L866Q, or R792P MscK was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>).

This strain grows normally in media containing 20 mM or more K<sup>+</sup> but fails to grow with only 5 mM K<sup>+</sup> present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). To test the capacity of MscK to allow K<sup>+</sup> transport, the mutated constructs were introduced into MJF603 and the transformants were streaked on minimal medium plates containing 5, 20, 40 or 115 mM K<sup>+</sup>. All transformants grew well on plates containing either 20 mM (data not shown) or 40 mM K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>) but the transformants expressing the G922S, G924S or L565Q/G922S mutations were slightly impaired in their growth on 115 mM K<sup>+</sup> (data not shown). The wild-type MscK channel was unable to restore growth on plates containing 5 mM K<sup>+</sup>, but transformants expressing G922S, G924S, W909R or L565Q/G922S mutant channels grew normally at this low concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>).

Therefore, it appears likely that G922S, G924S and W909R mutant channels gate sufficiently frequently at low osmolarity to allow rapid K<sup>+</sup> entry. The data obtained at 115 mM K<sup>+</sup> suggests that the channels bearing G922S or G924S mutations are gating sufficiently frequently to slow growth under these conditions, possibly by causing significant depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Assessment of the opening frequency of the MscK mutant channels using complementation of the K<sup>+</sup> transport defect of a triple K<sup>+</sup>-uptake mutant.

The analysis was performed at pH 7, in the presence of 200 mM K<sup>+</sup>, which has been observed to be required on the periplasmic side of the membrane for gating of MscK in excised membrane patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).

Using the cloned gene the frequency of patches that showed both MscK and MscL activity was routinely observed to be between 30% and 80%, indicating that functional MscK channels are still in low abundance in membrane patches relative to the native profusion of MscS and MscL.</p><p>MscK channel activity was characterized by stepwise openings and closures with an average open dwell time of &#x0223c;100 ms, which is similar to MscS channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The pressure required to activate MscL is used as a reference for the gating pressure for MscK (P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>K</sub>) and MscS (P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>S</sub>). We observed that the pressure needed to activate MscK was reproducibly lower (P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>K</sub>&#x0223c;1.87 &#x000b1; 0.07; <italic>n</italic> = 7) than the activation pressure for MscS (P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>S</sub>&#x0223c;1.59 &#x000b1; 0.03) and the conductance was also smaller than for MscS channels: 880 &#x000b1; 50 pS (<italic>n</italic> = 9) for MscK compared with &#x0223c;1250 pS for MscS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The RQ2 strain has two mutations in the <italic>mscK</italic> gene, L565Q and G922S. We have previously shown that it is the G922S mutation that is likely to be the major contributor to the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">McLaggan <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) and we confirmed this here by electrophysiology. MscK L565Q behaves exactly like the wild-type MscK channel (P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>K</sub>&#x0223c;1.78 &#x000b1; 0.05; <italic>n</italic> = 8), consistent with the physiological properties of this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). The G922S and the L565Q/G922S mutant channels displayed frequent openings with lower thresholds of activation (P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>K</sub>&#x0223c;2.40 &#x000b1; 0.10 and &#x0223c;2.65 &#x000b1; 0.11, respectively; <italic>n</italic> = 6 for each), which is consistent with the analysis of the equivalent chromosomally encoded channel in strain RQ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), and some spontaneous activity was also observed for the double mutant. However, both G922S-containing mutant channels failed to achieve a stable open state before closing, producing a flickery appearance of channel activity in recordings and prohibiting accurate measurements of the conductance of the fully open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>).

The former class, including W909R and G924S, display regular openings and closures, but gate at lower pressures than wild-type MscK [P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>K</sub>&#x0223c;2.47 &#x000b1; 0.12 and &#x0223c;4.38 &#x000b1; 0.66, respectively, for W909R (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and G924S (<italic>n</italic> = 7)] and both showed some spontaneous gating in the absence of applied pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). For these mutants the conductance was similar to the parent, consistent with the mutations affecting the sensitivity to pressure rather than the structure of the conducting pore. The A918P mutation caused channel openings to be unstable and exhibit a much reduced conductance (data not shown). Similar properties are associated with a mutation at the equivalent position in MscS (A102P; M.D. Edwards, W. Bartlett and I.R. Booth, unpublished) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2003b</xref>). Two mutant channels, R792P and L866Q, were not easily detected in protoplast patches and when pressure-induced activity was observed it exhibited unusual behaviour. These channels displayed irregular openings with different conductance values; even for the same patch, repeat applications of pressure could result in variable responses from these mutant channels (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Essentially, the R792P channels sometimes exhibited frequent closures in contrast with the wild-type channels, but other times they opened to a stable wild type-like state. Similar behaviour was observed for the L866Q channel, but with more extreme variability. Finally, attempts to measure the threshold pressures of these inconsistent openings showed that these mutant channels usually required greater pressure to open than the wild-type MscK under patch clamp conditions (with approximate pressure ratios &#x02013; due to the variable nature &#x02013; ranging from &#x0223c;1 to 1.5).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Li <italic>et al</italic>. (2002</xref>) established that the chromosomally mutated MscK protein in strain RQ2 could gate in response to pressure in the absence of high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations. Here we tested the ability of the cloned MscK mutant channels to open in recording solutions containing Na<sup>+</sup> in place of K<sup>+</sup>. As expected, mutation G922S generated flickery channel openings in the absence of K<sup>+</sup> however, these channels required greater pressure to open in Na<sup>+</sup> than in K<sup>+</sup> (P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>K</sub>&#x0223c;1.33 &#x000b1; 0.16 in Na<sup>+</sup>; <italic>n</italic> = 4). Although W909R MscK channels open with a lower pressure than wild-type MscK in the presence of K<sup>+</sup>, these mutant channels did not readily gate in Na<sup>+</sup> buffer and if observed, it was at exceptionally high pressures (close to that sufficient to gate MscL or rupture the membrane patch). In contrast, mutant channels containing the G924S substitution readily opened in the absence of K<sup>+</sup>, although activation under these conditions always required pressure and at a level greater than when K<sup>+</sup> was present (P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>K</sub>&#x0223c;1.88 &#x000b1; 0.16; <italic>n</italic> = 8). Attempts to record from cells expressing either R792P or L866Q mutant channels in Na<sup>+</sup> solutions produced similar irregular, unstable activity to that seen in K<sup>+</sup> buffer. Thus, it appears that Ser substitution of the two Gly residues in the predicted MscK pore creates channels with a strong GOF phenotype where K<sup>+</sup> is no longer necessary for gating but is essential for activation at lower pressures.</p><p>The data presented above are consistent with the gating mechanism being similar to that of MscS despite the sequence differences in this region (only 20% identity and 40% similarity in the 21 residues between Thr93 and Gly113 of MscS; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7A</xref>). To extend this analysis we used our previous investigations of MscS gating to select amino acid changes for which a predicted phenotype might be made. MscS exhibits a conserved packing interface in the TM3 pore-lining helices that is constructed from three Ala&#x02013;Gly pairs. Disruption of an Ala&#x02013;Gly packing interaction by introduction of a Gly residue in place of the Ala decreased the pressure required to gate the channel. In contrast, substitutions of Gly with Ala increased threshold pressure for activation. Introduction of Ser residues modified the gating pressure and channel characteristics in a position-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Molecular modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) of the MscK putative pore-lining helices identified the following packing motif: W<sub>914</sub>xAxAxSxGLGxGLQ<sub>928</sub> (S. Kim, C. Li and I.R. Booth, unpublished) that has the potential to create packing surfaces between adjacent pore-lining helices that comprise Ala<sub>916</sub>&#x02013;Ala<sub>918</sub>, Ser<sub>920</sub>&#x02013;Gly<sub>922</sub> and Gly<sub>924</sub>&#x02013;Gly<sub>926</sub> interactions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7B</xref>), which is significantly different from that observed in MscS. To help understand the relationship between pore sequence and packing we created A916G, S920A and G926A with the prediction that these changes would decrease (A916G) and increase (S920A and G926A), respectively, the pressure for gating MscK. All three mutants were readily created and the proteins expressed to levels equivalent to the wild-type channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8A</xref>). As predicted, the A916G channel gated at lower pressures than the wild type (P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>K</sub>&#x0223c;2.55 &#x000b1; 0.21; <italic>n</italic> = 7). These mutant channels exhibited a significant shortening of the peak mean open dwell time (&#x0223c;7 ms compared with &#x0223c;100 ms for wild-type channels; data not shown); however, they were able to attain the fully open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8B</xref>). MscK S920A channels were essentially wild type in their open-state conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8B</xref>) and open dwell time (&#x0223c;250 ms; not shown) but required more pressure to open them (P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>K</sub>&#x0223c;1.17 &#x000b1; 0.02; <italic>n</italic> = 10). Consistent with their electrophysiological character, the expression of the A916G mutant channels inhibited growth in high-osmolarity medium (both high Na<sup>+</sup> and high K<sup>+</sup> in the presence of betaine) and did not complement the mutant phenotype of the RQ2 strain. However, expression of the S920A channel did not impair growth at high osmolarity and efficiently complemented RQ2, consistent with the loss of function associated with this allele (data not shown). The most surprising result was obtained with G926A, which was expected to exhibit a channel that was more difficult to open. These mutant channels gated with low pressures (P<sub>L</sub>:P<sub>K</sub>&#x0223c;2.65 &#x000b1; 0.17; <italic>n</italic> = 6), although they rarely opened to the full extent observed when wild-type channels gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8B</xref>). In this respect, G926A behaved in a similar manner to G922S and it was not surprising therefore that expression of this mutant channel inhibited growth at high osmolarity in a K<sup>+</sup>-independent manner and failed to complement strain RQ2 (data not shown). These data, while confirming the trends observed in mutational analysis of MscS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), show subtle differences in the pore sequence requirements for normal gating of the MscK channel.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Alignment of the putative pore region of MscK with the pore region of MscS.

In addition, it is known that transport systems can acquire point mutations that alter their specificity leading to channel-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Buurman <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and still other channels have been identified but have no assigned physiological role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Milkman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kuo <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). In a wide genetic screen for mutants of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> with improved ability to take up QA, 31 suppresser mutations were isolated, of which six mapped to <italic>mscK</italic> (one allele being isolated twice), but none were found in other putative or confirmed genes for other MS channels (including <italic>mscS</italic> or <italic>mscL</italic>). The electrophysiological and growth phenotypes conferred by the mutations when transferred to the <italic>E. coli</italic> MscK protein provide a probable explanation for the improved QA uptake based on the aberrant gating of the channels. This is particularly true for the three mutations in the putative pore-lining helix, where we have demonstrated that the MscK alleles have altered pressure sensitivity, such that the threshold for activation is lowered. Spontaneous activation of the channel may create a new pathway for entry of QA, as is observed for K<sup>+</sup> in the triple K<sup>+</sup> transport mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). However, in the presence of high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, frequent channel openings will depolarize the membrane, as has been noted for MscL mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Buurman <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Thus, the MscK mutant channels may either provide the route for QA entry or potentiate accumulation of QA by lowering the membrane potential. Among the other classes of alleles suppressing the high QA-dependence phenotype of the <italic>nadB</italic> mutant strain were mutations that inactivated a drug export system and others that increased expression of a catabolite repressed GabP permease, which normally transports gamma amino butyrate (H. Jeong and J. Roth, unpublished). These data suggest that both altered uptake and diminished efflux of QA can contribute to the observed reduction in concentration dependence of growth.</p><p>The only previously recorded point mutations affecting the chromosomal copy of MS channels were MscK <italic>kefA2</italic> (strain RQ2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">McLaggan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) and a MscL N15D mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Buurman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). A partial explanation for this observation can be derived from a consideration of the properties of RQ2. Here we have demonstrated that when the G922S mutation was introduced onto a plasmid-borne <italic>mscK</italic> gene a much more obvious phenotype was observed than in the previous study where only the chromosomal locus was investigated. The RQ2 strain (L565Q/G922S on the chromosome) can grow in high-Na<sup>+</sup> medium in the presence of betaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">McLaggan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>); however, expression of G922S from a plasmid inhibited growth in the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, increased expression of wild-type MscK was without effect on growth in high-Na<sup>+</sup> medium. Similarly, increased expression of the G922S mutant channel inhibited growth on minimal medium containing either 1 mM or 20 mM K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>), conditions under which the chromosomal mutation was without observable effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">McLaggan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Protein abundance, which is affected by gene copy number and control over expression, affects the observed phenotype for these channel mutations. A similar conclusion can be drawn from recent analyses of MscL, where an N15D mutation was isolated in the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosomal gene as a suppresser of the K<sup>+</sup> transport defect in the triple K<sup>+</sup> transport null strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Buurman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) but the same mutation caused severe growth inhibition when expressed from a plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Ou <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). This may help to explain the paucity of chromosomal mutations that alter channel gating and the failure to retrieve MscS GOF mutants from generalized screens with expression from high-copy-number plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Okada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><sec><title>Strong GOF mutations reside in the pore-lining helix</title><p>Three of the five mutations isolated in a screen for improved QA import affected the putative pore region of MscK (W909R, A918P and G924S), which suggests comparable gating mechanisms for MscS and MscK, despite the dissimilarities in the pore helix sequences. Whereas both proteins are predicted to have two rings of hydrophobic residues creating the hydrophobic seal, the tight Ala&#x02013;Gly packing, which was seen as the basis for the helix rotation and tilt model of MscS gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), is not conserved in MscK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). Molecular modelling of MscK pore helices indicates the potential for both hexameric and heptameric organization (S. Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished), which is consistent with the known potential of sm domains (the domain that lies just below the predicted pore region) to exist in both hexameric and heptameric assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Mura <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Such packing would create Ala&#x02013;Ala, Ser&#x02013;Gly and Gly&#x02013;Gly interfaces, which have been shown to modify the pressure sensitivity and open dwell time properties of MscS channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The clash of Ala with Ala increased the pressure to gate MscS, whereas creating a Gly&#x02013;Gly interface reduced the pressure needed. Introduction of Ser residues opposite Gly had position-specific effects, but usually lowered the pressure required to gate the channel. Two of the pore mutations engineered specifically in this study obeyed the predictions from the MscS model for packing-residue interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>); A916G mutants (creating Gly&#x02013;Ala from Ala&#x02013;Ala) gate at lower pressure and S920A mutants (creating Ala&#x02013;Gly from Ser&#x02013;Gly) require higher pressure. Similarly, the behaviour of the MscK G924S mutant channel, selected from the screen for ability to use low QA concentrations, was not unexpected as the introduction of Ser residues into the pore-lining helix of MscS generally caused GOF. Indeed, the strongest phenotypes in the MscK mutant channels are associated with introduction of either Ser or Pro residues that have the most potential to modify the helix properties. However, as with MscS, the actual position of the Ser residue is critical to the impact on channel function. Both G924S and G922S proteins gate at low pressure, but whereas G924S channels can achieve a stable open state, the G922S channels cannot (this may be due to the G922S channels collapsing to a closed state before reaching the fully open state or it may be that they spend a significantly reduced time in the open state, where the temporal resolution of our recording system precludes absolute measurement of peak amplitude). It is notable that these two mutations are the only ones to confer significant independence of K<sup>+</sup> at the periplasmic face when gating, which may be due to these proteins forming conformations that already reduce the energy barrier for gating such that pressure is now a sufficient stimulus in the absence of K<sup>+</sup> (and accordingly, less pressure is required for transition to the open state in the presence of the activating ion).</p><p>The MscK and MscS proteins exhibit significant sequence similarity in the regions flanking the putative pore-lining helix. A larger region of lower similarity extending back towards the amino-terminus of MscS TM1 can be aligned but with decreased statistics, indicating that TM1 and TM2 have diverged significantly during the separate evolution of MscK and MscS from some distant common ancestor. Indeed, hydrophobicity and alkaline phosphatase analysis of MscK would support the channel-forming domain having four transmembrane helices rather than the three in MscS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) with a further seven TM domains located amino-terminal to the pore-forming domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">McLaggan <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Consistent with this proposal is the observation that between the seventh and eighth TM domains there is an extended hydrophilic stretch of sequence (residues 751&#x02013;780; rriawrrala rrqnlvkega egaeppeept) that resembles a flexible linker. Many larger MscS homologues have at least four TM domains with a probable N<sub>IN</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>IN</sub> conformation, suggesting that the four-TM span model might be a frequent structure. One of the GOF alleles reported here, R792P, maps to the eighth TM span of MscK, which would correspond to the first helix of a four-TM channel-forming domain. As the only basic residue at the junction between TM8 and the putative linker, it is conceivable that the loss of the R792 charge at this position alters the anchoring of the helix, which would be consistent with the inability to obtain stable channel recordings in patch clamp analysis. Equally, introduction of a proline-induced turn might alter the trajectory of the TM span; however, this region is very rich in residues that are turn-generating as the sequence QVNQQT immediately precedes R792. While there are uncertainties about the mechanism by which the phenotype of the R792P mutation arises, the altered character of the channel points to the importance of this region for the function of MscK.</p><p>A second mutation also identifies a further region of importance for gating and/or stability of MscK. When modelled onto the MscS structure, the L866Q mutation lies close to the base of TM1 in a region that is moderately conserved between the two proteins. In the MscS structure this region is described as an &#x003b1;-helical turn, rather than a precise continuation of the TM1 helix. The potential for disruption in the equivalent MscK TM span is even greater as this region is even more enriched in helix-breaking residues than MscS. We have previously identified this region as critical for gating of MscS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2003b</xref>) and the discovery that, in MscK, the introduction of another helix-breaking residue alters gating of the channel adds to the growing importance of this segment of the protein. However, it is notable that this residue lies close to the lipid&#x02013;headgroup interface of the membrane and the introduction of a potential hydrogen-bonding donor at this position in place of Leu may change the protein fold leading to the observed changes in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Yoshimura <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Nomura <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the discovery of MscK alleles as suppressers of QA dependence and their identification of altering channel gating properties led us to engineer other mutations in the putative pore region. The selected residues fitted with the model that we have previously advanced for paired residues in TM3 helices of MscS with the single exception of G926A. This was found to create a channel that gates at low pressure. The paradox is that this mutation, which from our predictions reprises in MscK the Gly&#x02013;Ala matching seen in MscS and removes a Gly&#x02013;Gly pairing, would be expected to predispose the channel to gate at higher pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). This raises the intriguing possibility that the MscK channel pore-lining helices adopt a different crossing angle from those observed in the crystal structure of MscS reflecting the significantly altered pattern of residues in the putative pore-lining helix of MscK. Structural analysis of this channel is underway and should reveal such changes and point the way to different structural algorithms for within the family of MS channels of the MscS/MscK class.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Media</title><p>Luria&#x02013;Bertani medium (LB) contained: tryptone, 10 g; yeast extract, 5 g; and NaCl, 5 g, per litre.

Three excerpts from electrophysiological traces are shown as examples of the unusual behaviour of mutant MscK channels containing R792P or L866Q substitutions. The two upper panels for each mutant are traces from sequential pressure trials for that patch - note the short dwell time nature of opening and general increase in conductance from the first pressure application to the next (in both cases). The lower panel for each mutant comes from a different protoplast patch and depicts examples where openings were more wild type-like in their character, although they required MscL levels of gating pressure to open.</p></caption><media xlink:role="text" xlink:href="mmi0064-0560-fs1.eps" xlink:type="simple" id="N0x1c81d60N0x33f5b60" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="postscript"/></supplementary-material><p>This material is available as part of the online article from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com">http://www.blackwell-synergy.com</ext-link></p><p>Please note: Blackwell Publishing is not responsible for the content or functionality of any supplementary materials supplied by the authors.
