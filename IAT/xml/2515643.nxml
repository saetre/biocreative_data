Adoptive transfer experiments suggest that autoimmune CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells mediate gastritis development as terminal effector cells. These results suggest that abnormal B-cell expansion due to AID deficiency can drive B-cell autoimmunity, and in turn promote TLO formation, which ultimately leads to the propagation of organ-specific autoimmune effector CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.

AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also display abnormal expansion of anaerobic commensal bacteria in the small intestine, which induces hypertrophic enlargement of Peyer's patches and protrusion of isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs). The abnormality of intestinal flora is due to the lack of hypermutated IgA, because reconstitution of intestinal IgA production recovered the normal composition of gut flora<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. These results suggest that AID plays a key role in homeostasis of intestinal flora.

On the other hand, recent studies suggest that interactions between B and T cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of autoimmue diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Edwards1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The B-cell receptor (BCR) in developing B-cell precursors is produced via the rearrangement of randomly selected V, (D) and J segments of the Ig heavy and light chain loci. This Ig gene recombination is crucial to increase the diversity of the B-cell repertoire however, due to its stochastic nature, a substantial number of newly synthesized BCRs bind autoantigens. It was recently estimated that more than 50&#x00025; of newly generated B cells are autoreactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Wardemann1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies using transgenic mice carrying autoreactive BCR genes indicate that autoreactive B cells are normally silenced by immunological tolerance mechanisms including clonal deletion, receptor editing and anergy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Nemazee1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Shlomchik1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in humans and mice that are prone to autoimmune diseases, the B-cell tolerance mechanisms seem to be overwhelmed by genetic or acquired defects. This concept is underscored by the finding that unregulated control of B-cell activation or proliferation due to the deficiency of the inhibitory Fc&#x003b3; receptor (Fc&#x003b3;RIIB), the protein phosphatase Shp1, or the protein kinase C&#x003b4; causes autoimmune diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Bolland1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Miyamoto1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

To better define the role of AID in autoimmunity, we carefully analyzed AID<italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice at different ages. We found that aged mice spontaneously developed gastritis with pathological features similar to human type A gastritis and murine experimental autoimmune gastritis. The disease could be reconstituted in nu/nu mice by adoptive transfer of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells isolated from inflamed gastric tissue. Anti-gastric-mucosa-specific Ab were elevated in gastritis-positive, but not in gastritis-negative AID<italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, indicating that autoreactive B cells are propagated in the gastritis-positive AID<italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. Importantly, gastritis development was preceded by formation of tertiary lymphoid organs (TLO). Self-reactive B cells, likely generated because of increased BCR diversity in the absence of AID, in TLOs could capture large amounts of gastric autoantigens to present to T cells, and reciprocally receive T-cell help. Consequently, such a vicious cycle through a B-T collaboration could facilitate the generation of gastric antigen-specific CD4 T cells, which ultimately cause the pathology of autoimmune gastritis. The data presented here show that AID is necessary not only for B cell homeostasis but also for negative regulation of autoimmune disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Lymphoid neogenesis is frequently observed in AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>We observed that AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions developed a number of polyp-like lesions in the gastric mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003033-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, see arrows).

Consequently, AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had a significantly shorter lifespan compared to wild type mice. Although AID deficiency was reported to lead to aberrant expansion of anaerobic bacteria in the gut, we found that gastritis development in AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice results from an autoimmune reaction rather than hyper responsiveness to gastric microflora. This view is supported by several observations. First, even under GF conditions, both lymphoid neogenesis and gastritis occurred in the AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice , whereas hypertrophy of ILFs was completely prevented (Hase K., unpublished observation). This result clearly suggests that lymphoid neogenesis in the stomach and hypertrophy of ILFs in the small intestine are induced by the different mechanisms in AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, although they share a similar appearance. Second, gastric mucosa-specific autoantibody was detected in gastritis-positive AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and there was a positive correlation between serum autoantibody levels and pathological gastritis scores. Detection of autoantibody indicates the activation and differentiation of gastric antigen-specific B cell clones. Third, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> effector T cells, which are likely autoreactive T cells typically observed in organ-specific autoimmune diseases, are generated in AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. These results imply an important role of AID for the containment of autoimmunity.</p><p>The gastritis that developed in aged AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was characterized by a massive infiltration of Mac1/CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and the destruction of parietal cells. The gastric glands in these mice were replaced by mucous-producing cells, resulting in epithelial hyperplasia. All of these pathological features are reminiscent of human type A gastritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Strickland1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and its experimental model, murine autoimmune gastritis, which are well-characterized organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Experimental autoimmune gastritis can be induced in BALB/c mice subjected to thymectomy 3 days after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Kojima1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Fukuma1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Approximately 60&#x00025; of neonatally thymecomized mice develop gastritis within 12 weeks. In this model, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells but not CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells prepared from the gastric mucosa can transfer the disease to nu/nu mice, indicating an essential role of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell in disease progression. Similarly, the gastritis that spontaneously develops in AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at later stages could be reconstituted in nu/nu mice by adoptive transfer of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. This observation further confirms that AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice spontaneously develop autoimmue gastritis through generation of gastric antigen-specific autoreactive T cells.</p><p>Of prime importance, lymphoid neogenesis precedes gastritis development in AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003033-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;C</xref>). Furthermore, indications of gastritis lesions, such as reduction in number of parietal cells, were more obvious at the circumference of TLOs both at early (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003033-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, see arrowheads) and late stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003033.s002">Figure S1C</xref>). These observations indicate that gastritis occurs secondary to TLO formation in AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Although lymphoid neogenesis has been detected in various organ-specific autoimmune disorders, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes and autoimmune gastritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Armengol1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Katakai1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, the mechanisms leading to lymphoid neogenesis as well as its immunopathological roles in autoimmune diseases are not fully elucidated. Given that TLO are apparently equipped with the complete set of lymphoid structures, i.e., secondary B-cell follicles with GC and distinct T-cell areas containing dendritic cells and high endothelial venules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Aloisi1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, TLO may play a role in maintaining an autoimmune response against persistent self antigens. This concept is at least party supported by experimental studies using the rat insulin promoter-lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein (RIP-GP) transgenic mouse model, where a positive correlation between lymphoid neogenesis and development of autoimmune diabetes was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Ludewig1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, expression of the recombination-activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 is evident in ectopic GC formed in rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune thyroid diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Armengol1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Itoh1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Zhang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. RAG genes, which are normally expressed in primary lymphoid organs, are master regulators of the rearrangement of V(D)J gene segments. The induction of RAG genes in TLOs raises the possibility that secondary BCR rearrangements, termed receptor revision, occur at these sites and may contribute to the generation of autoreactive B cells. In parallel, a recent study indicated that B-cell specificities in pancreatic TLO of NOD mice are skewed to enhance autoantigen-binding capacity, suggesting that TLO promote selection of autoreactive B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Kendall1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Once autoreactive B cells are selected and enhanced in TLO, these cells could differentiate into autoantibody-forming plasma cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003033.s002">Figure S1A and B</xref>). Consistent with this idea, there is a positive correlation between serum autoantibody levels and numbers of TLO in several autoimmune disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Armengol1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Katakai1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in the case of AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, B cells can produce only low-affinity IgM due to the lack of SHM and CSR. Therefore, gastric antigen-specific autoantibodies would be expected to only minimally contribute to the pathogenesis of the gastritis. Instead, the more important mechanism by which autoreactive B cells promote inflammatory processes may be T-cell activation through presentation of autoantigens and co-stimulation. It has been suggested that autoreactive B cells have a crucial role as APCs to capture and present autoantigens for activating T cells, which in turn drive T-cell autoreactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Takemura1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Yan1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This scenario could indeed be the case in the pathogenesis of autoimmune gastritis in AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Autoimmune B cells could be selected and propagated in TLO formed in the stomach of AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in the early stages. Given that B cells in gastric TLO are in a privileged location to capture large amount of autoantigens and present them to T cells, this interaction could contribute to the pathogenesis by induction of autoreactive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.</p><p>It should be noted that TLOs were induced not only in the stomach but also in other organs of AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003033-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, these organs are also considered to be potential targets for an autoimmune response. Indeed, autoimmune diseases have been found to develop in multiple organs in humans with <italic>AID</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Quartier1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The precise mechanism by which AID deficiency promotes the generation of self-reactive B cells is an open question at this moment. A previous report revealed that the BCR diversity is increased in AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Fagarasan1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, gastric Ag-specific B cells might emerge from the expanded B-cell repertoire. Under physiological conditions, B-cell autoimmunity is counteracted by several tolerance mechanisms including receptor editing, anergy, and clonal deletion. Particularly, as many as 50&#x00025; of newly produced B cells are reported to show an anergic phenotype (CD93<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgM<sup>lo</sup>), suggesting the primary importance of anergy in peripheral tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Merrell1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Although anergic B cells have a shorter lifespan relative to wild-type mature B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Fulcher1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, anergy is a reversible process: anergic B cells have been shown to revert to na&#x000ef;ve B cells upon hapten stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Benschop1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation raises the possibility that escape from anergy could result in autoimmunity. Mice and humans lacking functional AID display B-cell hyperplasia and a hyperactivated immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Muramatsu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Fagarasan1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these observations, we speculate that the aberrant activation stress may drive B-cell clones, which are normally retained in an anergic state, toward an autoimmune response. Intercrossing of AID <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with transgenic mice expressing a BCR prone to anergy should help clarify this speculation.</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain why AID deficiency leads to dysregulated proliferation of B cells. One possibility is that AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells are devoid of inhibitory signals though Fc&#x003b3;RIIB due to the lack of IgG Ab production. Fc&#x003b3;RIIB is the only Fc&#x003b3;R that contains a cytoplasmic ITIM motif. Crosslinking of the BCR and Fc&#x003b3;RIIB by IgG antibody-antigen complexes leads to negative feedback regulation for B cell activation via the phosphorylation of ITIM tyrosines and subsequent recruitment of the inositol phosphatase SHIP to the plasma membrane. Therefore, Fc&#x003b3;RIIB<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice display elevated Ig levels and enhanced immune complex-mediated tissue injury in response to Ag challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Takai1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, involvement of this inhibitory receptor in peripheral tolerance has been supported by the fact that Fc&#x003b3;RIIB<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on a C57BL/6 background spontaneously develop autoantibody-mediated lupus glomerulonephritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Bolland1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Although significantly different types of autoimmue diseases, namely systemic versus organ-specific, are induced in Fc&#x003b3;RIIB<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and in AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, respectively, this phenotypic difference is most likely due to the inability of AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to produce high-affinity autoimmune IgG Abs. AID<sup>-/-</sup> mice produce abnormally large amounts of IgM, whereas IgG is absent. IgM, like IgG, can promote complement activation, which in turn could support B-cell activation, because opsonization of Ags by complement components remarkably enhances both B cell activation (Carter and Fearon) as well as Ag uptake by B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003033-Edwards1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, since IgM is unable to bind Fc&#x003b3;RIIB, it fails to elicit negative feedback of humoral immunity. Thus, the imbalance of IgM and IgG in AID<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and humans could lead to unregulated B-cell proliferation, leading to the loss of peripheral tolerance. Other mechanisms, such as lack of high-affinity anti-idiotypic antibodies that might maintain B-cell homeostasis should also be considerable. Alternatively, insufficient elimination of external Ags due to the lack of class-switched and hypermutated Igs might drive B-cell activation. Elucidation of the precise mechanisms for unregulated B-cell proliferation as a result of AID deficiency is an important unresolved issue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Monoclonal Abs against B220 (RA3-6B2), CD3&#x003b5; (145-2C11), CD8&#x003b1; (53-6.7), FoxP3 (FJK-16s) (eBioscience); CD4 (GK1.5), CD11b/Mac1 (M1/70), CD11c (HL3), CD16/CD32 (93), CD19 (1D3), CD25 (7D4), CD44 (IM7), CD62L (MEL14), CD69 (H1.2F3), CD95/Fas (DX2), CR1 (8C12), IL-17 (TC11-18H10.1) (BD Biosciences), IFN-&#x003b3; (37895), IL-4 (30340) (R&#x00026;D Systems) and polyclonal Abs against IgM (Southern Biotech) and CXCL13 (R&#x00026;D Systems) were used.
