One positive recombinant, designated bmyf, was found to contain a 1931 bp insert with an open reading frame encoding a predicted protein highly related to the human myogenic factor myf-5 Human and bovine factors are 96% homologous in their predicted amino acid sequences. At the nucleotide level, bmyf and myf-5 are 92% identical in the coding region and 74 and 80% homologous in their 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions, respectively. The bmyf cDNA, nevertheless, extends 475 nucleotides beyond a polyadenylation signal common to both cDNAs. Bmyf transcripts are expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle where three transcripts of 1.5, 2 and 3 kb were detected. While the 1.5 kb transcript lacks sequences 3' to the polyadenylation signal at nt 1415 in the bmyf cDNA, both the 2 and 3 kb RNAs contain these sequences suggesting that bmyf transcripts are alternatively polyadenylated. Bmyf cDNA can activate the expression of the myogenic program in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts as assayed by stable and transient transfection experiments.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00195-0023-a" xlink:role="3150"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00195-0023-b" xlink:role="3150"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00195-0024-a" xlink:role="3151"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00195-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3147"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00195-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3148"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00195-0022.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3149"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00195-0023.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3150"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00195-0024.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3151"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00195-0025.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3152"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00195-0026.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3153"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
