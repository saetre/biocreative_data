This complex has been most extensively studied in yeast, where it is required for membrane trafficking and secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In multicellular organisms, Sec proteins are expressed at particularly high levels in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The functional role of Sec proteins in neurons, however, including whether they always function as a canonical octomeric complex, remains unclear.</p><p>We identified <italic>sec8 </italic>mutants in an unbiased forward genetic screen for mutations causing defects in development of glutamatergic <italic>Drosophila </italic>neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Sec8 is a core member of the sec 6/8 complex. Alone or as a member of that complex, Sec8 has been suggested to play a role in several aspects of neural development and function, including: (1) neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], (2) calcium-dependent neurotransmitter secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], (3) trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and (4) regulation of neuronal microtubule assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>A mouse <italic>sec8 </italic>knockout has been created, but dies early in embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], precluding significant functional or developmental analyses. In contrast, the <italic>Drosophila sec8 </italic>knockouts described here survive through embryogenesis, and hypomorphs survive throughout larval development into pupation. This provides the first opportunity to describe a <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant phenotype at any synapse. The <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ is a particularly good model synapse for this purpose, since it is glutamatergic and accessible to powerful microscopic and electrophysiological techniques throughout development. Here, we provide the first description of <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant synaptic phenotypes. We focused our analysis on (1) growth of presynaptic terminals, (2) basal neurotransmission, (3) ionotropic glutamate receptor trafficking and (4) microtubule density, since Sec8 has specifically been implicated in each of these processes.</p><p>We found that <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant NMJs show no obvious defect in growth of presynaptic arborizations or neurotransmitter secretion, but do show mild defects in glutamate receptor trafficking and relatively dramatic alterations in synaptic microtubule density. We hypothesize that Sec8's most important role in vivo is spatially-restricted inhibition of microtubule stability, and that disruption of microtubule regulation may underlie most, if not all, <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification and generation of <italic>sec8 </italic>mutants</title><p>We identified the transposon insertion mutant <italic>P{SUPor-P}CG2095</italic><sup><italic>KG02723 </italic></sup>in simultaneous unbiased forward screens for <italic>Drosophila </italic>mutants with alterations in NMJ presynaptic growth and glutamate receptor cluster formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We selected this mutant for further study on the basis of a dramatic semi-penetrant presynaptic overgrowth phenotype and reproducible loss of glutamate receptor immunoreactivity (see results, below). The <italic>KG02723 P</italic>-element insertion was mapped by the Berkeley <italic>Drosophila </italic>Genome Project using inverse PCR to the first exon of predicted gene <italic>CG2095 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We confirmed the KG02723 <italic>P</italic>-element insertion site in <italic>CG2095 </italic>by site-specific PCR primers.</p><p>We cloned and sequenced full-length <italic>CG2095 </italic>cDNA from the wild-type <italic>Drosophila </italic>strain <italic>Oregon R </italic>(Accession number AY905551). A BLAST search using this Oregon R CG2095 amino acid sequence showed 33% identity to rat and human Sec8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Conversely, BLAST searches using mammalian Sec8 against the translated <italic>Drosophila </italic>genome showed close matches only to CG2095. Thus, <italic>CG2095 </italic>represents the sole <italic>Drosophila sec8 </italic>homolog. Hereafter, we refer to <italic>CG2095 </italic>as <italic>sec8</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>Drosophila CG2095 / sec8</italic>.

We verified that the <italic>P</italic>-element insertion was responsible for the <italic>sec8P1 </italic>phenotype (see below) by complementation analysis and remobilization of the <italic>P</italic>-element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] to create precise excisions ('revertants'). These revertants are phenotypically indistinguishable from other control (<italic>w</italic><sup>1118</sup>) animals. Furthermore, <italic>sec8P1 </italic>mutants retain their phenotype in trans to a deficiency, <italic>Df(3R)Tpl10</italic>, that completely eliminates the <italic>CG2095 </italic>gene. These results show that the <italic>sec8P1 </italic>phenotype is specifically due to the P-element insertion in <italic>sec8</italic>.</p><p>Many transposon insertion mutants, including the <italic>sec8P1 </italic>mutants, represent hypomorphic alleles. Therefore, we generated deletions of the <italic>sec8 </italic>gene via imprecise excision of the <italic>KG02723 P</italic>-element in <italic>sec8P1</italic>, using standard methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Among the excision mutants isolated was a <italic>CG2095</italic>-specific deletion that we refer to as '<italic>sec8&#x00394;1</italic>'. To confirm that <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>only disrupts the <italic>sec8 </italic>gene and provide an accurate molecular description of this mutation, we sequenced the <italic>sec8 </italic>genomic region in <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>mutants. Sequencing showed that the <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>deletion begins before the ATG, 37 bp into the first 5' exon, and ends 73 bp prior to the 3' end of the last exon. Neighboring genes are completely intact. <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>therefore represents a zygotic null. <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>homozygous mutants hatch at the same time as controls (approximately 24 h after egg laying, AEL), but do not undergo their first molt and die as first instar larvae (~ 46 h AEL). The molecular nature of the <italic>sec8P1 </italic>and <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>mutations is summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>.</p><p>Homozygous <italic>sec8P1 </italic>and <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>mutants both hatched at approximately normal time (22&#x02013;24 h AEL) and appeared grossly normal by light microscopy (appropriate size, segmentation, mouthooks, etc.). There was no obvious difference in mutant animal size, behavior or viability immediately after hatching. However, homozygous <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>mutants did not undergo their first molt and did not live past first instar larval stage (~ 48 h AEL). Homozygous <italic>sec8P1 </italic>mutants appeared to molt and pupate normally, and therefore lived through larval development, but did not eclose and therefore died as pupae. In view of the viability and the fact that <italic>sec8 </italic>is almost completely deleted in <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>mutants, we conclude that <italic>sec8P1 </italic>represents a hypomorphic allele, while <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>represents a zygotic null allele.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Drosophila </italic>Sec8 is abundant in embryonic and larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs)</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryonic/larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a well-established model glutamatergic synapse that can be used to examine the effects of Sec8 loss on synaptic development and function. To test whether Sec8 is expressed at the NMJ, we raised rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Sec8 using a synthetic peptide composed of Sec8 amino acids 440&#x02013;460, and affinity purified these antibodies using the original peptide epitope. Immunoreactivity of this antibody was widely distributed throughout many tissues and was particularly enriched in synapses, including the NMJ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Because the pre and postsynaptic membranes are separated by only approximately 15 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], it is impossible to distinguish definitively by light microscopy whether Sec8 immunoreactivity directly at the NMJ is pre or postsynaptic. Nevertheless, several indications suggest that Sec8 is both pre and postsynaptic. First, there is clearly Sec8 immunoreactivity throughout the muscle cell outside the area delimited by presynaptic HRP staining; therefore, sec8 must be expressed in the postsynaptic muscle cell. Postsynaptic localization of Sec8 is also suggested by the fact that Sec8 immunoreactivity overlaps immunoreactivity for the postsynaptic glutamate receptor subunit GluRIIA. Three-dimensional reconstructions and rotations (not shown) show Sec8 immunoreactivity extending above the interior face of the muscle, consistent with presynaptic localization. We did not observe any Sec8 immunoreactivity in segmental nerve axons, suggesting that presynaptic Sec8, if present, must be localized specifically at the terminals, but there is little or no immunoreactivity in the centers of presynaptic boutons. Thus, presynaptic Sec8 must be localized specifically near the terminal membrane. We obtained essentially identical results using a recently described and independently generated antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Sec8 is found in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ.

On immunoblots using whole-animal extracts, our Sec8 antibody recognized a single 111 kDa band (not shown). The intensity of this band was reduced, on average, to approximately one-half normal in both <italic>sec8P1 </italic>and <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>L1 mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This suggests that despite the deletion of the <italic>sec8 </italic>gene in <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>mutants, and almost complete elimination of Sec8 in the NMJ of homozygous mutants, there is substantial maternal contribution of Sec8 in other tissues, as previously shown for other sec proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>We conclude from our immunohistochemical results that Sec8 is probably expressed both pre and postsynaptically at the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ, and that <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant NMJs have almost no remaining Sec8 but substantial maternal Sec8 persists in other parts of the <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>mutant animals.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>sec8 </italic>mutants show increased NMJ growth during larval development</title><p>Sec proteins have been implicated in the membrane addition required for neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Formation of <italic>Drosophila </italic>larval NMJs involves extensive neurite outgrowth and presynaptic arborization. Examination of motor nerve terminals in the ventral body wall neuromusculature of <italic>Drosophila sec8 </italic>mutants therefore provides an excellent opportunity to test whether Sec8 plays a role in nerve terminal growth in vivo. Approximately halfway through <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryonic development (12 h After Egg Laying, AEL), motor neuron growth cones exit the CNS and travel along the developing segmental nerve toward their body wall muscle targets. Approximately 13 h AEL, development of ventral NMJs begins when motor neuron growth cone filopodia contact the target muscles. Over the next several hours, filopodia-ringed growth cones in contact with appropriate targets collapse to form nascent presynaptic processes of indistinct shape, termed 'prevaricosities'. By 17&#x02013;22 h AEL, parts of the prevaricosities begin to constrict and/or swell such that presynaptic terminals (known as synaptic boutons) are formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These presynaptic boutons are functional very early; electrophysiological analysis shows that NMJ transmission occurs within minutes of contact between motor nerve axons and muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. At the time of hatching (22&#x02013;24 h AEL), presynaptic boutons are still relatively indistinct, morphologically, but nonetheless are clearly highly functional since neuromuscular transmission is required for hatching and subsequent crawling of the newly hatched first instar (L1) larva. During larval development (24&#x02013;120 h AEL), the presynaptic arborization grows dramatically in order to accommodate rapidly growing larval muscles. This growth involves additions in NMJ length, branches and bouton number (from about 8&#x02013;10 in at hatching to 50&#x02013;100 in the third instar 6/7 NMJ). Boutons also become more distinct during NMJ development, such that the third instar NMJ typically appears as 'beads on a string' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>To examine motor nerve terminal morphology, we used fluorescently-conjugated anti-HRP antibodies (which allow visualization of all neuronal membrane), and confocal microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In <italic>sec8P1 </italic>and <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>mutants, NMJ morphology appeared normal in first instar (L1) larvae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). L1 mutant motor nerve insertion sites appeared normal, presynaptic swelling size was appropriate for the animal age, and the arborizations were similar in number and shape to those from age-matched control animals. The number of boutons and branches in mutant L1 ventral longitudinal muscle 6/7 NMJs were statistically unchanged compared to control animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>; Control boutons per 6/7 NMJ = 13.36 &#x000b1; 0.62, n = 14; <italic>sec8P1 </italic>= 11.85 &#x000b1; 0.75, n = 13, p = 0.130; <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>= 13.14 &#x000b1; 0.67, n = 14, p = 0.816; control branches per 6/7 NMJ = 1.62 &#x000b1; 0.22, n = 21; <italic>sec8P1 </italic>= 1.43 &#x000b1; 0.25, n = 21, p = 0.577; <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>= 1.82 &#x000b1; 0.28, n = 22, p = 0.587). However, in <italic>sec8P1 </italic>third instar larvae (<italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>mutants did not survive to this stage of development), muscle 6/7 NMJs showed consistent and qualitatively obvious changes in morphology and terminal number (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). With less penetrance, <italic>sec8P1 </italic>mutant third instar larvae showed dramatically abnormal neurite growth (e.g. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) that was never observed in control NMJs. The average number of presynaptic boutons and branches was significantly increased in <italic>sec8P1 </italic>mutant larvae compared to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>; Control boutons per 6/7 NMJ = 38.45 &#x000b1; 1.65, n = 22; <italic>sec8P1 </italic>= 47.50 &#x000b1; 3.36 n = 22, p = 0.020; control branches per 6/7 NMJ = 3.14 &#x000b1; 0.30, n = 22; <italic>sec8P1 </italic>= 5.41 &#x000b1; 0.71, n = 22, p = 0.006). Homozygous <italic>sec8P1 </italic>and <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>L1 mutants did not show any obvious defects in body wall muscle shape or size. Muscle insertions were correct and muscles did not detach abnormally during manual dissection or subsequent treatment. We conclude from these results that loss of Sec8 does not significantly impair growth of motor nerve terminals or presynaptic arborization. Instead, surprisingly, loss of Sec8 triggered an increase of NMJ size during larval development.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>NMJ morphology in <italic>sec8 </italic>mutants becomes abnormal during larval growth.

Very little Sec8 is localized extrasynaptically in wildtype animals. Therefore, a change in synaptic microtubule immunofluorescence (where Sec8 is normally found), but not in extrasynaptic microtubule immunofluorescence (where only very little Sec8 is found), is most consistent with synapse-specific regulation of microtubules by Sec8. Extrasynaptic microtubule immunofluorescence was not significantly increased in either <italic>sec8P1 </italic>or <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>L1 mutant larvae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D,E</xref>; Control extrasynaptic MT density = 1.00 &#x000b1; 0.17, N = 11; <italic>sec8P1</italic>= 1.39 &#x000b1; 0.33, N = 11, p = 0.31; <italic>sec8&#x00394;1 </italic>= 1.33 &#x000b1; 0.25, N = 11, p = 0.28). We conclude from these data that Sec8 inhibits microtubules in vivo, as predicted by previous biochemical data showing inhibition of microtubule formation by sec proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of tubulin phenocopies the loss of glutamate receptors seen in <italic>sec8 </italic>mutants</title><p>Our data suggest that <italic>Drosophila </italic>Sec8 plays a role in glutamate receptor localization and microtubule regulation. These two phenotypes could represent separate functions for Sec8, or could be due to the same root cause. Mammalian glutamate receptors are trafficked to the synapse via the microtubule network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to surmise that the defects in postsynaptic glutamate receptor localization measured in <italic>sec8 </italic>mutants might be due to misregulation of microtubules. To address this, we mimicked the increase in microtubules observed in <italic>sec8 </italic>mutants by overexpressing alpha tubulin. Overexpression of an alpha tubulin transgene in postsynaptic muscles using the gal4-UAS system doubles microtubule density (Images not shown; Control MT density = 1.00 &#x000b1; 0.17, N = 11; <italic>UAS-&#x003b1; tub/B24 gal4 </italic>tubulin = 2.21 &#x000b1; 0.24 a.u., n = 12, p = 0.001), presumably due to a shift in the dynamic equilibrium between disassembled and assembled tubulin subunits. This shift toward an increase in microtubules caused a significant decrease in the size and number of postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters, similar to that observed in <italic>sec8 </italic>mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>; Control GluRIIA cluster size = 0.45 &#x000b1; 0.02 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, n = 115 clusters in 8 animals; <italic>UAS-&#x003b1; tub/B24 gal4 </italic>= 0.28 &#x000b1; 0.01 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, n = 104 clusters in 9 animals, p &#x0003c; 0.0001; Number of control clusters = 0.68 &#x000b1; 0.06 clusters/&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, n = 13 NMJs; <italic>UAS-&#x003b1; tub/B24 gal4 </italic>= 0.47 &#x000b1; 0.05 clusters/&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, n = 14 NMJs, p = 0.014).

Sec proteins are thought to play a role in almost every cell type, but are particularly highly enriched in the brain. Therefore, most interest in Sec protein function is within the context of neuronal development and function. Sec8, alone or as part of the exocyst complex, has been implicated in several aspects of neural development and function including: (1) neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], (2) calcium-dependent neurotransmitter secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], (3) trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and (4) regulation of neuronal microtubule assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We explored each of these areas of potential function in <italic>Drosophila sec8 </italic>mutants.</p><p>Surprisingly, we did not see any evidence that Sec8 is required for neurite extension or nerve terminal growth, at least in motor neurons. Instead, <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant NMJ motor arborizations were morphologically normal at time of hatching, but then developed more branches and more boutons during larval development, compared to controls. This suggests that Sec8 <italic>suppresses </italic>neurite growth. The <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant NMJ overgrowth phenotype is unlikely to be an artifact for several reasons: (1) Although our immunoblots showed that 50% of total late embryonic/L1 Sec8 was left after deletion of the gene, Sec8 in the NMJ at the start of larval development was already almost undetectable. (2) Regardless of whether the amount of Sec8 is reduced to 50% or 0% (the difference between a functional hypomorph or a null), there was no detectable impairment of presynaptic terminal growth. Instead, NMJ growth was enhanced in the sec8 mutants. (3) The NMJ growth enhancement occurred entirely during larval development &#x02013; when maternal sec8 was fading to its lowest levels. This <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant NMJ overgrowth phenotype is dramatically different from the phenotype observed in <italic>sec5 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila sec5 </italic>mutants showed a slight increase in NMJ growth during L1 development (c.f. Murthy et al., Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), but then progressive deterioration in the ability to form new motor nerve terminals through later larval development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This suggests, along with other evidence (see below), that metazoan Sec proteins may not always function together as part of a canonical octomeric complex.</p><p>Because Sec proteins are required for membrane secretion in yeast, neuronal Sec proteins have long been implicated in neurotransmission, which relies on synaptic vesicle membrane insertion and cycling. However, we did not see any evidence that Sec8 is critical for neurotransmitter secretion, consistent with recently published descriptions of <italic>Drosophila sec5 </italic>and <italic>sec15 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and <italic>sec10 </italic>RNAi expression in the fly NMJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Our result is unlikely to be an artifact of incomplete removal of Sec8 from the synapse, because even though <italic>sec8 </italic>zygotic null mutants showed substantial maternal contribution of Sec8 protein (~ 50% normal levels overall), immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy showed that Sec8 was almost completely absent from mutant early larval NMJs. Thus, we were able to examine synaptic function following severe genetic reductions in synaptic Sec8. No mutant evidence to date suggests a role for Sec proteins in neurotransmission. Our data add Sec8 to the list of tested Sec proteins, and strengthen this conclusion.</p><p>Mammalian Sec8 has been shown to interact with NMDA-type glutamate receptors and the PDZ-domain protein SAP102 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This interaction appears critical for delivery of NMDA receptors to synaptic membrane in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Sec8 also interacts with PSD-95 and SAP-97 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which are two proteins thought to be important for delivery of non-NMDA (AMPA &#x00026; kainate) glutamate receptors to postsynaptic membranes. Thus, Sec8 has been implicated in trafficking of all types of glutamate receptors. We observed mislocalization of postsynaptic glutamate receptors in <italic>Drosophila sec8 </italic>mutants, consistent with a role for Sec8 in glutamate receptor trafficking. However, the mechanism by which <italic>Drosophila </italic>Sec8 regulates glutamate receptor trafficking may not be the same as the mechanism proposed for mammalian neurons. As mentioned above, mammalian glutamate receptor trafficking by Sec8 is thought to occur via interactions with the PDZ-domain proteins SAP102, PSD-95 or SAP-97. DLG is the sole <italic>Drosophila </italic>member of the mammalian PSD-95/SAP97/SAP102 protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila </italic>DLG mutants, only B-type receptor trafficking/localization is disrupted; trafficking and localization of A-type receptors appear normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. But in the <italic>sec8 </italic>mutants described here, trafficking of both A- and B-type receptors was affected. Therefore, our evidence suggests that loss of Sec8 does not selectively disrupt a DLG-dependent glutamate receptor trafficking pathway, which would be expected to lead to loss of only B-type receptors.</p><p>Exocyst proteins, including Sec8, have recently been shown to associate with microtubules in vitro and in cultured cells, and overexpression of sec proteins inhibits microtubule polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>Drosophila sec8 </italic>cDNA in vivo also caused a noticeable but statistically insignificant reduction in microtubule immunoreactivity, and <italic>sec8 </italic>loss of function mutants showed dramatically increased microtubule immunoreactivity in NMJs. These results suggest that Sec8, probably in conjunction with other sec proteins, locally inhibits synaptic microtubule network assembly and/or stability.</p><p>The misregulation of microtubules in <italic>sec8 </italic>mutants could be responsible for the glutamate receptor mislocalization we observed, since glutamate receptors, like other transmembrane proteins, are thought to be transported to synapses via microtubule networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Consistent with the idea that the receptor trafficking defects are secondary to microtubule misregulation, postsynaptic overexpression of tubulin increased muscle microtubule density and phenocopied the loss of synaptic glutamate receptors measured in <italic>sec8&#x00394; 1 </italic>mutants. Misregulation of microtubules in sec8mutants might also explain the presynaptic growth defects that we observed in <italic>sec8 </italic>mutants. Presynaptic growth in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ is known to be dependent on microtubule stability in both pre and postsynaptic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Misregulation of microtubules by either pre or postsynaptic Sec8 might therefore be expected to trigger defects in presynaptic growth.</p><p>Regulation of microtubules by Sec8 might also explain why expression of a <italic>sec8 </italic>transgene in <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant neurons (<italic>elav C155 gal4/UAS-sec8; sec8</italic>) fails to rescue the synaptic overgrowth (Data not shown), and why overexpression of a <italic>sec8 </italic>transgene in <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant muscle (<italic>UAS-sec8; 24B gal4 </italic>or <italic>UAS-sec8; H94 gal4</italic>) fails to reverse <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant receptor trafficking phenotypes (Data not shown). Traditionally, these results might be taken as genetic evidence that our phenotypes may be due to 'background' mutations. But nervous-system-specific expression <italic>sec8 </italic>(<italic>elav C155 gal4/UAS-sec8; sec8</italic>) rescues the mutant viability, <italic>sec8P1 </italic>mutants retain their phenotype in trans to a deficiency (<italic>Df(3R)Tpl10</italic>) that removes the <italic>sec8 </italic>gene region, and precise excision of the P-element in <italic>sec8P1 </italic>mutants completely reverses all synaptic phenotypes (see results). These results all argue that: (1) The <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant flies die owing to problems in the nervous system but not the NMJ defects, and (2) all NMJ phenotypes are indeed due to specific disruption of <italic>sec8</italic>.</p><p>The failure of transgenic rescue is also consistent with the fact that overexpression of <italic>sec8 </italic>(in a wildtype background) phenocopies <italic>sec8 </italic>mutants. For example, presynaptic overexpression of <italic>sec8 </italic>causes NMJ overgrowth (Data not shown; Control boutons per 6/7 NMJ = 38.45 &#x000b1; 1.65, n = 22; <italic>elav C155 gal4/UAS-sec8 </italic>= 37.11 &#x000b1; 2.51, n = 18, p = 0.647; Control branches per 6/7 NMJ = 3.13 &#x000b1; 0.30, n = 22; <italic>elav C155 gal4/UAS-sec8 </italic>= 4.61 &#x000b1; 0.36 n = 18, p = 0.003). Interestingly, postsynaptic overexpression of sec8 also causes NMJ overgrowth (Data not shown; Control boutons per 6/7 NMJ = 38.45 &#x000b1; 1.65, n = 22; <italic>UAS-sec8; 24B gal4 </italic>= 53.80 &#x000b1; 3.19, n = 20, p &#x0003c; 0.0001; control branches per 6/7 NMJ = 3.13 &#x000b1; 0.30, n = 22; <italic>UAS-sec8; 24B gal4 </italic>= 7.15 &#x000b1; 0.51, n = 20, p &#x0003c; 0.0001). This latter result is consistent with the idea that Sec8 regulates microtubules and the knowledge that microtubule stability &#x02013; on both the pre and postsynaptic sides of the NMJ- is a critical regulator of presynaptic terminal growth and arborization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>Considered together, our results suggest that a primary role for Sec8 at synapses may be spatially-restricted regulation of microtubule networks. But we cannot conclude that this is a primary function for other Sec proteins. A growing body of evidence suggests that metazoan exocyst proteins may not always function as a canonical hetero-octomeric complex; functionally distinct subcomplexes appear to exist in different cell types or even within the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. There are, for example, important differences between the <italic>sec8 </italic>mutant phenotypes described here and the phenotypes previously described for <italic>Drosophila </italic>Sec5 mutants with regard to NMJ formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>Drosophila </italic>expressing <italic>sec10 </italic>RNAi in the neuromusculature showed no NMJ changes, and Sec10 was not detected in the NMJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. More recently, a study of <italic>Drosophila </italic>Sec15 mutants found more differences between <italic>sec </italic>mutant phenotypes and argued explicitly for independent Sec protein roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, several lines of evidence, including expression patterns and phenotypes, suggest that Sec proteins function independently in at least some tissues and/or at different times. Nevertheless, all <italic>Drosophila sec </italic>mutants show at least partial defects in membrane trafficking, membrane protein distribution and/or cell polarization &#x02013; processes that rely, at least to some extent, on microtubules. Thus, microtubule regulation may be a common thread tying together Sec protein function in vivo. One might imagine that different subsets of differentially-regulated Sec proteins transiently associate in specific cellular compartments to prune the dynamic microtubule network. This pruning and shaping might ensure that membrane packages are delivered past, or are dropped off at, appropriate places. We think that it is important for future work on Sec proteins to consider this possibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Sec8 is abundant in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ.

Specifically, we first identified homozygous mutants using the FlyBase Insertions Query Form <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/"/>. Approximately 10% (220 of 2185 stocks) of the insertion lines available in March 2003 contained lethal inserts. We examined dechorionated embryos from each of the 220 stocks to ensure that homozygous mutants developed to at least late stage embryogenesis (16&#x02013;17 h after egg laying, AEL), which is when NMJs begin to form. Of the 220 mutants, 202 developed into morphologically mature embryos (condensed CNS, clear segmentation, trachea, mouth hooks, etc.). These 202 mutants were rebalanced using a chromosome-specific GFP balancer for unambiguous identification of homozygous <italic>P</italic>-element mutants and then screened immunocytochemically using anti-HRP and anti-GluRIIA antibodies to visualize presynaptic nerve terminals and postsynaptic glutamate receptors, respectively.

Four hundred and forty-five independent mutant lines of flies were created; approximately 8% of these (35 of 445) were homozygous lethal. The lethal lines were then screened using a PCR-based assay with three pairs of primers. One pair of primers was designed to amplify a portion of <italic>sec8 </italic>near the <italic>P</italic>-element insertion. A second set of primers was designed to amplify a portion of the gene <italic>CG2082</italic>, located immediately 5' to <italic>CG2095</italic>, and the third set of primers was designed to amplify a portion of gene <italic>CG2091</italic>, located immediately 3' to <italic>sec8</italic>. Mutants in which the first (<italic>sec8 </italic>specific) primer pair did not produce a product but the second and third primer sets did suggested that <italic>sec8 </italic>was specifically deleted but the neighboring genes were left intact.

Goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse fluorescent (FITC or TRITC) secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Labs, West Grove, PA) were used at 1:400. Confocal images were obtained using an Olympus FV500 laser-scanning confocal microscope. All images represent maximum intensity projections of confocal Z-stacks. Image analysis and quantification was performed on maximum intensity projections of Z-stacks using ImageJ software. Three-dimensional surface reconstructions were generated from confocal Z-stacks using Amira 3.1 (Mercury Computer Systems, Chelmsford, MA).</p><p>Quantification of glutamate receptor cluster size was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].

These diameters stay relatively constant, even throughout larval development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

Cluster area was quantified and measured from maximum intensity Z-projections of confocal image stacks, using automated edge finding and area measurement in ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda MD). This method agrees well with manual measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], is highly reproducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], and involves no experimenter bias for cluster selection because the software selects and measures every bright spot regardless of shape or size. An alternative measurement of glutamate receptor abundance is fluorescence intensity. Although fluorescence intensity measurements gave qualitatively identical results for this study (data not shown), we do not prefer them for embryonic/L1 receptor abundance measurements because intensity measurements assume changes in protein density within individual PSDs (for which we have no evidence) or underestimate differences in receptor abundance due to fluorescence measurement from pixels between individual GluR clusters. Because immunoreactivity for microtubules and the synaptic proteins DLG, CSP and SYT did not show distinct clusters, we quantified their abundance using fluorescence intensity. However, all of these measurements are relative to 'background' fluorescence (measured from non-muscle areas for microtubules, or nonsynaptic areas for DLG, CSP and SYT) in the same image and filter channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. We feel that this is an important wavelength-matched control for variation due to possible differences in staining, mounting of the preparation, or microscope settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblots</title><p>After protein isolation for immunoblotting, protein abundance was quantified using Bradford assays, and the same amount of protein was loaded per lane on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The amount loaded was 20 &#x003bc;g for GluRIIB blots, 50 &#x003bc;g for GluRIIA blots and 20 &#x003bc;g for Sec8 blots. After electrophoresis, protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBST (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1&#x02013;2 h at room temperature. Anti-Sec8 was used at 1:500 and anti-GluRIIA ('8B4D2' concentrate, Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) was used at 1:200. GluRIIB antibodies usable for immunoblots have not previously been described. To generate Anti-GluRIIB antibodies for use in immunoblots, rabbit polyclonal antisera was raised against synthetic peptides containing C-terminal sequence of GluRIIB: RQSRDSTSTGYSSLEQITSASSAKKKK. For immunoblotting, GluRIIB antibodies were used at 1:400. Note that these GluRIIB antibodies are not the same as used for in situ staining; as described above, the GluRIIB antibodies used for in situ staining are described in Marrus et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. After incubating at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, the membranes were washed with TBS-T. Anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:5000 for GluRIIA blots and anti-rabbit AP-conjugated secondaries were used at 1:1000 for GluRIIB and Sec8 blots. Protein bands on blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (GluRIIA) or via a colorimetric reaction (GluRIIB and Sec8). Both GluRIIA and GluRIIB bands are completely eliminated in appropriate mutants (Df(2L) [AD9] and Df(2L) [SP22]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and Liebl, Ng, Sheng, Karr and Featherstone, unpublished).</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>All electrophysiology was performed on the ventral body wall muscle 6 at 19&#x000b0;C. For electrophysiology on first instar (L1) larvae we used a whole-cell patch clamp technique. Third instar larval muscles are too large for whole cell patch clamp. Therefore, we used two-electrode voltage clamp technique for third instar (L3) larval recordings. Both techniques were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. The sEJCs analyzed in this study, in either first or third instar larvae, are unlikely to include events resulting from endogenous action potentials, based on two pieces of evidence: (1) Endogenous action potential evoked activity is much larger, typically patterned, and thus easily recognizable, and (2) <italic>Drosophila </italic>sEJCs recorded in 0 mM calcium with 5 &#x003bc;m TTX occur with less frequency but are not larger, in both embryos/first instars and third instar larvae [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] and unpublished observations]. Therefore, although we do not methodologically exclude any particular type of synaptic event and therefore properly use the conservative term 'sEJC' to describe what we are measuring, all of the events shown and analyzed in this study are likely to represent only true spontaneous monovesicular 'mEJCs', or 'minis'.</p><p>For patch clamp electrophysiology on L1 (22&#x02013;24 h AEL) larvae, animals were manually dissected by gluing (Histoacryl Blue, Braun Germany) them to sylgard-coated coverslips under standard <italic>Drosophila </italic>saline (135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM TES, 72 mM sucrose). A slit was then made along the dorsal midline using a glass capillary pulled to a sharp point, and the body walls glued flat to the coverslip. After dissection, the exposed muscle sheath was enzymatically removed by 30&#x02013;90s exposure to 1 mg/ml collagenase (type IV, Sigma). Muscle 6 was then whole-cell patch clamped (-60 mV) in standard <italic>Drosophila </italic>saline (135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl, 1.8 mM CaCl, 5 mM TES, 72 mM sucrose) using standard patch-clamp techniques. Pressure ejection of 1 mM glutamate dissolved in extracellular saline utilized a Picospritzer III (General Valve/Parker Hannifin, Fairfield NJ). Pressure ejection pipettes were approximately the same size and tip diameter as unpolished patch pipettes. Glutamate leak was minimized by continuous back-pressure; no evidence for glutamate leak and subsequent desensitization of receptors was ever observed, and would be identical between genotypes. Data were acquired using an Axopatch 1 D amplifier and a PC running pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data were subsequently analyzed using Clampfit9 (Axon Instruments).</p><p>For two-electrode electrophysiology on third instar (L3) larvae (110&#x02013;120 hr AEL), Dissections were made as with first instar larvae, except that collagenase was not used. Larval dissections and recordings were also performed under standard <italic>Drosophila </italic>saline, as described above. Standard two-electrode voltage clamp techniques were used (holding potential -60 mV), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Electrodes for TEVC were filled with 3 M KCl. Data was acquired using an Axon GeneClamp 500B and a PC running Axoscope software. Data were subsequently analyzed using Clampfit9 (Axon Instruments)</p><p>In all cases (data from both L1 and L3 animals) sEJCs were detected and analyzed using Clampfit9's template-matching method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], which identifies synaptic events based on shape matching to a data-based ideal template. In <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryos and L1 larvae, small sEJCs as recorded and analyzed for this study represent a mixture of spontaneous calcium-dependent and calcium-independent monovesicular events. Changing the calcium concentration to 0 mM in the recording saline decreases the frequency of embryonic/L1 sEJCs, but not their amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical comparisons were made using unpaired T-tests or, for distributions, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.
