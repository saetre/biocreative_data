Nrp2 is involved in the regulation of many physiological conditions, including angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Previous reports have suggested a possibility that Nrp may function independently of VEGF receptors to modulate endothelial cell migration, which may lead to angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Nrp2 is also known to function as a receptor for VEGF-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which is a well-known lymphangiogenic factor and plays an important role in lymph node metastasis of various human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recently, Nrp2 was shown to play a role in cancer by promoting migration of breast cancer cells, which correlates with tumor cell metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, the role of Nrp2 in human breast cancer is largely unknown.</p><p>Metastasis is the major cause of death associated with solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Metastasis of cancer cells is a complex process including invasion, hemangiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, trafficking of cancer cells through blood or lymph vessels, extravasations, organ-specific homing, and growth. Recent evidence suggests that CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) plays a critical role in the homing of cancer cells to specific metastatic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, was found to be expressed in liver, bone marrow, lung, and lymph nodes, and also shown to promote migration of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Previous reports demonstrated that up-regulated CXCR4 expression in human cancers, including breast cancer, was correlated with lymph node metastasis and unfavorable prognosis, and was regulated by nitric oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we examined the relationship of Nrp2 to lymph node metastasis, VEGF-C expression, and CXCR4 expression in human breast cancer tissues, and further investigated the potential value or relevance of Nrp2 for predicting disease outcome. We then showed that an antibody against Nrp2 reduces cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression and inhibited CXCL12-induced chemotaxis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which were previously shown to express endogenous Nrp2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and tumor samples</title><p>This study was approved by the review board of the Wakayama Medical University Medical Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from each of the patients. Archival paraffin-embedded specimens of invasive breast cancer from 113 patients, who were diagnosed and treated between 1981 and 1992 at the Osaka Police Hospital, Japan, were selected as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. None of these cases had a family history of breast cancer or malignancy in first-degree relatives as determined by questioning at the time of admission for surgery. The patients had received mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. All women were apparently free of distant metastasis. All cases received post-operative adjuvant therapy consisting of combination chemotherapy and hormone treatment. Immunostaining for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), VEGF-C, and CXCR4 had been already performed and the results had been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Positivity was defined as nuclear staining of 10% or more cancer cells with a strong intensity for ER and PgR. VEGF-C immunoreactivity was defined as the cases in which at least 10% of tumor cells were immunoreactive. The intensity, staining percentage, and pattern of staining (nuclear and cytoplasmic) were assessed for CXCR4. The intensity was scored as low, moderate, and strong compared with background staining. The percentages of positive cells were estimated by calculating the ratio of the positively stained invasive tumor cells to the total invasive cells. Nuclear versus cytoplasmic location of expression was also noted in each sample. The staining patterns of tumors for CXCR4 was defined as high cytoplasmic expression (moderate and &#x0003e; 50%, or strong and &#x0003e; 30% cytoplasmic expression) or predominantly nuclear expression (at least 80% nuclear expression). The size of the primary tumor was determined from the surgical specimen. Lymph node metastasis was determined by counting the number of axillary lymph nodes with histological evidence of metastatic breast carcinoma. Histological typing and grading were done according to the WHO classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the Nottingham method (Bloom Richardson) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Patient and tumor characteristics are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The median age of the 113 patients at diagnosis was 51 years (range, 24&#x02013;87 years). Fifty-eight percent of the patients were younger than 50 years (n = 65), and 52% (n = 59) of the patients had lymph node metastasis at the time of surgery. Twenty-six percent of the patients had distant organ metastasis during the follow-up period (n = 29).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The relationship between Neuropilin-2 expression and other parameters.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="left">Neuropilin-2</td><td></td><td align="left">p value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Factor</td><td></td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">Positive</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Age</td><td align="left">&#x0003c; 50</td><td align="left">35 (54%)</td><td align="left">30 (46%)</td><td align="left">0.0911</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">&#x02267;51</td><td align="left">18 (38%)</td><td align="left">30 (62%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Histology</td><td align="left">Ductal</td><td align="left">47 (45%)</td><td align="left">57 (55%)</td><td align="left">0.4328</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Lobular</td><td align="left">3 (60%)</td><td align="left">2 (40%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Medullary</td><td align="left">1 (100%)</td><td align="left">0 (0%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Mucinous</td><td align="left">2 (67%)</td><td align="left">1 (33%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Tumor size</td><td align="left">pT1</td><td align="left">19 (53%)</td><td align="left">17 (47%)</td><td align="left">0.4240</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">pT2&#x02013;4</td><td align="left">34 (44%)</td><td align="left">43 (56%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lymph node metastasis</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">31 (57%)</td><td align="left">23 (43%)</td><td align="left">0.0389</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Positive</td><td align="left">22 (37%)</td><td align="left">37 (63%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Estrogen receptor</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">22 (49%)</td><td align="left">23 (51%)</td><td align="left">0.8476</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Positive</td><td align="left">31 (46%)</td><td align="left">37 (54%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Progesterone receptor</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">24 (47%)</td><td align="left">27 (53%)</td><td align="left">1.0000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Positive</td><td align="left">29 (47%)</td><td align="left">33 (53%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Histological grade</td><td align="left">I and II</td><td align="left">34 (51%)</td><td align="left">33 (49%)</td><td align="left">0.3440</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">III</td><td align="left">19 (41%)</td><td align="left">27 (59%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">VEGF-C</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">17 (85%)</td><td align="left">3 (15%)</td><td align="left">&#x0003c; 0.001</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Positive</td><td align="left">36 (39%)</td><td align="left">57 (61%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">CXCR4 (cytoplasmic)</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">37 (65%)</td><td align="left">20 (35%)</td><td align="left">&#x0003c; 0.001</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Positive</td><td align="left">16 (29%)</td><td align="left">40 (71%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">CXCR4 (nuclei)</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">42 (50%)</td><td align="left">42 (50%)</td><td align="left">0.2879</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Positive</td><td align="left">11 (38%)</td><td align="left">18 (62%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Distant metastasis</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">41 (49%)</td><td align="left">43 (51%)</td><td align="left">0.5243</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Positive</td><td align="left">12 (41%)</td><td align="left">17 (59%)</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For immunostaining, 4-micrometer thick paraffin sections were de-paraffinized, placed in a solution of 97% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min, then autoclaved for antigen retrieval. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the slides were treated for 20 min with Protein Block Serum-free (DAKO Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA). This was followed by an overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C in a humidified chamber with a 1:20 diluted goat anti-human Nrp2 antibody (R &#x00026; D Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA). After the overnight treatment, Histofine SAB-PO (NICHIREI, Tokyo, Japan) was used as the second antibody, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Color was developed using diaminobenzidine with 0.01% hydrogen peroxide, and hematoxylin was used as a counterstain. For the negative control, all reagents except for the primary antibody were used. The immunohistochemical scoring was performed blindedly by 3 pathologists (HY, RK, and YN), who had no clinical knowledge of the patients. The immunostained sections of two representative slides of each case were examined by light-microscopy, and all tumor areas were analyzed for Nrp2 positivity, which was defined as the cases in which at least 10% of tumor cells were immunoreactive.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, as monolayers in tissue culture dishes containing DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (HyClone, South Logan, UT, USA). For the experiments, 6 cm tissue culture plates (Corning Inc, Corning, NY, USA) were seeded with 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells in 3 mL of medium + 10% FCS. Next day, media was changed to FCS-free medium, and then neutralizing anti-Nrp2 antibody (final concentration was 3 microgram/mL) was added.

For Western blot analysis of CXCR4, 40 microgram samples of nuclear extracts or cytoplasmic fractions were separated by electrophoresis in 10&#x02013;20% SDS polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to PVDF membranes by electroblotting as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, incubated overnight with anti-human CXCR4 rabbit antibody (Abcam Ltd., Cambridge, UK), washed with PBS, and labeled with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Dako Cytomation, Denmark) for 1 h at room temperature. The signals were visualized using the LumiGLO Reserve chemiluminescence substrate kit (KPL, Inc, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and recorded by luminocapture (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Anti-beta-2-microglobulin antibody (Dako Cytomation) was used for the internal control of cytoplasmic extract.

The surface of the membranes was precoated with 50 microliter of fibronectin (BD Biosciences) in PBS (25 microgram per mL) per filter, allowed to dry at room temperature, and washed with PBS. MDA-MB-231 cells were suspended at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL in FCS-free medium and placed in the upper chambers of the membrane. At the same time, the lower compartment of the chamber was loaded with or without 400 ng/mL of recombinant human CXCL12 (R&#x00026;D Systems), and the upper compartment of the chamber was placed with or without neutralizing anti-Nrp2 antibody (final concentration was 3 microgram/mL).

In normal breast epithelium, Nrp2 expression was not observed. In normal and cancer tissue, Nrp2 expression was identified in blood or lymph vessels. In addition to cytoplasmic VEGF-C and cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression, that had been already reported, Nrp2 expression was correlated with lymph node status and was positive in 53.1% of cases.</p><p>Previously, we reported that lymph node metastasis is correlated with cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Given that Nrp2 expression was significantly correlated with cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression, we considered the possibility that Nrp2 expression with VEGF-C stimulation is involved in the expression of cytoplasmic CXCR4. In the present study, treatment of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, which express Nrp2, endogenous VEGF-C, and cytoplasmic or nuclear CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], with anti-Nrp2 antibody significantly inhibited cytoplasmic CXCR4 protein expression. Furthermore, the chemotactic responses of MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly blocked by neutralizing anti-Nrp2 antibody. In these cells, cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression was unchanged after administration of recombinant human VEGF-C protein (wild type or Cys156Ser) (data not shown). Endogenous VEGF-C expression may be sufficient for endogenous CXCR4 expression, and Nrp2 with endogenous VEGF-C stimulation may regulate cytoplasmic CXCR4. Our data support the previous report that downregulation of Nrp2 in cancer cells can lead to fewer metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, it is known that expression of CXCR4 in MDA-MB-231 cells is dependent on VEGF signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Since the Nrp2 antibody blocked CXCR4 expression at 12 h after administration, the Nrp2 antibody may be affecting CXCR4 expression through the inhibition of VEGF signaling rather than inhibiting CXCR4 directly.</p><p>In this study, survival curves determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and univariate analysis demonstrated that Nrp2 expression was negatively associated with OS. Furthermore, multivariate analysis using the Cox stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that Nrp2 expression was still correlated with poor OS after consideration of other prognostic factors. Therefore, Nrp2 expression appears to be a reliable prognostic biomarker. Although we reported previously that cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression may become a useful prognostic indicator for OS, cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression was not identified as an independent prognostic factor for OS in this study (p = 0.0735). Considering that Nrp2 was correlated with poorer prognosis despite no correlation with distant metastasis, it may be necessary to increase the number of cases in the future study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Nrp2 expression is significantly correlated with VEGF-C expression, cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression, and lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. Nrp2 expression may serve as a significant prognostic factor for long-term survival in breast cancer. Nrp2 also regulates cytoplasmic expression of functional CXCR4 expression <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Nrp2: Neuropilin-2; VEGF: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; CXCR4: CXC chemokine receptor 4; ER: estrogen receptor; PgR: progesterone receptor; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium; FCS: Fetal Calf Serum; DFS: disease-free survival; OS: overall survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HY conceived the study, participated in the design of the study, conducted and evaluated both the immunostainings and the in vitro assay, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
