Within the PIC, transcription factor for RNA polymerase IIB (TFIIB) determines the start site of transcription. TFIIB binding has not been localized, genome-wide, in metazoans. Serial analysis of chromatin occupancy (SACO) is an unbiased methodology used to empirically identify transcription factor binding regions. In this report, we use TFIIB and SACO to localize TFIIB binding regions across the rat genome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A sample of the TFIIB SACO library was sequenced and 12,968 TFIIB genomic signature tags (GSTs) were assigned to the rat genome. GSTs are 20&#x02013;22 base pair fragments that are derived from TFIIB bound chromatin. TFIIB localized to both non-protein coding and protein-coding loci. For 21% of the 1783 protein-coding genes in this sample of the SACO library, TFIIB binding mapped near the characterized 5' promoter that is upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). However, internal TFIIB binding positions were identified in 57% of the 1783 protein-coding genes. Internal positions are defined as those within an inclusive region greater than 2.5 kb downstream from the 5' TSS and 2.5 kb upstream from the transcription stop. We demonstrate that both TFIIB and TFIID (an additional component of PICs) bound to internal regions using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The 5' cap of transcripts associated with internal TFIIB binding positions were identified using a cap-trapping assay. The 5' TSSs for internal transcripts were confirmed by primer extension. Additionally, an analysis of the functional annotation of mouse 3 (FANTOM3) databases indicates that internally initiated transcripts identified by TFIIB SACO in rat are conserved in mouse.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Our findings that TFIIB binding is not restricted to the 5' upstream region indicates that the propensity for PIC to contribute to transcript diversity is far greater than previously appreciated.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The core promoter is the major regulatory element responsible for determining transcriptional output. The core promoter spans a region of 40&#x02013;50 bases and encompasses the transcript start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The core promoter assembles a pre-initiation complex (PIC) of general transcription factors (GTFs) in a step-wise fashion to recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Reconstitution assays using purified factors demonstrate that TFIIB is required for transcript initiation by RNAP II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The importance of TFIIB in transcript initiation was suggested by a co-crystal structure showing that TFIIB positions the coding DNA strand into the active site of RNAP II, thereby ensuring proper TSS selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Additionally, TFIIB remains at the promoter and does not track with the elongating RNAP II complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus, TFIIB is an ideal factor to localize core promoters.</p><p>Recently, the isolation and analysis of the mouse transcriptome by the functional annotation of mouse 3 (FANTOM3) consortium indicates that most protein-coding genes produce multiple transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Importantly, for most genes the 5' end of multiple internal transcripts (as identified by the 5' cap structure) localized far downstream of the 5' TSS for the full-length protein-coding transcript. It has been proposed that regulation of internally initiated and variant transcripts may occur through alternative or multiple promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we use serial analysis of chromatin occupancy (SACO) to identify TFIIB binding regions in the rat genome. SACO allows an unbiased and genome-wide interrogation of transcription factor binding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this method, a transcription factor (in this case TFIIB) is cross-linked to its binding site using formaldehyde, and the DNA-protein complexes are isolated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The DNA is purified from the transcription factor and is then processed into 20&#x02013;22 bp tags as in long serial analysis of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In SACO, these tags are referred to as genomic signature tags (GSTs). The GSTs are concatamerized and sub-cloned into a sequencing vector. The concatamers of TFIIB GSTs comprise the SACO library. The TFIIB GSTs are aligned to the genome and only those with unique assignments are further considered. The resolution of SACO is limited by the largest chromatin fragments included in construction of the library (for this library, approximately 2.5 kilobases). Therefore, a conservative estimate is that a TFIIB GST identifies a putative TFIIB binding site within a 2.5 kilobase fragment of chromatin. In the current study, the sequencing and analysis of a sample of the SACO library indicates that internal TFIIB binding positions are a common feature of protein-coding genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>TFIIB SACO library</title><p>Initially, we tested whether TFIIB binds promoters of active genes in the rat insulinoma cell line, Rin-m. The Rin-m cell line was established from radiation-induced rat islet cell tumor maintained in athymic <italic>nude </italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), we found that transcript levels of two genes known to be expressed in Rin-m cells, <italic>insulin </italic>and <italic>cFos </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], were at least two-to-three orders of magnitude higher than repressed genes (the immune cell specific <italic>Fcgr2b </italic>and muscle specific, <italic>myocardin</italic>, <italic>Mycd</italic>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

A portion of the library corresponding to 19,204 GSTs was sequenced. Of these, 12,968 (68%) could be assigned to a unique position in the rat genome, similar to the fraction of unique GSTs in previously characterized SACO libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We mapped the distribution of TFIIB GSTs on each rat chromosome to determine whether this set of identified regions represents an unbiased sample (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The chromosomes contain between 210 and 1416 TFIIB GSTs. The average number of TFIIB binding sites per megabase of DNA ranges from approximately two on the X chromosome to eight on chromosome 16. We then focused on a sub-population of the library that contains 2481 distinct TFIIB GSTs localizing to 1783 protein-coding genes in the reference sequence (RefSeq) database. An alignment of TFIIB GSTs and corresponding RefSeq genes on chromosome 10 demonstrate that the entire length of the chromosome is represented in the SACO library (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). A similar representation was present at other chromosomes examined (data not shown). Therefore, chromosome size and position do not appear to bias TFIIB localizations identified in our library.</p></sec><sec><title>TFIIB binding occurs internally as well as 5' and 3'</title><p>A key question of interest was to identify the position of TFIIB GSTs relative to RefSeq gene boundaries. We found that TFIIB occupied internal and 3' positions in addition to the more traditional 5' promoter region. One example of the distribution of putative TFIIB binding sites is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> for genes of the <italic>gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor </italic>subfamily (<italic>Gabrs</italic>). We then localized all TFIIB GSTs in the library relative to RefSeq gene boundaries. TFIIB GSTs were classified as 5' promoter associated if they were found in an inclusive region 2.5 kb outside and 2.5 kb inside the transcript start site (TSS), 3' promoter associated if they were within a region 2.5 kb outside and 2.5 kb inside the 3' end, and internal if they were greater than 2.5 kb inside either the 5' or 3' ends of gene boundaries. The 2.5 kb limit was chosen based upon agarose gel determination of the uppermost size of the chromatin fragments included in library construction (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). There is a total of 1783 RefSeq genes with uniquely assigned GSTs in the TFIIB SACO library. 21% of the genes localized TFIIB binding to the 5' UTR relative to the characterized TSS of the RefSeq gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). 14% had 3' UTR localizations thereby identifying potential promoters that drive antisense transcripts. Surprisingly, most genes (57%) contained internal TFIIB binding positions. Moreover, 8% of the RefSeq genes contained multiple TFIIB binding regions; most with an internal position. Therefore, internal TFIIB binding is a common characteristic of protein-coding genes.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of TFIIB GSTs relative to RefSeq gene annotations.

First, we performed ChIP assays to confirm TFIIB binding to 18 internal positions of 9 genes demarcated by TFIIB GSTs. TFIIB bound each of the 18 internal positions examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). TFIIB also bound a region at the 3' end of <italic>CBP</italic>. To test whether the PIC was recruited to the internal TFIIB positions, we assayed for TFIID binding by ChIP. TFIID plays a role in promoter recognition within the PIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Like TFIIB, TFIID bound each internal position tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The levels of TFIIB and TFIID binding to the internal and 3' positions were similar to that at the 5' promoter of <italic>Ins1 </italic>and <italic>CBP</italic>. No significant binding for TFIIB or TFIID was detected at the repressed <italic>HBB </italic>and <italic>IL2 </italic>genes.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>TFIIB and TFIID bind internal positions in RefSeq genes and are associated with internally initiated transcripts.

Using a modified cap trap assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we found that the 5' ends of all 18 internal transcripts surveyed were associated with TFIIB GSTs. A representative agarose gel is shown for the cap-trapped TSS of an internal transcript from <italic>CBP </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This indicates that the internal TFIIB positions are associated with TSSs. We also mapped the TSS for an antisense <italic>CBP </italic>transcript identified by proximity to a 3' TFIIB GST.</p><p>The cap-trapping experiments confirmed that transcripts were initiated at internal positions within the protein-coding genes identified by TFIIB SACO. We then used primer extension to confirm the cap-trapping results with an alternative method. Primer extension requires an oligonucleotide that anneals downstream of a TSS to prime a cDNA synthesis reaction. The reverse transcriptase extends the cDNA until it reaches the 5' end of the transcript. The resulting products are ultimately run on a polyacrylamide gel. We isolated five capped transcripts associated with TFIIB GSTs for <italic>CBP</italic>. Four of the GSTs were associated with internal-sense transcripts and one with an antisense transcript. For the primer extension assay, the characterized 5' promoter was included as a control. We detected transcripts that initiated from the internal and antisense promoters, in addition to the known 5' promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

The FANTOM3 consortium recently determined the 5' and 3' boundaries for over 180,000 unique RNAs comprising the mouse transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Using NCBI's Homologene, we identified 1462 RefSeq mouse homologs of the rat genes in our TFIIB SACO library. Of the mouse homologs, 1284 (88%) had cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) evidence for internal TSSs. We then positionally co-aligned the rat TFIIB GSTs identified in our TFIIB SACO screen with the mouse TSSs reported by the FANTOM3 consortium. Overall, with respect to distance, 84% of the GSTs were within 2.5 kb of a TSS (80% of these sites were within 750 bp). To illustrate this co-alignment, we considered <italic>CBP </italic>as an example (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Rat <italic>CBP </italic>had the most TFIIB GSTs and the highest number of experimentally confirmed TSS by our modified cap-trapping method. The rat TFIIB GSTs and the rat TSS that we identified in <italic>CBP </italic>were mapped to mouse <italic>CBP</italic>. We then overlaid transcript start positions within mouse <italic>CBP </italic>identified by FANTOM3. The positions of internal TSS in mouse <italic>CBP </italic>co-align with TFIIB GSTs and TSS in rat <italic>CBP</italic>, suggesting that the internal promoters are conserved across the two species. Together, this analysis suggests that full-length protein-coding transcripts may comprise only a fraction of the transcripts derived from a gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Internal transcripts associated with TFIIB GSTs in rat are conserved in mouse.

The mouse TSS data was obtained from the FANTOM3 consortium [11].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-8-102-5"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The TFIIB SACO approach described in this report allowed us to ascertain experimentally the prevalence of TFIIB binding and PIC localization among protein-coding genes. We found that the majority of protein-coding genes were characterized by internal TFIIB binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the internal positions represent core promoters. First, repeat ChIP assays performed using antibodies against TFIIB and TFIID demonstrate that each of the 18 internal sites of 9 RefSeq genes chosen at random was occupied by PIC <italic>in vivo </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Second, we experimentally isolated eighteen 5' capped transcripts closely associated with internal TFIIB positions from nine RefSeq genes. Third, 88% of the mouse homologs identified in our screen had CAGE evidence for internal TSSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These findings in conjunction with the earlier FANTOM3 transcript analysis reiterate that alternative promoters are a common feature of protein-coding genes. Thus, our localization of PIC via TFIIB binding suggests that positional diversity of core promoters has been underestimated.</p><p>In the last few years, we have begun to understand the complexity and diversity of core promoters that reside in the mammalian genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This is in stark contrast to the early emphasis on three key motif elements that defined a core promoter: a TATA box, an initiator (Inr) element, and a downstream promoter element (DPE). In comparison with <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>(in which much of the core promoter architecture was originally characterized), mammalian core promoters less frequently contain TATA boxes, have a lower frequency of pairing TATA with Inr elements, and many promoters, including those within CpG islands, appear to lack all three of these core elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Two TFIIB recognition elements (BREs) have been demonstrated to mediate TFIIB binding within core promoters. BRE<sup>u </sup>is upstream of the TATA box and BRE<sup>d </sup>is downstream. It is known that both the BREu and the BREd modulate promoter activity but that this effect is dependent on the specific composition of elements present within a core promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This core promoter heterogeneity has made motif analysis of promoters challenging. A recent study by Kim et. al. demonstrates this issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Using a TAF1 antibody to identify core promoters using a ChIP-coupled microarray, it was discovered that the TATA box was not significantly enriched among 10,567 active promoters in fibroblast cells. Whether or not there will be a uniform code of motifs that determine whether a stretch of DNA is predicted to function as a core promoter await further experimentation. Informative motif analysis of genome-wide studies, like Kim et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] or this study, will likely require experimental assays to categorize the vast array of sequences into putative classes of core promoters.</p><p>The most significant finding of our study is that TFIIB binding localizes to positions other than the 5' promoter of protein-coding genes. While the strong co-occurrence of TFIIB GSTs with transcript start sites identified by the FANTOM3 group suggest that these alternative positions identify promoters, TFIIB has been shown to have additional roles outside of transcript start site selection. Singh and Hampsey recently reported that TFIIB binding to terminator sequences located downstream of protein coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Instead of functioning as a core promoter to drive an anti-sense transcript, TFIIB bound at this position communicated with the 5' promoter via a loop structure. The authors proposed that this loop between the 5' promoter and 3' terminator plays a role in transcript re-initiation. It will be of interest to determine whether TFIIB binding at the 3' end of protein-coding genes identified in our SACO screen, similarly cooperates with the 5' promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results presented here provide the first genome-wide mapping of TFIIB binding in a metazoan. Because TFIIB is required for RNAP II dependent transcription, our SACO screen provides an unbiased localization of promoter elements. Our finding that TFIIB occupation of internal regions is common within genes suggests that the full-length protein-coding transcripts may in fact represent a fraction of the genetic output from these loci. Identification of evolutionarily conserved internal promoters suggests that adjacent transcripts may be subjected to regulation that is independent of the 5' untranslated region and promoter elements. Clearly we are only at the very beginnings with our understanding of the transcriptome and its regulation in higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Rin-m cells (ATCC #CRL-2057), passage 5&#x02013;10, were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 5 mM L-glutamine.
