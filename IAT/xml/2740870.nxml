The transition to new food sources during the agriculture revolution around 11,000 years ago probably created selective pressure and shaped the genome of modern humans. One major player in energy homeostasis is the appetite-stimulating hormone neuropeptide Y, in which the stimulatory capacity may be mediated by the neuropeptide Y receptors 1, 2 and 5 (<italic>NPY1R, NPY2R</italic> and <italic>NPY5R</italic>). We assess association between variants in the <italic>NPY1R, NPY2R</italic> and <italic>NPY5R</italic> genes and nutrient intake in a cross-sectional, single-center study of 400 men aged 40 to 80 years, and we examine whether genomic regions containing these genes show signatures of recent selection in 270 HapMap individuals (90 Africans, 90 Asians, and 90 Caucasians) and in 846 Dutch bloodbank controls. Our results show that derived alleles in <italic>NPY1R</italic> and <italic>NPY5R</italic> are associated with lower carbohydrate intake, mainly because of a lower consumption of mono- and disaccharides. We also show that carriers of these derived alleles, on average, consume meals with a lower glycemic index and glycemic load and have higher alcohol consumption. One of these variants shows the hallmark of recent selection in Europe. Our data suggest that lower carbohydrate intake, consuming meals with a low glycemic index and glycemic load, and/or higher alcohol consumption, gave a survival advantage in Europeans since the agricultural revolution. This advantage could lie in overall health benefits, because lower carbohydrate intake, consuming meals with a low GI and GL, and/or higher alcohol consumption, are known to be associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>One major player in energy homeostasis is the appetite-stimulating hormone neuropeptide Y (NPY) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Bell1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

These ethnic differences in total and nutrient-specific energy intake might be caused by the natural selection of mutations providing an advantage for a particular environment or type of agriculture. The transition to different food sources during the agricultural revolution, which started around 11,000 years ago, was an important selective pressure and the changes in food intake helped shape the genome of modern humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Diamond1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Under neutral selection, the linkage disequilibrium (LD) around variants in the genome will decay over time due to recombination, so that older (common) alleles typically have short-range LD and younger (rare) alleles have long-range LD. However, when an allele is under positive selection, its frequency rises rapidly in the population over a short time span and the haplotype carrying the advantageous allele therefore breaks down more slowly than an allele with the same frequency under neutral selection.</p><p>In this study we investigated the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <italic>NPY1R, NPY2R</italic> and <italic>NPY5R</italic> genes in the total and nutrient-specific energy intake in a Dutch study population of 400 healthy older men. To see whether changing environments in the past may have caused adaptation or maladaption to our current life style, we examined whether these loci showed a signature of recent selection, using genome-wide SNP data from the HapMap populations and a genome-wide SNP dataset of 846 Dutch bloodbank controls.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>NPY1R</italic>, <italic>NPY2R</italic> and <italic>NPY5R</italic> Variation and Macronutrient Intake in Healthy Older Men</title><p>Five tSNPs in the NPY2R gene and another five in the <italic>NPY1R</italic> and <italic>NPY5R</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007070-g001">figure 1</xref>) were genotyped in the Hamlet population.

We also show that carriers of these derived alleles on average consume meals with a lower GI and GL. However, the same alleles are associated with increased alcohol consumption. The derived allele of rs11724320 appears to be under recent selection in the European population, and probably originates from around 4,000 years ago.</p><p>A predicted selective sweep of around 4,000 years ago fits the theory of adaptation to novel food sources during the agriculture revolution, which started in Europe around 6,000 years ago and was gradually further developed from that point on. Our data suggest that a lower carbohydrate intake, consumption of meals with a low GI and GL, and/or higher alcohol consumption gave a survival advantage in Europeans during the agricultural revolution.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Adaptation to New Food Sources</title><p>The consumption of new food sources or the transition to novel dietary habits can lead to selective pressure when certain gene variants are better adapted to a particular dietary habit than others, resulting in a survival advantage for humans carrying the better adapted variants of the gene. One famous example is the selective advantage of variants in the lactase gene (<italic>LCT</italic>) which preserves the ability to digest lactose, the major sugar in milk, after weaning and throughout adult life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Tishkoff1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This lactase persistence is considered an adaptation to dietary change brought about by the development of agriculture and animal domestication and husbandry.</p><p>The agricultural revolution started around 11,000 years ago in the area of the Black Sea and was accompanied by major changes in diet for many human populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Kiple1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In Western Europe, agriculture was started about 6,000 years ago and was gradually further developed from that point on. Therefore the selection of the derived allele of rs11724320, which originated about 4,000&#x02013;5,000 years ago, might well have been driven by the transition to novel food habits.</p><p>The Mediterranean agriculture that developed in Europe at that time comprised livestock husbandry, which supplied much more protein and fat than the agricultures that developed in warmer parts of the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Kiple1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. It can be argued that the allele under selection in the <italic>NPY1R/NPY5R</italic> genes, which is associated with reduced carbohydrate intake, is in fact adapted to this increased amount of protein and fat in the diet after the agriculture revolution. A higher percentage of dietary protein and fat necessarily results in a lower percentage of other macronutrients like carbohydrates.</p><p>However, we did not find an association between SNP variants in the <italic>NPY1R/NPY5R</italic> genes and fat and protein intake as a percentage of total energy intake, even when we took the percentage of fat and protein together in the linear regression model. This could be due to power-related issues, because one limitation of our study is the small size of the Hamlet population. Since, however, a reduced relative carbohydrate uptake must be compensated for by increased fat, protein and alcohol intake, we cannot exclude the possibility that the selective pressure was in fact due to an increased use of fat and proteins rather than reduced (simple) sugar consumption.</p><p>Thrifty genes, favoring the economical use and storage of energy, confer a survival advantage in times of food scarcity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Neel1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Currently, these thrifty genes are maladapted to our &#x02018;Westernized&#x02019; diet and lifestyle and may nowadays be contributing to the occurrence of obesity and T2D worldwide. However, it is possible that Europeans had already started adapting genetically to a &#x02018;Westernized&#x02019; diet with high fat and protein intake after the rise of Mediterranean agriculture. The lower frequency of T2D in Europeans compared to other ethnic groups that are now adopting a &#x02018;Westernized&#x02019; diet and lifestyle supports this hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Dowse1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis is that new food sources may have helped Europeans to adapt to colder climates with less sunlight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Jobling1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can damage the bare human skin, but it is also important for the synthesis of vitamin D. This vitamin plays an essential role in the mineralization and normal growth of bone during infancy and childhood. Apart from the lighter skin pigmentation, a demand for adequate vitamin D synthesis in the less sunny northern European climate may therefore have favored adaptation to vitamin D deficiency with more consumption of high fat and high protein products like liver, fish, oils, eggs and milk products (these products contain vitamin D) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Jobling1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Caucasians living in Western Europe may have required efficient thermogenesis to cope with cold climates. Lipids from fat, but not glucose, contribute to thermogenesis during exposure to cold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-McDonald1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a recent study that investigated the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA (both parts of the DNA which do not show recombination) in 2000 Dutch men showed that 80&#x00025; originated from hunter-gatherers that already populated Western Europe 25,000 year ago (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nrcnext.nl/nieuws/wetenschap/article2030713.ece">http://www.nrcnext.nl/nieuws/wetenschap/article2030713.ece</ext-link>, article in Dutch). The ancestors of modern residents of the Netherlands had already lived in Europe long before the agriculture revolution began and had probably already adapted to colder climates with less sunlight.</p><p>Another possibility is that instead of a survival advantage for high fat and high protein intake, the selective pressure may have been due to a survival advantage for low-carbohydrate and/or low GI/GL diets. Many studies have assessed the effectiveness and safety of different weight-loss diets, including the low-carbohydrate diet without calorie restriction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Shai1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Nordmann1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. After 12 to 48 months, the participants who were on the low-carbohydrate diet not only showed significantly more weight-loss compared to participants in other diet groups, but also experienced positive changes in overall metabolic effects and lipid profiles. They also experienced a decrease in C-reactive protein levels and in blood pressure. Thus, reducing carbohydrate intake as a percentage of total energy intake results in overall health benefits, even though the total energy intake is not restricted.</p><p>All dietary carbohydrates can be digested or converted into glucose. However, there are several types of carbohydrates (like monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and starch and non-starch polysaccharides) and people's physiological glycemic and insulinemic responses to these different carbohydrates vary substantially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Ludwig1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. A high GI meal is followed by rapid absorption of glucose and rapid stimulation of insulin secretion and other hormones.

We did not use the ancestral haplotype as a reference because of its low frequency in the Hamlet population.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Integrated Haplotype Score (iHS) Analysis in</title><p>We used the web-based tool haplotter to calculate extended haploblocks around our SNPs in HapMap and the online available software to calculate extended haploblocks around SNPs in our genome wide dataset, using the iHS method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Voight1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. iHS is a statistic that was developed to detect evidence of recent positive selection (&#x0003c;30,000 years ago) at a locus, and is based on the differential levels of linkage disequilibrium surrounding a positively selected allele compared to the background allele at the same position. An extremely positive iHS score (&#x0003e;2) means that haplotypes on the ancestral allele background are longer than the derived allele background, while an extremely negative iHS score (&#x0003c;&#x02212;2) means that the haplotypes on the derived allele background are longer than the haplotypes associated with the ancestral allele.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Extended Haplotype Homozygosity Analysis in the GWAS Data</title><p>A region of 1 Mb around <italic>NPY1R/NPY5R</italic> was extracted from the imputed GWAS dataset. We used the Beagle software program to infer haplotypes from genotypes of the Dutch subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007070-Browning1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Then we calculated haplotype decay around the SNPs in the <italic>NPY1R/NPY5R</italic> region by performing extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) analysis, using R (version 2.7.1). An EHH value stands for the probability that all haplotypes are homozygote at a recombination distance <italic>r</italic> from the selected site. We started by choosing the ancestral allele of the core SNP; at this point EHH&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 for that allele. Next we compared the ancestral allele of the core SNP with the first proximate SNP upstream and looked for the most frequent haplotype between the ancestral allele of the core SNP and each of the alleles of the first proximate SNP. This meant that all individuals with the most frequent haplotype remained for analysis; all individuals with the other haplotype were excluded forever. If, for example, 80&#x00025; of the individuals showed the most frequent haplotype between the ancestral allele and the first proximate SNP upstream, then EHH&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.80 at that point. Subsequently, the first proximate allele upstream was compared with the second one and the same comparison and inclusion was done. We repeated this analysis with all proximate alleles on the upstream side of the ancestral allele of the core SNP until all subjects were excluded (EHH&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0) and we performed the same procedure with all alleles located downstream from the core SNP. We then repeated this whole procedure for the derived allele of the core SNP.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Age Estimation</title><p>We used the data from the EHH analysis of the 864 Dutch individuals to obtain a crude estimate of the age of expansion of the derived variant as a result of recent selection, the so-called selective sweep. For this analysis we assumed a star phylogeny of the haplotypes. The recombination distance <italic>r</italic> is the distance in cM/Mbp between EHH&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>x</italic> to the left of the core SNP and EHH&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>x</italic> to the right of the core SNP. For a chosen <italic>x, r</italic> can be obtained from the data. As both <italic>x</italic> and <italic>r</italic> are then known, the generation time <italic>g</italic> can be calculated as: g&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;(ln x/&#x02212;2r)&#x0002a; 100. Assuming an average generation length of 25 years, the age of the selective sweep equals 25 <italic>g</italic>. For this study, we calculated <italic>r</italic> at EHH &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.25 (support interval EHH&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.15&#x02212;EHH&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.35).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Jackie Senior for critically reading the manuscript, Mohammad Hadi
