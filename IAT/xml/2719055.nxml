Clinical features of this syndrome include severe mental retardation, growth retardation, dysmorphic features, thin and sparse hair, feeding difficulties and cleft or high palate. The commonly deleted region contains at least seven genes. Haploinsufficiency of one of these genes, <italic>SATB2</italic>, a DNA-binding protein that regulates gene expression, has been implicated as causative in the cleft or high palate of individuals with 2q32q33 microdeletion syndrome. In this study we describe three individuals with smaller microdeletions of this region, within 2q33.1. The deletions ranged in size from 173.1 kb to 185.2 kb and spanned part of <italic>SATB2</italic>. Review of clinical records showed similar clinical features among these individuals, including severe developmental delay and tooth abnormalities. Two of the individuals had behavioral problems. Only one of the subjects presented here had a cleft palate, suggesting reduced penetrance for this feature. Our results suggest that deletion of <italic>SATB2</italic> is responsible for several of the clinical features associated with 2q32q33 microdeletion syndrome.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Special AT-rich sequence binding protein 2 (SATB2; OMIM 608148) is a DNA-binding protein that regulates gene expression through chromatin modification and interaction with other proteins and plays roles in mammalian development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Britanova1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Dobreva2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Three of these individuals had a distinctive behavioral phenotype with hyperactivity, motor restlessness, chaotic behavior, and happy personality with periods of aggression and anxiety.

Subject 1 is a 9-year 8-month old female with severe mental retardation, dysmorphic features, and behavior problems. Family history was negative for any individuals with similar developmental delays. The subject was born to a 30-year-old mother via a somewhat difficult vaginal delivery following a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes. Fetal activity was normal. Exposures were denied. There was perinatal distress with difficulty in delivering the head. Labor was induced. Birth weight was 8 pounds 9 ounces. She had a fractured clavicle and some transient tachypnea and was discharged home at 7 days. Developmental delays were noted in early childhood, and intelligence testing placed her IQ below 50. She had delayed primary dentition, with eruption of her first tooth at age 2. At age 9 years 8 months she has 20 words, four to five signs, and one two-word phrase. Head MRI at age 2 was normal, and head CT at age 7 was also unremarkable. She has a heart murmur with no known further workup. Dysmorphic features include frontal bossing, a long and narrow face with a prominent maxillary arch, a class II malocclusion with relative micrognathia, slightly large ears, a smooth upper lip, and a smooth philtrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006568-g002">Figure 2A&#x02013;B</xref>). The subject was uncooperative with direct examination of her palate, but her history is not consistent with any palatal clefting. At age 9 years 8 months height is at the 25<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;50<sup>th</sup> percentile, weight is at the 50<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;75<sup>th</sup> percentile, and head circumference is at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile. She has normal dentition. The subject is very social, repeats actions multiple times, frequently washes her hands, likes to have her hair washed, has touch avoidance, has good eye contact, is somewhat photophobic, and has nodules on the dorsal surfaces of her fifth fingers bilaterally consistent with the effects of chewing on her hands.</p><fig id="pone-0006568-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006568.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(A) Facial image of subject 1 at age 2 years, 9 months.

cleft palate, and behavior problems. The subject was born to an 18-year-old G3P0&#x02192;1020 mother at term via spontaneous vaginal vertex delivery following a pregnancy complicated by maternal smoking (1/2 pack per day), maternal x-rays following a car accident, and bleeding at 6 months, followed by bed rest. Birth weight was at the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile. The subject had a cleft palate, which was repaired before 1 year of age. He had feeding difficulties as an infant with frequent vomiting. Developmentally, he smiled at 1 month, rolled over at 4 months, and walked alone at 2&#x02013;3 years. At age 21 he does not put words together and is not toilet trained. Formal evaluation at 10 years of age put his development at 18&#x02013;24 months. Dysmorphic features include a broad nasal midsection, short tongue, short oropharynx with poor movement, small mandible with crowded teeth, small testes, slightly broad thumbs and first toes, prominent heels, and macrocephaly. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006568-g002">Figures 2C and D</xref> show subject 2's facial features at age 10. At age 21 height is at the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile, weight is at the 5<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>th</sup> percentile, and head circumference is greater than the 98<sup>th</sup> percentile (59 cm). Neurological examination revealed increased tone, normal strength, and deep tendon reflexes measuring 3&#x0002b;. The subject has a happy demeanor, although he has a history of aggression at times and will pick his skin. Food is locked up because of overeating and vomiting, and he will eat non-food items. He also has a high tolerance for pain.</p><p>Subject 2's family history is significant for a full brother with speech delays as a child, but he is not having any problems at age 20. A paternal half-sister has a cleft lip/palate and mental retardation. The subject's father is of normal intellect. There is also a paternal first cousin who was born with a cleft palate and an unspecified ear anomaly that required plastic surgery. Two maternal half-sisters are developmentally normal. Learning disabilities were present in a maternal uncle and a maternal first cousin. Ancestry is African-American, and consanguinity was denied.</p><p>Subject 3 is a 6-year-old female with severe mental retardation. She is of Guatemalan ancestry, and no family history information is available. Developmental delays were noted at 6 months of age. At 4.5 years, developmental assessment placed her at an 18-month level. Intelligence testing showed an IQ of 32. On the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, she had a standard score for adaptive behavior of 56 with strength in socialization skills and a standard score of 66 with other scores clustering in the mid 50s. She does not have any speech, but she does have some signs. The only dysmorphic features present are borderline microcephaly with some brachycephaly and fused mandibular central incisors. She does not have a cleft palate. At age 6 height is at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile, weight is at the 50<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;75<sup>th</sup> percentile, and head circumference is at the 2<sup>nd</sup> percentile (48 cm). The only troublesome behavior noted by her parents was her inability to sleep through the night until she was 5 years old.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report the characterization of three individuals with microdeletions of 2q33.1. The microdeletions range in size from 173.1 kb to 185.3 kb, and each spans part of <italic>SATB2</italic>. To our knowledge, these are the smallest deletions associated with the 2q32q33 microdeletion syndrome; the minimal deletion region in the four individuals reported by Van Buggenhout et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-VanBuggenhout1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> was 8.1 Mb. The three individuals in the present study had clinical features characteristic of 2q33.1 microdeletion syndrome, including severe developmental delay with little to no speech and tooth abnormalities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006568-t001">Table 1</xref>). Two of the subjects also have unusual behavior.</p><p>All three individuals in our study had dentofacial abnormalities. Subjects 1 and 2 had micrognathia or a small mandible, likely contributing to the crowding of the teeth. Several of the individuals previously reported with cytogenetically visible deletions of 2q32q33 have had dental abnormalities, including missing teeth, abnormally shaped teeth, malocclusion, and diastema <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-VanBuggenhout1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-AlAwadi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Miyazaki1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Palmer1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Vogels1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-deRavel1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of <italic>SATB2</italic> in tooth and jaw development is supported by the identification of a <italic>de novo SATB2</italic> mutation in a male with profound mental retardation and jaw and tooth abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Leoyklang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and a translocation interrupting <italic>SATB2</italic> in an individual with Robin sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Tegay1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, mouse models have demonstrated haploinsufficiency of <italic>Satb2</italic> results in craniofacial defects that phenocopy those caused by 2q32q33 deletion in humans; moreover, full functional loss of <italic>Satb2</italic> amplifies these defects. <italic>Satb2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have small mouths, premaxillary and nasocapsular hypoplasia, micrognathia, and variable incisor agenesis. <italic>Satb2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have fully penetrant incisor adontia. Loss of <italic>Satb2</italic> correlates with increased cell death in the developing jaw along with altered expression of other craniofacial developmental genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Britanova2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The individuals reported by Van Buggenhout et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-VanBuggenhout1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> also presented with thin and sparse hair and thin and transparent skin, and two had nail abnormalities. This combination of features is suggestive of an ectodermal dysplasia, although the individuals in the present study did not have any of these other ectodermal-related features. The detection of a deletion of 2q31.2q32.3 that did not encompass <italic>SATB2</italic> in an individual with abnormal teeth and thin skin suggests other genes in the region may impact ectodermal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Mencarelli1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, <italic>SATB2</italic> haploinsufficiency likely contributes to the tooth abnormalities in the 2q32q33 microdeletion subjects, but deletion of other genes may be necessary for the full ectodermal phenotype.</p><p>Although haploinsufficiency of <italic>SATB2</italic> has been suggested to cause isolated cleft palate in humans, within our cohort <italic>SATB2</italic> deletions show reduced penetrance for cleft palate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006568-t001">Table 1</xref>). Subject 2 is the only individual in this study with a cleft palate, and his family history was significant for clefting, suggesting there could be other genetic factors contributing to the clefting. These relatives were not available for testing to determine their <italic>SATB2</italic> genotype. Incomplete penetrance has been observed in mouse models; one study of <italic>Satb2</italic>-haploinsufficient mice showed cleft palate in approximately 25&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Britanova2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas another population was reported as phenotypically normal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Dobreva2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, <italic>SATB2</italic> haploinsufficiency alone may not be sufficient for cleft palate; other factors, environmental or genetic, may need to be present to lead to clefting.</p><p><italic>SATB2</italic> also likely influences brain development, as illustrated by the severe mental retardation seen in these subjects. This is consistent with mouse studies that show Satb2 is necessary for proper establishment of cortical neuron connections across the corpus callosum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Alcamo1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, despite the apparently normal corpus callosum in heterozygous knockout mice. One subject in this report who had brain imaging, subject 1, had a normal study.</p><p>A behavioral phenotype in some individuals with 2q32q33 microdeletions further implicates a role of this gene in brain development. Subjects 1 and 2 in the present study had characteristic behaviors, including repetitive behaviors, touch avoidance, chewing on hands, skin picking, aggression, and pica. Subject 3, who did not have a history of behavior problems, did have a history of sleeping difficulties. Some of these behaviors overlap with those seen in previously reported individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-VanBuggenhout1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Taysi1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Vogels1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-deRavel1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, one individual with a balanced translocation disrupting <italic>SATB2</italic> had autism spectrum disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Marshall1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. By excluding the deletion of the individual in their study without behavioral problems, Van Buggenhout et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-VanBuggenhout1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> proposed a 0.5-Mb common deletion region at 2q32.3 proximal to <italic>SATB2</italic> for behavioral problems. However, the presence of a rather typical behavioral phenotype in two of the individuals in our report suggests a role for <italic>SATB2</italic> haploinsufficiency in these characteristic behaviors. However, not all individuals with <italic>SATB2</italic> abnormalities exhibit behavioral problems; the individuals reported by Brewer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Brewer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> with balanced translocations disrupting <italic>SATB2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-FitzPatrick1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> had mild learning disabilities with speech delay and no report of behavior problems. Haploinsufficiency for other genes in the region may also have an impact on behavior, because the individual with a 2q31.2q32.3 deletion that did not include <italic>SATB2</italic> also had hyperactivity, anxiety, aggressiveness, and self mutilation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006568-Mencarelli1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our results suggest haploinsufficiency of <italic>SATB2</italic> causes some of the clinical features associated with the 2q32q33 microdeletion syndrome, including palate abnormalities, tooth anomalies, MR and behavior problems. Because many chromosomal syndromes are caused by more than one gene (contiguous gene syndromes), identification and characterization of additional individuals may elucidate the full etiology of this syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>For the individuals with 2q33.1 microdeletions described here, informed consent was obtained to perform high-resolution microarray-based molecular cytogenetic testing and to publish photographs.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Subjects and controls</title><p>During the period encompassing November 2007 through October 2008, we tested 9,773 samples submitted to Signature Genomic Laboratories from the United States and abroad.
