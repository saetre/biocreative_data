We found that the mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line P19 expresses Hox-2.5 during differentiation by the treatment with retinoic acid (RA). Expression of the Hox-2.5 gene was not detected in undifferentiated P19 cells, but detected 72 hours after treatment with RA. In order to analyze this inductive response, we first identified the Hox-2.5 transcription initiation site and a possible promoter region. Subsequently, we prepared constructs containing various Hox-2.5 DNA fragments fused to a firefly luciferase reporter gene and transfected these into undifferentiated or differentiating P19 cells. These studies have demonstrated that a region -279 to +15 with respect to the transcription initiation site has a differentiation-responsive promoter activity. Deletion analysis suggests that the sequences responsible for this induction are located in several distinct domains within the 294 bp promoter region. Two of the possible differentiation-responsive elements were identified by analysis of DNA-protein interactions, and in vivo competition assays lend support to the notion that these regions are involved in the differential expression of Hox-2.5 promoter activity.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0214-a" xlink:role="5731"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0215-a" xlink:role="5732"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0216-a" xlink:role="5733"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0212.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5729"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0213.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5730"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5731"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5732"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5733"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0217.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5734"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0218.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5735"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
