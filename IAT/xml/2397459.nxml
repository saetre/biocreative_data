Here, we identify two members of the atypical dual specificity phosphatases (DSP), DSP18 and DSP21, that are localized in mitochondria. Although DSP18 is widely expressed in several mammalian tissues, DSP21 is selectively expressed in the testes. We demonstrate that DSP18 and DSP21 are targeted to mitochondria by cryptic internal localization signals. Subfractionation of mitochondria demonstrated that DSP18 is located in the intermembrane space as a peripheral membrane protein of the inner membrane. In contrast, subfractionation of rat testis mitochondria revealed DSP21 is localized to the matrix as a peripheral membrane protein of the inner membrane. Moreover, we demonstrate that a previously reported substrate for DSP18, the stress-activated protein kinase, does not localize to mitochondria in several different tissues, making it an unlikely substrate for DSP18. Finally, we show that induction of apoptosis by treatment with staurosporine causes translocation of DSP18 from the intermembrane space into the cytosol similar to other apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. This work rigorously demonstrates the unique location of two highly similar DSPs on opposing sides of the mitochondrial inner membrane.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>18849</grant-num> (to J.

The primary work of Reed and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>) provides evidence that proteins in the mitochondria undergo reversible phosphorylation. Recent studies have suggested that reversible phosphorylation may participate to a greater extent than previously thought in regulating mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). These findings are highlighted by the discovery that mutations in the mitochondrially localized kinase PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase) are associated with a rare form of early onset Parkinson disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). In addition to kinases, a number of serine/threonine phosphatases are known to function in mitochondria, including the phosphatases for the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) and the E1b subunit of the branched-chain &#x003b1;-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to serine/threonine phosphatases, we recently identified the first dual specificity protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref> PTPMT1, to exclusively localize to the inner membrane of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). PTPMT1 appears to play a critical role in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell bioenergetics, since knockdown of PTPMT1 protein in INS-1 cells causes a significant increase in ATP production in response to low glucose. This in turn leads to an increase in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>).</p><p>There have been a limited number of other reports of PTP family members targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) or intermembrane space (IMS). Shp-2, a predominately cytosolic non-receptor PTP can reside in the IMS. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP-1) and PTPD1 are suggested to localize to the cytosolic face of the mitochondrial OM in response to specific stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). MKP-1 is proposed to translocate to the OM antagonizing the pro-apoptotic effects of p38 MAPK on the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). PTPD1 is targeted to the mitochondrial OM via the protein kinase A anchoring protein (AKAP)-121 where it recruits and activates the tyrosine kinase Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). This signaling complex has been suggested to regulate ATP synthesis via modulation of mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>).</p><p>Members of the atypical dual specificity phosphatases are poorly characterized enzymes no more than 250 amino acids in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). In addition, unlike classical DSPs, they lack Cdc25 homology domains (CH2) and kinase interaction motifs that mediate interaction with MAPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). The atypical DSPs contain the universal Cys-X<sub>5</sub>-Arg (CX<sub>5</sub>R) active site sequence motif characteristic of all PTPs and are distinguished by their <italic>in vitro</italic> ability to dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Two members of the atypical dual specificity phosphatases, DSP18 and DSP21, were originally identified via an EST data base search for tyrosine phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Concurrently, Wu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) cloned DSP18 from a cDNA library and showed it to be widely expressed in various tissues. DSP18 is a catalytically active phosphatase with a preference for phosphotyrosine over phosphoserine/threonine oligopeptides <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Recently, the crystal structure of human DSP18 was determined, revealing a unique C-terminal motif not seen in any known PTP structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Comparison of the structure of DSP18 to the <italic>Vaccinia</italic> H1-related protein, VHR, reveals that the region critical for substrate recognition in VHR is absent in DSP18, suggesting a unique region for substrate recognition in DSP18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>).</p><p>In the current study we demonstrate that transiently expressed DSP18 and DSP21 localize to the mitochondria. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endogenous DSP18 is localized to the IMS of rat kidney mitochondria where it peripherally associates with the IM. In contrast, DSP21 is targeted to the matrix compartment of mitochondria in testis tissue and, like DSP18, is peripherally associated with the IM. Our results reveal for the first time a DSP within the IMS compartment of mitochondria.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cloning and Expression Constructs</italic>&#x02014;The complete open reading frames of DSP14 (NP_008957), DSP24 (NP_076930), DSP18 (NP_776106) (Invitrogen), and DSP21 (ATCC-9898164) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) were amplified by PCR from plasmids containing full-length cDNAs and cloned into pEGFP-N1, N2, or C1 (Clontech).

As part of a larger effort to uncover the subcellular localizations of PTPs, we initially cloned full-length open reading frames of several genes into a vector encoding a C-terminal EGFP. We then transiently transfected COS-7 cells and analyzed subcellular localization via immunofluorescence (IF). Interestingly, of the PTPs we initially examined, only DSP18-EGFP redirected the predominantly cytosolic and nuclear EGFP to mitochondria, where it co-localized with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker Red (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref> and data not shown). Mutation of the catalytic cysteine to serine showed no change in the ability of DSP18 to target to mitochondria (data not shown).

Although localization to the mitochondria is often encoded by the N terminus, the first 94 residues of DSP18 were unable to redirect EGFP from the cytosol and nucleus to mitochondria as compared with wild type DSP18 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). However, constructs containing amino acids 47-141 and 95-188 of DSP18 targeted EGFP to the mitochondria as indicated by colocalization with MitoTracker Red (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the placement of EGFP at the N terminus of DSP18 blocked localization of DSP18 to the mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>F</italic></xref>), suggesting that N-terminal epitope tags impede import into the mitochondria. The expression of DSP18 constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-EGFP antibody (supplemental Fig. 2). Collectively these findings suggest an internal region of DSP18 from amino acid 95 to 141 is necessary for localization to mitochondria and that import requires an unconstrained N terminus.</p><p><italic>Detection of Endogenous DSP18</italic>&#x02014;To verify our overexpression studies, we examined the localization of endogenous DSP18. We generated a DSP18-specific, polyclonal antibody against full-length recombinant protein. The anti-DSP18 antibody did not cross-react with the highly similar protein DSP21 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). IF analysis of endogenous DSP18 in COS-7 cells probed with the anti-DSP18 antibody exhibited mitochondrial localization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Cells probed with pre-immune serum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>) or cells stained with antibody blocked with recombinant GST-DSP18 showed no mitochondrial localization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). Similar staining patterns were observed in HEK 293 cells and HeLa cells (data not shown). To biochemically confirm the IF results, we isolated highly purified mitochondria from homogenized rat kidneys by differential centrifugation followed by histodenz gradient purification. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that endogenous DSP18 was highly enriched in the mitochondrial fraction along with the mitochondrial protein marker SMAC, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum protein marker calreticulin was removed during histodenz gradient purification (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>).</p><p>To investigate the location of DSP18 at a higher resolution, we performed immunogold labeling of DSP18 of ultrathin cryosections from rat kidney tissue and COS-7 cells transiently expressing DSP18-EGFP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>F</italic></xref>, <italic>panels 2</italic> and <italic>3</italic>, respectively) and analyzed them by electron microscopy. Gold particles were found predominantly within mitochondria, suggesting DSP18 is localized to either the matrix, IM, or IMS, possibly the intra-cristal spaces (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>F</italic></xref>). These results indicate that endogenous DSP18 is enriched in mitochondria and traffics to one of the interior compartments of the organelle.</p><p><italic>Endogenous DSP18 Is an IMS Protein That Peripherally Associates with the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane</italic>&#x02014;After identification of DSP18 as a mitochondrial protein, we sought to rigorously define its location within mitochondria. Rat kidney mitochondria were purified on a histodenz gradient as previously shown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>) and separated into the following fractions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>): OM, IMS (soluble material between the IM and OM), submitochondrial particles partially depleted of OM, mitoplasts (MP-intact IM and matrix), and soluble matrix. These fractions were blotted with antibodies against known marker proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>) for demonstration of purity. The VDAC, an OM marker, is enriched at contact sites between the outer and inner membranes and is, therefore, typically detected in both OM and MP/SMP fractions when using the swell/shrink separation method used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). DSP18 was enriched in the inner membrane-containing SMP and MP fractions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), similar to PTPMT1, a known integral membrane protein located on the matrix side of the IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>).

Because of the location of DSP18 on the IM, we sought to determine whether DSP18 was located on the IMS or the matrix side of the IM. MP and SMP were treated with the proteolytic enzyme trypsin to cleave exposed proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). In MPs treated with trypsin, DSP18 showed a decrease in signal over time in contrast to the matrix protein PTPMT1. However, DSP18 showed no loss of signal from SMP treated with trypsin, suggesting that DSP18 is attached to the IM facing the IMS compartment. The Complex I protein NDUFB6, which is buried within the IM, was used as a loading control.</p><p>To evaluate the strength of association of DSP18 to the IM, we washed either MP or pre-swollen whole mitochondria with high salt, an alkaline wash, pH 11.5, or control buffer. The whole mitochondria were pre-swollen to expose the outer surface of the inner membrane. DSP18 remained bound to the membrane after treatment with high salt but was subsequently released during the alkaline wash (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). Conversely, the tightly associated integral membrane protein PTPMT1 was not released by either treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that DSP18 is a mitochondrial IMS protein, which is peripherally associated with the IM predominantly along the cristae.</p><p><italic>DSP21 Is a Highly Similar DSP That Is Also Targeted to Mitochondria via an Internal Mitochondrial Localization Signal</italic>&#x02014;Using DSP18 as an index protein, we searched for other highly similar phosphatases that localize to mitochondria. Based on high sequence identity or similarity (69.3 and 80.4%, respectively), we identified a 21.5-kDa protein, DSP21, as a potential candidate for being targeted to mitochondria (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). To determine DSP21 subcellular localization, we transiently expressed a DSP21-EGFP fusion protein in COS-7 cells. Interestingly, DSP21-EGFP also showed mitochondrial localization when co-stained with MitoTracker Red (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). To verify our overexpression data, we generated a polyclonal antibody against full-length recombinant DSP21 and labeled cells with anti-DSP21 antibody (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). IF analysis of endogenous DSP21 showed mitochondrial localization and co-labeled with MitoTracker Red. However, no mitochondrial localization was observed in cells stained with pre-immune serum or serum blocked with recombinant DSP21-His<sub>6</sub> (data not shown). The high degree of sequence similarity to DSP18 led us to investigate whether DSP21 also contained an internal mitochondrial localization signal. We generated several constructs containing truncations of DSP21 fused to EGFP and transiently transfected these constructs into COS-7 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>). Similar to DSP18, DSP21 is targeted to the mitochondria via an internal localization signal. Constructs containing amino acids 43-128 were both necessary and sufficient to redirect EGFP to the mitochondrion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>DSP18 is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane facing the intermembrane space.</bold><italic>A</italic>, diagram of mitochondrial subfractionation as described under &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures.&#x0201d; <italic>B</italic>, 20 &#x003bc;g of each submitochondrial fraction (Fig. 4<italic>A</italic>) were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with markers for OM (anti-VDAC), IMS (anti-SMAC), IM (anti-PTPMT1), and soluble matrix (<italic>SM</italic>; anti-Hsp70 - heat shock protein 70). <italic>C</italic>, 200 &#x003bc;g of MP and SMP were treated with 2.5 &#x003bc;g of trypsin in 100 &#x003bc;l of buffer for the indicated amounts of time.

Unlike DSP18, which is expressed in several different tissues, DSP21 protein appeared highly expressed only in testis tissue (data not shown). Although DSP18 mRNA was present in testes, we were unable to detect any protein expression of DSP18 in testis tissue (data not shown). We isolated highly purified mitochondria from rat testis homogenate by differential centrifugation followed by histodenz gradient purification. Western blot analysis demonstrated that DSP21 was highly enriched in the mitochondrial fraction along with the mitochondrial marker VDAC; however, the endoplasmic reticulum marker, calreticulin, was removed after gradient purification (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>F</italic></xref>). In total, these data indicate that DSP21 is targeted to the mitochondria via an internal mitochondrial localization signal similar to DSP18, suggesting a common mechanism of import; however, these phosphatases vary in their tissue-selective expression.</p><p><italic>DSP21 Is Localized to the Matrix and Peripherally Associates with the Mitochondrial Inner Membrane</italic>&#x02014;To determine whether DSP21 is localized to the same compartment as DSP18, we sought to thoroughly define its location within rat testis mitochondria using the previously described fractionation method (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). The mitochondrial OM marker VDAC and the IM marker adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) are both found at OM/IM contact sites; therefore, they can be found in both membrane fractions. The observation that DSP21 was enriched in both the SMP and MP fractions but not the OM suggests that DSP21 is localized to the IM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). We examined its orientation on the IM using MP and SMP fractions treated with trypsin over time. MP treated with trypsin showed no loss of signal for DSP21 as assessed by Western blot (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, trypsin-treated SMP fractions showed a rapid decrease in signal for DSP21 similar to that seen by the IM marker ANT. The electron transport chain Complex I subunit NDUFB6 was used as a loading control. Interestingly, these data suggest DSP21 is associated with the IM, but in contrast to DSP18, DSP21 is found facing the matrix compartment. As well, we treated SMP with either a buffer control, a high salt solution to remove loosely associated proteins, or an alkaline wash to remove peripheral membrane proteins. Analogous to DSP18, DSP21 remained membrane-associated after the buffer control and high salt washes; however, SMP treated with the alkaline wash released DSP21 from the membrane as assessed by immunoblots using anti-DSP21 antibodies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). In contrast, the ANT, an integral membrane protein of the IM, was not removed during the alkaline wash. This indicates that DSP21, like DSP18, is a peripheral membrane protein, and collectively these data suggest that DSP21 is localized to mitochondria in testis tissue where it peripherally associates with the IM within the matrix compartment.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>DSP21 is a highly similar phosphatase to DSP18 localized to mitochondria.</bold><italic>A</italic>, sequence alignment of DSP18 and DSP21, with identities highlighted in <italic>gray</italic>, and the amino acids of the catalytic triad (<italic>D, C, R</italic>) highlighted in <italic>yellow</italic>.

Kinetic analysis of DSP18-His<sub>6</sub> and DSP21-His<sub>6</sub> was carried out using pNPP as a substrate.

A recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>) describes DSP18 as a MAPK phosphatase with the ability to dephosphorylate the p54 SAPK/JNK using an overexpression system in HEK-293 cells. Because we have shown that DSP18 resides in the mitochondria, we thought it was important to investigate whether endogenous SAPK/JNK is localized to mitochondria where it could act as a substrate for DSP18. Because mitochondria can have different protein compositions in different tissues, we isolated mitochondria from kidney, liver, and testis. Rat tissue was isolated and separated into the following fractions: homogenate, post-nuclear supernatant, Mito (histodenz gradient-purified mitochondria), and post-mitochondrial supernatant. Equal amounts of each fraction were separated by SDS/PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against SAPK/JNK, the mitochondrial marker Hsp70, and DSP18. SAPK/JNK was detected in the homogenate (<italic>Homo</italic>) and post-nuclear supernatant (<italic>PNS</italic>) and post-mitochondrial supernatant (<italic>PMS</italic>) fractions but not in the Mito fractions as compared with Hsp70 and DSP18 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). The high sequence similarity between DSP18 and DSP21 led us to examine whether SAPK/JNK could possibly be found in mitochondria isolated from rat testes. Similar to the kidney fractions, SAPK/JNK was not detected in mitochondria isolated from testes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). Moreover, SAPK/JNK was not detected in mitochondria from liver tissue, which does not express DSP18 or DSP21 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>To determine whether activation of SAPK/JNK was required for translocation to mitochondria, we treated HEK-293A cells with 40 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> of ultraviolet (UV) light, a known activator of the SAPK/JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). After UV treatment, HEK-293A cells were homogenized, and crude Mito were isolated using differential centrifugation.

Disruption of these key signaling events can increase the risk of age related disorders, cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>). Given its role in multiple cellular processes, reversible phosphorylation will also likely play a significant role in regulating mitochondrial functions. Currently there are more than 60 reports of mitochondrial phosphoproteins as well as &#x0223c;27 kinases and 10 phosphatases that are reportedly localized to the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Many of the kinase and phosphatase localizations have not been rigorously examined. In the present study we have clearly shown for the first time that a dual specificity phosphatase, DSP18, is localized to the IMS compartment of mitochondria. We also identified a highly similar phosphatase, DSP21, as a protein selectively expressed in testes that resides within the mitochondrion. In contrast to DSP18, DSP21 is localized to the matrix compartment of mitochondria. DSP18 and DSP21 are both associated with the IM and can be released after an alkaline wash, making them classical peripheral membrane proteins. Given the similarity between DSP18 and DSP21, it is intriguing that they are located on opposing sides of the IM. Interestingly, this is not the first case of two highly similar proteins being targeted to opposite sides of the IM. The yeast AAA proteases, Yme1 and Yta10 with homologs in humans, are also targeted to the IM but are oriented so they face opposing compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>). This places DSP18 and DSP21 in unique locations for regulating signaling processes within mitochondria via reversible phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Finally, our data suggest that DSP18 is released from the mitochondrial IMS after induction of specific apoptotic signals that result in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.</p><p>Previously, published reports claimed that DSP18 and DSP21 are localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). However, these were overexpression experiments utilizing N-terminal tags which have been shown to commonly disrupt the localization of mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>). Our data demonstrate that N-terminal tags block the ability of DSP18 and DSP21 to localize to mitochondria either by interfering with the mitochondrial localization signal or translocation machinery. Additionally, previous work demonstrated that recombinant DSP18 and DSP21 exhibits <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphatase activity against MAPK-like phosphopeptides, suggesting that DSP18 may have an <italic>in vivo</italic> preference for phosphorylated tyrosine residues over phospho-serine/threonine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Although preliminary data from our laboratory support this suggestion, questions still remain regarding a physiological substrate(s). Recent work using an overexpression system has suggested that the MAPK SAPK/JNK is an <italic>in vivo</italic> substrate for DSP18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). However, this is in contrast to previously reported data demonstrating no <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphatase activity against a variety of MAPKs including SAPK/JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Classical MAPK phosphatases contain CH2 and kinase interaction motifs, modules that allow them to recognize their MAPK substrates; however, DSP18 and DSP21 lack these binding motifs, suggesting a unique substrate recognition motif for these phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Furthermore, we were unable to detect any SAPK/JNK localized to the mitochondria, indicating that it is not likely a substrate for DSP18 within the IMS compartment.</p><p>We identified a highly conserved internal mitochondrial localization signal in DSP18 and DSP21. Roughly one-third of known mitochondrial proteins do not contain classical N-terminal signal sequences; yet, alternative import signals such as internal mitochondrial localization signal have not been well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>). Additionally, many proteins containing an internal mitochondrial localization signal are directed to either the OM, IMS, or IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>). For example, the IMS protein cyt c and the IM protein ATP/ADP translocase (ANT) both contain an internal mitochondrial localization signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>). This is consistent with our finding that endogenous DSP18 and DSP21 localize to the IM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). To date, DSP18 is the only DSP shown to localize to the IMS compartment, whereas DSP21 is the second DSP to be found predominantly within the matrix; therefore, they are in distinctive locations for regulating the function of mitochondrial processes by dephosphorylation of proteins both within the IMS and the matrix.</p><p>Our data shows that DSP18 is released from the mitochondrial IM of the IMS after induction of apoptotic events. These events result in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and release of apoptogenic factors. Because DSP18 is tightly associated with the IM, its release into the cytosol after OM permeabilization is likely not an artifact. Unlike cyt c, there is precedence for IMS proteins such as apoptosis-inducing factor to require proteolysis to enable release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>). It is possible that such a process is required for DSP18 release. DSP18 is in a unique position to regulate signaling processes after its liberation into the cytosol, or perhaps its release into the cytosol allows for key phosphorylation events to take place in the IMS to potentiate the apoptotic process. Further exploration of the substrate for DSP18 as well as mouse knock-out models should elucidate its role(s) in mitochondrial biology as well as in apoptotic processes.</p><p>Thus, DSP18 and DSP21 are in different, but intriguing, mitochondrial compartments to regulate signaling processes. Although few PTPs have well defined <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates, our work, which rigorously determines their location within mitochondria, dramatically narrows the number of potential phosphoprotein substrates. Further exploration of the substrates for DSP18 and DSP21 should elucidate their role(s) in mitochondrial biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M709547200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M709547200_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M709547200_2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M709547200_3.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Gregory S.
