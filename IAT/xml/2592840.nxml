In addition to these heterotypic TJs, claudin 11 forms autotypic TJs comprising the radial component of central nervous system myelin. The exact function of these TJs has been unclear, although their location at the membrane perimeter is well sited to regulate diffusion between the interstitium and intramyelinic space. In this study, we demonstrate that claudin 11 affords rapid nerve conduction principally for small diameter myelinated axons. <italic>Claudin 11</italic>&#x02013;null mice have preserved myelin and axonal architecture, but as much as a 60% decrease in conduction. They also have increased action potential thresholds and activated internodal potassium channels. These data indicate that TJs modulate the biophysical properties of myelin. Computational modeling reveals that claudin 11 reduces current flow through myelin and moderates its capacitive charging. Together, our data shed new light on myelin structural components and our understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of this membrane.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: 4-AP, 4-aminopyridine; ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; AP, action potential; CAP, compound AP; CNS, central nervous system; CV, conduction velocity; DCM, double-cable model; DTX, dendrotoxin-1; MS, multiple sclerosis; PNS, peripheral nervous system; SHK, <italic>Stichodactyla helianthus</italic> toxin; TJ, tight junction; TJM, TJ model.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The ensheathment of neurons with myelin membrane is one of the key advances in vertebrate evolution (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartline and Colman, 2007</xref>) that has enabled rapid saltatory conduction, large reductions in axon diameter, and, ultimately, miniaturization of the central nervous system (CNS). Molecular and cell biology approaches over the last decade have unraveled several of the organizational and structural complexities of myelin sheaths that previously had been only glimpsed from morphological studies (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schnapp and Mugnaini, 1978</xref>).</p><p>For example, the assembly of paranodal axoglial junctions (appearing as transverse bands in freeze-fracture replicas) requires association of the adhesion protein neurofascin-155 expressed by oligodendrocytes with the axonal caspr-contactin heteromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charles et al., 2002</xref>). Ablation of these junctions causes profound slowing of nerve conduction but minimally perturbs myelin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>). Together with evolutionary considerations (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartline and Colman, 2007</xref>), these data have led to the widespread notion that axoglial junctions form electrically tight barriers at paranodes to insulate the internodal axon segment, although the ultrastructure of transverse bands reveals an organization of intramembranous particles that is consistent with a permeable junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenbluth, 1999</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to axoglial junctions, the properties and functions of claudin 11 tight junctions (TJs) in CNS myelin are poorly understood. These junctions form the radial component observed in cross sections of CNS sheaths and may occlude the extracellular space at all noncompact myelin membrane surfaces (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schnapp and Mugnaini, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peters, 1962</xref>). Early studies have suggested that TJs contribute to myelin stability or demarcate an immune privileged compartment to sequester myelin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mugnaini and Schnapp, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tabira et al., 1978</xref>). However, recent data from the lateral wall of the cochlear duct suggest a more traditional role for claudin 11 TJs in myelin physiology involving the generation and maintenance of chemical or electrical gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gow et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kitajiri et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>A detailed dissection of the physiological properties of myelin has been problematic, and this membrane is still viewed in a rudimentary manner as an amorphous stack of lipid bilayers (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartline and Colman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Waxman and Bennett, 1972</xref>). Computational models of myelinated fibers also reflect this simplistic view but reasonably account for its biophysical properties as an insulator with high resistance and low capacitance for large diameter fibers common to the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, such models fall short in accounting for the properties of the small myelinated axons that are widely distributed in the CNS of humans and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboitiz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rabi et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, current models may lack important structural features of CNS myelin sheaths.</p><p>In this study, we reveal novel functions and properties of two prominent structural components of murine myelinated fibers, TJs and axoglial junctions. First, an electrophysiological analysis in <italic>Claudin 11</italic>&#x02013;null mice reveals severely slowed conduction velocities (CVs) and large juxtaparanodal potassium ion (K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) currents in small diameter fibers. These abnormalities do not arise from disruptions to myelin structure or the partitioning of ion channels in axons but from changes in the biophysical properties of myelin. Second, we demonstrate that peptide toxins gain access to juxtaparanodal voltage-gated potassium channels (K<sub>v</sub>) in wild-type and mutant mice, revealing the permeability of axoglial junctions to large molecules. To elaborate on our findings, we developed a novel computational model based on small CNS myelinated fibers (unpublished data). This model incorporates TJs into compact and noncompact myelin and accords with the electrophysiological analysis of <italic>Claudin 11</italic>&#x02013;null mice to a greater extent than current models based on double-cable designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blight, 1985</xref>). Our data are significant in two respects. First, they demonstrate that a major function of claudin 11 TJs in the CNS is to form a series resistance with myelin membrane and impede its capacitive charge. This function has greater impact for small diameter myelinated axons than for large fibers. Second, they indicate that axoglial junctions may not form a permeability barrier at paranodes. Together, these data shed new light on the general principles of saltatory conduction with implications for neural coding in disease states.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Slowed conduction in small optic nerve axons from <italic>Claudin 11</italic>&#x02013;null mice</title><p>The measurement of compound action potentials (APs [CAPs]) in isolated optic nerves is an effective method for examining the function of CNS white matter tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harroch et al., 2000</xref>).

First, latencies of the second and third CAP components are markedly increased with respect to controls, indicating slower nerve conduction in medium and small fibers. A statistical analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) indicates that CVs for these components are statistically different (P &#x0003c; 0.01) and approach 50% of normal, whereas the first component is minimally slowed (P &#x0003e; 0.05). Second, recruitment of the second and third components is right shifted between 7 and 20 V, demonstrating increased thresholds for AP generation in small axons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D&#x02013;F</xref>). Third, amplitudes of the second and third CAP components are diminished in the mutants (P &#x0003c; 0.001), whereas the first component amplitude is unchanged (P &#x0003e; 0.05). These changes are not associated with nerve conduction block or shifts in the refractory period (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808034/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808034/DC1</ext-link>), which are hallmarks of demyelination.

Indeed, these channels reside in the axonal membrane and are sequestered underneath the myelin behind axoglial junctions, which are thought to serve as permeability barriers to the periaxonal space. However, the fluorescent conjugate 6-FAM-AEEAc&#x02013;<italic>Stichodactyla helianthus</italic> toxin (SHK), which blocks K<sub>v</sub>1.1 and K<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels, readily diffuses through these junctions and binds to its targets in explants of adult wild-type mouse optic nerve (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), <italic>Claudin 11</italic>&#x02013;null optic nerve (not depicted), and rat spinal cord (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808034/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808034/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, in contrast to published studies (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartline and Colman, 2007</xref>) suggesting that axoglial junctions serve as permeability barriers for the periaxonal space, our data show they are permeable to peptide toxins.</p><p>The broad spectrum membrane-permeant K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) strongly increases amplitudes of the second and third components of the CAPs from <italic>Claudin 11</italic>&#x02013;null mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, bottom), which is consistent with the DTX data. Similar to earlier experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devaux et al., 2003</xref>), 4-AP also broadens the CAPs in wild-type mice, indicating that K<sub>v</sub> channels, possibly in the internode, are normally activated by APs in small fibers. The DTX and 4-AP inhibitors exert negligible effects on the latencies of CAP components (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), indicating that K<sub>v</sub> channel activity in the mutants does not directly cause conduction slowing. Furthermore, Western blots of K<sub>v</sub>1.1 and K<sub>v</sub>1.2 in the optic nerve show that K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels are expressed at normal levels in <italic>Claudin 11</italic>&#x02013;null mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).</p><p>It is unlikely that the 4-AP response stems from inhibiting nodal channels such as K<sub>v</sub>3.1 because of their low abundance in small CNS myelinated fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devaux et al., 2003</xref>). Rather, the large effects of 4-AP (compared with DTX) on the K<sub>v</sub>1.1 and K<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels may stem from the small size and membrane-permeant properties of this inhibitor, which give it access to paranodal and internodal channels. Diffusion of DTX is more limited, and it would be unlikely to have significant access to internodal channels. However, we cannot preclude the possibility of other novel K<sub>v</sub> channels in the nodes that are blocked by 4-AP.</p></sec><sec><title>Nodal, paranodal, and juxtaparanodal myelin components are normally localized</title><p>Several studies demonstrate that perturbing the structural components of nodes, paranodes, and juxtaparanodes elicits strong behavioral phenotypes and abnormal CVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coetzee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupree et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>).

Thus, this analysis reveals the unanticipated importance of TJs for saltatory conduction. Claudin 11 forms an electrically tight barrier that potentiates the insulative properties of CNS myelin sheaths; however, this potentiation is normally only significant for small axons with thin sheaths and is marginal for large axons.

In this light, an axon of 2.1-&#x003bc;m diameter ensheathed with 15 membrane wraps (the first component in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) may achieve a myelin thickness of approximately nine wraps after remyelination (equivalent to the myelin thickness of the second component in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, the range of axon diameters for which TJs are important for saltatory conduction is greater for demyelinating pathologies.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for claudin 11 loss of function in other neurological diseases</title><p>Morphometric studies show that small diameter myelinated axons are widely distributed in the CNS of mammals, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboitiz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rabi et al., 2007</xref>). As summarized in Fig. S5 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808034/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808034/DC1</ext-link>), 45&#x02013;70% of myelinated axons in human corpus callosum are &#x0003c;1 &#x003bc;m in diameter, and we envisage that the absence of claudin 11 TJs would significantly lower CVs of most fibers in this white matter tract. Corpus callosum is the major conduit for interhemispheric communication, and small myelinated axons dominating the fiber population in anterior regions (e.g., the genu) mainly connect the prefrontal cortices, whereas those in posterior regions (anterior two-thirds of the splenium) connect the associative cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hofer and Frahm, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The approximate length of collosal fibers in humans is 100&#x02013;130 mm, and the transit time for APs through small diameter axons is 50&#x02013;100 ms. A 40&#x02013;60% reduction in CV in the absence of claudin 11 TJs would increase AP latencies by at least 20 ms, thereby perturbing information processing and integration in higher order cortical circuits with disastrous consequences for Hebbian long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caporale and Dan, 2008</xref>). Thus, a <italic>CLAUDIN 11</italic> hypomorphic phenotype conceivably could include altered executive brain function, associative behavior, learning, and memory.</p><p>In this vein, several microarray studies show reduced expression of <italic>CLAUDIN 11</italic> and several other myelin-specific genes in cingulate and temporal cortices and the hippocampus in postmortem tissue from schizophrenia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katsel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCullumsmith et al., 2007</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the disturbances in perception that feature in the clinical phenotype of schizophrenia may be in part associated with the distribution of small diameter myelinated fibers in the CNS. Interestingly, schizophrenia endophenotypes also are manifest in several demyelinating disorders, including metachromatic leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and MS, for which multifocal or diffuse myelin pathophysiology is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stewart and Davis, 2004</xref>). The convergent pathology in these diseases is thinner than normal myelin, which would reduce membrane resistance, increase capacitive charging of the myelin, and reduce CVs, perhaps analogously to the absence of claudin 11 TJs in <italic>Claudin 11</italic>&#x02013;null mice. Thus, our analyses suggest a plausible link between congenital or acquired TJ dysfunction and several neurological disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>TJs in PNS myelin</title><p>The satisfying account of claudin 11 function in central myelinated fibers in this study has important implications for peripheral myelin. Schwann cells in the PNS localize claudin 19 TJs between paranodal loops, inner and outer mesaxons, and Schmidt-Lantermann incisures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyamoto et al., 2005</xref>). These sites are analogous to the locations of TJs in the CNS where the extracellular space around the entire perimeter of the myelin sheet is occluded. However, axons of &#x0003c;1-&#x003bc;m diameter that are most dependent on TJs in the CNS are rarely myelinated in the PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Waxman and Bennett, 1972</xref>); thus, it seems unlikely that PNS and CNS TJs function analogously. Indeed, several missense mutations identified in the human <italic>CLAUDIN 19</italic> gene are associated with renal failure and polycystic kidney disease but not with peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Konrad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, nerve conduction measurements in sciatic nerves from <italic>Claudin 19</italic>&#x02013;null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyamoto et al., 2005</xref>) fail to convincingly demonstrate slower than normal CVs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Claudin 11</italic>&#x02013;null mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gow et al., 1999</xref>) and maintained on an interbred 129 Sv/Ev-C57BL/6Tac background at Wayne State University facilities.

The vertebral column was rapidly excised and transferred into oxygenated ice-cold ACSF, and the ventral white matter tracts were isolated with scissors (3-cm segment). After 60 min, ventral white matter tracts were placed in a triple-compartment recording chamber.

Drugs were applied to the central compartment, and electrophysiological measurements were recorded after the effects of the drugs reached steady state, typically 30&#x02013;60 min after application. DTX was purchased from Alomone Laboratories, and 4-AP was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For recruitment analysis, CAP amplitudes were measured and plotted as functions of stimulation intensity. Maximal amplitudes and area under the CAPs were measured, and the CAP delay and duration were calculated at half-maximal amplitude.

In brief, the model comprises 20 myelin sheaths with 19 intervening nodes of Ranvier. Each sheath is subdivided into sections: eight paranodal, two juxtaparanodal, and one internodal.
