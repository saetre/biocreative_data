For Eph receptor ligands, it provides the switch between cell-cell adhesion and repulsion. Ligand shedding is tightly controlled by intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, which for Eph receptors relies on the release of an inhibitory interaction of the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane segment with the kinase domain.

Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and electron tomography reveal that activation extends the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase intracellular domain away from the cell membrane into a conformation that facilitates productive association with ADAM10. Accordingly, EphA3 mutants with constitutively-released kinase domains efficiently support shedding, even when their kinase is disabled. Our data suggest that this phosphorylation-activated conformational switch of EphA3 directly controls ADAM-mediated shedding.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The Eph transmembrane receptors are part of the receptor tyrosine kinase family and play important roles in communication between neighbouring cells. An Eph receptor binds to its ligand, membrane-tethered ephrin, on a neighbouring cell so as to form a stable complex and activate downstream signalling events. One such event is regulation of ADAM10, a transmembrane protease of the ADAM metalloprotease family, which provides a feedback mechanism to Eph signalling. ADAM10 is located on Eph-expressing cells and cleaves ephrin from its membrane tether on the opposite cell (through its so-called sheddase activity), thereby separating the cell-cell connection and allowing the signalling complex to internalise. In other biological contexts, activity of the ADAM metalloprotease family underlies signalling mechanisms such as oncogenic EGF-receptor transactivation, adhesion molecule shedding and cytokine/chemokine release. In general, ADAM function is enhanced when receptor tyrosine signalling is active and repressed when tyrosine kinase signalling is inhibited. However, the mechanism through which receptor tyrosine kinase signalling regulates ADAM10, have remained elusive. By combining fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and electron microscopic tomography of EphA3, we have demonstrated in live cells at molecular resolution that tyrosine phosphorylation of activated EphA3 triggers a measurable movement of the kinase domain away from the plasma membrane. Only this conformation of the EphA3 kinase domain away from the plasma membrane permits ADAM10 to come close enough to EphA3 so that it can reach its tightly EphA3-bound substrate, ephrin-A5. Our findings delineate a new regulatory concept in cell-cell communication, whereby control over proteolytic sheddase activity is provided by an activation-induced switch in the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain of a receptor tyrosine kinase, rather than by a cytosolic signalling pathway.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ADAM (A-Disintegrin-And-Metalloprotease) transmembrane proteases fulfil essential functions during normal and pathological tissue- and organ-development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Kheradmand1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our findings now reveal an entirely novel concept of RTK/ADAM regulation whereby the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain directly regulates ADAM activity rather than involving intermediate signalling proteins and kinase activity per se.</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that steric hindrance represents a conserved mechanism for receptor-regulated ADAM activity.

Our observation that CaM-binding to an EphA3/L-selectin chimeric receptor can also regulate ADAM10 cleavage of ephrins would seem to confirm steric hindrance as a mechanism regulating Eph-associated ADAM activity and to suggest this as a more widely conserved concept of ADAM regulation. For example, steric hindrance could also explain the regulation of ADAM activity by other RTKs such as the EGFR, which binds CaM within the JM region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-MartinNieto1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and controls ADAM-facilitated ligand shedding in an activation dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000215-Blobel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

(E) Acceptor photobleaching confirms the reliability of fluorescence lifetime imaging to detect FRET. <sup>tkRas</sup>RFP-transfected (red) Cos7 cells co-expressing EphA3-GFP &#x0005b;3YF&#x0005d; (green) were imaged by FLIM. The images were taken from the same cell before (bottom row) and following (top row) RFP (acceptor) photobleaching. Areas of the cell where the fluorescent acceptor was photobleached show an increase in the GFP lifetime of the donor compared to the nonbleached sample, confirming the fidelity of lifetime imaging to detect FRET.</p><p>(2.47 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000215.s009.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000215.s010"><label>Figure S10</label><caption><p><bold>EM of Qdot-labelled EphA3.</bold> EM images of fixed AP<sub>C</sub>-EphA3-expressing HEK293T cells without pretreatment (A) or following ephrin stimulation (B), showing plasma membrane disruption and endocytosis, respectively.
