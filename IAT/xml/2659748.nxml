We have previously shown that TGF-&#x003b2; signaling between EC and mural cells participates in vessel stabilization in vitro. We therefore investigated the role of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in maintaining microvessel structure and function in the adult mouse retinal microvasculature. TGF-&#x003b2; signaling was inhibited by systemic expression of soluble endoglin (sEng) and inhibition was demonstrated by reduced phospho-smad2 in the adult retina. Blockade of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling led to increased vascular and neural cell apoptosis in the retina, which was associated with decreased retinal function, as measured by electroretinogram (ERG). Perfusion of the inner retinal vasculature was impaired and was accompanied by defective autoregulation and loss of capillary integrity. Fundus angiography and Evans blue permeability assay revealed a breakdown of the blood-retinal-barrier that was characterized by decreased association between the tight junction proteins zo-1 and occludin. Inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in cocultures of EC and 10T1/2 cells corroborated the in vivo findings, with impaired EC barrier function, dissociation of EC from 10T1/2 cells, and endothelial cell death, supporting the role of EC-mesenchymal interactions in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. These results implicate constitutive TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in maintaining the integrity and function of the adult microvasculature and shed light on the potential role of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in vasoproliferative and vascular degenerative retinal diseases.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Formation, stabilization and specialization of the vasculature is a complex process that requires the coordinated action of a number of growth factors and a variety of heterotypic cellular interactions.

Trypsin digests of the retinal vasculature have revealed a ratio of pericytes to ECs roughly equaled to 1, whereas ECs outnumber pericytes in other microvascular beds by as much as 10 to 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Stewart1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In vitro studies demonstrate that contact between ECs and pericytes or astrocytes leads to TGF-&#x003b2;1 activation, a major determinant of TGF-&#x003b2;1 availability and signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-MurphyUllrich1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Taken together, these observations have led us to speculate that the high number of pericytes in the retina reflects a significant role for constitutive TGF-&#x003b2;1 signaling in maintenance of retinal microvascular integrity.</p><p>Binding of TGF-&#x003b2;1 dimers to TGF&#x003b2;-receptor II (TGF&#x003b2;RII) leads to the recruitment of TGF&#x003b2;-receptor I (TGF&#x003b2;RI), the formation of a tetrameric complex, phosphorylation and conformational changes in the intracellular domain of TGF&#x003b2;RI, and downstream activation of smad transcription factors. Most cell types express only one TGF&#x003b2;RI receptor, ALK5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Lebrin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In ECs, TGF-&#x003b2;1 activation of ALK5 is growth inhibitory and is thought to mediate vessel stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Lebrin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. ECs also express the TGF&#x003b2;RI receptor ALK1, as well as the TGF-&#x003b2;1 co-receptor endoglin (also referred to as TGF&#x003b2;RIII). In contrast to ALK5 signaling, TGF-&#x003b2;1 signaling via endoglin or ALK-1 on ECs is associated with vessel destabilization, EC proliferation and migration, by limiting TGF-&#x003b2;1-ALK5 EC signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Lebrin2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Results of fluorescein angiography, Evans blue extravasation, and western blotting for association of the tight junction proteins occludin and zo-1 suggest that endogenous TGF-&#x003b2;1 is required to maintain the BRB. In concordance with these observations in vivo, coculture of ECs and 10T1/2 cells led to enhanced EC barrier function, and the addition of the ALK5 inhibitor reversed this effect and reduced coculture-induced association between occludin and zo-1. Furthermore, previous reports demonstrate that systemic administration of a TGF-&#x003b2;R1 inhibitor (Calbiochem: LY364947) increases tumor vessel permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Kano1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> and smad4 deficient mice exhibit defects in vascular integrity and maturation as well as abnormal gap junction formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Lan1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the finding that permeability defects in Akt(&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice can be rescued with addition of TSP-1 and TSP-2, both potent activators of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Chen1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, further support a role for TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the maintenance of the BRB. These results suggest that locally activated TGF-&#x003b2;1 is critical for optimal endothelial barrier function and are in agreement with our previous reports demonstrating that TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced by astrocytes contacting ECs contributes to the maintenance of the blood-neural-barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Garcia1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While there was no change in the levels of the tight junction proteins zo-1 and occludin in retinas from sEng-expressing mice (data not shown), there was a decrease in association between these proteins, a characteristic feature of tight junction disassembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Collins1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, the coculture-induced association between occludin and zo-1 was reversed with addition of the ALK-5 inhibitor. Integrity of inter-endothelial junctions is regulated by multiple parameters including cytoskeletal tension, junctional protein-protein interaction and connection between junctional proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. Each of these determine the intercellular cleft size and degree of permeability. For example, binding of zo-1 to the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of occludin plays a role in maintaining the tight junction and also cytoskeletal tethering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Mitic1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas previous studies describe the association of occludin/zo-1 as dependent upon both tyrosine phosphatase signaling and also protein kinase C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Collins2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>High levels of circulating sEng also led to significant neural cell apoptosis, particularly of the ganglion cells and neural cells of the INL. The pattern of apoptotic cells correlated well with the localization of pp-smad2, the direct downstream target of TGF-&#x003b2;1, suggesting that the apoptosis and functional defects of neural retinal cells are the direct effect of a role for TGF-&#x003b2;1 or TGF-&#x003b2;3 as a survival factor. In support of this notion, TGF-&#x003b2;1 has been described in the monkey and human ganglion cells of the retina, the outer plexiform layer (OPL), the axon bundles in the nerve fiber layer; and the associated ganglion cell bodies proximal to the basal lamina comprising the inner limiting membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Anderson1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. The TGF-&#x003b2;1 precursor molecule LC pre-pro is evident in the photoreceptor outer segments, the OPL and Muller cell endfeet cytoplasm. In normal adult rat retinas, both protein and mRNA of TGF-&#x003b2;RI and TGF-&#x003b2;RII are present in the ganglion cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Ma1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. TGF-&#x003b2;3 is not associated with microvascular cells, but is present in neural cells of the ganglion cell layer, the inner nuclear layer and some photoreceptor cells. The expression of TGF-receptors and pp-smad2 in normal retinas suggests that TGF-&#x003b2; plays an important role in the homeostasis of normal retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005149-Yamanaka1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, with effects independent of the vasculature. These findings of impaired retinal function with inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2; have important implications for understanding both vasoproliferative and vascular degenerative retinal diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>RNA isolation and PCR</title><p>Retinas were dissected, and pooled for RNA extraction using a RNAqueous - 4PCR kit (Ambion).
