Here, we present an evolutionary comparison of the <italic>TRIM5</italic> gene to its closest human paralogs: <italic>TRIM22</italic>, <italic>TRIM34</italic>, and <italic>TRIM6</italic>. We show that <italic>TRIM5</italic> and <italic>TRIM22</italic> have a dynamic history of gene expansion and loss during the evolution of mammals. The cow genome contains an expanded cluster of <italic>TRIM5</italic> genes and no <italic>TRIM22</italic> gene, while the dog genome encodes <italic>TRIM22</italic> but has lost <italic>TRIM5</italic>. In contrast, <italic>TRIM6</italic> and <italic>TRIM34</italic> have been strictly preserved as single gene orthologs in human, dog, and cow. A more focused analysis of primates reveals that, while <italic>TRIM6</italic> and <italic>TRIM34</italic> have evolved under purifying selection, <italic>TRIM22</italic> has evolved under positive selection as was previously observed for <italic>TRIM5</italic>. Based on <italic>TRIM22</italic> sequences obtained from 27 primate genomes, we find that the positive selection of <italic>TRIM22</italic> has occurred episodically for approximately 23 million years, perhaps reflecting the changing pathogenic landscape. However, we find that the evolutionary episodes of positive selection that have acted on <italic>TRIM5</italic> and <italic>TRIM22</italic> are mutually exclusive, with generally only one of these genes being positively selected in any given primate lineage. We interpret this to mean that the positive selection of one gene has constrained the adaptive flexibility of its neighbor, probably due to genetic linkage. Finally, we find a striking congruence in the positions of amino acid residues found to be under positive selection in both TRIM5&#x003b1; and TRIM22, which in both proteins fall predominantly in the &#x003b2;2-&#x003b2;3 surface loop of the B30.2 domain. Astonishingly, this same loop is under positive selection in the multiple cow <italic>TRIM5</italic> genes as well, indicating that this small structural loop may be a viral recognition motif spanning a hundred million years of mammalian evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The intrinsic immunity protein TRIM5&#x003b1; provides a post-entry defense against retroviral infection, which depends on its specific ability to recognize retroviral capsids. TRIM5&#x003b1; has been locked in genetic conflict with retroviruses throughout most of primate evolution, characterized by a higher than expected rate of amino acid change, referred to as positive selection. Here, we find that one of <italic>TRIM5</italic>'s closest human paralogs, <italic>TRIM22</italic>, has also undergone positive selection in primates.

Most <italic>TRIM</italic> genes also encode a variable C-terminal domain, and in over half of them, including the TRIM5&#x003b1; protein isoform of <italic>TRIM5</italic>, this is a B30.2 domain.

However, there are a few exceptions. The TRIM1 protein has been demonstrated to weakly restrict the murine retrovirus N-MLV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.

Overexpression of TRIM34 has been shown to restrict HIV-2, SIVmac, and EIAV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. TRIM25 is involved in signal transduction leading to interferon production in response to RNA viruses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Recent evidence has suggested that TRIM22 may also have antiviral properties, although there is some inconsistency between studies. For instance, overexpression of TRIM22 can inhibit spreading infection of HIV-1 in certain cell types, including macrophages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, and TRIM22 may down-regulate transcription from the long terminal repeat promoter of HIV-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.

Under this hypothesis, TRIM5&#x003b1; will be continually selected for protein innovation in order to maintain fitness relative to retroviruses. A common measure for quantifying protein evolution is the dN/dS parameter, which summarizes the rate of amino acid&#x02013;altering DNA changes relative to the baseline of &#x0201c;silent&#x0201d; DNA changes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. By looking at the DNA sequence of <italic>TRIM5</italic> from multiple species, we were able to conclude that this gene has experienced accelerated protein evolution because of high dN/dS ratios &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. In individual populations (like humans) the actual mechanism of positive selection is the selective sweep, where an advantageous mutation rises in frequency in the population by the forces of natural selection. However, this mutation will not rise in frequency alone, but will commonly bring along with it proximal mutations (good, bad, or neutral) as &#x0201c;hitchhikers.&#x0201d; Since <italic>TRIM5</italic> has been under positive selection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, we asked how this has affected its genomic neighborhood containing related <italic>TRIM</italic> genes with antiviral potential.</p><p>We show that the cow genome contains an expanded cluster of <italic>TRIM5</italic> genes and no <italic>TRIM22</italic> gene, while the dog genome encodes <italic>TRIM22</italic> but has lost <italic>TRIM5</italic>.

To test this hypothesis, we calculated dN/dS values along each branch of the primate phylogeny for both <italic>TRIM22</italic> and <italic>TRIM5</italic>, using the free-ratio model in PAML (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p><p>In the NWM clade, branch dN/dS values are almost uniformly lower for <italic>TRIM22</italic> than for <italic>TRIM5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030197-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).

It is useful to ask whether fluctuations in branch dN/dS values truly represent changing selective pressures, or simply noise around an average value. We can address this issue by comparing the likelihood of a tree modeled with individual dN/dS values for each branch to the likelihood obtained when a single dN/dS is fitted onto the whole tree. Branch values on each of the <italic>TRIM22</italic> and <italic>TRIM5</italic> NWM trees are not significantly different from one another (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030197-t002">Table 2</xref>), because a single universal dN/dS value cannot be statistically rejected (dN/dS<sub>universal</sub> is calculated as 0.45 for <italic>TRIM22</italic> and 1.2 for <italic>TRIM5</italic>). Therefore, while two branches on the <italic>TRIM22</italic> NWM tree have dN/dS values greater than 1, we can conclude that these deviations from the average dN/dS are not statistically significant.

We can conclude that the positive selection of TRIM22 has been concentrated in the same regions as those responsible for retroviral specificity in TRIM5&#x003b1;.</p><fig id="ppat-0030197-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>TRIM22 Amino Acid Sites Identified as Evolving under Positive Selection</title><p>(A) A diagram of TRIM22 illustrates the amino acid positions highlighted as being subjected to positive selection (p &#x0003e; 0.95).

The Red Queen hypothesis suggests that this signature could have arisen from millions of years of interaction between the TRIM22 protein and viral pathogens.

Although no definitive targets for TRIM22 have yet been described, one would not necessarily expect TRIM22 to have activity against modern retroviruses since the agent that led to the selective events may not currently be circulating exogenously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Why Is <italic>TRIM5</italic> Copy Number So Dynamic over Evolutionary Time?</title><p>The cow genome encodes multiple <italic>TRIM5</italic> genes, while the dog genome encodes no <italic>TRIM5</italic> at all. It is easy to imagine why <italic>TRIM5</italic> may have duplicated so many times in cow, because multiple retroviral pathogens on different evolutionary trajectories essentially create multiple arms races in which <italic>TRIM5</italic> genes must simultaneously engage. Thus, increasing the number of <italic>TRIM5</italic> genes or alleles allows simultaneous selection for multiple retroviral affinities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. One possibility for the loss of <italic>TRIM5</italic> in dog is that another, redundant gene has largely taken over <italic>TRIM5</italic>'s antiretroviral function. In light of the current data it is tempting to speculate that this gene is <italic>TRIM22</italic>. Another possibility for the loss of <italic>TRIM5</italic> from the dog genome is that retroviral pathogens have not provided a constant selective force for maintaining this gene.

Despite the similar footprints of positive selection left on both genes, it appears that either <italic>TRIM5</italic> or <italic>TRIM22</italic> has be subject to strong (and therefore detectable) positive selection in any given primate lineage, but rarely both. One easy explanation is that TRIM5&#x003b1; and TRIM22 target distinct classes of viruses, or even different variants of the same virus. When one of these viral classes or variants is predominating in the environment, the corresponding <italic>TRIM5</italic> or <italic>TRIM22</italic> gene evolves under positive selection. However, this model requires the assumption that these different viral types never or rarely challenge the same host simultaneously. Instead, we favor the alternate possibility that this discordance in their positive selection is a direct result of tight genetic linkage due to their neighboring positions. As positive selection acts on one gene (e.g., <italic>TRIM5</italic>) and drives a particular allelic variant to higher frequency in a population, two consequences will arise: linked mutations in nearby genes will &#x0201c;hitchhike&#x0201d; along with this advantageous allele, and overall sequence diversity in neighboring regions will be reduced as this single allele dominates. This is commonly known as the Hill-Robertson effect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. The net result is that selection is weakened in surrounding regions, making it more difficult for a neighboring gene (in this case, <italic>TRIM22</italic>) to be simultaneously subject to positive selection. Indeed, several studies have pointed out that genetic linkage can limit the power of natural selection, subjecting genomic neighborhoods to more stochastic (rather than selective) changes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b056">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Despite <italic>TRIM5</italic> and <italic>TRIM22</italic> being some of the most rapidly evolving primate genes, the possibility exists that a large portion of their adaptive landscape might still be unexplored if genetic linkage is dulling the power of selection on both. Additionally, since an adaptive event may require recurrent episodes of amino acid fixation, each gene may be slowed in its evolutionary &#x0201c;response time&#x0201d; to new pathogens. We propose that the Hill-Robertson effect may explain why large, related gene families (<italic>TRIM</italic>, olfactory receptors, etc.) tend to be broken up and scattered throughout genomes, because randomly occurring re-locations of single or groups of paralogous genes may be selectively favored in order to reduce recombinational &#x0201c;interference&#x0201d; between neighbors, and therefore to elicit maximal functional diversity from the family. A corollary of this prediction is that clusters that occur in genomic regions of high recombination may suffer fewer consequences of such interference. The <italic>APOBEC3</italic> cytidine deaminases may be an example of such a gene cluster, as even neighboring genes appear to have undergone simultaneous positive selection in certain primate lineages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030197-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. The <italic>TRIM5</italic> genes in cow may also be located in a recombinationally rich environment, since we observe simultaneous positive selection in several of these genes. Even with the limited information presented, there seems to be ample evidence of recombination in this region of the cow genome: loss of <italic>TRIM22</italic>, inversion of <italic>TRIM5</italic> orientation relative to human, and expansion of the <italic>TRIM5</italic> cluster since the cow-pig split.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Patterns of Positive Selection Highlight Common Motifs for Substrate Recognition</title><p>Our findings suggest that the &#x0201c;rules&#x0201d; for TRIM restriction of viruses may be quite well defined.
