However, the molecular mechanisms of tobacco smoke exposure that lead to initiation or exacerbation of cardiovascular disease are unclear. In this study, the effects of mainstream tobacco smoke (MTS) on global transcription in the heart were investigated. Male C57B1/CBA mice were exposed to MTS from 2 cigarettes daily, 5 days/wk for 6 or 12 wk. Mice were sacrificed immediately, or 6 wk following the last cigarette. High-density DNA microarrays were used to characterize global gene expression changes in whole heart. Fifteen genes were significantly differentially expressed following exposure to MTS. Among these genes, cytochrome P-450 1A1 (Cyp1A1) was upregulated by 12-fold, and Serpine-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, PAI-1) was downregulated by 1.7-fold. Concomitant increase in Cyp1A1 protein levels and decrease in total and active PAI-1 protein was observed in tissue extracts by Western blot assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Observed changes were transient and were partially reversed during break periods. Thus, gene expression profiling of heart tissue revealed a novel cardiovascular mechanism operating in response to MTS. Our results suggest a potential role for PAI-1 in MTS-induced cardiovascular pathology.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Tobacco smoking remains the second largest preventable cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Proctor, 2004</xref>). Exposure to tobacco smoke causes coronary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Price et al., 1999</xref>), atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chen et al., 1995</xref>), and ischemic heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Njolstad et al., 1996</xref>). The degree of this risk is proportional to the amount of smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Sherman, 1991</xref>). While the chemical properties of tobacco smoke are relatively well characterized, the mechanisms by which smoking leads to disease and the factors that determine susceptibility to these diseases are not well understood.</p><p>The interaction between cigarette smoke and the cardiovascular system involves complex molecular pathways that are not clearly elucidated. The use of DNA microarrays enables the simultaneous monitoring of thousands of transcripts in a single experiment and can be used to understand complex molecular responses. In the present study, we used Agilent high-density DNA microrrays to examine global transcriptional changes in heart tissue of mice exposed to mainstream tobacco smoke (MTS) for 6 or 12 wk, respectively. Our findings reveal the repression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a key gene involved in fibrinolysis, in the hearts of mice exposed to MTS. This finding is in contrast to established evidence demonstrating an increase in plasma PAI-1 activity and impaired fibrinolysis in cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gils &#x00026; Declerck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hamsten et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Juhan-Vague et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Vaughan, 2005</xref>).

Briefly, mice in individual exposure chambers were exposed to 2 cigarettes daily (1R3 reference cigarettes; Tobacco and Health Research Institute, University of Kentucky) at a rate of 0.08 L/min, 1 (20-ml) puff per 52 s, 5 days/wk for a total of 6 wk or 12 wk, including the 2-wk lead-up period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Yauk et al., 2007</xref>). Control mice were placed in restrainers only. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by exsanguation. Animal procedures were carried out under the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and procedures approved by the McMaster University Animal Research Ethics Board.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue Processing</title><p>Whole hearts were excised from the mice, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

The lower half was further divided in two sections randomly for total protein extracts and microsome preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA Extraction and Purification</title><p>Frozen heart tissue was sliced as described earlier. Total RNA was isolated from the upper portion of the heart tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). All RNA samples showed A260/280 ratios between 2.0 and 2.1. RNA integrity was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and only high-quality RNA (28S/18S &#x0003e; 1.8) was used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray Hybridization</title><p>Individual total (2.5 &#x003bc;g) RNA samples of heart tissue from 40 mice (5 mice for each group, 4 treatment groups and 4 control groups) and universal reference total RNA (Stratagene) were used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA and cyanine-labeled cRNA (samples with Cyanine 5-CTP, and reference RNA with Cyanine 3-CTP, Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent linear amplification kits, Agilent Technologies). Cyanine-labeled cRNA targets were in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase and purified by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Five micrograms of each labeled cRNA was hybridized to Agilent 4121A oligonucleotide microarrays (Agilent Technologies) at 60&#x000b0;C overnight.

The present study is the first to show in vivo repression of PAI-1 in response to toxicant exposure, such as MTS. In order to verify that changes in mRNA levels of PAI-1 result in inhibition or decrease in its protein levels in heart, known amounts of cellular protein from whole heart tissue extract were assayed by Western blot as well as by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reduction in total PAI-1 protein was not evident by Western blotting (data not shown). However, significant reduction (40%) in total PAI-1 protein was observed following 6 wk of MTS exposure using the total PAI-1 antigen assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Although PAI-1 levels (mRNA expression) showed marginal recovery after 12 wk of MTS exposure, total protein was still 20% less than the controls.

Interestingly, levels of active PAI-1 protein increased 2-fold after 12 wk of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As mRNA expression and total protein levels of PAI-1 during the break periods did not change, we did not measure the active levels of PAI-1 in these samples. To investigate additional effects of PAI-1 downregulation, we examined total cellular tPA levels. Transcriptional repression of PAI-1 in response to MTS exposure did not affect total tPA protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also quantified the total active tPA in heart tissues using a Murine tPA activity immunoassay.

Upregulation of Cyp1A1 confirmed that chemical constituents of the tobacco smoke reached the heart, and that changes in transcripts could be measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Fifteen genes were differentially expressed as a result of the exposure, of which 3 (cytochrome P-450 1A1 subfamily a, polypeptide 1, cysteine-rich protein 61, and serine [or cysteine] proteinase inhibitor, clade E, member 1 [PAI-1]) were responsive at both the 6- and 12-wk time points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The responsive genes were found to be involved in pathways related to xenobiotic metabolism and fibrinolysis. There is a strong relationship between cigarette smoking, fibrinolytic mechanisms, and elevated risk for cardiovascular events. Components of the fibrinolysis pathway&#x02014;endothelium, platelets, and fibrinogen&#x02014;are influenced by active smoking. Smoking causes endothelial dysfunction and impairs acute endogenous fibrinolytic capacity, a mechanism by which cigarette smoking can result in arterial thrombosis and myocardial infarction (MI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Newby et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, PAI-1, a key inhibitor of tissue type and urokinase plasminogen activator in plasma, was downregulated in the mice exposed to MTS at both time points. PAI-1 is an acute-phase response gene and its levels in plasma are tightly regulated by local cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kluft et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dellas &#x00026; Loskutoff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Sawdey &#x00026; Loskutoff, 1991</xref>). High levels of circulating PAI-1 contribute to the development of MI, coronary artery disease, and pathologic thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Dellas &#x00026; Loskutoff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gils &#x00026; Declerck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hamsten et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Juhan-Vague et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Vaughan, 2005</xref>), worsen the prognosis of patients suffering from MI, and are routinely observed in atherosclerotic plaques, macrophages, and endothelial cells of people diagnosed with cardiac diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Schneiderman et al., 1992</xref>). Thus, the relationship of increased plasma PAI-1 activity and cardiovascular disease incidence is well documented. However, a direct causal relationship between increased PAI-1 expression and a known cardiac disease is yet to be established. Moreover, PAI-1 knockout mice are phenotypically normal, although they are more prone to bleeding when challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Carmeliet et al., 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">1993b</xref>) . Deficiency or total absence of PAI-1 expression in humans is associated with mild atypical bleeding diathesis and no apparent disease state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Agren et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Santamaria et al., 2007</xref>). These studies raise important questions about the implications of altered PAI-1 expression in these disease models.</p><p>Our finding of downregulation of PAI-1 mRNA and protein synthesis in heart tissue of mice exposed to 6 and 12 wk of MTS is consistent with previous work on plasma PAI-1 levels in humans examining acute effects of smoking in chronic smokers and nonsmokers. The authors found decreased plasma levels of PAI-1 in chronic smokers compared to nonsmokers within 30 min of both groups smoking 2 cigarettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ozdemir et al., 1992</xref>). They suggested that platelets and endothelial cells of nonsmokers are more sensitive to acute smoking than those of chronic smokers, and that chronic smoking causes receptor downregulation or exhaustion of the platelets and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ozdemir et al., 1992</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the transcriptional down-regulation of PAI-1 mRNA leads to decreased protein synthesis in whole heart tissue in mice. This finding, likely attributed to endothelial cell response, is a potential mechanism for the observed decrease in plasma PAI-1 levels measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ozdemir et al. (1992)</xref> in chronic smokers. Total cellular PAI-1 is much lower than secreted levels. It is the free circulating PAI-1 in plasma that is capable of binding tPA and inactivating fibrinolysis. The dramatic decrease in total protein synthesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) at 6 wk following MTS was accompanied and further validated by observed differences in active PAI-1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Furuyama et al. (2006)</xref> noted that in RHMVE cells exposed to diesel exhaust particles, only secreted PAI-1, not total cellular PAI-1, levels decreased with decreasing mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Furuyama et al., 2006</xref>), we did see a fairly significant change in active PAI-1 levels in heart tissue extracts. The discrepancy could be due to differences in the type of cells and chemicals used, or as a result of differences in response of cultured monolayer of cells compared to whole heart tissue. Future work will investigate PAI-1 levels in plasma.</p><p>Growth factors, cytokines, and hormones involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling induce PAI-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Loskutoff et al., 1989</xref>). Transforming growth factor (TGF) &#x003b2;1 is a major regulator of PAI-1 in both in vivo and in vitro models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dong et al., 1996</xref>). Oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Furuyama et al., 2006</xref>) and MAPK signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Pasten et al., 2007</xref>) are shown to downregulate PAI-1 mRNA expression in vitro. Our microarray results demonstrate downregulation of KPNA2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), an importin regulated by TGF&#x003b2;1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Umegaki et al., 2007</xref>). RT-PCR results show significant downregulation of an acute response gene JunB mRNA, a downstream target of TGF&#x003b2;1, and a small decrease in cytokine TGF&#x003b2;1, its receptor TGFR2, following 6 wk of exposure to MTS (data not shown). Therefore, we speculate overall shutdown of acute response to MTS in heart at 6 wk following exposure to MTS.</p><p>Interestingly, we also found a small increase in PAI-1 mRNA expression (relative to 6 wk) and protein levels at 12 wk after MTS exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). An increase in blood serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid counts for total cell number and mononuclear cells was also observed, accompanied by an increase in interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA and protein expression in lungs of the 12-wk MTS animals (unpublished data). These data demonstrate potential initiation of inflammatory response with continuing exposure to MTS. Apart from its role in stabilizing a fibrin clot, PAI-1 is also implicated in inflammation, wound healing, and tissue repair. Vascular events including inflammation and tissue injury increase with chronic smoking and thus may necessitate reversal of PAI-1 expression. However, altered PAI-1 gene expression or protein synthesis resulted in subtle and nonsignificant changes in overall tPA levels and its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Thus, time-dependent changes in PAI-1 expression and reversal of its repression during quit periods suggest tight regulation of PAI-1 expression and suggest separate functions for PAI-1 in response to different MTS exposure scenarios. Studies have shown that downregulation of PAI-1 reduces cardiomyocyte apoptosis after acute MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Xiang et al., 2005</xref>). Red wine polyphenols offer cardioprotection associated with decreasing PAI-1 expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Pasten et al., 2007</xref>). We hypothesize that transient PAI-1 repression after an acute event such as exposure to MTS is cardio protective and may involve nonfibrinolytic functions of PAI-1. An observed increase in PAI-1 at a later stage may be a potential risk factor for developing a cardiac event.</p><p>In summary, we investigated global gene expression profiles of heart tissue of mice exposed chronically to MTS, and following smoking cessation. We demonstrate transcriptional repression and decreased protein abundance of PAI-1 in whole heart tissue of mice exposed to MTS. Importantly, the results suggest that individual susceptibility to the development of cardiac disease in smokers may depend on early events, including PAI-1 regulation. Future work will examine the manifestation of cardiac disease in PAI-1 knockout mice exposed to MTS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was funded by The Tobacco Control Programme and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
