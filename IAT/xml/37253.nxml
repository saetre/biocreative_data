Here we have cloned a new human testis-specific PABP (PABP3) of 631 amino acids (70.1 kDa) with 92.5&#x00025; identical residues to the ubiquitous PABP1. A northern blot of multiple human tissues hybridised with PABP3- and PABP1-specific oligonucleotide probes revealed two PABP3 mRNAs (2.1&#x000a0;and 2.5 kb) detected only in testis, whereas PABP1 mRNA (3.2 kb) was present in all tested tissues. In human adult testis, PABP3 mRNA expression was restricted to round spermatids, whereas PABP1 was expressed in these cells as well as in pachytene spermatocytes. PABP3-specific antibodies identified a protein of 70 kDa in human testis extracts. This protein binds poly(A) with a slightly lower affinity as compared to PABP1. The human PABP3 gene is intronless with a transcription start site 61 nt upstream from the initiation codon. A sequence of 256 bp upstream from the transcription start site drives the promoter activity of PABP3 and its tissue-specific expression. The expression of PABP3 might be a way to bypass PABP1 translational repression and to produce the amount of PABP needed for active mRNA translation in spermatids.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x95f96d8.0x9d38018" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession nos<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In fact, gene transcription is mainly active in the first steps of this process (meiosis) and most of the mRNAs are stored as mRNP particles and translated at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c5">5</xref>). The maximal levels of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) parallel the presence of mRNP, suggesting that PABP maintains the stability and the translational potentiality of long-lived mRNA.</p><p> In eukaryotic cells mRNA and pre-mRNA associate with at least 20 different specific proteins to form mRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c7">7</xref>). The predominant protein of this complex is a PABP, which binds to the 3&#x02032;-poly(A) tail of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c8">8</xref>). In mammals the PABP family comprises a nuclear isoform and several cytoplasmic forms coded by different genes. Two mouse cytoplasmic isoforms, the ubiquitous PABP1 and testis-specific PABP2, have been characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c10">10</xref>). In human a ubiquitous PABP (PABP1) has been cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c11">11</xref>) and a cytoplasmic inducible isoform (iPABP) has been characterised following activation of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c12">12</xref>) and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c13">13</xref>). In addition, three PABP pseudogenes are present in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c16">16</xref>). As initially described for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c16">16</xref>), mammalian cytoplasmic PABPs stabilise mRNA and enhance translation in association with the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-4G subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c17">17</xref>) or PABP-binding protein (PAIP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c18">18</xref>). Shuttling of PABP1 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm suggests an involvement of this protein in nuclear mRNP formation and cytoplasmic export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c19">19</xref>). These key roles have recently been highlighted by the observation that PABP1 is one of the targets of enteroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c20">20</xref>), coxsackieviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c21">21</xref>) and rotaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c22">22</xref>) for host protein synthesis shut-off.</p><p> In the current study we describe a new testis-specific PABP isoform (PABP3) specifically expressed in round spermatids. Its mRNA is transcribed from a retroposon under the control of a tissue-specific promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The nucleotide sequences for PABP3, PABP4 mRNA and the PABP3 promoter have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession nos AF132026, AF132027 and AF315079, respectively.

NTERA-2&#x0002f;D1 and HeLa cells were&#x000a0;cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (Life Technologies, France) containing 10&#x00025; (v&#x0002f;v) foetal calf serum (Life Technologies), penicillin&#x0002f;streptomycin and 2 mM glutamine with a <italic>p</italic><sub>CO2</sub> of 10&#x00025; (NTERA-2 cells) or 5&#x00025; (HeLa cells) at 37&#x000b0;C in humidified air.

Briefly, HeLa or NTERA-2&#x0002f;D1 cells, at 60 and 90&#x00025; confluence, respectively, were washed twice with serum-free medium.

One of them (EST h08023t), corresponding to a new PABP isoform, was used as probe in order to screen a human testis cDNA library. Seven of 10 positive clones corresponded to PABP1 and three of them revealed two new PABP sequences, PABP3 and PABP4. The PABP3 cDNA (2397 nt) exhibits an ORF of 1893 nt encoding a 631 amino acid protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f1">1</xref>). The initiation codon (ATG), at position 24, is flanked by a Kozak consensus sequence favourable for translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c36">36</xref>). Three polyadenylation consensus signal sequences (AATAAA) are detected in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) at positions 2015, 2035 and 2373. PABP3 exhibits four RNA-binding domains (RBDs), each of them containing the two ribonucleoprotein consensus motifs (RNP1 and RNP2). Alignment of the PABP3 and PABP1 amino acid sequences reveals 92.5&#x00025; identical residues (data not shown). The major differences between these two species are a deletion of six amino acids (PVINPY) in the PABP3 sequence, corresponding to positions 395&#x02013;400 of PABP1, and four amino acid substitutions in RBDs I, II and III, at positions 52, 53, 102 and 191.</p><p> The sequence of the PABP4 cDNA (accession no. AF132027) reveals two ORFs corresponding to incomplete PABP proteins (data not shown). The first starts at nt 81, with an initiation codon in a favourable consensus sequence for translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c36">36</xref>). It codes for a peptide of 56 amino acids which contains RNP2 of RBD1. The second ORF (269 amino acids) starts at nt 548 with an ATG in a poor context for initiation of translation. It might code for a protein of 269 amino acids containing only one-and-a-half RBDs. In the 3&#x02032;-UTR an imperfect polyadenylation consensus signal sequence (AATTAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c38">38</xref>) is located 52 bases upstream from the poly(A) tail.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of PABP mRNA expression in human tissues</title><p>Since the nucleotide sequences of the different PABPs are very well conserved, we designed oligonucleotides specific for PABP1, iPABP, PABP3 and PABP4 (named PABP1, iPABP, PABP3 and PABP4, respectively) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke301tb1">1</xref>) in order to differentiate expression of their respective mRNAs. The specificity of these oligonucleotides was checked by hybridisation to <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA of the four PABP isoforms (data not shown). Hybridisation of the PABP1-specific probe to a multiple tissue northern blot revealed one major band at 3.2 kb, corresponding to PABP1 mRNA, in all the tissues tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f2">2</xref>A). In contrast, hybridisation to PABP3 revealed two weak but distinct bands at 2.1 and 2.5 kb only in human testis. Oligonucleotides specific for PABP4 and iPABP did not reveal any specific signal (data not shown).</p><p> Due to the weakness of the signal detected on the northern blot, a more accurate quantification of PABP mRNA isoforms expressed in human testis was achieved using semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR on total RNA. To that end we designed a pair of specific primers, 5&#x02032;RT and 3&#x02032;RT, which were able to amplify fragments of different sizes for the four human PABPs in the same reaction sample (see Materials and Methods). A characteristic electrophoretic profile of the amplified products is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f2">2</xref>B. As expected, PABP1 and PABP3 are the two major PABP mRNA isoforms expressed in human testis. Based on 11 independent experiments, the amount of PABP3 mRNA represents 18.8 &#x000b1; 5.2&#x00025; of the PABP1 messenger level, whereas PABP4 and iPABP mRNA expression represent only 1.77 &#x000b1; 0.57 and 5.5 &#x000b1; 0.06&#x00025; of those of PABP1, respectively. These results are in agreement with the northern blot analyses, in which these latter two mRNAs were undetectable.</p><p> The PABP1 and PABP3 mRNAs were localised by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation on human adult testis sections using PABP1- and PABP3-specific oligonucleotide probes, respectively. PABP1 mRNA was strongly expressed in round spermatids and to a lesser extent in pachytene spermatocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f3">3</xref>A and B). In contrast, PABP3 mRNA was only detected in round spermatids and at a lower level as compared to PABP1 (24 h revelation as compared to 6 h for PABP1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f3">3</xref>C and D). No signal was observed with the control sense oligonucleotide 5&#x02032;RT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f3">3</xref>E and F).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis of PABP3</title><p>In order to demonstrate the presence of PABP3 in testis we raised antibodies against oligopeptide 3 (CAVPNQRAP, amino acids 391&#x02013;398 of PABP3) elongated with a Cys at the N-terminal end. This sequence is specific for PABP3 as compared to PABP1, since six amino acids (PVINPY) are inserted in PABP1 at position 391. These antibodies were used to detect PAPB3 on a western blot of testis and liver extracts. Liver was used as a negative control, since no PABP3 mRNA was detected in this tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f2">2</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f4">4</xref>, these antibodies recognised a band in testis at 70 kDa but no signal in liver extracts. This band was competed out by an excess of peptide 3 (used to raise the antibodies), whereas an excess of peptide 1 (specific for PABP1) did not alter the specific signal. This analysis clearly established the presence of PABP3 in human testis.</p></sec><sec><title>PABP synthesis and binding to RNA homopolymers</title><p>In order to demonstrate the functionality of PABP3, we compared its ability to bind RNA homopolymers with that of PABP1 and iPABP. We synthesised mRNAs corresponding to PABP1, iPABP and PABP3 and to the luciferase control. These mRNAs were translated in the presence of &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine and the labelled proteins were analysed on SDS&#x02013;acrylamide gels (data not shown). For each sense RNA we observed a band corresponding to a protein of the expected size from the length of the different ORFs (PABP1, 70.3 kDa; iPABP, 72.4 kDa; PABP3m 70.1 kDa). No labelled protein was detected when antisense RNA was used as template.</p><p> In a second step we determined whether these proteins were able to bind poly(A)&#x02013;Sepharose. In order to estimate the relative affinities of each PABP for the polymer each of the three PABPs was incubated in the presence of poly(A)&#x02013;Sepharose in a buffer containing increasing KCl concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f5">5</xref>A). PABP3 exhibited optimal binding at 0.5&#x02013;1 M KCl and a strong decrease in affinity at 2 M KCl. iPABP exhibited maximal binding activity at 0.1 and 0.5 M KCl and a sharp decrease at 1 and 2 M KCl. Binding of PABP1 was optimal at 1 M KCl and was only slightly affected at 2 M KCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f5">5</xref>A). The decrease in binding of PABP3 and PABP1 to the poly(A) homopolymer in the presence of 1 and 2 M KCl was evaluated as 78 and 32&#x00025;, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f5">5</xref>B). The binding properties of PABP1 and iPABP were compatible with the results obtained by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c31">31</xref>). The three PABPs were also incubated with poly(A)&#x02013;Sepharose in 1 M KCl binding buffer in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of ribohomopolymers &#x0005b;poly(U), poly(A), poly(G) and poly(C)&#x0005d; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f5">5</xref>A). The competition by purified soluble poly(U) for binding of PABP to poly(A)&#x02013;Sepharose appears slightly more efficient for PABP3 and iPABP than for PABP1. For each PABP an increased binding to poly(A)&#x02013;Sepharose was observed in the presence of poly(G). Under these experimental conditions we did not observe any non-specific binding of luciferase to poly(A)&#x02013;Sepharose or of PABP to Sepharose 4B (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic analysis of PABP3 and PABP4 sequences</title><p>Recently Kleene<italic> et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c39">39</xref>) reported that mouse testis PABP2 is encoded by an intronless gene. In order to determine whether the human testis-specific PABP3 gene might also be an intronless gene, we amplified the PABP1 and PABP3 genomic sequences using a set of oligonucleotides designed to clone the ORFs. The specific fragments were revealed by hybridisation with oligonucleotides specific for PABP1 and PABP3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f6">6</xref>). We obtained a 23 kb genomic PABP1 fragment as expected from the human PABP1 gene sequence. The same set of oligonucleotides amplified a 2 kb band on the PABP1 plasmid. In contrast, a fragment of 1.9 kb was amplified from genomic DNA or plasmid cDNA using the PAPBP3-specific oligonucleotide, a result which is compatible with the presence of an intronless gene. The lack of an amplified fragment on genomic DNA using primers T7 and 3&#x02032;ORF indicated that the signal cannot arise from genomic DNA contamination by the plasmid. The recent availability of a working draft of human chromosome 13 (accession no. AL359757.4), on which the PABP3 gene is located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c33">33</xref>), confirmed that this gene is intronless. We also determined that the PABP4 pseudogene is intronless (data not shown)</p></sec><sec><title>5&#x02032;-End cloning of PABP3 mRNA</title><p>In order to determine whether PABP3 cDNA corresponded to a full-length mRNA the oligonucleotide RACE (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke301tb1">1</xref>) was hybridised to human testis poly(A) mRNA and the extension products cloned. The sequence of 25 clones revealed four potential initiation start sites located 26, 40, 42 and 58 bp upstream from the initiator ATG, extending the PABP3 cDNA by a maximum of 35 nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f7">7</xref>). Therefore, the 5&#x02032;-UTR of PABP3 is expected to be very short and it should be noted that it does not contain any poly(A) stretches as described for PABP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c14">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and characterisation of the promoter region of the PABP3 gene</title><p>Screening of a human genomic library for the PABP3 gene resulted in isolation of two positive BAC clones. They contained a 100 and a 150 kb insert, respectively, each including a 3.5 kb <italic>Sph</italic>I fragment that hybridised to oligonucleotide Seq1 specific for the extremity of the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the PAPB3 cDNA. This fragment rearranged systematically during subcloning. Therefore, we sequenced the BAC insert as described in Materials and Methods up to 556 bp upstream from the initiator ATG. This fragment was cloned by PCR and its sequence is reported in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f7">7</xref>. Alignment of the PABP3 cDNA with this genomic fragment showed that 23 nt of its 5&#x02032;-UTR and a further 35 nt determined by primer extension were contiguous on the gene and lay within a single exon.</p><p> S1 nuclease protection analysis of this genomic DNA fragment by hybridisation to poly(A) mRNA from human testis resulted in protection of a 239 bp fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f8">8</xref>). The 5&#x02032;-end of this fragment maps exactly at the 5&#x02032;-end of the longest PABP3 cDNA obtained by primer extension of the PABP3 mRNA, located 58 nt upstream of the initiation codon. As expected, no DNA fragment was protected by hybridisation of the probe with liver poly(A) mRNA, which does not contain PABP3 mRNA. The specificity of this S1 nuclease experiment was also confirmed by the protection obtained by hybridisation to a synthetic PABP3 mRNA (240 bp) and not to PABP1 mRNA (data not shown). This experiment identifies the start site of PABP3 mRNA and therefore the promoter region of this gene. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f7">7</xref>, this region revealed several consensus sequences: AP4 (&#x02013;456, &#x02013;241, &#x02013;216, &#x02013;205, &#x02013;202, &#x02013;125, &#x02013;108); HNF3&#x003b2; (&#x02013;406, &#x02013;391, &#x02013;326); GFI1 (&#x02013;281, &#x02013;267); NF1 (&#x02013;227, &#x02013;220); AP2 (&#x02013;219, &#x02013;131); MYB (&#x02013;83). Other consensus sequences are mentioned in the legend to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f7">7</xref>. CpG residues represent 21.6&#x00025; of the nucleotides between bases 1 and &#x02013;256 of the promoter and 0.8&#x00025; further upstream. Alignment of the human PABP3 promoter with the human PABP1 and mouse PABP2 promoters revealed that the first 277 bp of the promoter of the PAPB3 gene exhibit 91.4&#x00025; identity with the 5&#x02032;-UTR of PABP1 mRNA and that the promoter of the human testis PABP3 has an initiation start site located 100 bp downstream as compared to the putative start site of the mouse PABP2 gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Promoter activity of the genomic sequence flanking the PABP3 mRNA start site</title><p>The promoter activity of the 498 bp sequence flanking the PABP3 mRNA start site was assessed for its ability to drive expression of an EGFP reporter gene in transiently transfected NTERA-2 cells, which express endogenous PABP3 mRNA as demonstrated by RT&#x02013;PCR (data not shown). The shortest construct (&#x02013;130, &#x0002b;1) drove low but significant activity in NTERA-2 cells, which represented 1.42 &#x000b1; 1.02&#x00025; of the activity driven by the CMV promoter in the same cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke301f9">9</xref>). Extension of this construct up to residue &#x02013;256 resulted in a 14-fold increase (19.87 &#x000b1; 3.99&#x00025;) in EGFP fluorescence in NTERA-2 cells, activity of the construct dropped to 6.43 &#x000b1; 1.8&#x00025; of the control when it was extended to &#x02013;443 bp, whereas a further extension of the sequence up to &#x02013;498 bp induced an increase in EGFP fluorescence up to 12.2 &#x000b1; 0.77&#x00025; of the activity driven by the CMV promoter. As a negative control we used HeLa cells, which do not express PABP3 mRNA as assessed by RT&#x02013;PCR (data not shown). Transfection of these cells with EGFP under control of the CMV promoter exhibited four times more activity than in NTERA-2 cells. Following transfection of the different PABP3 promoter constructs into HeLa cells only the P2 construct exhibited a very weak promoter activity (2.42 &#x000b1; 0.44&#x00025; of the control). These data demonstrate that the &#x02013;498 nucleotide sequence upstream from the transcription start site of the PAPB3 mRNA contains all the elements necessary for cell-specific expression of the PABP3 promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have characterised two novel PABP mRNAs (PABP3 and PABP4), isolated from human testis, which exhibit strong similarities to human PABP1. Sequence analysis of the PABP4 mRNA reveals an ORF encoding a truncated protein of 56 amino acids which contains only half of RBDI (RNP2) and is unable to bind to ribohomopolymers. Therefore, the PABP4 gene, which encodes a non-functional protein, should be considered as a pseudogene.</p><p> More interestingly, we identified a new functional PABP in human testis (PABP3) which is under the control of a cell-specific promoter. PABP3 is highly similar to the ubiquitous human PABP1. These two proteins differ mainly by four amino acid changes in the RBDs and by deletion of 18 nt in PABP3 as compared to PABP1, which eliminates the PVINPY sequence in PABP3. This motif is located immediately upstream from the proline-rich region involved in protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c18">18</xref>). Therefore, PABP3 might display specific properties in its interaction with other proteins, such as translation initiation factors or viral proteins.</p><p> Northern blot revealed two testis-specific PABP3 mRNAs (2.5 and 2.1 kb). Three polyadenylation signals are present in the PAPB3 cDNA sequence located at positions 2015, 2035 and 2373. The mRNA that we cloned was polyadenylated at the last site, but we cloned a shorter PABP3 cDNA which used the first polyadenylation signal located 358 bp upstream. Therefore, it is very likely that the 2.1 and the 2.5 kb PABP3 mRNA species are generated by alternative polyadenylation. A similar situation exists for PABP1 mRNA, which contains two polyadenylation signals at nt 2507 and 2823 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c11">11</xref>). Of 270 PABP1 ESTs in the dbest database, 90 were generated from transcripts polyadenylated at the upstream site and 180 were generated from transcripts polyadenylated at the downstream site.</p><p> Due to high similarities among the human PABP species we analysed PABP expression using specific oligonucleotides for detection of specific PABP transcripts by northern blotting and by semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR. PABP1 mRNA is the major transcript in human testis, as well as in other tissues, whereas PABP3 expression appears to be testis-specific, where it represents 18&#x00025; of PABP mRNA; no signals were observed for PABP4 and iPABP. Using semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR it was determined that iPABP mRNA represented &#x0003c;7&#x00025; of the PABP1 mRNA level in human testis. This result differs from those of Yang<italic> et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c12">12</xref>), who reported that both PABP1 and iPABP mRNA were expressed at similar levels in all human tissues tested, including testis. This discrepancy might result from cross-hybridisation between the PABP probes, since they used a cDNA probe.</p><p> We have demonstrated that PABP1 and PABP3 are expressed in spermatogenic cells at different differentiation stages. Human PABP1 is expressed in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, whereas expression of the specific testis isoform appears later in spermatogenesis and is restricted to round spermatids. The distribution of PAPB mRNA in human testis differs slightly from the PABP mRNA expression reported in mouse testis, where PABP1 and testis-specific PABP2 mRNA co-localised in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c10">10</xref>).</p><p> Human PABP3 binds to poly(A) sequences with a lower affinity than PABP1. This can be related to the amino acid substitutions detected in the different RBDs, however, we did not observe any of the tyrosine substitutions described in mouse testis PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c10">10</xref>) which were reported to decrease binding to poly(A). As for other PABPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c40">40</xref>), poly(A) binding to PABP3 is adversely affected by poly(C) and poly(U), whereas poly(G) enhances poly(A) binding activity. This might result from a poly(G)-binding site on PABP, located in RBD III and&#x0002f;or IV and distinct from the poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c30">30</xref>). Binding of poly(G) would promote conformational changes in the protein leading to an increased affinity of the poly(A) sites of the first two RBDs.</p><p> Human testis-specific PABP3 and PABP4 mRNAs are transcribed from intronless genes which very likely correspond to retroposons. Expression of functional retroposons is a common phenomenon in meiotic and haploid spermatogenic cells, as pointed out by Kleene <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c39">39</xref>). The gene tree of 21 PABP sequences from various species (data not shown) revealed that the human PABP3 and PABP4 genes appeared independently of the mouse testis-specific retroposon PABP2. These genes likely derive from PABP1, which exhibits 94 and 87&#x00025; identity with the human PABP3 and PABP4 sequences, respectively. Based on these similarities, PABP4 might have appeared before PABP3.</p><p> We have identified the transcription start site on the PABP3 gene by 5&#x02032;-RACE and S1 mapping. Several constructs of the genomic region with this start site were conjugated with an EGFP reporter gene and transfected into NTERA-2 and HeLa cells. From these experiments it appears that the PABP3 promoter is tissue-specific, since it was not functional in HeLa cells, although these cells expressed the control CMV&#x0002f;pEGFP construct at a very high level. The region (&#x02013;130, &#x0002b;1) is sufficient to drive low, but significant activity in NTERA-2 cells, but not in HeLa cells. Interestingly, a myb-binding site, able to bind A-myb and possibly involved in the proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c43">43</xref>), is located in this sequence. Activation of this myb element could play a role in the tissue-specific expression of the PABP3 promoter, as has been suggested for other testis-specific genes such as PGK-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c44">44</xref>) and Hsp70-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c45">45</xref>). An extension of the promoter sequence up to nt 256 upstream from the initiation start site strongly induces promoter activity, up to 20&#x00025; of the activity of the control CMV&#x0002f;pEGFP. This region contains four AP4, two AP2 and one NF1 binding sequence. Binding of ubiquitous factors to this region could depend on the presence of other interacting testis-specific factors, as proposed for the mouse Tcp-10bt gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c46">46</xref>). A further extension of the promoter sequence up to &#x02013;446 inhibits promoter activity. This region contains a well-conserved site for Gf-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c47">47</xref>), a transcriptional repressor described in a large series of genes encoding various cytokines and regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the decrease in promoter activity of the longest construct might result from an interaction with Gfi-1. Finally, it should be pointed out that the PABP3 gene is transcribed from a CpG-rich promoter. Several germline-specific genes with CpG-rich promoters, such as MAGE-AI and LAGE-I, are largely unmethylated in male germ cells and methylated in somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c48">48</xref>). Such a lack of methylation in testis would be sufficient to explain the testis specificity of the PABP3 promoter.</p><p> Interestingly, the 256 bp upstream from the initiation start site of the PABP3 gene, which display the highest promoter activity, exhibit &#x0003e;91&#x00025; identity with the 5&#x02032;-UTR of PABP1 mRNA. This indicates that the 5&#x02032;-UTR of this PAPB1 mRNA contains a potential promoter sequence for testis-specific expression. Until now there has been no evidence that this region functions as an alternative promoter for the PABP1 gene. Thus, it is likely that the region from 256 bp upstream of the PABP3 promoter plays a crucial role in commitment of this promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. A mouse testis-specific PABP2 gene has also been described, but the promoter functionality and specificity of this gene has not yet been analysed. Its transcription start&#x000a0;site would correspond to position &#x02013;108 of the PABP3 promoter and, therefore, it lacks the region where we observed a myb-binding sequence. As for the PABP3 promoter, it exhibits AP2-binding sites susceptible to direct transcription in spermatogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c49">49</xref>).</p><p> The presence of a functional PABP3 isoform in spermatogenic cells might contribute to testis-specific regulation of mRNA homeostasis. In meiotic and early haploid cells, stages at which many mRNAs are synthesised, PABP mRNAs are present at a high level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c50">50</xref>). Nevertheless, most of the testicular PABP mRNAs are not engaged in polysomes, indicating that translation of PABP mRNAs is strongly repressed at these stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c51">51</xref>). However, this repression might be specific for PABP1, which contains an A-rich sequence in its 5&#x02032;-UTR allowing binding of PABP and blockage of translation of its own mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke301c54">54</xref>). Clearly, human PABP3 does not contain an A-rich sequence in its 5&#x02032;-UTR. Therefore, PAPB3 might represent the major functional species associated with polysomes in round spermatids. Expression of this testis-specific PABP mRNA might be a way for the cell to escape negative feedback control and to produce the amount of PABP protein needed for the active mRNA synthesis phase of spermatogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke301f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> cDNA and predicted amino acid sequences of PABP3.
