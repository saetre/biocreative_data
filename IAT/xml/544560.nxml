Genetic analyses indicate that <italic>spen </italic>interacts with pathways that regulate the function of Hox proteins, the response to various signaling cascades and cell cycle control. Although <italic>spen </italic>mutants affect only a small subset of morphological structures in embryos, it has been difficult to find a common theme in <italic>spen </italic>mutant structural alterations, or in the interactions of <italic>spen </italic>with known signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>By generating clones of <italic>spen </italic>mutant cells in wing imaginal discs, we show that <italic>spen </italic>function is required for the correct formation and positioning of veins and mechanosensory bristles both on the anterior wing margin and on the notum, and for the maintenance of planar polarity. Wing vein phenotypic alterations are enhanced by mutations in the <italic>crinkled </italic>(<italic>ck</italic>) gene, encoding a non-conventional myosin, and correlate with an abnormal spatial expression of Delta, an early marker of vein formation in third instar wing imaginal discs. Positioning defects were also evident in the organization of the embryonic peripheral nervous system, accompanied by abnormal E-Cadherin expression in the epidermis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data presented indicate that the role of <italic>spen </italic>is necessary to maintain the correct positioning of cells within a pre-specified domain throughout development. Its requirement for epithelial planar polarity, its interaction with <italic>ck</italic>, and the abnormal E-Cadherin expression associated with <italic>spen </italic>mutations suggest that <italic>spen </italic>exerts its function by interacting with basic cellular mechanisms required to maintain multicellular organization in metazoans. This role for <italic>spen </italic>may explain why mutations in this gene interact with the outcome of multiple signaling pathways.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The morphological complexity of metazoans is achieved through the regulation of multiple genes in an orchestrated spatial and temporal manner. One of these genes, <italic>split ends </italic>(<italic>spen</italic>), was initially identified in a screen for mutations affecting axonal outgrowth in the nervous system in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Additional mutations in <italic>spen </italic>were isolated in a screen for genetic modifiers of <italic>Deformed </italic>(<italic>Dfd</italic>) function. <italic>Dfd </italic>encodes a Hox transcription factor that specifies maxillary segment identity during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>spen </italic>was subsequently found to enhance embryonic thoracic defects resulting from loss of function mutations in the Hox gene <italic>Antennapedia </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Other studies have found mutations in <italic>Drosophila spen </italic>as modifiers of mutations in components of Ras/MAP kinase pathways, including Raf kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], kinase suppressor of Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], loss of function mutations in the gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase Corkscrew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and in the ETS family transcription factor, Aop/Yan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic>spen </italic>gene have also been identified as enhancers of gain of function phenotypes caused by overexpression of E2F or Cyclin E in eye cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], both of which are required for progression through the S phase of the cell cycle, as well as <italic>Dacapo</italic>, a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Overexpression of Spen may interfere with Notch signaling during the development of adult external sensory organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and <italic>spen </italic>function is required for the maternal expression of the Notch pathway transcription factor encoded by <italic>Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recent evidence also suggests that <italic>spen </italic>may participate in the transduction of the Wingless (Wg) signal within a subset of cells in the wing imaginal disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The Spen protein is ubiquitously expressed throughout embryogenesis. Differential splicing of <italic>spen </italic>results in isoforms encoding at least two proteins of ~5500 amino acids containing three tandem RNP-type RNA binding domains and a SPOC (<underline>S</underline>pen <underline>P</underline>aralogous and <underline>O</underline>rthologous <underline>C</underline> terminal) domain at the carboxy terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These domains are highly conserved in both the mouse and human orthologs, called Msx-2 Interacting Nuclear Target (MINT) and SMRT/HDAC1 Associated Repressor Protein (SHARP), respectively. There is increasing evidence indicating that Spen-related polypeptides play a role in transcriptional repression. MINT may participate in bone development by binding to the <italic>osteocalcin </italic>promoter, via its RNP motifs, and repressing transcription in a binding complex with the homeodomain protein Msx-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The interaction between SHARP and Silencing Mediator for Retinoid and Thyroid-hormone receptors (SMRT) can lead to the recruitment of histone deacetylase complexes through the conserved SPOC domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Both SHARP and MINT have also been proposed as negative regulators of the Notch signaling pathway in mammals. SHARP has been shown to bind directly to RBP-J&#x003ba; and repress the HES-1 promoter in an HDAC-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although deletion of MINT coding sequences in mice results in embryonic lethality around E 14.5 due to multiple abnormalities, the analysis of hematopoiesis derived from MINT<sup>-/- </sup>precursors reveals a defect in B cell development that could be attributed to defects in Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Despite the sum of genetic and biochemical evidence, a selective role for Spen-like proteins in a particular pathway in mammals or <italic>Drosophila </italic>remains unclear. Because wing development is a well characterized system for the study of primary pattern formation, diverse signaling pathways, and cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we have used mitotic recombination in the wing disc to analyze <italic>spen </italic>mutant mosaics. An additional advantage is that, because wings are not essential for adult viability, the study of a large number of specimens is possible. In this study, we show that the function of <italic>spen </italic>is necessary for the maintenance of planar polarity, and for the correct formation and positioning of veins and mechanosensory bristles on the anterior wing margin and the notum. Alterations in vein formation in <italic>spen </italic>clones correlate with abnormal spatial expression of Delta, an early marker of vein formation in third instar wing imaginal discs. All wing phenotypes are enhanced in a <italic>crinkled </italic>(<italic>ck</italic>) mutant background, a gene encoding the non-canonical myosin VIIa. The abnormal position of sensory organs is also observed during embryonic PNS development. In contrast with previous reports, we show that <italic>spen </italic>is not essential for the determination of specific cell fates nor for cell survival, nor is it directly required for the outcome of the Ras, Notch, and Wingless signaling pathways. Based on our observations, we propose that <italic>spen </italic>is required for cells to maintain positional identity and tissue cohesiveness during the organized growth of wing and notum epithelia.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>spen </italic>function is essential throughout development</title><p><italic>spen </italic>has been shown to be involved in many processes during embryonic development. Mutant modifier and gain of function screens indicate that <italic>spen </italic>participates in a variety of developmental processes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including Hox gene function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and the modulation of signal transduction pathways such as Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], Notch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and Wingless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Given these varied interactions, it is unclear how <italic>spen </italic>functions through a common mechanism of action. To better understand a role for <italic>spen</italic>, we have generated genetic mosaics in adult tissues by using <italic>Flp1</italic>-mediated mitotic recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>spen</italic><sup><italic>poc</italic>361 </sup>and <italic>spen</italic><sup><italic>poc</italic>231 </sup>mutant alleles have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although not molecularly characterized, there is evidence indicating that <italic>spen</italic><sup><italic>poc</italic>361 </sup>is a null allele. First, in maternal and zygotic <italic>spen</italic><sup><italic>poc</italic>361 </sup>mutant embryos, Spen protein cannot be detected with a polyclonal antibody raised against the region encoding amino acids 3203&#x02013;3714 [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and not shown], suggesting that this mutant is either a protein null or that it is truncated before this region. Second, the <italic>spen</italic><sup><italic>poc</italic>361 </sup>allele displays nearly the same strength as the TE21A deficiency, which deletes the entire locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Both <italic>spen </italic>alleles were recombined onto chromosomes containing an FRT sequence at 40A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and were subjected to heat shock driven Flp1-mediated mitotic recombination with a <italic>M(2)</italic><sup>36<italic>F </italic></sup><italic>FRT</italic><sup>40<italic>A </italic></sup>chromosome. Heat shocks delivered at different times during larval and pupal development rendered few escapers (&#x0003c;1%), which presented with little or no mosaicism as revealed by the absence of the <italic>M </italic>dominant marker (not shown), indicating that the function of <italic>spen </italic>is essential during all stages of development.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>spen </italic>mutant mosaics affect vein morphology and planar polarity in adult wings</title><p>Because the studies described above did not provide any information about the nature of this lethality, mosaics were generated through expression of the Flp1 recombinase in wing imaginal discs, where <italic>spen </italic>mRNA is expressed ubiquitously as revealed by RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (not shown). Using the <italic>MS1096-GAL4 </italic>driver [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>], the expression of a <italic>UAS-Flp1 </italic>transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] induced mitotic recombination in wing discs between the <italic>FRT </italic>chromosome bearing a <italic>spen </italic>mutant allele and an <italic>FRT </italic>chromosome containing a ubiquitously expressed <italic>GFP </italic>transgene on 2L. The homozygous viable <italic>2piM FRT</italic><sup>40<italic>A </italic></sup>chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] was used as a control in all crosses. Initially, to avoid non-specific interference of additional mutations in the analysis (see below), clones were not phenotypically marked in adults, although their formation could be followed in discs by looking at the expression of the <italic>GFP </italic>transgene. In order to prevent the evaluation of non-specific abnormalities caused by the <italic>MS1096-GAL4 </italic>insertion on the X chromosome of hemizygous males, only heterozygous females were analyzed.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of <italic>spen </italic>mutant clones in wing imaginal discs</bold>.

Therefore, the phenotypic effects caused by <italic>spen </italic>mutations are not exclusively cell autonomous, although it appears autonomous in cells within a given cell layer.</p><p>A "misplacement" effect was also observed at the wing margin, most frequently affecting the dorsal bristles. In a normal wing, the bristles are evenly spaced in a row along the dorsal side of the anterior wing margin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In the presence of <italic>spen </italic>mutant clones, the spacing between these bristles was altered (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). Additionally, a mis-alignment and occasional tufting of the thick trichomes that are found along the wing margin was also observed. Again, these phenotypes were not exclusively cell autonomous, as was the case with aberrations in wing vein morphology.

However, when clones were generated specifically in wing imaginal discs, we observed that mutations in the <italic>spen </italic>gene did not affect the viability or the size of mutant cells during growth of the disc, as evidenced by normal cell size and number within the adult clones. These observations are intriguing given previous reports linking the function of <italic>spen </italic>to cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

Similarly, the phenotypes observed in <italic>spen </italic>mutant embryos do not clearly correlate with mutations in components of the Ras signaling pathway. For instance, the expression of orthodenticle (<italic>otd</italic>) mRNA at the ventral midline, which is dependent on DER function, and is abnormal in mutants that are defective in this signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], was indistinguishable between <italic>spen </italic>maternal and zygotic mutant embryos and wild type embryos (data not shown).

Additionally, there is supporting biochemical evidence indicating that both the human and murine orthologs of Spen, interact with RBP-J&#x003ba;/CBF-1, a mammalian ortholog of Su(H) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The interaction of both SHARP and MINT with RBP-J&#x003ba;/CBF-1 prevents the interaction of the latter with the intracellular fragment of activated N, thus suggesting that both SHARP and MINT are negative regulators of N signaling in mammals. On the other hand, inactivation of the murine MINT gene does not clearly reflect a defect in N signaling. Loss of function of MINT in hematopoietic precursors, revealed that splenic B cells differentiated more efficiently toward the marginal zone than to the follicular type. This phenotype, attributed by the authors to a defect in N signaling, is in conflict with the fact that the election of T <italic>versus </italic>B cell fates in the lymphoid lineage, also dependent on N signaling, appears unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Indeed, variations in the numbers of follicular and marginal zone B cells, as reported for the MINT-deficient B cells, may also be attributed to migration defects leading to their abnormal distribution within the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, it seems that a specific role for MINT in the mammalian N pathway has not been clearly defined yet.</p><p>The displacement of veins observed in adult wings in the presence of <italic>spen </italic>mutant clones, frequently accompanied by widening of the veins, is a phenotype consistent with defects in the N signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, this phenotype correlates with abnormal (diffuse and/or ectopic) expression of Delta (Dl) in third instar imaginal discs both in <italic>spen </italic>mutant clones, and in cells adjacent to these clones. However, the role of the N signaling pathway has been well established as crucial for the determination of cell types during the development of external sensory organs. Defects in the N pathway alter sense organ cellular composition by affecting alternative cell fate decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In our experimental system, the generation of <italic>spen </italic>mutant clones did not interfere with bristle formation <italic>per se</italic>, but with their spatial distribution. Both micro and macrochaetae were incorrectly positioned throughout the notum and, in some cases, chaetae were absent, but ectopic supernumerary bristles were also seen. Nevertheless, all external sensory organs appeared to have normal morphology, suggesting that there were no mis-specifications of cell fates, as it would be expected for N signaling defects. Additional evidence that supports this is that the expression of Cut at the wing margin, which is dependent upon both Su(H) and N function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], was detected within <italic>spen </italic>mutant clones.

Furthermore, we could not consistently correlate any of the abnormalities observed in adult wings containing <italic>spen </italic>mutant clones to known defects in the Wg signaling pathway. Clonal analysis in third instar imaginal discs did not reveal specific defects in the Wg pathway either: Wg signaling is required for Dl expression at the wing margin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and Dl expression was topologically affected but not absent in <italic>spen </italic>mutant clones. Taken together, it appears that <italic>spen </italic>function is required for one Wg signaling target (Senseless) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], but not for others (Dl).

A plausible explanation is that it could affect cell adhesion. In fact, in <italic>spen </italic>mutant embryos, the expression of E-cadherin was up-regulated at sites of high epithelial morphogenetic activity, generating a phenotype similar to the E-cadherin mutant embryos, as it has been observed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. It is plausible that the increase in E-cadherin expression is the result of a wound response to a defect in epithelial integrity, caused by <italic>spen </italic>mutations [K. Mace, J. Pearson, and W. McGinnis, submitted]. A defect in cell adhesion and/or cytoskeletal rearrangements could also explain specific aspects of the <italic>spen </italic>embryonic phenotype. The holes that result in abnormal cuticle deposition in the embryonic epidermis are due to a failure of epidermal epithelial integrity. These cells subsequently undergo a wound response at the end of embryogenesis. Additionally, some of the phenotypes resulting from the loss of <italic>spen </italic>are indeed similar to those seen in mutants for the gene encoding Daschous, a cadherin involved in cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, blistering of the wings, a phenotype that is often found in cell adhesion mutants, was never observed in any of the <italic>spen </italic>mutant clones.</p><p>A role for Spen in cell adhesion and/or cytoskeletal rearrangements could also be inferred through its genetic interaction with <italic>crinkled </italic>(Myosin VIIA), and the planar cell polarity phenotype observed in mutant cells for <italic>spen </italic>in the wing blade. Myosin VIIA is associated with the cadherin-catenins complex and participates in the creation of a tension force between the actin cytoskeleton and adherens junctions, which is predicted to strengthen cell-cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>ck </italic>acts downstream of <italic>Drosophila Rho-associated kinase </italic>(<italic>Drok</italic>), which links Frizzled-mediated planar cell polarity signaling to the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Myosin VIIA mutations have been described in vertebrates, including those causing the Usher syndrome in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], the <italic>shaker-1 </italic>mutation in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and the <italic>mariner </italic>mutation in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Interestingly, these mutations, among other symptoms, cause splaying and abnormal distribution of sensory hair cells in the inner ear, leading to deafness in mice and humans, and mechanosensory defects in zebrafish. It seems plausible that <italic>spen </italic>may regulate the expression or function of components affecting the outcome of pathways involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements and epithelial planar polarity and, hence, affect cell positioning. However, a direct requirement for <italic>spen </italic>function in the Ck or Drok pathways is unlikely, since mutations in these genes result in different phenotypes than those observed in <italic>spen </italic>mutants.</p><p>An influential role for <italic>spen </italic>in mechanisms of intercellular adhesion and/or cytoskeletal rearrangements may also be relevant to understanding its suggestive role in human cancer. The search of public human sequence resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] reveals one <italic>spen </italic>ortholog (SHARP), and three putative Short Spen-like Protein (SSLP) orthologs in the human genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). At least one of these genes (OTT/RBM15) is involved in a recurrent translocation detected in acute megakaryocitic leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and a potentially aberrant transcript for another human SSLP ortholog at 3p21 has been identified in cDNA isolated from human cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Despite the presence of common domains, the functional relationship between large and small Spen-related polypeptides is still unknown. It is plausible that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, SSLP might rescue some of the functions of <italic>spen </italic>during early embryonic development, as evidenced by the incomplete penetrance of phenotypes seen in <italic>spen </italic>maternal and zygotic mutant embryos. Complementation at this level has been suggested by others to explain the incomplete penetrance of <italic>spen </italic>mutations in wing discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], although it should be noted that the region required for Spen to interact with transcription factors such as Msx-2 or nuclear receptors, is apparently missing in SSLP proteins. Therefore, the potential redundancy of Spen and SSLP will have to be determined.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Human <italic>spen</italic>-related genes</bold>. The figure shows all <italic>Drosophila </italic>and human related sequences putatively encoding polypeptides with three RNP-type RNA binding motifs at the N terminus (purple boxes), and the SPOC domain at the C terminus (yellow boxes). The gray box on Hs SHARP indicates the region that contains motifs required for the interaction of SHARP/MINT with Msx-2 (residues 2070 to 2394 [14]), nuclear receptors (residues 2201 to 2707 [15]), and RBP-J&#x003ba; (residues 2803 to 2817 [17], and 2638 to 2777 [18]). The expected sizes for each peptide is shown on the right, while names and chromosomal localization in humans is on the left. Asterisks indicate that the peptides have been predicted from the genomic sequence, either because there are no known full length ESTs corresponding to the genomic regions analyzed (case for Hs SSLP at 3p21), or because there are no reported ESTs at all (Hs SSLP at 5q23). In the case of the SSLP at 5q23, there are also stop codons in frame with the putative ORF, so it is likely that this sequence represents a pseudogene. Accession numbers for the sequences likely to represent full length cDNAs are: AAF13218 (Dm SPEN), NP_055816 (Hs SHARP), AAF59160 (Dm SSLP), NP_073605 (OTT/RBM15), and CAC38829 (OTT-MAL fusion). The putative full length ORF for the Hs SSLP at 3p21 was predicted using GENESCAN [54] on the genomic sequence AC092037. The truncated cDNA arising from this gene is found under AAA72367 or NP_037418. The Hs SSLP at 5q23 was predicted with GENESCAN from the genomic segment AC005915, and the assembly was completed with ENSP322787, a predicted peptide from the Ensembl Database [42].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-4-15-10"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that the function of the <italic>spen </italic>gene is essential for all stages of development. The experimental evidence indicates that Spen participates in processes that regulate planar cell polarity and may influence cytoskeletal organization, and its loss results in specific phenotypes that can not be solely explained by defects in a specific signaling pathway. In order to unify our observations with those previously reported by others, we would like to propose that the function of Spen is necessary for the maintenance of correct cell positioning during growth, ensuring that structures that are determined early during development are correctly positioned in the adult (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). As cells are determined early during development to become part of a specific structure, their position has to be maintained during growth according to a pre-established pattern. If cells were unable to maintain their position, we would expect phenotypes similar to those obtained in <italic>spen </italic>mutant clones. Structures would be misplaced, and in some cases would be absent if the cells that were predetermined to adopt a specific fate fall within "forbidden" positions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). This mechanistic model could explain why <italic>spen </italic>interacts genetically with signaling pathways that require and/or specify precise spatial organization during metazoan development.</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p><bold>A mechanistic model for Spen function</bold>. The cartoon illustrates our conclusions to explain the defects seen in the presence of <italic>spen </italic>mutant clones. Wild type or heterozygote cells are depicted with green nuclei, and <italic>spen </italic>mutant cells with gray nuclei. The appearance of <italic>spen </italic>mutant cells in fields that will give rise to specific structures such as bristles or veins would imply the lack of an instructive signal to remain in place during growth of the disc. This will finally result in a progressive mis-localization of cells, ultimately leading to the abnormal positioning of structures after development is completed. Such a model would explain that, in some cases as in the proneural clusters, a change of fate is generated because negative instructive signals that depend on cell to cell contact are lost, resulting in the formation of two sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells within the same pro neural cluster (shown as red cells in B and C). The same situation may occur in the formation of wing veins, where similar Notch dependent regulatory mechanisms take place (E). Loss of or veins (or bristles) may occur when vein-forming cells move into intervein regions after their commitment has taken place, therefore leaving a hole where they should have been, which has been filled with cells that are unable to form vein at that spot.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-4-15-11"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila </italic>stocks</title><p>All flies were grown at 21&#x000b0;C in standard medium, and were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center, unless indicated otherwise.
