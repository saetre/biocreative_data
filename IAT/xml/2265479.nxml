In humans, there are eleven HDACs, organized into three distinct subfamilies. This large number of HDACs raises questions about functional overlap and division of labor among paralogs. In vivo roles are simpler to address in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where there are only five HDAC family members and only two are implicated in transcriptional control. Of these two, HDAC1 has been characterized genetically, but its most closely related paralog, HDAC3, has not. Here we describe the isolation and phenotypic characterization of <italic>hdac3</italic> mutations. We find that both <italic>hdac3</italic> and <italic>hdac1</italic> mutations are dominant suppressors of position effect variegation, suggesting functional overlap in heterochromatin regulation. However, all five <italic>hdac3</italic> loss-of-function alleles are recessive lethal during larval/pupal stages, indicating that HDAC3 is essential on its own for <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. The mutant larvae display small imaginal discs, which result from abnormally elevated levels of apoptosis. This cell death occurs as a cell-autonomous response to HDAC3 loss and is accompanied by increased expression of the pro-apoptotic gene, <italic>hid</italic>. In contrast, although HDAC1 mutants also display small imaginal discs, this appears to result from reduced proliferation rather than from elevated apoptosis. The connection between HDAC loss and apoptosis is important since HDAC inhibitors show anticancer activities in animal models through mechanisms involving apoptotic induction. However, the specific HDACs implicated in tumor cell killing have not been identified. Our results indicate that protein deacetylation by HDAC3 plays a key role in suppression of apoptosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal tissue.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that reverse acetylation of protein substrates inside the cell. Like phosphorylation, acetylation/deacetylation can alter the biochemical properties of a protein target and thereby regulate its functions. Histones are a major target of certain HDACs. When histones become deacetylated, the biochemical properties of the local chromatin are altered, which can contribute to gene silencing. HDACs can also act upon protein substrates besides histones. There are multiple HDACs encoded in animal genomes, with eleven HDACs in humans. Thus, it becomes complicated to determine which individual HDACs exert which biological functions in vivo. To address this, we have isolated and studied mutations that specifically disrupt a single HDAC, HDAC3, in Drosophila. We find that a major function of HDAC3 is to prevent programmed cell death from occurring abnormally in certain fly tissues. This finding has implications for anticancer strategies since HDAC chemical inhibitors can reduce tumors in animal models through induction of cell death. Our study identifies HDAC3 as a single HDAC among many that can play a key role in control of cell death and suggests that this version of the enzyme should be further investigated for regulatory roles in tumor cell killing versus survival.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are members of an ancient enzyme family that reverses acetylation of protein substrates. The most well-characterized HDAC substrates are the N-terminal tails of the histones. Acetylation of histone tail lysines generally correlates with gene activity, whereas HDAC-sponsored removal of these tail modifications frequently accompanies gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Kurdistani1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Ng1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Changes in charge density resulting from histone acetylation/deacetylation may also affect packaging of nucleosome arrays into higher-order arrangements that can impact transcription rates. A major HDAC regulatory function, then, is to promote gene silencing.</p><p>The histone deacetylase HDAC1 has been the most throughly studied HDAC at the biochemical and functional levels. Extensive analysis of HDAC1 in yeast, also known as RPD3, indicates that it can deacetylate all four core histones, that it targets hundreds of genes around the genome, and confirms its major role as a direct transcriptional repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Kurdistani1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Robyr1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Suka1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Biochemical studies show that HDAC1 is typically assembled into nuclear complexes, such as the SIN3 and NURD complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Ng1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Zhang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Wade1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These co-repressor complexes are recruited to target genes through interactions with DNA-binding proteins. A prime example is provided by nuclear hormone receptors such as thyroid hormone receptor; the unliganded receptor recognizes target genes through its zinc finger DNA-binding domain, and it recruits a SIN3/NCoR/HDAC1 complex, which deacetylates target chromatin and leads to gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Xu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As a consequence of their roles with many co-repressors, HDACs have widespread function around the genome and they participate in many gene regulatory systems.

Thus, many endocrine, homeostatic, and developmental pathways employ HDACs in their gene control mechanisms.</p><p>There are 11 HDAC family members in humans, defined by an approximately 350 amino acid homology region that encompasses the catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Gregoretti1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. These have been classified into three major subfamilies, with class I containing HDACs 1, 2, 3 and 8, class II containing HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10, and HDAC11 comprising a third distinct subtype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Gregoretti1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, the sirtuins represent yet another HDAC family, which are distinguished by their NAD-dependent reaction mechanism and are structurally unrelated to the family of 11 human HDACs. The large number of HDACs makes it difficult to determine which functions are shared and which can be uniquely assigned to individual family members. HDAC functional diversity is further complicated by the ability of HDACs to modify many protein substrates besides histones. Indeed, all three major HDAC subtypes are present in bacterial species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Gregoretti1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that they likely evolved as protein deacetylases that only later acquired ability to act upon histones. In agreement with diversity of function, HDAC1 and 2 are largely nuclear, HDAC6 is cytoplasmic, and still other HDACs, including HDAC3, are found in both nucleus and cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Ng1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Takami1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Cho1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the lack of HDAC3 mutations to date has impeded understanding of its biological functions in the fly system. Here we describe isolation of HDAC3 loss-of-function alleles and present phenotypic characterization. All five HDAC3 mutations are homozygous lethal at late larval or pupal stages.

An initial <italic>hdac3</italic> allele was obtained by imprecise excision of a P transposon inserted into the neighboring gene, <italic>snr1</italic>, on the fly third chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). The excision yielded an approximately 1.8 kb deletion of genomic DNA that removes the 3&#x02032; two-thirds of both the <italic>hdac3</italic> and <italic>snr1</italic> coding regions. The deletion allele, termed <italic>hdac3<sup>6C</sup></italic>, breaks at codon 145 of <italic>hdac3</italic>, within the HDAC catalytic domain. Since the severely truncated HDAC3 protein derived from this mutant allele, if stable, lacks critical portions of the catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Vannini1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Somoza1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, it likely causes severe loss of HDAC3 function. However, the usefulness of this deletion allele for <italic>hdac3</italic> functional studies is limited by the simultaneous disruption of <italic>snr1</italic>.</p><p>To obtain mutations that specifically disrupt HDAC3, we next performed a noncomplementation screen for EMS-induced alleles that are lethal in trans to the <italic>hdac3<sup>6C</sup></italic> deletion (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). The recovery of <italic>hdac3</italic> alleles, as opposed to <italic>snr1</italic> alleles, was facilitated by use of a <italic>P&#x0005b;snr1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;</italic> rescue construct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Zraly1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> in test crosses of the newly isolated lethal mutations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). We isolated four new <italic>hdac3</italic> mutations from this screen, each of which is lethal in trans to <italic>hdac3<sup>6C</sup></italic>. All four <italic>hdac3</italic> mutant alleles cause lethality during pupal stages when either hemizygous or in transheterozygous combination with each other. Sequence analysis revealed that three of these alleles are missense mutations and one, <italic>hdac3<sup>N</sup></italic>, converts Q57 to a stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Since this nonsense mutation eliminates the HDAC catalytic domain, it is likely a null allele. These results show that HDAC3 has unique functions required for fly development and viability, despite its 56&#x00025; identity and 76&#x00025; similarity to HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>The three-dimensional crystal structure of human HDAC8, a class I HDAC, has been determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Vannini1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Somoza1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Based upon high primary sequence conservation, all class I HDACs likely exhibit similar overall protein folds. Thus, we projected our three <italic>hdac3</italic> substitutions onto the HDAC8 structure, to gain information about their possible effects on the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

The catalytic site is located on one side and features a deep pocket, which is thought to bind the acetylated lysine substrate, and a Zn-binding site. All three missense substitutions are located on the opposite side, away from the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, rather than specifically disrupting the catalytic center, these mutations may affect HDAC3 interactions with partner proteins, such as co-repressors, or they may cause structural destabilization. Two of these mutations affect residues that are highly conserved among HDACs; P254 is absolutely conserved among all 16 human and fly HDACs and V192 is conserved in all class I HDACs and in 14 of the 16 human and fly HDACs.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>Hdac3</italic> Mutations Suppress PEV but Show Little Effect on Polycomb Silencing</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> HDAC1 has previously been implicated in two types of chromatin regulation: heterochromatin modification and gene silencing by the Polycomb system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Chang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Tie1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Mottus1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-DeRubertis1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

Previous studies have described up-regulation of cell-extrinsic death receptor pathways as well as effects upon components in intrinsic pathways that operate through mitochondria to trigger apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Bolden1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the sum of the evidence suggests multiple inputs, the cell autonomy of the response in the fly system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g005">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that cell-intrinsic regulation of pro-apoptotic factors makes a key contribution. Besides pro-apoptotic factors such as hid/Smac/Diablo, the Bcl2 class of cell-intrinsic regulators are commonly used in the mammalian pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Jiang1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. However, relatively little is known about regulatory mechanisms of the Bcl2 factors Buffy and Debcl in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Hay2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is also currently unclear which of the 11 human zinc-dependent HDACs must be inhibited to trigger tumor cell apoptosis. Many of the commonly used HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin (TSA) are broad spectrum antagonists that affect all family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Bolden1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, encouraging preclinical results have been obtained with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, which affects all eleven human HDACs, and with valproic acid, which inhibits eight of the eleven including all class I enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Johnstone1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Bolden1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Insinga1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Egger1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data show that loss of HDAC3 alone is sufficient to trigger robust apoptosis in fly tissues, indicating that this conserved HDAC plays a substantial role among family members in apoptotic control. Further studies will be needed to assess if specific inhibition of human HDAC3 makes a critical contribution to tumor cell killing.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Division of Labor and Functional Roles of HDAC1 and HDAC3</title><p>A recent transcription profile microarray study using cultured fly cells suggests that HDAC1 and HDAC3 are the only two fly HDACs with major functions in transcriptional control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Foglietti1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, HDAC3, the closest fly paralog by sequence, is also likely to be the most functionally related fly family member to HDAC1. Our isolation of <italic>hdac3</italic> mutations provided the opportunity to begin to assess this HDAC1/HDAC3 relationship in vivo. Our results show that both <italic>hdac3</italic> and <italic>hdac1</italic> mutations can suppress PEV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g002">Figure 2</xref>), indicating roles for both HDACs in heterochromatin regulation. The fact that an <italic>hdac1</italic>; <italic>hdac3</italic> double mutant displays an enhanced effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g002">Figure 2I</xref>) suggests that both HDACs make significant contributions to this process. The simplest molecular explanation is that both enzymes directly deacetylate histone residues that then become methylated in heterochromatin. However, RNA interference experiments using cultured fly S2 cells suggest that HDAC1 is the predominant histone-modifying enzyme, with little unique contribution detected from HDAC3, at least in this cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Foglietti1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, HDAC3 function at heterochromatin could reflect deacetylation of either histone or non-histone substrates.</p><p>In a developmental context, requirements for HDAC3 function distinct from HDAC1 could occur at times or in cell types that accumulate HDAC3 but not HDAC1. However, the spatial distributions of <italic>hdac3</italic> and <italic>hdac1</italic> mRNAs are both widespread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g003">Figure 3</xref>), their temporal profiles during development are similar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Cho1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, and we have not detected individual tissues or cell types where <italic>hdac3</italic> product accumulates without <italic>hdac1</italic>. In general, <italic>hdac1</italic> mRNA levels appear more abundant than those of <italic>hdac3</italic> especially in the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This is consistent with the report that the genome-wide transcriptional response to HDAC1 knockdown in cultured fly cells is more robust and involves a larger number of affected genes as compared to HDAC3 knockdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Foglietti1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, HDAC1 may be needed for certain processes that do not require HDAC3. Indeed, both our in vivo results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g006">Figure 6</xref>), and fly S2 cell studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Foglietti1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, support a preferential role for HDAC1, as opposed to HDAC3, in controlling cell proliferation.</p><p>The most significant HDAC3 function revealed by our genetic approach is in control of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000009-g005">5</xref>). Since HDAC3 loss is by itself sufficient to trigger ectopic apoptosis, neither HDAC1 nor other fly HDACs can substitute for this requirement, at least in imaginal disc tissue. These results contrast with findings on apoptosis from an HDAC knockdown study using cultured fly cells. Although treatment with a broad-specificity HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin, did induce apoptosis in S2 cells, neither HDAC1 nor HDAC3 knockdown, nor the double knockdown, affected cell viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000009-Foglietti1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the degree of <italic>hdac3</italic> loss-of-function produced by our mutations in vivo is more severe than the degree achieved by RNA interference. Alternatively, the conflicting results may reflect tissue differences in the response to HDAC loss; S2 cells are derived from embryonic neuronal cells whereas the most dramatic induction of apoptosis is seen in a larval epithelial tissue, imaginal discs. Indeed, we note that there is little apoptotic induction in nervous system tissue of the same larvae that display robust induction in discs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000009.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Further studies will be needed to determine the mechanisms and pathways by which HDACs control apoptosis in various tissues during normal development as well as in mammalian cell and animal models for cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Isolation and Characterization of <italic>Hdac3</italic> Mutant Alleles</title><p>The <italic>hdac3<sup>6C</sup></italic> deletion was generated by imprecise excision of a P element, <italic>P&#x0005b;PZ ry&#x0002b;&#x0005d;Snr1<sup>01319</sup></italic>, inserted into the neighboring <italic>snr1</italic> gene.
