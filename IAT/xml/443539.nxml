The conversion of a binary 30S ribosome&#x02013;mRNA complex into a 30S-mRNA&#x02013;initiator&#x02013;tRNA ternary complex, wherein the ribosome is tethered to the mRNA by both the SD&#x02013;anti-SD interaction and the codon&#x02013;anti-codon interaction, is further governed by three initiation factors (IF1&#x02013;IF3) which control the fidelity of this first step in translation initiation, i.e. the selection of the correct start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c4">4</xref>). In addition to this pathway, there is experimental evidence for a second <italic>t</italic>ranslation <italic>i</italic>nitiation <italic>p</italic>athway (<italic>tip</italic>), wherein a 30S-initiator&#x02013;tRNA complex is recruited to canonical mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c6">6</xref>). As recently reported by Mayer <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c7">7</xref>), IF2 appears to act as a carrier for initiator&#x02013;tRNA to the ribosome, and would thus augment the formation of the 30S-initiator&#x02013;tRNA complex. Consistent with the latter <italic>tip</italic> is the lack of evidence that <italic>cis</italic> elements on leaderless mRNAs, starting directly with the 5&#x02032; terminal start codon, contribute to ribosomal recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c12">12</xref>). Taken together with the stimulatory effect of IF2 on leaderless mRNA translation, it has been concluded that the start codon is the only constant and necessary ribosomal recognition element on leaderless mRNAs, and that start codon recognition of leaderless mRNAs requires a ribosome&#x02013;initiator&#x02013;tRNA complex, an intermediate equivalent to that obligatorily formed during translation initiation in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of whether the 30S ribosomal subunit binds first either to mRNA or to initiator&#x02013;tRNA, it is generally accepted that translation initiation in prokaryotes proceeds via an obligatory dissociation of ribosomes and only the 30S subunit is believed to associate with natural occurring mRNAs and initiator&#x02013;tRNA. While there is ample evidence for transient 30S translation initiation complexes formed at the 5&#x02032; end of a mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c15">15</xref>), it is an open question whether translational re-initiation at start codons internal to a polycistronic mRNAs is brought about by non-dissociated 70S ribosomes. Typically, translation re-initiation events in bacteria occur when a downstream translational start site is in close vicinity to or overlaps with the termination codon of an upstream gene. Although a canonical SD sequence facilitates such re-initiation events, it appears not to be essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c17">17</xref>). It is unknown whether re-initiation events occur in the presence of initiation factors, especially IF3, which would restrict ribosomal P-site access to <graphic xlink:href="gkh663equ1.gif"/> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c3">3</xref>). The translational coupling of the coat and lysis gene of phage fr was shown to be dependent on the non-canonical UUG start codon of the lysis gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c18">18</xref>). This finding could indicate that re-initiation of the lysis gene is accomplished by 70S ribosomes on which IF3 may not exert its proofreading function for initiator-tRNA. In addition, based on studies of the <italic>Escherichia coli lac</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c19">19</xref>) and <italic>str</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c20">20</xref>) operons it has been suggested that 70S ribosomes cross the boundary between translationally coupled genes. More light on potential 70S re-initiation events has been shed through the use of <italic>E.coli</italic> temperature-sensitive mutants in the gene encoding the ribosome recycling factor (RRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c22">22</xref>). RRF together with EFG is required for disassembly of the translational post-termination complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c25">25</xref>). Inactivation of the RRF protein resulted <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c26">26</xref>) as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c21">21</xref>) in unscheduled translational re-initiation downstream from a termination codon. These experiments suggested that 70S ribosome are not dislodged from the mRNA upon termination, and that they are indeed capable of translation initiation at downstream translational starts. Moreover, inactivation of RRF <italic>in vivo</italic> does not affect translational coupling at the coat&#x0002f;lysis gene boundary of RNA phage GA, which is again indicative for 70S re-initiation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c22">22</xref>).</p><p>Using the primer extension inhibition assay (toeprinting; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c27">27</xref>), Balakin <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c28">28</xref>) have first shown, that 70S ribosomes, in contrast to 30S ribosomal subunits, show a high preference for the 5&#x02032; terminal AUG of leaderless phage &#x003bb; <italic>c</italic>I repressor mRNA. Using the same assay, O'Donnell and Janssen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c29">29</xref>) reported likewise for several leaderless mRNAs that 70S initiation complexes are intrinsically more stable than 30S initiation complexes. These findings are in agreement with filter binding assays performed in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c30">30</xref>) and by Udagawa <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c31">31</xref>), which revealed a 5- to 10-fold higher retention of leaderless mRNAs in the presence of <graphic xlink:href="gkh663equ2.gif"/> with 70S ribosomes when compared to 30S subunits. Udagawa <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c31">31</xref>) have used the cell-free PURE translation system to scrutinize the 70S <italic>tip</italic> for leaderless mRNAs. Although these authors observed translation of leaderless <italic>c</italic>I mRNA with 70S ribosomes in the absence of initiation factors, an mRNA containing a canonical ribosome binding site was likewise translated under the same conditions. Hence, the currently available evidence for the 70S <italic>tip</italic> of leaderless mRNAs is either rather indirect or controversial.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate the proficiency of stable non-dissociated 70S ribosomes in <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of leaderless mRNAs. Moreover, we report that leaderless mRNA translation continues under conditions where the prevalence of 70S ribosomes is mimicked <italic>in vivo</italic>, and where translation of bulk mRNA ceases. These studies provide definite evidence for a third <italic>tip</italic> in bacteria, wherein translation initiation of leaderless mRNAs is accomplished by 70S monosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>The <italic>E.coli</italic> strains MC1061 [F<sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>araD139 &#x00394;(ara-leu)7679 galE15 galK16 &#x00394;(lac)X74 hsdR2 mcrA mcrB1 rpsL</italic> (Sm<sup>r</sup>)], LJ14 (MC1061 <italic>frr14</italic> (Ts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c21">21</xref>) and RL425 (<italic>metB</italic> HfrP4X &#x003bb;<sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>rpsB</italic><sup>ts</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c32">32</xref>) have been described.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c28">28</xref>) have suggested that the anti-SD is not accessible in 70S ribosomes, and therefore not available for the SD&#x02013;anti-SD interaction. We therefore first examined whether the inaccessibility of the anti-SD in 70S ribosomes could account for the failure of 70S particles to form a translation initiation complex at an internal <italic>rbs</italic>. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f1">1</xref>A, the RNA SD-oligonucleotide 5&#x02032;-UAAGGAGGUG-3&#x02032; complementary to the anti-SD bound almost equally well to 30S and 70S ribosomes, whereas only negligible binding to the 50S subunit was observed. It should be noted that the 70S ribosomes were stable under these assay conditions and did not to dissociate into their subunits (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>A). Thus, the lack of translation initiation complex formation at an internal <italic>rbs</italic> by 70S ribosomes cannot be attributed to the inaccessibility of the anti-SD in these particles. Rather, 70S initiation appeared to require a 5&#x02032; proximal position of the start codon.</p><p>To address this question, we studied 70S initiation complex formation on <italic>ompA&#x00394;117</italic> mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f1">1</xref>B), which contains a 5&#x02032; terminal AUG codon, and downstream the canonical <italic>rbs</italic> of <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA. This model mRNA is suited to analyze conditions which affect either 5&#x02032; terminal or internal translation initiation complex formation since the ribosomal choice of either AUG start codon is mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c42">42</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f1">1</xref>B, lane 2, 70S ribosomes formed a translation initiation complex only at the 5&#x02032; terminal AUG, whereas 30S subunits generated a ternary complex almost exclusively at the internal canonical <italic>rbs</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f1">1</xref>B, lane 3). Thus, 70S ribosomes preferentially form a translation initiation complex at 5&#x02032; terminal starts which might be attributed to topological constraints of the 70S mRNA track rather than to an inaccessibility of their anti-SD.</p></sec><sec><title>Selective translation of a leaderless mRNA by particularly stable 70S monosomes derived from an <italic>E.coli rpsB</italic> mutant</title><p>We have recently shown that a leaderless <italic>c</italic>I-<italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA was selectively translated at the non-permissive temperature in the <italic>E.coli rpsB</italic><sup>ts</sup> strain RL425, which carries a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c32">32</xref>). At the elevated temperature the RL425 ribosomes were found to be deficient in both, ribosomal proteins S1 and S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c38">38</xref>). During a further analysis of these S1&#x0002f;S2-deficient 70S particles, we noticed that they were particularly stable. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>, in contrast to RL425-70S ribosomes isolated at 28&#x000b0;C [70S(28&#x000b0;C)] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>A&#x02013;E), the 70S particles isolated at 42&#x000b0;C [70S(42&#x000b0;C)] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>F&#x02013;J) did not dissociate in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> cations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>G). Moreover, the addition of all three initiation factors IF1, IF2 and IF3 in a 2-fold molar excess over 70S(42&#x000b0;C) ribosomes did likewise not result in dissociation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>H), whereas the control 70S(28&#x000b0;C) ribosomes dissociated substantially in the presence of the factors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>C).</p><p>Studying translation initiation by 70S ribosomes <italic>in vitro</italic> is complicated by the fact that cellular extracts are used, which contain initiation factors. Upon addition of 70S ribosomes to an <italic>E.coli</italic> S100 translation mix, the majority of the 70S ribosomes most likely dissociates, and then translation initiation commences with 30S subunits (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c43">43</xref>). Given the results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>F&#x02013;H, we inticipated that the presence of initiation factors in S100 extracts would not lead to a dissociation of the 70S(42&#x000b0;C) monosomes. To test this, both the 70S(28&#x000b0;C) and 70S(42&#x000b0;C) ribosomes were incubated with the S100 extract for 40 min. The subsequent sedimentation profile revealed that a substantial amount of the 70S(28&#x000b0;C) ribosomes had dissociated after incubation with the S100 extract (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>D), whereas the mutant 70S(42&#x000b0;C) ribosomes were retained quantitatively as 70S tight couples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>I). To test whether the 70S(42&#x000b0;C) ribosomes can accomplish translation initiation of a leaderless mRNA but not that of an mRNA with an internal canonical <italic>rbs</italic>, <italic>in vitro</italic> translation extracts were used, which contained either 70S(28&#x000b0;C) or 70S(42&#x000b0;C) ribosomes. Both extracts were programmed with <italic>E.coli ompA</italic> mRNA, the leaderless <italic>c</italic>I mRNA or both, and the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reactions were carried out for 40 min at 28&#x000b0;C. As mentioned above, 70S ribosomes did not form a translation initiation complex on <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c41">41</xref>). Consistent with this observation, 70S(42&#x000b0;C) ribosomes failed to translate <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>K, lanes 2 and 6). However, these 70S(42&#x000b0;C) monosomes translated the leaderless <italic>c</italic>I mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>K, lanes 4 and 6). To test whether the 70S(42&#x000b0;C) ribosomes still persisted after translation, ribosome sedimentation profiles were determined upon <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of <italic>c</italic>I mRNA with 70S(28&#x000b0;C) ribosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>E) and with 70S(42&#x000b0;C) ribosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>J), respectively. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>J, the 70S(42&#x000b0;C) ribosomes did not dissociate after the translation reaction.

Thus, the lack of translation of the canonical <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA by 70S(42&#x000b0;C) tight couples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>K) cannot be solely attributed to their particular stability but also to the absence of the ribosomal proteins S1 and S2. Therefore, we sought for a means to verify the data shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>K with ribosomes containing the full complement of ribosomal proteins. More than 30 years ago, Slobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c37">37</xref>) has crosslinked the ribosomal subunits with dimethylsuberimidate to test whether a <graphic xlink:href="gkh663equ3.gif"/> complex is an obligatory intermediate in protein synthesis. These crosslinked 70S ribosomes were functional in <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of poly(U), whereas they were incompetent in phage f2 mRNA translation. Therefore, the author concluded, that dissociation of the ribosome into subunits is mandatory for initiation of protein synthesis on natural mRNAs. Given that poly(U) resembles leaderless mRNAs in that it lacks ribosomal recruitment signals and has a 5&#x02032; terminal start codon, we tested whether 70SCLR are likewise functional in translation of the natural leaderless <italic>c</italic>I mRNA. Upon crosslinking of the subunits, &#x0223c;70% of the ribosomes were found to be covalently joined and did not dissociate into their subunits in the presence of 1 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f3">3</xref>A). These 70SCLR were purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation and tested for their stability in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> cations as well as in the presence of an S100 extract. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f3">3</xref>B and C, the 70SCLR monosomes remained stable under both conditions. In addition, the 70SCLR contained both ribosomal proteins, S1 and S2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f3">3</xref>D). When 70SCLR were added to the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assay, only the leaderless <italic>c</italic>I mRNA was translated, whereas the 70SCLR failed to translate <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f3">3</xref>E, lane 2).

Upon inactivation of RRF at 42&#x000b0;C in the <italic>E.coli frr</italic><sup>ts</sup> mutant LJ14, the ribosome remained on the mRNA after termination of translation and initiated random translation downstream of the stop codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c21">21</xref>). In other experiments it was observed that under these conditions ribosomes are released from the 3&#x02032;end of mRNA as 70S monosomes (G. Hirokawa and A. Kaji, unpublished work). We therefore reasoned that this would create a situation where wild-type 70S ribosomes are prevalent and would give us the opportunity to examine whether this correlates with a preferential translation of a leaderless mRNA when compared to canonical transcripts.</p><p>To test this idea, the ribosomal profile of the <italic>frr</italic><sup>ts</sup> mutant strain LJ14 was first analyzed under permissive and non-permissive conditions. Even at the permissive temperature (28&#x000b0;C) strain LJ14 contained higher levels of 70S monosomes than the isogenic wild-type strain MC1061 at either 28 or 42&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f4">4</xref>A and B). Upon shift of strain LJ14 to the non-permissive temperature the peaks corresponding to the 30S and 50S subunits were nearly absent and 70S ribosomes were predominant in the cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f4">4</xref>C). Next, we assessed whether the translation yield of a leaderless mRNA correlated with the determined high levels of 70S monosomes in strain LJ14. The strains MC1061(<italic>frr</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and LJ14 (<italic>frr</italic><sup>ts</sup>) were transformed with plasmid pRB381<italic>c</italic>I harboring a chimeric <italic>c</italic>I-<italic>lacZ</italic> gene. The <italic>c</italic>I-<italic>lacZ</italic> gene, which starts with the A of the initiating codon of the <italic>c</italic>I gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c12">12</xref>) was used for the ease of identification of the encoded fusion protein upon separation of total cellular proteins in SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels. Both <italic>E.coli</italic> strains were grown at 28&#x000b0;C in minimal medium and then either kept at 28&#x000b0;C or shifted to 42&#x000b0;C for 40 min. The cells were then pulse labelled for 1 min with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine and total proteins of equal amounts of cells were separated on a 12% SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f4">4</xref>D, even at 28&#x000b0;C, the relative translation of the leaderless <italic>c</italic>I-<italic>lacZ</italic> gene was approximately 3-fold higher in strain LJ14 when compared to the wild-type strain MC1061 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f4">4</xref>D, lanes 1 and 2). Upon temperature shift of strain LJ14 to 42&#x000b0;C translation of bulk mRNA was greatly diminished, whereas translation of the leaderless mRNA was hardly affected when compared to that obtained at the same temperature in the isogenic wild-type strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f4">4</xref>D, lanes 3 and 4).

Given that under these physiological conditions 70S ribosomes dissociate after disassembly from mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c25">25</xref>), leaderless mRNAs must most likely compete with canonical mRNAs for 30S subunits. For the following reasons leaderless mRNAs are poor substrates for 30S subunits. So far, no ribosomal recruitment signals other than the start codon have been identified on leaderless mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c14">14</xref>). Instrumental for ribosome recruitment to these mRNAs is the interaction of the start codon with the anticodon of initiator tRNA bound to the 30S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c13">13</xref>). The stronger tethering of initiator tRNA to 70S ribosomes when compared to 30S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c47">47</xref>) can therefore readily explain the intrinsically low stability of 30S ternary complexes on 5&#x02032; terminal AUGs as well as the preference of 30S subunits for a canonical <italic>rbs</italic> (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f1">1</xref>B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c29">29</xref>). A number of studies have shown that IF3 discriminates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c40">40</xref>) against 30S initiation complex formation on leaderless mRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that their translational efficiency is negatively correlated with the concentration of IF3 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c49">49</xref>). These observations cumulated in the hypothesis that translation initiation of leaderless mRNA with 30S subunits can only be accomplished by a 30S-tRNAi-IF2 complex in the absence of IF3 (14,29,49; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f5">5</xref>B).</p><p>In spite of the prevailing view that <italic>de novo</italic> translation initiation events in bacteria obligatorily require free 30S ribosomes (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f5">5</xref>A), more than a decade ago Balakin <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c28">28</xref>) have put forward the idea that translation initiation of leaderless mRNA commences with 70S monosomes. In this study, we have made use of stable S1&#x0002f;S2-deficient 70S ribosomes and of crosslinked 70S ribosomes, and have shown that these ribosomes do not dissociate under the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions used for translation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f2">2</xref>I and J, and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f3">3</xref>C). Translation of <italic>c</italic>I mRNA by these 70S ribosomes demonstrated for the first time the proficiency of intact 70S monosomes to initiate translation of a naturally occurring leaderless mRNA. In contrast, the failure of these ribosomes to translate the canonical <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA corroborated the <italic>in vitro</italic> toeprinting results in that 70S initiation requires a 5&#x02032; terminal start codon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f1">1</xref>B). The ability of 70S ribosomes to form initiation complexes at 5&#x02032; terminal start codons but not at internal initiation sites might be explained by topological constraints of the mRNA track which is situated at the subunit interface. From the crystal structure of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c51">51</xref>) it appears that entry of the mRNA into the template channel of the 70S monomers requires its 5&#x02032; end to be pulled through the channel between both subunits. Thus, it seems conceivable that a 5&#x02032; terminal AUG can find its way through the tunnel until it is locked in the ribosomal P-site. The same may be less probable for an internal AUG preceded by RNA sequences that can form secondary structures. Further support for this idea comes from studies showing that the 5&#x02032; proximal position of the start codon is important for the <italic>in vivo</italic> translational efficiency of leaderless mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c52">52</xref>).</p><p>By viewing poly(U) as a quasi-leaderless mRNA these results can now explain why Slobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c37">37</xref>) observed poly(U) translation but not phage f2 mRNA translation with crosslinked 70S ribosomes, the latter of which comprises only internal ribosome binding sites. Likewise, we have observed poly(U) translation with the S30 extract derived from the <italic>frr</italic><sup>ts</sup> strain LJ14 grown at 42&#x000b0;C, when 70S ribosomes are predominant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f4">4</xref>C), whereas translation of phage MS2 RNA was hardly discernable (A. Kaji, unpublished work). It seems therefore conceivable that earlier in evolution a stable proto-ribosome-tRNA complex simply initiated translation at the 5&#x02032; terminal codon of single-stranded RNA polynucleotides, and that the contemporary leaderless mRNAs represent remnants of ancestral RNAs which are nowadays equipped with a canonical start codon.</p><p>Translation of the leaderless <italic>c</italic>I-<italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA was observed in strain LJ14 at the non-permissive temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f4">4</xref>D), which provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> correlation between preferential translation of a leaderless mRNA and the prevalence of 70S ribosomes. 70S monosomes are known to be prevalent under adverse conditions, like carbon source downshifts, stationary phase and slow growth, and during cold adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c55">55</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh663f5">5</xref>B and C, the two <italic>tips</italic> with IF3-deficient 30S subunits and with intact 70S ribosomes would ensure a steady translation of leaderless mRNAs under normal physiological conditions as well as at the extremes of physiology. In this way, a constant translation of the leaderless &#x003bb; <italic>c</italic>I as well as of the Tn<italic>1721 tetR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c56">56</xref>) repressor mRNAs would, for instance, ensure silencing of both accessory genetic elements. Several leaderless mRNAs from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species encode proteins that confer resistance to antibiotics, which, although structurally diverse, have the ribosome as a common target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh663c57">57</xref>).
