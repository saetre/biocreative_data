Even though cellular RNAs are known to be non-specifically incorporated into virus particles, we have previously found that encapsidation of APO3G into HIV-1 virions is specifically enhanced by viral genomic RNA. Intracellularly, APO3G was found to form large RNA-protein complexes involving a variety of cellular RNAs. The goal of this study was to investigate the possible contribution of host RNAs recently identified in intracellular APO3G ribonucleoprotein complexes to APO3G's encapsidation into HIV-1 virions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our results show that 7SL RNA, a component of signal recognition particles, and hY1, hY3, hY4, hY5 RNAs were present in intracellular APO3G complexes and were packaged into HIV-1 particles lacking viral genomic RNA unlike APO3G, which was not packaged in significant amounts into genomic RNA-deficient particles. These results indicate that packaging of 7SL or hY RNAs is not sufficient for the packaging of APO3G into HIV-1 virions. We also tested the encapsidation of several other cellular RNAs including &#x003b2;-actin, GAPDH, &#x003b1;-tubulin, and small nuclear RNAs and determined their effect on the packaging of APO3G into nascent virions. Again, we were unable to observe any correlation between APO3G encapsidation and the packaging of any of these cellular RNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results from this study support our previous conclusion that viral genomic RNA is a critical determinant for APO3G incorporation into HIV-1 virions. While most cellular RNAs tested in this study were packaged into viruses or virus-like particles we failed to identify a correlation between APO3G encapsidation and the packaging of these cellular RNAs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>APOBEC3G (APO3G) is a member of the family of cytidine deaminases that in humans include APOBEC1, APOBEC2, seven APOBEC3 variants designated APOBEC3A through 3H, as well as activation-induced deaminase (AID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The protein has potent antiretroviral properties and is expressed in all major target cells susceptible to HIV-1. A crucial prerequisite for antiretroviral activity is the packaging of APO3G into assembling virions. APO3G is efficiently packaged into <italic>vif</italic>-deficient HIV-1 particles but is largely absent from wild type virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A number of studies have shown that packaging of APO3G into virus-like particles (VLP) is mediated through an interaction with the viral Gag precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies demonstrated that the APO3G-Gag interaction is sensitive to RNase-treatment suggesting a possible role of RNA in APO3G encapsidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Consistent with these studies, we previously observed that efficient packaging of APO3G into <italic>vif</italic>-deficient HIV-1 particles required the presence of viral genomic RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, even though small amounts of APO3G were packaged into particles in the absence of viral genomic RNA, such APO3G was sensitive to detergent treatment of the virus and therefore not stably associated with the viral nucleoprotein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. HIV-1 virions containing genomic RNA packaged approximately 3 times more APO3G and the APO3G found in such virions was largely detergent resistant, indicative of stable association with the viral nucleoprotein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Other studies support the significance of viral genomic RNA for the encapsidation of APO3G into HIV-1 particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>APO3G is an RNA binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and recent studies demonstrated that intracellular APO3G can assemble into high molecular mass (HMM) RNA-protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Intracellular HMM complexes of APO3G are thought to lack cytidine-deaminase activity and are unable to restrict retrovirus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Recent analysis of APO3G complexes identified a variety of cellular RNAs including Alu and hY retroelements as well as mRNAs encoding APO3G, ubiquitin, and protein phosphatase 2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. On the other hand, messenger RNA encoding &#x003b1;-tubulin was not identified in APO3G complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Similarly, &#x003b2;-actin mRNA was found to be absent from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or underrepresented in APO3G complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Retroviruses including HIV-1 package small cellular RNAs in addition to two copies of viral genomic RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It is not clear how cellular RNAs are packaged into virions; however, most cellular RNAs appear to be packaged randomly and independent of genomic RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, the efficiency of encapsidation of most of the cellular RNAs seems to reflect their cellular abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. One of the first cellular RNAs identified in murine and avian retroviruses is 7SL RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. 7SL RNA is a critical component of the signal recognition particle and is involved in the recognition of the signal peptide during protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. More recently, 7SL RNA was also identified in HIV-1 virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; however, so far no functional significance has been associated with the presence of 7SL RNA in retroviral particles.</p><p>The current study aimed at the investigation of the possible involvement of cellular RNAs in the encapsidation of APO3G into HIV-1 virions. We focused on RNAs previously identified in intracellular APO3G complexes (e.g. human Y RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or HIV-1 RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]) or previously found in retroviral particles (7SL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; snRNAs (U1-U6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]). We also analyzed mRNAs previously reported to be excluded from intracellular APO3G complexes (&#x003b1;-tubulin and &#x003b2;-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]) and we randomly chose glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to study APO3G binding and virus encapsidation of its mRNA. Our results confirmed the presence of hY1 and hY3 RNAs in intracellular APO3G complexes. In addition, we identified 7SL RNA, U6 snRNA, and GAPDH mRNA as novel components of intracellular APO3G complexes. Only small amounts of &#x003b1;-tubulin mRNA were recovered from APO3G immune complexes as reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; On the other hand, &#x003b2;-actin mRNA was clearly associated with APO3G complexes in our analysis thus contrasting earlier reports. Most of these RNAs were also packaged into HIV-1 virions. Interestingly, packaging of hY RNAs appeared to be inhibited by the presence of genomic RNA while packaging of other cellular RNAs including 7SL RNA was largely independent of viral genomic RNA. Taken together, our data strongly support a role of viral genomic RNA in the specific encapsidation of APO3G. Our results also demonstrate that cellular RNAs are not sufficient for the encapsidation of APO3G into HIV-1 particles and for the functional association with viral nucleoprotein complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Association of APO3G with cellular RNAs</title><p>Cellular APO3G is present in HMM ribonucleoprotein complexes. Analysis of the RNAs in these complexes revealed the presence of Alu RNAs and small Y RNAs, two of the most prominent non-autonomous mobile genetic elements in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We wanted to confirm and extend these observations by further investigating the association of APO3G with other small cellular RNAs such as 7SL RNA, Y RNAs, and U RNAs. Messenger RNAs encoding &#x003b2;-actin, GAPDH, or &#x003b1;-tubulin were included as additional controls for the specificity of APO3G-RNA interactions. HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA-Apo3G-MycHis DNA. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, washed with PBS and divided into two fractions: 30% of the transfected cells were used to isolate total cellular RNA as described in Methods; the remaining 70% of the cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. A sample of the lysate (10%) was used as total protein control for the subsequent immunoblot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Total). Equal fractions of the remaining lysate (45% of total lysate each) were either immunoprecipitated with a myc-specific polyclonal antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A/B</xref>, &#x003b1;-myc) or were exposed to Protein-A beads without antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A/B</xref>, mock). Half of the immunoprecipitated samples were used for immunoblotting to identify APO3G protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of APO3G in the cell extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Total) and the APO3G immune complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, &#x003b1;-myc). As expected, APO3G was absent in the mock immunoprecipitated sample (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, mock). The second half of the precipitated samples was used for RNA extraction. RT-PCR was performed on total RNA and RNA from the immune complexes as described in Methods using a series of primer sets as listed in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. All RT-PCR reactions were done simultaneously. RT-PCR of total RNA identified all RNAs in the total cellular extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, Total). None of the RNAs was amplified from the mock precipitated sample demonstrating the lack of non-specific binding of these RNAs to Protein A beads (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, mock). In contrast, several of the RNAs, including 7SL, &#x003b2;-actin, and GAPDH, as well as hY3 and U6 RNA were recovered from APO3G immune complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, &#x003b1;-myc). Alpha-tubulin mRNA, as well as hY1, hY4, and U4 RNAs were amplified only inefficiently from the APO3G immune complexes suggesting weak interaction of these RNAs with APO3G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, &#x003b1;-myc). In contrast, hY5 cytoplasmic RNAs and U1 and U2 small nuclear RNAs did not appear to associate with APO3G immune complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, &#x003b1;-myc).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primer sets for RT PCR</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Target</bold></td><td align="left" colspan="2"><bold>Primer Sets</bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><bold>forward</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>reverse</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>&#x003b1;-tubulin<sup>1)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">cacccgtcttcagggcttcttggttt</td><td align="left">catttcaccatctggttggctggctc</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>GAPDH<sup>2)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">gaaggtgaaggtcggagtc</td><td align="left">gaagatggtgatgggatttc</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>&#x003b2;-actin<sup>3)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">atggatgatgatatcgccgcg</td><td align="left">ctagaagcatttgcggtggacg</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>7SL<sup>3)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">gggctgtagtgcgctatgc</td><td align="left">cccgggaggtcaccatatt</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Vif</bold></td><td align="left">gatggcaggtgatgattgtgtgg</td><td align="left">ctgtccattcattgtatggc</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>hY1<sup>4)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">ggctggtccgaaggtagtga</td><td align="left">aaagactagtcaagtgcagtagtgag</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>hY3<sup>4)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">ggctggtccgagtgcagtg</td><td align="left">aaaggctagtcaagtgaagcagtgg</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>hY4<sup>4)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">ggctggtccgagtgcagtg</td><td align="left">aaagccagtcaaatttagcagtggg</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>hY5<sup>4)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">agttggtccgagtgttgtggg</td><td align="left">aaaacatgcaagctagtcaagcgcg</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>U1<sup>5)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">cctggcaggggagataccatgatcacg</td><td align="left">ggggaaagcgcgaacgcagtccccc</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>U2<sup>5)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">cttcttggccttttagctaagatc</td><td align="left">ggtgcactgttcctggaggtactgc</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>U4<sup>5)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">gctttgcgcagtggcagtatcg</td><td align="left">cagtctccgtagagactgtcaaaaattg</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>U6<sup>5)</sup></bold></td><td align="left">gtgctcgcttcggcagcacatatac</td><td align="left">ggaacgcttcacgaatttgcg</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>1) Eppendorf cMaster RTplusPCR system (Eppendorf Inc.

Cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis and RT-PCR as described for figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. Myc-tagged and untagged APO3G were efficiently expressed in the transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, top panel, lanes 1&#x02013;2). As expected, untagged APO3G was not immunoprecipitated by the myc-specific antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, top panel, lane 4) while epitope-tagged APO3G-MycHis was identified in the immune complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, top panel, lane 3). A shorter form of APO3G-MycHis co-migrating with the untagged form of APO3G in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> presumably represents C-terminally truncated protein missing part or all of the epitope tag as it was not recognized by epitope-tag-specific antibodies (data not shown). To test non-specific binding of RNA to the myc-specific antibody, we performed RT-PCR as described for figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> using 7SL-specific primers. As expected, 7SL RNA was identified in immune complexes of myc-tagged APO3G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, lower panel, lane 3). However, 7SL RNA was not amplified by RT-PCR from samples containing untagged APO3G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, lower panel, lane 4). These results demonstrate that the presence of 7SL RNA in immune complexes of myc-tagged APO3G was due to the presence of APO3G and not caused by non-specific binding of the RNA to the myc antibody. Finally, the RT-PCR reaction was sensitive to treatment with RNase A as exemplified by the lack of 7SL RNA amplification in RNase-treated samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular RNAs are not sufficient to target APO3G into HIV-1 virions</title><p>Previous studies on murine and avian retroviruses found that these viruses encapsidate a variety of host RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. More recent studies have similarly identified cellular RNAs in HIV-1 particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The experiments described above are both consistent with our previous finding that APO3G has RNA binding properties in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and other studies demonstrating association of APO3G with cellular RNAs as well as HIV-1 RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, we and others previously reported that viral genomic RNA enhances the encapsidation of APO3G into HIV-1 virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Contrasting these findings, other reports concluded that Gag is sufficient for the encapsidation of APO3G into VLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, the APO3G-Gag interaction was found to be either RNA independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or to be sensitive to RNase-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and several studies concluded that nonspecific RNA was critical for APO3G packaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, the parameters determining APO3G packaging into HIV-1 virions remained unclear and warranted further investigation.</p><p>In our next experiment, we compared the packaging of APO3G and cellular RNAs into HIV-1 virions or VLP in an attempt to identify a possible correlation between APO3G packaging and encapsidation of cellular RNAs. Four types of particles were analyzed as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. All particles lacked a functional <italic>vif </italic>gene to prevent degradation of APO3G, which would make interpretation of our results more difficult. NL4-3&#x00394;Vif served as a positive control; C-Help&#x00394;Vif is a helper virus construct lacking both LTRs and carrying deletions in env and in the 5' untranslated region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. C-Help&#x00394;Vif particles do not package detectable quantities of genomic RNA and we previously found that packaging of APO3G into C-Help&#x00394;Vif virions was impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The mS.1&#x00394;Vif construct carries mutations in stem-loop 1 of the 5' untranslated region of the viral RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] mS.1&#x00394;Vif particles contain viral genomic RNA but are impaired in APO3G packaging due to the mutations in the stem loop 1 motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Finally, DB653&#x00394;Vif was included to control for the requirement of NC in RNA and APO3G packaging. DB653&#x00394;Vif was derived from DB653 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and carries SSHS/SSHS mutations in the NC zinc finger motifs.

In contrast, amplification of 7SL RNA as well as &#x003b2;-actin, GAPDH, and &#x003b1;-tubulin mRNAs yielded comparable amounts of PCR products indicative of the presence of similar levels of these cellular RNAs in all three particle preparations. These results suggest that packaging of these RNAs was independent of the presence or absence of viral genomic RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Similarly, U1, U2, U4, and U6 small nuclear RNAs were amplified with similar efficiency from all three particle preparations. while human Y5 RNA was virtually absent from the particles. On the other hand, hY1, hY3, and hY4 RNAs appeared to be packaged more efficiently into C-Help&#x00394;Vif particles than into NL4-3&#x00394;Vif and mS.1&#x00394;Vif virions. The less efficient packaging of hY1, hY3, and hY4 RNAs into NL4-3&#x00394;Vif and mS.1&#x00394;Vif particles is unrelated to APO3G encapsidation as APO3G levels in mS.1&#x00394;Vif particles were as low as in C-Help&#x00394;Vif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

As before, hY5 RNA was virtually absent from all particle preparations including the zinc finger mutant. Interestingly, packaging of 7SL RNA was not affected by mutation of the NC zinc fingers suggesting that 7SL RNA is packaged in an NC-independent manner. In contrast, packaging of hY1, hY3, and hY4 RNAs was critically dependent on intact NC zinc finger domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Thus, packaging of hY RNAs is indeed NC-dependent and the absence of hY RNAs from NL4-3&#x00394;Vif particles is best explained by competitive binding of viral genomic RNA and hY RNA to NC.</p></sec><sec><title>7SL RNA does not promote SRP54 encapsidation</title><p>7SL RNA (also referred to as SRP RNA) is a component of the signal recognition particle (SRP), which is critical for the targeting of nascent secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]). SRP54 is one of six protein subunits that constitute mammalian SRPs and is responsible for high affinity assembly of 7SL RNA into the SRP complex (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]). Given the fact that 7SL RNA was efficiently packaged into HIV-1 virions, we wanted to test whether intracellular high affinity 7SL RNA-SRP54 interactions would result in the recruitment of SRP54 rather than APO3G into HIV-1 virions.</p><p>First, we verified the association of 7SL RNA with SRP54 in normal HeLa cells.

It is also uncontested that the antiviral activity of APO3G &#x02013; with the notable exception of resting CD4+ T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] &#x02013; requires the encapsidation of APO3G into nascent virions (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]). However, the mechanism of APO3G encapsidation is not fully understood. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies demonstrated the ability of APO3G to interact with viral Gag protein and the nucleocapsid region of the viral Gag precursor was identified as the likely APO3G binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Consistent with this model, studies on virus-like particles demonstrated efficient packaging of APO3G in the absence of viral genomic RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] although some of these studies proposed that non-specific cellular RNA may contribute to APO3G encapsidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Our own data confirm the importance of NC for encapsidation as APO3G was not encapsidated into a zinc finger mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The absence of APO3G from DB653&#x00394;Vif particles combined with the presence of low levels of APO3G in C-Help&#x00394;Vif virions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) suggests that APO3G/NC interactions &#x02013; either with or without support from NC-dependent cellular RNAs &#x02013; are sufficient for low level packaging of APO3G into virus-like particles. However, the presence of genomic RNA invariably increased the efficiency of APO3G packaging (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Importantly, our previous analysis of helper virus-associated APO3G demonstrated that APO3G packaged through genomic RNA-independent mechanism(s) is sensitive to detergent treatment and thus most likely not associated with the viral nucleoprotein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The current study was stimulated by recent reports on the presence of cellular 7SL RNA and snRNAs in HIV-1 virions or retroviral particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] as well as the characterization of cellular RNAs associated with intracellular APO3G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our goal was to test the possible contribution of these or other host RNAs towards the packaging of APO3G into HIV-1 particles. Of the four hY RNAs previously identified in APO3G complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], hY3 was clearly identified in APO3G complexes while hY1 and hY4 only weakly interacted with APO3G in our analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Among the snRNAs tested, only U6 clearly co-purified with APO3G complexes and U4 showed weak interaction. This finding is interesting since U6 snRNA localizes primarily to the nucleus and does not have a known cytoplasmic function. Surprisingly &#x003b2;-actin mRNA, which was previously reported to be absent from APO3G complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] as well as GADPH mRNA clearly co-purified with APO3G in our study. In contrast, we confirmed that &#x003b1;-tubulin mRNA only poorly associated with APO3G. The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear and could be due to differences in experimental conditions. Importantly, however, most RNAs tested in our study were packaged into NL4-3&#x00394;Vif virions as well as helper virus and mS.1&#x00394;Vif particles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Interestingly, comparative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that hY1, hY3, and hY4 RNAs were more efficiently packaged into C-Help&#x00394;Vif particles lacking viral genomic RNA than into particles containing viral genomic RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Subsequent analysis of an NC mutant revealed that these hY RNAs are packaged through an NC-dependent mechanism. Thus, their inefficient packaging into NL4-3&#x00394;Vif and mS.1&#x00394;Vif particles may be explained by competitive binding of viral genomic RNA to NC.</p><p>U6 snRNA was previously identified in RSV particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Interestingly, however, U1, U2, and U4 snRNA, all of which were identified in our HIV preparations, were either absent from RSV particles or only present in trace amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. While it is possible that RSV and HIV differ in the packaging of cellular RNAs, it is also possible that the greater sensitivity of the RT-PCR approach used in our study versus the northern blot analysis employed in the RSV analysis contributed to the different findings. Of note, 7SL RNA despite being packaged in molar excess relative to viral genomic RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] did not promote the packaging of SRP54 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) consistent with a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, despite the high affinity interaction of 7SL RNA with SRP54, such intracellular interaction was insufficient to promote packaging of SRP54 into cell-free virions. Similarly, packaging of RNAs previously found in association with intracellular APO3G complexes was insufficient to support APO3G encapsidation. Thus, we did not observe a correlation between the packaging of cellular RNAs into HIV-1 particles and encapsidation of APO3G. The exclusion of APO3G from C-Help&#x00394;Vif particles lacking genomic RNA but containing high levels of cellular RNAs and the absence of APO3G from mS.1&#x00394;Vif particles containing genomic RNA with mutations in the stem-loop 1 region of the 5' untranslated region point to a role of viral genomic RNA in the packaging of APO3G. We cannot formally rule out that other, thus far unidentified cellular RNA species contribute to the packaging of APO3G into virus particles; however, this seems unlikely since we would have to posit that such RNAs are specifically excluded from C-Help&#x00394;Vif and mS.1&#x00394;Vif particles.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated that <italic>vif</italic>-defective HIV-1 particles package a variety of cellular RNAs. Most of the cellular RNAs tested, except hY RNAs, were packaged independent of viral genomic RNA. Packaging of hY RNAs was NC-dependent and inhibited by viral genomic RNA. In all experiments, APO3G packaging correlated well with the presence of viral genomic RNA but not with the presence of any of the cellular RNAs tested. Thus, our data do not support a model in which APO3G is packaged through non-specific or specific interaction with cellular RNAs. In particular, we can rule out that packaging of 7SL RNA is sufficient for the encapsidation of APO3G. Instead, we propose that packaging of APO3G into virus particles is mediated through interaction with viral genomic RNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The <italic>vif</italic>-defective molecular clone pNL4-3&#x00394;Vif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] was used for the production of <italic>vif</italic>-defective HIV-1 virus stocks.

For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 450 &#x003bc;l of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH7.5, 150 mM, NaCl 0.5% and Triton X-100). The cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation (13,000 &#x000d7; g, 3 min) and the supernatant was incubated on a rotating wheel for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis MO) coupled with (IP) or without (Ctrl) anti-myc rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis MO). Immunocomplexes were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4). Bound proteins were eluted form beads by heating in sample buffer for 5 min at 95&#x000b0;C and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies as indicated in the text. For immunoprecipitation of APO3G-RNA complexes, cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation by antibody covered beads or control beads as described above and washed three times with RNA-protein binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, 25 mM KCl, 7 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 5% Glycerol and 0.1% NP-40). Bound RNA was then extracted as described below.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction</title><p>Total cellular RNA was extracted from untransfected and transfected HeLa cells using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. To isolate RNA from immunocomplexes, beads were washed three times with RNA-protein binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, 25 mM KCl, 7 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 5% Glycerol and 0.1% NP-40). RNA was then extracted using RNeasy RNA extraction kit. For isolation of SRP54-associated RNA, SRP54 was precipitated with SRP54-reactive human autoantibodies derived from a patient with polymyositis ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]; gift of Frederick W Miller, NIEHS, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). RNA was then extracted from the immunocomplexes as before</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>RNA extracted from cells, viruses, or immunocomplexes was treated with RNase-free DNase I (10 units, 30 min, 37&#x000b0;C) prior to the RT-PCR reaction. RNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry. RT-PCR was performed using equal amounts of RNA and the one-step RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Primers for the amplification of specific RNAs are listed in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. RNA was first reverse transcribed at 50&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes followed by 30 PCR cycles (denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C; 15 sec; annealing at 55&#x000b0;C, 30 sec; and extension at 72&#x000b0;C, 1 min) and one 10-minute extension cycle at 72&#x000b0;C. RT-PCR products were mixed with DNA loading buffer (EDTA 20 mM, TAE 5&#x000d7;, Glycerol 50% and 0.002% Bromphenol Blue dye), electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels, and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. A DNA size marker was run in parallel.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>M.K. conceived the study, was leading the execution of the experiments, and participated in the writing of the manuscript.
