The results of a comprehensive expression analysis of HsfA2 and Hsp17-CII, two important members of the heat stress system, in the developing anthers of a heat-tolerant tomato genotype are reported here. A transcriptional analysis at different developmental anther/pollen stages was performed using semi-quantitative and real-time PCR. The messengers were localized using <italic>in situ</italic> RNA hybridization, and protein accumulation was monitored using immunoblot analysis. Based on the analysis of the gene and protein expression profiles, HsfA2 and Hsp17-CII are finely regulated during anther development and are further induced under both short and prolonged heat stress conditions. These data suggest that HsfA2 may be directly involved in the activation of protection mechanisms in the tomato anther during heat stress and, thereby, may contribute to tomato fruit set under adverse temperatures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anther development</kwd><kwd>heat stress</kwd><kwd>HsfA2</kwd><kwd>Hsp17-CII</kwd><kwd>pollen</kwd><kwd>tomato</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exposure to environmental stresses, such as high temperature, can severely reduce the productivity/yield of tomato plants grown under field conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Tzur <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>). Decreased fruit set due to heat stress (hs) has been associated with several alterations in the morphology of tomato flower structures and with physiological imbalances in stress-protective metabolites, such as carbohydrates, polyamines, and proline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pressman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The major factor responsible for the failure of tomato fruit to set under suboptimal temperature conditions is considered to be the higher sensitivity of flower developmental processes to temperature changes, with the anthers being reported to be more vulnerable than the female organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peet <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Alterations in tomato anthers, such as a failure of adequate dehiscence and of tapetum development, have been found when hs occurs during the early phases of pollen development, i.e. 7&#x02013;15 d before anthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2002</xref>). However, hs also affects late pollen development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> recently demonstrated that <italic>TMS1</italic>, encoding a Hsp40 heat shock protein with DnaJ and PDI domains, is required for thermotolerance in growing pollen tubes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. A mutation in this gene led to the reduction of seed production when plants were exposed to high temperatures.</p><p>The sensitivity of pollen development to hs has also been attributed to reduced thermotolerance due to the inability of the pollen to provide a strong hs response and, consequently, to produce large quantities of heat shock proteins (Hsps) as compared with vegetative tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mascarenhas and Crone, 1996</xref>). However, both low and high molecular weight Hsps have been found to be expressed in the early and late stages of pollen development in various plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honys and Twell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Volkov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sheoran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frank <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). One hypothesis is that the activation of hs gene expression during plant development is correlated to developmental programmes rather than to the response of the plant under stressful environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Waters <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). According to this proposal, during pollen formation, Hsps may function as molecular chaperones for the folding/refolding of proteins involved in meiosis and tetrad formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouchard, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reynolds, 1997</xref>). The developmental regulation of Hsp expression has been well characterized in animals, where they are induced by distinct heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) activated by endogenous stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pirkkala <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). In contrast, few members of the large Hsf family in plants have been shown to be developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gagliardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Honys and Twell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frank <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kotak <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> observed an elevated expression of HsfA9 during embryogenesis and seed maturation in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and showed that its transcriptional control was strictly mediated by the ABI3 signal cascade. The function of other Hsf genes as potential transcriptional activators of Hsp expression in plant developmental programmes, however, remains poorly understood.</p><p>Researchers have expended the most effort on analysing the network of Hsfs activated in plant tissues, such as leaves, under hs conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Koskull-D&#x000f6;ring <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In particular, one of the components of the tomato Hsf family, HsfA2, shows a number of striking characteristics that suggest it would be an ideal potential transcriptional activator during the hs response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baniwal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mishra <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref> reported that HsfA2 was strongly accumulated in tomato cells under conditions of high temperature, following its induction by the master regulator, HsfA1, and that it became the dominant Hsf component in thermotolerant cells. Three major functional states of HsfA2 are distinguished: a soluble nuclear form, a soluble cytoplasmic form, and a stored form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nover <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heerklotz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Port <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). After the plant has sensed hs, HsfA2 is accumulated in the nucleus of tomato cells in the presence of HsfA1, and both Hsfs then form hetero-oligomeric complexes that markedly enhance the expression of hs genes (Chang-Schaminet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009). In contrast, during ongoing hs conditions, a considerable quantity of HsfA2 is present in large cytoplasmic aggregates (the hs granules). Ultimately, following the hs and during the recovery period, most of the HsfA2 is found in a soluble form in the cytoplasm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Port <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> demonstrated that Hsp17.4-CII acts as a specific repressor of HsfA2 activity, suggesting that this complex is responsible for the recruitment of HsfA2 into hs granules.</p><p>Analyses of <italic>HsfA2</italic> and <italic>Hsp17.4-CII</italic> transcripts revealed a differential regulation during flower development under normal and hs conditions (F Giorno and S Grillo, unpublished data). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frank <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> subsequently demonstrated the expression of these hs genes by transcriptional profiling of tomato microspores.</p><p>The results reported here were obtained from an in-depth investigation on the expression of these genes and the accumulation of their corresponding proteins in the tomato anther during its development under experimental hs conditions. Unravelling the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate Hsf and, thereby, Hsp expression during tomato flower development will undoubtedly be a major step towards improving genetic traits in tomato plants, such as pollen thermotolerance and fruit set.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material, growth, and HS treatments</title><p>Tomato seeds from <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> cv Saladette, a heat-tolerant line that has normal fruit set under high temperature conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rudich <italic>et al.</italic>, 1977</xref>), were germinated and grown at control temperatures (CT: 26 &#x000b0;C / 19&#x000b0; C day/night) under a long-day photoperiod (16/8 h, day/night), with low-intensity light supplied by high-pressure sodium lamps (600W; Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).

For reverse transcription, 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA for each sample was incubated with RNase-free DNase (RQ1; Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and 400 ng of total RNA was used for reverse transcription according to the manufacturer's instructions (iScript&#x02122; cDNA Synthesis Kit; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). PCR analyses were carried out in 25 &#x003bc;l volumes containing 0.125 &#x003bc;l of cDNA synthesis reaction mixture, 400 nM of each primer, and 12.5 &#x003bc;l of iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The PCRs were performed in a 96-well thermocycler (Bio-Rad iCycler; Bio-Rad Laboratories) using a controlled temperature program starting with 3 min at 95 &#x000b0;C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 &#x000b0;C and 45 s at 60 &#x000b0;C. To verify the presence of a specific product, the melting temperature of the amplified products was determined. In addition, a fraction of each PCR mixture was analysed on a 2% agarose&#x02013;ethidium bromide gel to verify the size of the amplified DNA fragment. The primers used for the real-time quantitative PCRs were designed using a computer program (BEACON DESIGNER 5.01; Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA) to obtain primers that have close to identical melting temperatures and do not form secondary structures with each other under the given PCR conditions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp316/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link> available at <italic>JXB</italic> online).</p><p>The primers used to quantify <italic>Hsp17.4&#x02013;CII</italic> and <italic>Hsp17.6-CII</italic> mRNAs were gene specific.

However, the overproduction of Hsps can also interfere with normal developmental processes, as shown by maize plants carrying a mutation in the <italic>Empty Pericarp2</italic> gene. This gene is normally a negative regulator of the heat shock response, but the presence of the mutation results in abortion or retarded embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The results reported here on the temporal and spatial regulation of <italic>HsfA2</italic> and <italic>Hsp17-CII</italic> suggest possible roles for the <italic>Hsf</italic> and <italic>Hsp</italic> genes in developmental processes.</p><p>HsfA2 was more highly expressed in anthers than in other organs and was strongly activated when exposed to hs; this is similar to its expression in leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mishra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). HsfA2 was expressed early in young anthers, at the stage when, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brukhin <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref>, pollen mother cells are developing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frank <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> reported the expression of these genes at the post-meiotic stage, presumably in the tetrads, under non-hs conditions.</p><p>It has been suggested that during these developmental processes Hsps may function as molecular chaperones for the folding/refolding of proteins involved in meiosis and tetrad formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouchard, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reynolds, 1997</xref>). HsfA2 is an activator of Hsp genes and is likely to be involved in the regulation of Hsp activation during tomato pollen/anther development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nishizawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schramm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; Oyawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007). A similar function of transcriptional activator is well documented for Hsf members in animals and also for HsfA9 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, where HsfA9 induces Hsp expression during seed maturation coinciding with dormancy and desiccation tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kotak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Honys and Twell (2004)</xref> meticulously analysed the transcriptome of the male gametophyte of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> but were unable to identify transcripts of <italic>HsfA2</italic>. Given these data from earlier studies, the present results suggest that <italic>HsfA2</italic> expression is differentially modulated between tomato and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Consequently, the species-specific functional diversification previously documented for HsfA1 and HsfB1 may also be extended to HsfA2 in terms of its involvement in different developmental pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bharti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Koskull-D&#x000f6;ring <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>HsfA2 is known to be markedly activated in young anthers in response to hs regimes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frank <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> reported that HsfA2 is strongly expressed in maturing tomato microspores experimentally treated with a short hs at 45 &#x000b0;C. However, in the present study, HsfA2 was activated even with a mild hs (36 &#x000b0;C), and its expression was maintained for several days when plants were subjected to this type of stress. This result indicates that HsfA2 may even be involved in the hs response to milder stresses in order to enhance the expression of Hsp genes and to protect the pollen grains during development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schramm <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> examined the kinetic expression characteristics of HsfA2 and demonstrated that this protein is also present at relatively high levels during the recovery period following the hs. As such, the behaviour of HsfA2 resembles that of typical Hsp proteins in thermotolerant cells. In agreement with these data, in this study, the HsfA2 protein also remained at high levels in the anthers during the recovery periods. However, the decline in mRNA levels of <italic>Hsp17-CII</italic> observed during the recovery periods suggests that the HsfA2 protein was inactive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Port <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> observed that HsfA2 inactivation depends on its interaction with Hsp17.4-CII protein.

In tomato, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mishra <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref> reported that the essential component of the tolerance to high temperature is HsfA1 but that HsfA2 is sufficient to restore the thermotolerance in HsfA1-silenced protoplasts.</p><p>An <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> T-DNA insertion mutant lacking <italic>HsfA2</italic> expression is more sensitive to prolonged hs due to its decreased expression of Hsps and genes such as <italic>ascorbate peroxidase 2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schramm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meiri and Breiman (2009)</xref> recently demonstrated that HsfA2 contributes to the thermotolerance of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by mediating the translocation of the ROF1 and Hsp90.1 protein complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Interference in this shuttle system severely affects the expression of Hsps during hs recovery periods in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant lines and therefore also hinders the acquisition of thermotolerance following exposure to prolonged hs conditions. Recent evidence that maturing microspores of an hs-tolerant line have a higher HsfA2 basal level than those of an hs-sensitive line also suggests that this gene may contribute to pollen thermotolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frank <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>However, it cannot be excluded that other Hsfs are active during microspore development in tomato and that HsfA2 is only one example of such transcription factors.</p><p><italic>HsfA2</italic> expression in dry pollen was not observed here. However, this absence of expression may be due to the fact that dry pollen is metabolically inactive as the cytoplasm is greatly dehydrated; therefore, no further protection should be required at this stage. In contrast, the <italic>Hsp17.6-CII</italic> transcript was detected in the dry pollen. It is therefore possible that this latter gene is activated at this stage by other transcriptional factors that are, in turn, regulated by the desiccation processes, as has been observed for other Hsps in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> during seed maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kotak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the results from the study reported here show that HsfA2 and Hsp17-CII are activated early in the tomato diploid pollen mother cells before the microspores develop and that their expression is persistent under prolonged HS conditions until mature dry pollen is produced. The data suggest that HsfA2 may be directly involved in the activation of protection mechanisms in the tomato anther during hs and, thereby, may contribute to tomato fruit set under adverse temperatures.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp316/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> ara available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp316/DC1"><bold>Table S1.</bold></ext-link> Primer sequences used for semi- and real-time quantitative PCR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="erp316_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="erp316_Primer_sequences.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>Hsp</term><def><p>heat shock protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hsf</term><def><p>heat stress transcriptional factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hs</term><def><p>heat stress</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We would like to thank Peter de Groot for technical assistance, Gerard van der Weerden for the excellent support with greenhouse facilities, Dr Elisabeth Pierson for help with the <italic>in situ</italic> images, and all of our colleagues in our lab for helpful suggestions and advice on this research.
