To explore the trafficking mechanism by which cAMP increases apical NKCC2, we measured cumulative apical membrane exocytosis and NKCC2 exocytic insertion in TALs. By monitoring apical FM1&#x02013;43 fluorescence, we observed rapid stimulation of apical exocytosis (2 min) by forskolin/IBMX. We also found constitutive exocytic insertion of NKCC2 in TALs over time, which was increased by 3-fold in the presence of forskolin/IBMX. PKA inhibition blunted cAMP-stimulated exocytic insertion but did not affect the rate of constitutive exocytosis. We conclude that cAMP stimulates steady-state apical surface NKCC2 by stimulating exocytic insertion and that this process is highly dependent on PKA but not Epac.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">R01 HL080409-05</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">P01 HL090550-01</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The renal-specific Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cotransporter NKCC2 is expressed at the apical membrane and in subapical vesicles in the thick ascending limb (TAL)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> of Henle's loop, where it mediates NaCl reabsorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).

NKCC2 is located in the apical membrane and subapical vesicles of TALs. To study whether cAMP stimulates apical membrane exocytosis in TALs, we monitored the effect of forskolin/IBMX on FM1&#x02013;43 fluorescence in the apical membrane of microperfused TALs. FM1&#x02013;43 is a styryl dye that is impermeable to cell membranes and fluoresces when bound to membranes but not in aqueous solution. Thus, its intensity is directly related to membrane surface area and is used as an index of cumulative exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). TALs were perfused with luminal solution containing FM1&#x02013;43 (2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) for 10 min, and then the luminal solution was exchanged to wash out the dye from apical membranes. Confocal images were acquired every 10 s and later analyzed to quantify apical membrane FM1&#x02013;43 intensity over time in TALs treated with vehicle (basal) or forskolin/IBMX. Under basal conditions, apical FM1&#x02013;43 intensity was stable and did not increase over time for a period of 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). After washout of FM1&#x02013;43 from the TAL lumen, fluorescence intensity was almost completely eliminated, indicating that little FM1&#x02013;43 was internalized via endocytosis. In TALs treated with forskolin/IBMX, we observed a rapid increase in FM1&#x02013;43 fluorescence intensity after 2 min (22 &#x000b1; 6%, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), followed by a sustained increase with a maximal difference of 47 &#x000b1; 7% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) by 7 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>).

However, the trafficking steps and the signaling cascade by which cAMP increases apical NKCC2 in epithelial cells were unknown. Here, we observed that PKA inhibition blocks cAMP-induced increases in steady-state surface NKCC2 when cAMP is increased by either forskolin/IBMX or the physiological agonist dDAVP in native TAL epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Consistent with a role of PKA, a PKA-selective agonist stimulated surface NKCC2 to similar levels compared with forskolin/IBMX, whereas the Epac-selective agonist 8-<italic>p</italic>-chlorophenylthio-2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl-cAMP had no effect on surface NKCC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The absence of an effect of the Epac analog may indicate that Epac is not involved in the stimulation of surface NKCC2 or that the concentration of agonist was not sufficient to stimulate Epac activity. However, the latter is unlikely because the concentration of Epac agonist used was higher than those reported to activate Epac in renal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and polarized epithelial cells. In addition, we observed that during PKA inhibition with H-89, the Epac-selective agonist decreased surface NKCC2 by 20% (data not shown), suggesting an inhibitory role of Epac in NKCC2 trafficking to the membrane that may be masked by low PKA activation. Together, our data indicate that PKA mediates cAMP-induced stimulation of steady-state apical surface NKCC2 in TALs.</p><p>The concentration of H-89 used here has been extensively validated for PKA inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In our experiments, 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> H-89 blocked 70&#x02013;100% of the forskolin/IBMX effect in steady-state apical NKCC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, we observed only a partial blockade of cAMP-stimulated NKCC2 exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). We think that this is due to differences in the incubation time with H-89 in the two protocols. In the exocytic insertion protocol, TALs were warmed in the presence of both H-89 and forskolin/IBMX, whereas for steady-state surface NKCC2 measurements, the PKA inhibitor was preincubated with H-89 before increasing cAMP. It is possible that this shortens the time required for H-89 to maximally inhibit PKA. Alternatively, it is possible that a fraction of cAMP-stimulated exocytic insertion is mediated by a different cAMP-stimulated pathway.</p><p>We also observed constitutive NKCC2 insertion under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that trafficking of NKCC2 to the apical membrane is a continuous dynamic process rather than an event triggered by cAMP. It is likely that constitutive endocytosis and recycling are involved in maintaining steady-state NKCC2 at the apical membrane. However, these processes appear not to be dependent on PKA activity because H-89 did not affect steady-state surface NKCC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) or the rate of exocytic insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Although our data indicate that cAMP stimulates NKCC2 exocytosis, they do not exclude the possibility that cAMP affects endocytosis and recycling of NKCC2 and that these mechanisms also contribute to enhance apical membrane NKCC2 levels.</p><p>The protein targets by which PKA stimulates NKCC2 exocytosis are not known. Our previous data indicate that the SNARE (<underline>s</underline>oluble <underline><italic>N</italic></underline>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor <underline>a</underline>ttachment protein <underline>re</underline>ceptor) family of proteins is involved in NKCC2 trafficking because the stimulation of surface NKCC2 by cAMP was blocked by tetanus toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This neurotoxin blocks vesicle fusion by cleaving the SNARE proteins VAMP-2 and VAMP-3, both of which are expressed and co-localize with NKCC2 in TALs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Several proteins that modulate SNARE-mediated exocytosis such as snapin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), tomosyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), complexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), and Munc18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) mediate PKA-stimulated exocytosis. Thus, we speculate that PKA stimulates NKCC2 exocytosis by SNARE-dependent fusion and trafficking to the apical membrane of TALs. In addition to SNARE protein phosphorylation, rat NKCC2 possesses three predicted serine phosphorylation sites in its C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) that may serve as potential PKA targets. Although phosphorylation at these sites has not been described, N-terminal threonine phosphorylation is associated with enhanced activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), although the kinase involved (SPAK) appears to be unrelated to the cAMP pathway. The contribution of these pathways to NKCC2 exocytosis remains to be studied.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grants R01 HL080409-05 and P01 HL090550-01 (Subproject 2; to P.
