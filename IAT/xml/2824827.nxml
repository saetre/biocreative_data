It is reasonable to assume that, like its role in neuronal development, Nestin is essential for the retinal development primarily by controlling the retinal progenitor cell survival. Lens development may require Nestin for similar reasons. Nestin was reported to be expressed in the epithelium of lens vesicle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009318-Mokry1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Nestin</italic> MO may induce apoptosis of the epithelial progenitor cells, resulting in defective lens development and organization.</p><p>In summary, nestin is widely expressed in developing zebrafish brain and eyes, especially in the neural, retinal and lens epithelial progenitor cells. It plays a crucial role in protecting progenitor cells from apoptosis thereby facilitating progenitor cell development into neurons, glial cells, motor nerves, retina and lens. Its deficiency leads to enhanced progenitor cell apoptosis and defective brain, eye and cranial nerve development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009318.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Comparison of <italic>isl1</italic> expression in embryos treated with control MO vs. <italic>nestin</italic> MO. <italic>Isl1</italic> expression was analyzed by WMISH.
