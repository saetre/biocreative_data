Centrosome duplication normally parallels with DNA replication and is responsible for correct segregation of replicated DNA into the daughter cells. Although geminin interacts with Cdt1 to prevent loading of MCMs (minichromosome maintenance proteins) on to the replication origins, inactivation of geminin nevertheless causes centrosome over-duplication in addition to the re-replication of the genome, suggesting that geminin may play a role in centrosome duplication. However, the exact mechanism by which loss of geminin affects centrosomal duplication remains unclear and the possible direct interaction of geminin with centrosomal-localized proteins is still unidentified.</p><p><italic>Results</italic>. We report in the present study that geminin is physically localized to the centrosome. This unexpected geminin localization is cell-cycle dependent and mediated by the actin-related protein, Arp1, one subunit of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex. Disruption of the integrity of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex by overexpression of dynamitin/p50, a well-characterized inhibitor of dynactin, reduces the centrosomal localization of both geminin and Arp1. Enrichment of geminin on centrosomes was enhanced when cellular ATP production was suppressed in the ATP-inhibitor assay, whereas the accumulation of geminin on the centrosome was disrupted by depolymerization of the microtubules using nocodazole. We further demonstrate that the coiled-coil motif of geminin is required for its centrosomal localization and the interaction of geminin with Arp1. Depletion of geminin by siRNA (small interfering RNA) in MDA-MB-231 cells led to centrosome over-duplication. Conversely, overexpression of geminin inhibits centrosome over-duplication induced by HU in S-phase-arrested cells, and the coiled-coil-motif-mediated centrosomal localization of geminin is required for its inhibition of centrosome over-duplication. Centrosomal localization of geminin is conserved among mammalian cells and geminin might perform as an inhibitor of centrosome duplication.</p><p><italic>Conclusions</italic>. The results of the present study demonstrate that a fraction of geminin is localized on the centrosome, and the centrosomal localization of geminin is Arp1-mediated and dynein&#x02013;dynactin-dependent. The coiled-coil motif of geminin is required for its targeting to the centrosome and inhibition of centrosome duplication. Thus the centrosomal localization of geminin might perform an important role in regulation of proper centrosome duplication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>actin-related protein 1 (Arp1)</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>dynamitin/p50</kwd><kwd>dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex</kwd><kwd>geminin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>Arp1, actin-related protein 1</kwd><kwd>Az, sodium azide</kwd><kwd>CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase</kwd><kwd>Co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation</kwd><kwd>DAPI, 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole</kwd><kwd>DOG, 2-deoxyglucose</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>GST, glutathione transferase</kwd><kwd>HU, hydroxyurea</kwd><kwd>MCM, minichromosome maintenance protein</kwd><kwd>MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast</kwd><kwd>pre-RC, pre-replication complex</kwd><kwd>siRNA, small interference RNA</kwd><kwd>TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine &#x003b2;-isothiocyanate</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><ref-count count="32"/><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome stability is maintained by high-fidelity replication of the genome and faithful separation of replicated DNAs into daughter cells. Regulation of DNA replication is achieved by proper licensing of the pre-RC (pre-replication complex), which involves the stepwise recruitment of Orcs, Cdc6, Cdt1 and MCMs (minichromosome maintenance proteins) on to the replication origins. In late mitosis and G<sub>1</sub>-phase, MCM2-7, a putative replicative helicase, is assembled on to replication origins to license DNA replication (Chong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">1995</xref>; Yankulov et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">1999</xref>). Functional assembly of MCM proteins on to chromatin is dependent upon Cdc6 and Cdt1 (Tanaka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1997</xref>; Maiorano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2000</xref>). Once DNA replication is initiated, the replication licensing is inhibited by CDKs (cyclin-dependent kinases), Cdt1 degradation and the binding of the inhibitory protein geminin to Cdt1. Cdt1 is expressed in the G<sub>1</sub>-phase and is phosphorylated at the onset of S-phase, and is almost degraded through SCF (Skp1/cullin/F-box)-Skp2 and CUL4-DDB1-CDT2 ubiquitin E3 ligases (Nishitani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2001</xref>; Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2004</xref>). During S- and G<sub>2</sub>-phase, non-proteolytic Cdt1 is inactivated by binding to geminin, and consequently the inactivation of Cdt1 prevents MCMs reloading on to chromatin (McGarry and Kirschner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1998</xref>; Wohlschlegel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2000</xref>; Yanagi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2002</xref>; Xouri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2007</xref>). This process ensures that replication origins fire only once per cell cycle. Loss of geminin results in genomic over-replication (Melixetian et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2004</xref>; Zhu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2004</xref>).</p><p>Centrosome duplication is strictly regulated in parallel with DNA replication (Hinchcliffe and Sluder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2001</xref>). As the major MTOCs (microtubule-organizing centres) in animal cells, the centrosome duplicates during S-phase and plays a significant role in the assembly and bipolarity of the spindle (Nigg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2002</xref>). A large set of proteins is localized on the centrosomes and are involved in centrosome duplication. Cytoplasmic dynein is a multisubunit microtubule motor complex that, together with its activator, dynactin, drives its cargo toward the minus ends of the microtubules and centrosomes. Dynactin has been proposed to function as a linker between dynein and its cargo (King and Schroer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2000</xref>). Arp1 (actin-related protein 1; also known as centractin-&#x003b1;), the most abundant subunit in the dynactin complex, is in charge of microtubule transport of cellular organelles and centrosome-related proteins towards the minus end (Merdes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2000</xref>; Xiang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2000</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that loss of geminin causes centrosome over-duplication in addition to genomic over-duplication, further evidence that geminin is an inhibitor of centrosome over-duplication (Tachibana et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2005</xref>), but the exact mechanism is unclear. The potential centrosomal proteins that directly interact with geminin are also unidentified. In the present study, we observed that geminin is localized to the centrosomes. The centrosomal localization of geminin is functional dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex-dependent and the interaction of geminin with the dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex is mediated by Arp1. The coiled-coil motif is required for centrosomal localization of geminin and the interaction of geminin with Arp1. The accumulation of geminin on centrosomes might shed light on uncovering the role of geminin in co-ordinating DNA replication and centrosome duplication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>A fraction of geminin is localized on centrosomes in the cell cycle</title><p>To study the speculated function of geminin on centrosome duplication, we cloned the human geminin gene, expressed the protein fused with GFP (green fluorescent protein) in HeLa cells and followed its localization. In the living cells, surprisingly, we observed that a fraction of GFP&#x02013;geminin was localized on the aster-like structures in interphase and spindle fibres in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, indicated with arrowheads). To determine whether the aster-like structure was the centrosome, we fixed HeLa cells with ice-cold methanol and performed an immunofluorescence count staining using an antibody against &#x003b3;-tubulin, a protein marker for centrosomes.

To verify that the centrosomal localization of GFP&#x02013;geminin was not an artefact due to overexpression of GFP&#x02013;geminin, we performed co-immunofluorescence staining of endogenous geminin using a geminin-specific antibody with the antibody anti-&#x003b3;-tubulin.

To test this assumption, with Western blot analysis and immunostaining, we analysed two other cell lines, one is the MDA-MB-231 cell, a breast cancer cell line from humans, and the other is the MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cell, an embryonic fibroblast cell line from mouse. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>(C), the antibody raised for human geminin also cross-reacted with mouse geminin. Similar to the results in HeLa cells, a fraction of endogenous geminin was clearly co-localized with &#x003b3;-tubulin on centrosomes in interphase and spindle fibres and poles in mitosis in both MDA-MB-231 and MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, indicated with arrowheads).</p><p>To determine the timing of geminin localization on centrosomes, we synchronized HeLa cells at anticipated times through double-thymidine arrest.

The proteins co-immunoprecipitated with geminin were separated by SDS/PAGE and analysed by MS. We observed the presence of Arp1 and dynactin1 in the protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The interaction between geminin and Arp1 was further examined by Co-IP (co-immunoprecipitation) using anti-geminin and anti-Arp1 antibodies. Arp1 can be co-immunoprecipitated by geminin, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Arp1 could also be pulled down by exogenous GST (glutathione transferase)&#x02013;geminin protein from HeLa cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). These results showed the direct interaction of geminin with Arp1. It is reported that Arp1 is the most abundant subunit of the dynactin complex, a cargo carrier toward the minus-end of microtubules (Fouquet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2000</xref>). Arp1 is also a centrosomal protein and localizes on centrosomes and spindle in mitosis (Clark and Meyer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1992</xref>). The results of the present study confirmed the localization of Arp1 on centrosomes and spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, indicated by arrowheads). We then examined the co-localization of geminin and Arp1 on centrosomes.

Kinetochore components, such as Mad2 (mitotic arrest deficient 2), BubR1 [Bub (budding uninhibited by benomyl)-related 1] and CENP-E (centrosomal protein E), would be targeted on to the spindle poles through the dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex after ATP reduction (Howell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2001</xref>). If geminin was transported to the centrosome through the dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex, the centrosomal concentration of geminin would be enhanced after cellular ATP reduction when microtubule plus-towards transport was impaired. Consistent with our hypothesis, after incubation with 5&#x000a0;mM Az and 1&#x000a0;mM DOG for 30&#x000a0;min at 37&#x000b0;C, in which cellular ATP was reduced to 5&#x02013;10% of normal levels, both endogenous geminin and GFP&#x02013;geminin were enriched at the centrosome in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>D, indicated by arrowheads).

We then observed that geminin was no longer enriched on centrosomes when the cells were subjected to treatment with Az/DOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, indicated with arrowheads).

In the present study, centrosome over-duplication was observed after introducing siGeminin into the MDA-MB-231 cells for 48&#x000a0;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). In siGeminin-transfected cells, approx. 20% multiple centrosomes were observed, whereas in control cells only 5% multiple centrosomes were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). It was reported that loss of geminin leads to genome over-replication (Melixetian et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2004</xref>; Zhu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2004</xref>; Machida and Dutta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2007</xref>). If the centrosome over-duplication was induced by loss of geminin, but not DNA re-replication, overexpression of geminin might inhibit the centrosome over-duplication without DNA re-replication. It has been known that HU, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, arrests cells at S-phase and leads to centrosome over-duplication without DNA re-replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C) (D'Assoro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2004</xref>; Tachibana and Nigg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2006</xref>).

These results suggest that the centrosomal localization of geminin defines an important role in centrosome duplication.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>DNA replication and centrosome duplication are two parallel key events for cell proliferation. Any regulation and co-ordination failure of these events would be a disaster to the cell life, or lead to genome instability. Eukaryotic cells have developed an elaborate mechanism to co-ordinate DNA replication and centrosome duplication and to limit the two key events to occur only once in one cell cycle (Hinchcliffe and Sluder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2001</xref>; Bell and Dutta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2002</xref>), although the detail of the mechanism is unclear. DNA replication is initiated by DNA replication licensing of the pre-RC and is tightly regulated by the DNA replication inhibitor geminin and oscillations of CDKs. Depletion of geminin not only leads to genome amplification (Melixetian et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2004</xref>; Zhu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2004</xref>; Machida and Dutta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2007</xref>), but also centrosome over-duplication and subsequent mitotic defect (Tachibana et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2005</xref>). Overexpression of geminin inhibits centrosome over-duplication caused by HU treatment (Tachibana and Nigg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2006</xref>). It was also reported that Orcs and MCMs, members of the pre-RC, localize to the centrosome (Stuermer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2007</xref>). But the possible direct interaction between geminin and centrosomal localization proteins is still unidentified. In the present study, we directly demonstrated that a fraction of geminin is physically localized to centrosomes. Through an ATP-inhibitor assay and disruption of the function of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex by overexpressing its specific inhibitor dynamitin/p50, we further demonstrated that the centrosomal geminin fraction is transported along with microtubules by the dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex, and the transportation mechanism is conservative, at least in mammalian cells.</p><p>Arp1 is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular events. It is a subunit of the dynactin complex, and facilitates the centrosomal accumulation of some centrosome-associated proteins conducted by dynein&#x02013;dynactin. It has also been proposed that Arp1 serves as a linker between the cargo protein and dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex during the transportation of the cargo proteins to the centrosomes (Schroer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1996</xref>). In the present study, we observed that geminin and Arp1 associated with each other and were co-localized on centrosomes. Functional disruption of the dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex by overexpressing dynamitin/p50 not only resulted in disassociation of geminin, but also Arp1 from the centrosomes. These results might suggest that the centrosomal geminin is transported to centrosomes by the dynein&#x02013;dynactin complex mediated by Arp1.</p><p>The coiled-coil motif of geminin is required for its dimerization and interaction with Cdt1 and inhibition of DNA replication (Benjamin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2004</xref>; Saxena et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2004</xref>). The results of the present study show that the coiled-coil motif is also required for the geminin interaction with Arp1 and its centrosomal localization. The coiled-coil-motif-mediated centrosomal localization of geminin is also required for its inhibition of centrosome over-duplication. We propose that geminin plays a different role through the coiled-coil motif and might be a linker between DNA replication and centrosome duplication.</p><p>Taken together, the present study raised a notion that geminin plays roles in the cell cycle, not only preventing DNA over-replication through an extensively elucidated DNA replication inhibitor to inhibit Cdt1, but also prohibiting centrosome over-duplication possibly through interfering locally with the function of one or more centrosomal components, which is so far uncharacterized. We propose that, similar to the regulation by geminin of DNA replication initiation, the regulation by geminin of centrosome duplication is achieved through transportation of a fraction of this protein to the duplicating centrosomes to bind and inhibit the centrosome duplication initiator(s) once the centrosome duplication is initiated. However, the coiled-coil domain is a kind of domain which meditates potential protein&#x02013;protein interactions, the detailed mechanism of interaction between geminin and Arp1 is still to be clarified, and the downstream targets need to be identified. Furthermore, the final characterization of the initiator(s) is needed for finally solving the mechanism of centrosome duplication regulation by geminin. Although the regulation of centrosome duplication has not yet been rigorously defined, our results favour an hypothesis that geminin might directly co-ordinate the two key events of DNA replication and centrosome duplication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids and antibodies</title><p>Human geminin (GenBank&#x000ae; assession number: NM_015895) and Arp1 (GenBank&#x000ae; assession number: NM_005736) were cloned from a cDNA library using RT (reverse transcriptase)&#x02013;PCR and subcloned into pET28a for protein purification and pEGFPC2 for transfection.

Cells were then in turn washed with TBS [10&#x000a0;mM Tris/HCl (pH&#x000a0;7.4) and 150&#x000a0;mM NaCl] and 1/10 TBS/8% (w/v) sucrose, and then lysed in buffer A [1&#x000a0;mM Hepes (pH&#x000a0;7.2), 0.5% Nonidet P40, 0.5&#x000a0;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1&#x000a0;mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1&#x000a0;mM PMSF, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin and 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml pepstatin A] and centrifuged at 2500&#x000a0;<bold><italic>g</italic></bold> for 10&#x000a0;min to remove cell debris, nuclei and chromatin. The lysate were filtered through a nylon mesh (125&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) and adjusted to a final concentration of 10&#x000a0;mM Hepes. The sample was treated with 2&#x000a0;units/ml DNase I for 30&#x000a0;min on ice and centrifuged with a 60% (w/v) sucrose cushion at the bottom of centrifugation tube for 30&#x000a0;min at 10000&#x000a0;<bold><italic>g</italic></bold>.

The sedimented centrosomes in the sucrose solution were divided into equal volumes of 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l.
