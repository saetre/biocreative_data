Cellular PAcP functions as a neutral protein tyrosine phosphatase and is involved in regulating androgen-promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation. Despite the fact that the promoter of the <italic>PAcP</italic> gene has been cloned, the transcriptional factors that regulate PAcP expression remain unidentified. This article describes our analyses of the promoter of the <italic>PAcP</italic> gene. Deletion analyses of the promoter sequence up to &#x02212;4893 (&#x02212;4893&#x0002f;&#x0002b;87) revealed that a 577 bp fragment (&#x02212;1356&#x0002f;&#x02212;779) represents the unique positive <italic>cis</italic>-active element in human prostate cancer cells but not in HeLa cervix carcinoma cells. Interestingly, the 577 bp fragment contains a non-consensus nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B)-binding site that is required for NF-&#x003ba;B up-regulation in prostate cancer cells, while NF-&#x003ba;B failed to have the same effect in HeLa cells. Conversely, inhibition of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway stopped p65 NF-&#x003ba;B activation of the p1356 promoter activity. Gel shift and mutation analyses determined that AGGTGT (&#x02212;1254&#x0002f;&#x02212;1249) is the core sequence for NF-&#x003ba;B-binding and activation. Biologically, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;&#x00029; activated endogenous PAcP expression in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. The data collectively indicate that NF-&#x003ba;B up-regulates PAcP promoter activity via its binding to the AGGTGT motif, a novel binding sequence located inside the <italic>cis</italic>-active enhancer element in human prostate cancer cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Prostate cancer has become major a health problem in the male population of the Western world and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c1">1</xref>). This is in part due to the lack of effective therapy for advanced prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c3">3</xref>). Therefore, the application of gene therapy to this cancer has attracted great attention. There is considerable interest in achieving a high level of expression in a defined cell population through specific promoters or regulatory elements. Several human genes that exhibit prostate-specific or prostate-enriched expression have been identified, including prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c4">4</xref>), PSMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c5">5</xref>), Nkx3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c6">6</xref>), DD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c7">7</xref>) and PAcP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c10">10</xref>). Nevertheless, in part due to the androgen-dependent manner of their expression, except for PAcP and DD3, their potential application to patients undergoing androgen ablation therapy requires further investigation.</p><p>Human PAcP has a long history of serving as a marker for prostate cancer due to its prostate-specific manner of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c12">12</xref>). There are two forms of PAcP: the cellular and the secretory forms. The intracellular level of PAcP is decreased, correlating with prostate carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c13">13</xref>), but its secreted protein in circulation may serve as a marker for cancer diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c14">14</xref>). The cellular form of PAcP functions as a neutral protein tyrosine phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c15">15</xref>) and is involved in regulating cell growth by dephosphorylating ErbB-2 in human prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c17">17</xref>). Cellular PAcP is also involved in regulating non-genomic, androgen-promoted prostate cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c18">18</xref>). The regulation of PAcP expression and secretion has been of long-standing interest. In the past five decades, PAcP secretion has served as a marker for androgen action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c19">19</xref>). Nuclear run-on experiments have revealed that androgens can regulate PAcP expression at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c12">12</xref>). Despite intensive studies of androgen regulation of PAcP expression at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c20">20</xref>), its transcriptional regulation remains an enigma. It has been proposed that androgen regulation of the PAcP gene is mediated via putative steroid-response elements (SREs) located between &#x02212;1576 and &#x0002b;336 on the <italic>PAcP</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c22">22</xref>). The results of initial studies, however, show that androgens cannot activate the promoter activity of constructs covering these elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c21">21</xref>). It is possible that the responsibility for androgen regulation lies with the distal SRE(s) in the PAcP promoter, as found in PSA and probasin promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c24">24</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>cis</italic>-active element located between &#x02212;1356 and &#x02212;779 of the PAcP promoter is involved in regulating the high level of prostate-specific promoter activity and exhibits androgen independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c25">25</xref>). Taking all this into accounts, the promoter of the PAcP gene represents an interesting candidate for potential application in promoter-based gene therapy for advanced prostate cancer and serves as a model for understanding cell-specific expression.</p><p>Nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B)&#x0002f;Rel includes a family of related transcription factors that bind to a set of related DNA sequences, i.e. the &#x003ba;B-binding site, for regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c28">28</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B forms homo- or heterodimeric complexes of various subunits, and the classical NF-&#x003ba;B is a heterodimer composed of a 50 kDa (p50) subunit and a 65 kDa (p65) subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c29">29</xref>). Different NF-&#x003ba;B dimers can bind to the known &#x003ba;B sites bearing the consensus sequence GGGRNNYYCC or GGRRNNYCCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c30">30</xref>). The diverse regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent promoters is due at least in part to the ability of different dimers to bind to the same or distinct &#x003ba;B sites in a cell-type- and&#x0002f;or stimulus-dependent manner. For example, p65&#x0002f;RelA, c-Rel and RelB are positive regulators due to the presence of the potent transcriptional-activation domain. Although those dimers composed solely of Rel proteins lacking transcriptional-activation domains, e.g. p50 and p52, may in general mediate transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c29">29</xref>), p50&#x0002f;p50 or p52&#x0002f;p52 homodimers can be transcriptional activators along with the Bcl-3 coactivator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c32">32</xref>). Interestingly, Bcl-3 is also an inhibitor for these latter homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c32">32</xref>). In cells, in the absence of stimuli, NF-&#x003ba;B is sequestered in the cytoplasm by association with the inhibitory proteins I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c30">30</xref>). Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B occurs through the site-specific phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B, e.g. serine-32 and -36 of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, by I&#x003ba;B kinases (IKKs) and subsequent degradation of I&#x003ba;B. This activation allows the translocation of the released NF-&#x003ba;B into the nucleus to regulate target gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c33">33</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B can be activated by diverse signals, leading to regulation of various cellular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c35">35</xref>). For example, NF-&#x003ba;B may be involved in the progression of breast cancer cells from the hormone-dependent to the hormone-independent stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c36">36</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B is also activated in some hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c38">38</xref>). Interestingly, the androgen receptor and NF-&#x003ba;B are mutually antagonistic in transcription assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c39">39</xref>), raising the possibility that the development of androgen independence in prostate cancer cells may be due in part to the aberrant regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B-targeted genes. Clearly, further studies are required to clarify the functional role of NF-&#x003ba;B in prostate cancer progression.</p><p>Despite the potential importance of PAcP in prostate cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c40">40</xref>), little information is available about transcriptional factors that are involved in regulating the expression of this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c42">42</xref>). In this article, we describe the characterization of a 5 kb PAcP promoter fragment. Our data reveal that &#x02212;1356&#x0002f;&#x02212;779 is the unique positive <italic>cis</italic>-active regulatory element. Within this element, we found a novel hexanucleotide NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site that is required for NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated further activation of the PAcP promoter in human prostate cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The cell culture medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), gentamicin, glutamine, Opti-MEM medium and LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent were obtained from Invitrogen, Inc.

We constructed a series of CAT reporter vectors containing various external and internal deletions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f1">1</xref>) and then transiently transfected them into PC-3 human prostate cancer cells in order to quantify CAT activities. The promoter activity of p779 was arbitrarily assigned the value 1.0 and was used as the reference for normalizing the activities of the other constructs [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f1">1</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c25">25</xref>)].</p><p>Deletion analyses of the 5 kb promoter DNA fragment revealed that the p1356 construct exhibited the highest level of activity among the promoter constructs examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f1">1</xref>). Similarly high levels of activity were observed for p1305 and p1258 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f1">1</xref>). Since p1258, p1305 and p1356 exhibited approximately the same (high) level of activity, these plasmids were used interchangeably for constructing various reporter vectors. The CAT activity of p4893 was &#x0003c;5% of that of p1356. When the region from &#x02212;3262 to &#x02212;2598 (p4893&#x00394;I) was deleted, the promoter activity of the resulting plasmid was as low as that of p4893, indicating that there is no putative regulatory element inside this fragment. The promoter activity of p4893&#x00394;II, containing a deletion between &#x02212;3262 and &#x02212;1305, was lower than that of p1305, indicating the presence of a negative regulatory element located between &#x02212;4893 and &#x02212;3262. Deletion of the region from &#x02212;3888 to &#x02212;1305 (p4893&#x00394;III) caused an increase in the level of CAT activity, to approximately twice that p4893&#x00394;II, suggesting the presence of a negative regulatory element within the region &#x02212;3888&#x0002f;&#x02212;3262. The data also indicate the presence of negative regulatory element(s) between &#x02212;4893 and &#x02212;3888, because the promoter activity of p4893&#x00394;III was &#x0223c;20% that of p1305. Previous analyses of the region between &#x02212;2899 and &#x02212;1305 revealed the presence of two negative regulatory regions, &#x02212;2899&#x0002f;&#x02212;2583 and &#x02212;1668&#x0002f;&#x02212;1356 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c25">25</xref>).</p><p>We also analyzed whether p1305 exhibits a high level of activity in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells that express endogenous PAcP. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f1">1</xref>B, among the three plasmids examined, p1305 exhibited the highest level of promoter activity, as observed in PC-3 cells. The lower activity of p1305 in LNCaP cells than in PC-3 cells is possibly due to competition of transcriptional factors with the endogenous gene. Interestingly, in HeLa human cervix epitheloid carcinoma cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f1">1</xref>B), WI-38 human lung diploid cells and A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells [data not shown and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c25">25</xref>)], these three plasmids exhibited a similarly low level of promoter activity. The data thus clearly show that the sequences between &#x02212;1258 and &#x02212;779 are required for the high level of PAcP expression in prostate cancer cells, although p1356 exhibits an &#x0223c;20% higher level of promoter activity than p1305 and p1258.

To identify the potential protein-binding sites in the <italic>cis</italic>-active region, a DNase I protection assay was carried out using nuclear protein extracts from PC-3, DU145 and HeLa cells. Two partially overlapping subsegments of the enhancer, i.e. from &#x02212;1356 to &#x02212;992 and from &#x02212;1111 to &#x02212;737, which were synthesized by PCR with end-labeled primers, were used as probes for the positive strand, while a filled-in fragment from &#x02212;1356 to &#x02212;779 was used as the probe for the negative strand. The labeled probes were incubated with prostate (DU 145 or PC-3) or non-prostate (HeLa) nuclear proteins and subsequently digested with DNase I. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f2">2</xref>A and B, DNase footprinting analyses identified at least six protected regions in the coding strand from &#x02212;1300 to &#x02212;1286 (I), &#x02212;1277 to &#x02212;1238 (II), &#x02212;1228 to &#x02212;1199 (III), &#x02212;1082 to &#x02212;1073 (IV), &#x02212;1069 to &#x02212;1047 (V) and &#x02212;986 to &#x02212;976 (VI). Two footprints were detected in the non-coding strand from &#x02212;1266 to &#x02212;1240 (II&#x02032;) and from &#x02212;1226 to &#x02212;1191 (III&#x02032;) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f2">2</xref>C). Similar results from footprinting analyses were obtained when LNCaP nuclear proteins were utilized (data not shown). The data indicate that several transcriptional factors interact with the positive regulatory fragment of the PAcP promoter sequence, while no distinct protection region by prostate nuclear proteins, differing from HeLa nuclear proteins, was identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Computer analyses of the positive regulatory sequence in the PAcP promoter</title><p>We investigated putative transcriptional factor-binding sites in this <italic>cis</italic>-active region using the MatInspector database.

Since region II contains a putative binding site for the AP1 protein, a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotide, designated PSD and corresponding to the sequence between &#x02212;1262 and &#x02212;1242 of the PAcP promoter (shown in bold in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f3">3</xref>), was incubated with nuclear protein extracts from HeLa, DU 145 and PC-3 cells. Purified AP1 protein and its consensus oligonucleotide were used as a positive control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f4">4</xref>A, lane 2). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f4">4</xref>A, there were several bands with reduced mobilities revealed by EMSA using nuclear extracts with the PSD oligonucleotide. These nuclear protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were outcompeted by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled PSD oligonucleotide, indicating the specific interaction of nuclear proteins with PSD oligonucleotides. Similar patterns of nuclear protein&#x02013;DNA complex formation were obtained by utilizing LNCaP nuclear proteins, although overall the signal was weaker than for PC-3 nuclear proteins (data not shown). However, no complex formation was observed between the AP1 protein and the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled PSD oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f4">4</xref>A, lane 3), and the unlabeled PSD oligonucleotide failed to compete with the AP1 consensus oligonucleotide in complex formation with the AP1 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f4">4</xref>A, lane 4). Similarly, the AP1 consensus oligonucleotide could not compete with the PSD oligonucleotide in complex formation with nuclear proteins from PC-3 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f4">4</xref>B, lane 3). Therefore, the consensus AP1 sequence on PSD was unable to function as an AP1-binding site, i.e. the AP1 protein could not bind to the PSD oligonucleotide, while several DNA-binding proteins can bind to the PSD fragment of the PAcP promoter <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>A novel NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site located in the &#x02212;1262&#x0002f;&#x02212;1242 sequence of the <italic>cis</italic>-active region of the PAcP promoter</title><p>In order to determine whether the PSD oligonucleotide could interact with known transcription factor(s), several commercially available consensus oligonucleotides were utilized to compete with the PSD oligonucleotide in complex formation with nuclear proteins from PC-3 cells. Unexpectedly, the formation of PSD&#x02013;protein complexes was outcompeted by an NF-&#x003ba;B consensus oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>A), but not by AP2, OCT1, CREB, SP1 or TFIID. To confirm that the NF-&#x003ba;B protein could bind directly to the PSD oligonucleotide, we performed an EMSA using the p50 NF-&#x003ba;B protein. The formation of a DNA&#x02013;protein complex was clearly seen between the NF-&#x003ba;B protein and the PSD oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>B, lane 1) as well as between the NF-&#x003ba;B protein and the authentic NF-&#x003ba;B consensus oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>B, lane 3). The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by the successful competition from an excess amount of corresponding, unlabeled oligonucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>B, lanes 2 and 4). Similarly, the p65 NF-&#x003ba;B protein formed complexes with the authentic NF-&#x003ba;B consensus oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>C, lane 1) as well as PSD oligonucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>C, lane 3). Unlabeled PSD oligonucleotides competed with the formation of the PSD oligonucleotide and p65 NF-&#x003ba;B complexes, indicating the specificity of the interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>C, lane 5). In order to further determine the interaction between the NF-&#x003ba;B subunit and PSD oligonucleotides, we performed super-shift assays with the corresponding Ab. Although the anti-p65 NF-&#x003ba;B Ab had a super-shift effect on the complexes formed by the authentic NF-&#x003ba;B consensus oligonucleotide and the p65 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>C, lane 2), this anti-p65 Ab failed to have a super-shift effect on the PSD oligonucleotide&#x02013;p65 NF-&#x003ba;B complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>C, lane 4). Furthermore, in the presence of the Ab, the PSD oligonucleotide&#x02013;p65 NF-&#x003ba;B complex disappeared (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>C, lane 4). Similarly, in the presence of the anti-p50 NF-&#x003ba;B Ab, the p50 NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;PSD oligonucleotide complex disappeared (data not shown). The DNASIS program was utilized to analyze the sequence similarity between AP1 or NF-&#x003ba;B consensus oligonucleotides and the PSD sequence. Interestingly, the PSD oligonucleotide exhibited a slightly higher homology with the AP1 oligonucleotide than with the NF-&#x003ba;B consensus oligonucleotide, i.e. 52 versus 46%, in the total alignment window (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>D).

Since TNF-&#x003b1; can induce NF-&#x003ba;B activation in PC-3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c47">47</xref>), PC-3 cells were transiently transfected with p779 or p1356 and then grown in media containing different amounts of TNF-&#x003b1;. Cells were harvested to determine the level of CAT activity. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f6">6</xref>A, in PC-3 cells, a 48 h TNF-&#x003b1; treatment could stimulate the transcriptional activity of p1356 approximately 2-fold, while it failed to have the same effect for p779. This TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation resulted in an overall activity of p1356 20-fold higher than that of p779 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f6">6</xref>A). However, in HeLa cells TNF-&#x003b1; did not have an effect on the transcriptional activity of p1356 or p779 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f6">6</xref>B). Similar results were obtained when transiently transfected PC-3 cells were treated with IL-1, another NF-&#x003ba;B-activating cytokine (data not shown). These data collectively indicate that TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1, via NF-&#x003ba;B, up-regulate the level of PAcP promoter activity in PC-3 cells but not in HeLa cells, and that the <italic>cis</italic>-active enhancer region &#x02212;1356&#x0002f;&#x02212;779 is essential for this stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of NF-&#x003ba;B and I&#x003ba;B on the level of PAcP promoter activity</title><p>To determine whether NF-&#x003ba;B can directly regulate the level of PAcP promoter activity, the p1356 reporter plasmid and expression vectors encoding NF-&#x003ba;B p65 or p50 subunit proteins were transiently co-transfected into PC-3 cells. Overexpression of the p50 protein, an NF-&#x003ba;B subunit without the transcriptional activation domain, could not activate the PAcP promoter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f7">7</xref>A). Instead, higher dosages of p50 expression resulted in suppression of the PAcP promoter activity, similar to previous observations for the p50 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c48">48</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of the p65 subunit, which contains a transactivation domain, increased the level of p1356 PAcP promoter activity by over 2-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f7">7</xref>A), which is similar to the effect of TNF-&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f6">6</xref>A).

The role of NF-&#x003ba;B in activating the p1356 PAcP promoter activity was further determined using I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;AA, a mutant form of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, which can constitutively inactivate the NF-&#x003ba;B dimer that contains the p65 and&#x0002f;or c-Rel subunit. Expression of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;AA alone showed only up to an &#x0223c;20% inhibitory effect on the basal activity of the p1356 promoter construct, indicating the inhibition of endogenous NF-&#x003ba;B activity in PC-3 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f7">7</xref>B). Co-transfection of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;AA completely abolished the stimulating effect by 0.5 &#x003bc;g p65 NF-&#x003ba;B on p1356 promoter activity, following a dose-dependent response (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f7">7</xref>B).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f8">8</xref>A (left panel) shows that the 3&#x02032;-PSD oligonucleotide failed to interact with nuclear proteins, while the 5&#x02032;-PSD oligonucleotide showed a band of complex formation. The specificity of the interaction between the 5&#x02032;-PSD oligonucleotide and nuclear proteins was confirmed by the competition between excess amounts of unlabeled probe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f8">8</xref>, left panel). To confirm that the NF-&#x003ba;B protein can bind to the 5&#x02032; part of the PSD oligonucleotide, the 5&#x02032; probe was incubated with the p65 NF-&#x003ba;B protein.

The intensity of binding increased when the core sequence moved toward the 3&#x02032; end of the PSD oligonucleotide. A clear, pronounced band was seen with the oligonucleotide containing the AGGTGT core sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f8">8</xref>B, lane 5).

The substitution of A&#x02192;C at position &#x0002b;1 or T&#x02192;G at position &#x0002b;6 had only a marginal effect on the binding to p65 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f8">8</xref>C, lanes 2 and 7). When the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotides contained a single substitution at positions from &#x0002b;2 to &#x0002b;5, the band disappeared or the intensity was significantly reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f8">8</xref>C, lanes 3&#x02013;6).

Interestingly, TNF-&#x003b1; stimulated PAcP expression following a dose&#x02013;response fashion and a 50 ng&#x0002f;ml concentration could increase PAcP expression up to 3-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f9">9</xref>B), as observed in the promoter activity assay in PC-3 cells. Thus, NF-&#x003ba;B activation up-regulates endogenous PAcP expression in LNCaP cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative analysis of the novel NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site in prostate-enriched genes</title><p>We analyzed the presence of the AGGTGT motif in the promoter regions of several other genes that have high levels of expression in prostate cells, including PSA, Nkx-3.1, MIC-1 and DD3. Computer analyses of an &#x0223c;4 kb fragment of the 5&#x02032;-flanking promoter region upstream of the start codon revealed the presence of AGGTGT motifs within the promoter regions of the PSA, Nkx-3.1 and MIC-1 genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh677tb1">1</xref>). Although no AGGTGT motif was found inside 4 kb of the 5&#x02032;-flanking promoter region of the DD3 gene, there were four reminiscent motifs with T&#x02192;G substitution at position &#x0002b;6 that had no significant impact on NF-&#x003ba;B&#x0002f;AGGTG(T&#x0002f;G) interactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f8">8</xref>C, lane 7). Taken together, the data indicate that AGGTG(T&#x0002f;G) is a common motif in prostate-enriched genes, and it could potentially participate in the regulation by NF-&#x003ba;B of expression not only for PAcP but also for other prostate-enriched genes in a cell-specific manner.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This article describes our finding that the &#x02212;1356&#x0002f;&#x02212;779 region represents the unique positive regulatory domain in a 5 kb promoter DNA fragment (&#x02212;4893&#x0002f;&#x0002b;87) of the <italic>PAcP</italic> gene although there are at least four negative regulatory elements. This positive <italic>cis</italic>-element is also involved in regulating the prostate cell-specific expression of the <italic>PAcP</italic> gene. However, DNase I footprinting analyses on the &#x02212;1356&#x0002f;&#x02212;779 fragment do not reveal a discrete binding site for prostate nuclear proteins versus non-prostate nuclear proteins, although there are at least six potential regulatory domains in this fragment. A similar phenomenon is observed in the PAcP promoter region &#x02212;231&#x0002f;&#x0002b;50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c21">21</xref>). These results may suggest that other weak binding sites or unstable interactions of transcriptional factors with the PAcP promoter are responsible for mediating its prostate-specific expression. Alternatively, cofactors required for the prostate-specific activation of the PAcP promoter are not recruited through their direct interactions with promoter DNA, but rather through the cofactor&#x02013;cofactor interaction and&#x0002f;or histone modification. For example, the SWI&#x0002f;SNF complex is required for hormone-dependent activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c50">50</xref>). Recruitment of SWI&#x0002f;SNF is mediated through CBP&#x0002f;p300, which itself is recruited through the interaction with the SRC coactivator, which leads to chromatin remodeling with altered DNA topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c51">51</xref>). It is also possible that HNF&#x0002f;FKH proteins contribute to the prostate-specific regulation because in the region between &#x02212;1235 and &#x02212;1205 bp, there are four consensus-binding sites for HNF&#x0002f;FKH proteins. Forkhead gene proteins interact with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c53">53</xref>) and are involved in regulating gene expression in various developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c55">55</xref>), including genes with liver-specific function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c56">56</xref>) and in gut development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c58">58</xref>). Detailed analyses of transcriptional factors interacting with the PAcP promoter may require the utilization of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Additionally, it should be noted that there are minor differences in footprinting analyses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f2">2</xref>A and B) and EMSA assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f4">4</xref>A) between nuclear proteins from PC-3 and DU 145 cells. These differences are apparently due to the nature of the two cell lines, because prostate cancer cells are known to exhibit heterogeneity and these two cell lines were derived from different origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c17">17</xref>). Nevertheless, the two cell lines exhibit similar patterns of PAcP promoter activity in transient transfection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c25">25</xref>). Thus, the effects of these minor differences in regulating the PAcP promoter activity require further investigation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, sequence analyses using a MatInspector data bank search for the PAcP positive regulatory fragment from &#x02212;1356 to &#x02212;779 reveal that there is no potential binding site for ubiquitous transcription factors, except for the AP1 and CREB proteins. The AP1 protein includes c-<italic>fos</italic> and c-<italic>jun</italic> proto-oncogene products and can be induced by phorbol ester 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). It regulates a diverse range of cellular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c59">59</xref>) through its interaction with the TPA-responsive element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c61">61</xref>). Unexpectedly, the putative AP1 binding sequence in the <italic>cis</italic>-active region of the PAcP promoter does not interact with the AP1 protein in EMSA, nor can its consensus oligonucleotides compete with the PSD oligonucleotide in DNA&#x02013;protein complex formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f4">4</xref>). The results indicate that the AP1 protein does not directly bind to the PAcP promoter DNA. This notion is parallel to our observations that the effect of TPA on the PAcP mRNA level is a slow response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c62">62</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of c-Jun and c-Fos proteins inhibits androgen-stimulated PSA promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c64">64</xref>). Thus, different mechanisms are involved in regulating the expression of PAcP and PSA, two major prostate differentiation antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c62">62</xref>). Additionally, the putative CREB-binding site is not within the protein interaction domain in footprinting assays. Further analyses of the putative CREB-binding site are required to determine the involvement of the CREB protein in the regulation of PAcP promoter activity.</p><p>Based on the results from searching the transcription factors database, the enhancer element of the PAcP promoter between &#x02212;1356 and &#x02212;779 does not contain a sequence corresponding to the consensus NF-&#x003ba;B element (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f3">3</xref>). Interestingly, the consensus NF-&#x003ba;B oligonucleotide competes with the PSD&#x02013;protein complex formation in EMSA. Similarly, in the murine tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 gene, the AP1 factor binds to a sequence that exhibits no consensus with the AP1 response element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c66">66</xref>). Our data further show that the PSD oligonucleotide can directly interact with the NF-&#x003ba;B p50 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>B) and p65 proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>C), and overexpression of the p65 subunit activates the PAcP promoter activity. The inhibitory effect of p50 is similar to its effect on the PSA promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c67">67</xref>). In general, it is p65, not p50, that serves as the positive effector of NF-&#x003ba;B-activated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c69">69</xref>). Overexpression of a mutant I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>B) and treatment with an NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitory peptide (data not shown) effectively abolish p65 NF-&#x003ba;B-induced activation of PAcP promoter construct p1356. The data collectively indicate that NF-&#x003ba;B directly activates the PAcP promoter via a novel binding site specifically in prostate cancer cells. This mode of regulation is biologically significant because the activation of the PAcP promoter activity by NF-&#x003ba;B correlates with elevated expression of endogenous PAcP in LNCaP cells.</p><p>Interestingly, the PSD oligonucleotide could form multiple complexes with nuclear proteins (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>A), while it forms only one major band with the purified NF-&#x003ba;B protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>B and C). It seems that NF-&#x003ba;B is directly interacting with this DNA sequence in the PAcP promoter because NF-&#x003ba;B consensus oligonucleotides effectively compete with the formation of three major complexes. This direct interaction differs from observations in several other systems that NF-&#x003ba;B cooperates with other transcription factors and is not involved in direct DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c70">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c73">73</xref>). Furthermore, this PSD sequence containing the NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site is required for activating the PAcP promoter activity using TNF-&#x003b1; (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f9">9</xref>) and IL-1 (data not shown) through NF-&#x003ba;B activation in p1356-transfected PC-3 cells but not in HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f6">6</xref>). The data collectively indicate that NF-&#x003ba;B-induced PAcP expression exhibits a cell-type-specific manner. However, it should be noted that in the presence of the anti-p65 NF-&#x003ba;B Ab, the complex formation between PSD oligonucleotides and p65 protein disappeared (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f5">5</xref>C, lane 4), while the same Ab had a super-shift effect on the NF-&#x003ba;B consensus oligonucleotide and p65 protein (lane 2). Similarly, the anti-p50 Ab abolished the interaction between the p50 NF-&#x003ba;B protein and PSD probes (data not shown). We hypothesize that both Abs have high affinities to corresponding proteins and that after their binding, the corresponding subunit protein undergoes a conformational change, resulting in the loss of their interactions with PSD oligonucleotides, which apparently have low affinity interactions. Of course, there are alternative explanations, e.g. the Abs may recognize the domain that also interacts with PSD probes and thus blocks the interaction. Further experiments are required to identify the mechanism of this Ab effect.</p><p>Owing to the potential importance of PAcP expression in prostate cancer as well as the biological significance of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling in general, we examine further the interaction between the DNA sequence AGGTGT and the NF-&#x003ba;B protein. It is known that different NF-&#x003ba;B dimers can interact with vast sequence variations in the &#x003ba;B-binding site. Further analyses of various NF-&#x003ba;B crystal structures reveal that all &#x003ba;B sites consist of two half-sites in which p50 and p52 monomers bind to a 5 bp 5&#x02032;-GGGRN-3&#x02032; consensus, while p65 and c-Rel monomers do not require the first G:C base pair and bind to a 4 bp 5&#x02032;-GGAA-3&#x02032; consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c74">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c76">76</xref>). These half-sites are separated by a 1 bp spacer. For example, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f10">10</xref>, p65 NF-&#x003ba;B homodimers can bind to target sites with only one cognate half-site with the consensus sequence GGAA separated by an A&#x02013;T base pair with highly conservative G at position &#x0002b;2 and a conservative G&#x02013;C base-pair at position &#x02212;3 of the other half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c75">75</xref>). Significantly, the results of our EMSA analyses of the AGGTGT motif oligonucleotide reveal that the presence of G at positions &#x0002b;2 and &#x0002b;3 is indispensable for binding to the NF-&#x003ba;B p65 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f8">8</xref>C). Our observation is thus in agreement with the results of crystal structure analyses of the p65 NF-&#x003ba;B homodimer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c75">75</xref>). The conserved G&#x02013;C base pairs at positions &#x0002b;2 and &#x02212;3 that are present inside &#x003ba;B-like elements regulated by p65 and p50 are also present inside the PSD oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f10">10</xref>) in which GGTG is sufficient and essential for NF-&#x003ba;B-binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f8">8</xref>A). We therefore hypothesize that GGxxTxxCx is a consensus sequence that can be recognized by both p65 and p50 NF-&#x003ba;B homodimers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f10">10</xref>). Furthermore, the GGTG motif could have a higher binding preference for p65 than for p50 homodimers because it exhibits a slightly higher homology with the p65 consensus than the p50 consensus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f10">10</xref>). Interestingly, the nucleotide polymorphism within the NF-&#x003ba;B motif contributes to the binding affinity of NF-&#x003ba;B proteins toward the target sites, thus regulating different levels of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c77">77</xref>). This novel NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site may contribute to the differential regulation of gene expression by NF-&#x003ba;B and thus merits further study.</p><p>The presence of this new NF-&#x003ba;B-binding site in the positive regulatory region of the PAcP promoter allows the NF-&#x003ba;B signal pathway to further activate the p1356 PAcP promoter activity by &#x0003e;20-fold, higher than the basic p779 promoter activity in a cell-specific manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh677f6">6</xref>). It is imaginable that other factor(s), e.g. HNF&#x0002f;FKH, may also interact with this 577 bp fragment to provide additional up-regulations, adding up to an extremely high level of PAcP expression in normal, differentiated prostate epithelia. In addition, NF-&#x003ba;B activation of the p1356 PAcP promoter occurs in androgen-insensitive PC-3 cells in the absence of added androgens, indicating that NF-&#x003ba;B activates PAcP expression via an androgen-independent pathway. In contrast, the PSA promoter contains four low-affinity consensus NF-&#x003ba;B-binding sites. They are either adjacent to or overlapping with androgen-response elements, indicating that possible cooperative interactions between NF-&#x003ba;B and AR contribute to PSA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh677c67">67</xref>). In addition to these low-affinity NF-&#x003ba;B-binding sites, computer analyses reveal the existence of one AGGTGT motif in the PSA promoter (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh677tb1">1</xref>). Similarly, the promoters of the MIC-1 and Nkx-3.1 genes contain at least one AGGTGT motif. Interestingly, the promoter of the DD3 gene has at least four reminiscent sequences containing one non-essential base pair substitution at position &#x0002b;6, i.e. AGGTGG, although it lacks the AGGTGT motif. The presence of this novel NF-&#x003ba;B-binding motif inside the promoter of prostate-enriched genes may indicate the importance of NF-&#x003ba;B to transactivation of the respective promoters in a prostate cell-specific manner for a high level of expression. In summary, owing to the importance of PAcP expression in prostate cancer biology, further characterizations of its promoter will provide useful information for understanding the regulation of PAcP expression in prostate epithelia and may contribute to new insights into prostate cancer progression.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh677f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The effect of deletion in the 5&#x02032; region of the PAcP promoter on the CAT activity in human prostate cancer cells.
