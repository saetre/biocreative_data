However, the profile of aggregate structures that are present in the brains of HD patients or of HD mouse models and the relative contribution of specific aggregate structures to disease pathogenesis is unknown. We have used the Seprion ligand to develop a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based method for quantifying aggregated polyglutamine in tissues from HD mouse models. We used a combination of electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and sodium dodecyl sulphate&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS&#x02013;PAGE) to investigate the aggregate structures isolated by the ligand. We found that the oligomeric, proto-fibrillar and fibrillar aggregates extracted from the brains of R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 knock-in mice were remarkably similar. Using AFM, we determined that the nanometre globular oligomers isolated from the brains of both mouse models have dimensions identical to those generated from recombinant huntingtin exon 1 proteins. Finally, antibodies that detect exon 1 Htt epitopes differentially recognize the ligand-captured material on SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels. The Seprion-ligand ELISA provides an assay with good statistical power for use in preclinical pharmacodynamic therapeutic trials or to assess the effects of the genetic manipulation of potential therapeutic targets on aggregate load. This, together with the ability to identify a spectrum of aggregate species in HD mouse tissues, will contribute to our understanding of how these structures relate to the pathogenesis of HD and whether their formation can be manipulated for therapeutic benefit.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant late-onset neurodegenerative disorder with a mean age of onset of 40 years. Symptoms include psychiatric disturbances, motor disorders, cognitive decline and weight loss. Disease duration is 15&#x02013;20 years and there are no effective disease-modifying treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C1">1</xref>). The disease is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the <italic>HD</italic> gene that is translated into a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in the huntingtin (Htt) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C2">2</xref>). Neuropathologically, HD is characterized by a generalized brain atrophy as well as neuronal cell loss in the striatum, cortex and other brain regions. Intracellular polyQ-containing aggregates are deposited throughout the neuropil and as inclusions in neuronal nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C4">4</xref>).</p><p>PolyQ aggregates formed <italic>in vitro</italic> from recombinant protein comprise a range of oligomeric, proto-fibrillar and fibrillar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C7">7</xref>). However, it is not known whether these reflect the oligomeric polyQ structures that form <italic>in vivo</italic> in HD patients or in HD mouse models. Similarly, although the genetic and pharmacological manipulation of polyQ aggregates <italic>in vitro</italic> and in invertebrate disease models has suggested that either the prevention of aggregate formation or their partition into less toxic structures can have beneficial consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C12">12</xref>), the role that polyQ aggregates play in disease pathology remains unclear. The ability to monitor the effects of aggregate manipulation in HD mouse models would help to determine the relevance of experiments performed in simple model systems. To this end, it is essential that the aggregate load in mouse tissues can be quantified and that the aggregate species that form <italic>in vivo</italic> can be identified.</p><p>We utilized two HD mouse models that were generated by very different approaches. The R6/2 mouse is transgenic for a human exon 1 Htt protein which in our colony has approximately 200Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C13">13</xref>). These mice develop an early-onset phenotype with rapid disease progression and as a consequence can realistically be used as a therapeutic screening tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C14">14</xref>). In our R6/2 colony, nuclear inclusions can be readily detected by immunohistochemistry in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus by 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C16">16</xref>), RotaRod impairment is apparent by 6 weeks and end-stage disease occurs at 15 weeks. The <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 knock-in mouse is a more genetically precise model of the human disease, and carries approximately 150Q which has been inserted into the mouse <italic>Hd</italic> gene (<italic>Hdh</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C17">17</xref>). In our <italic>Hdh</italic><sup>Q150/Q150</sup> colony, nuclear inclusions were detected by immunohistochemistry in the striatum and hippocampus by 6 months and the cortex by 8 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C18">18</xref>), an impaired RotaRod performance was apparent by 18 months of age and end-stage disease occurs at around 22 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C18">18</xref>). The <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice develop a phenotype that is remarkably similar to that found in R6/2 except that onset is much delayed and the disease progresses much more slowly over a period of 22 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C19">19</xref>). At the level of light microscopy, a complex distribution of aggregates in the form of nuclear inclusions and cytoplasmic aggregates are widely distributed throughout the brains of both models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C18">18</xref>).</p><p>Quantification of the aggregate load in mouse tissues has primarily involved counting the number of striatal nuclear inclusions and measuring their diameter. However, this only samples a subset of the aggregate species in one small brain region and more quantitative approaches that are less work-intensive are desperately needed. We have previously used the filter retardation assay to detect aggregates in mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C20">20</xref>) but we have been unsuccessful in optimizing this as an <italic>in vivo</italic> screening tool owing to signal variability. However, even if these technical difficulties were overcome, this approach would still have the disadvantage of only measuring the presence of aggregates that are larger than the cellulose acetate membrane pore size and therefore retained on the membrane.</p><p>Here we describe the use of the Seprion ligand to establish an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based method that provides a rapid, highly sensitive assay with good statistical power to detect changes in aggregate load in the brains of mouse models of HD. We demonstrate that the ligand captures a remarkably similar range of oligomeric, proto-fibrillar and fibrillar aggregates from the brains of both the R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q50 mouse models and that these are comparable to those generated from recombinant proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) we show that the dimensions of nanometre globular aggregates from the R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 knock-in brains are identical to those generated by the aggregation of recombinant exon1 Htt proteins containing just 46 and 53 polyQs. Finally, antibodies that detect exon 1 Htt epitopes differentially recognize the ligand-captured material on sodium dodecyl sulphate&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS&#x02013;PAGE) gels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Seprion ligand ELISA provides a highly quantitative assay for measuring polyQ aggregate load in Huntington's disease mouse tissue</title><p>The Seprion ligand has previously been used to isolate and quantify aggregated forms of the prion protein, Prp<sup>Sc</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C22">22</xref>). It is a high molecular weight polymeric ligand that consists of repeating charged and hydrophobic chemical groups that interact with similar repeating groups that occur on aggregated proteins. The selectivity for aggregated proteins is based on the arrangement of large numbers of polar and hydrophobic regions in aggregated proteins which occur to a much lesser extent in a single unaggregated protein molecule.</p><p>We have used the Seprion ligand to develop an ELISA-based plate assay by which aggregated Htt is captured from tissue lysates and detected by immunoprobing with the S830 antibody that was raised against the N-terminal exon 1 Htt protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C23">23</xref>). We quantified the aggregate load in each of the five brain regions from female R6/2 mice at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks of age. The Seprion ligand extracted statistically significant levels of aggregates from the striatum and hippocampus at 2 weeks of age, the cerebral cortex and brain stem at 4 weeks and cerebellum at 6 weeks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP467F1">1</xref>A). Only signals corresponding to background levels were measured in wild-type (WT) samples, equivalent to those obtained with capture-buffer only controls. The ELISA readings have proved to be highly reproducible between experiments, e.g. there was no difference in the aggregate load measured in the cortex from four different series of 12-week-old R6/2 mice using different batches of ligand-coated plates over a period of 2 years (<italic>F</italic><sub>(3,21)</sub> = 2.121, <italic>P</italic> = 0.133). We have previously shown that nuclear inclusions form in a number of R6/2 peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C24">24</xref>). We applied the Seprion ELISA to quantify the corresponding aggregate levels and found that statistically significant amounts could be detected by 8 weeks in muscle and by 12 weeks in pancreas and liver (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP467F1">1</xref>B). Therefore, the Seprion ELISA might provide a highly sensitive method of quantifying the level of aggregated polyQ in tissues from mouse models of HD. This assay has great potential for use as an outcome measure either in preclinical efficacy trials to test the effect of potential therapeutic interventions or in mice with genetic modifications that might modulate HD-related mouse phenotypes. For example, for the purpose of a pharmacodynamic trial in which a compound has been administered to R6/2 mice from 4 to 8 weeks of age, power calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C25">25</xref>) indicate that as few as eight mice would be sufficient to give an 80% chance of detecting a 30&#x02013;50% reduction in aggregate load in brain regions (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP467F1">1</xref>C).</p><fig id="DDP467F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Seprion ligand quantification of aggregate load in tissues from HD mouse models.

We had assumed that this widespread distribution occurred because they express a small N-terminal fragment of mutant Htt. Therefore, we were surprised to find that at end-stage disease, polyQ aggregates in the form of nuclear inclusions and cytoplasmic aggregates are present in all brain regions of homozygous <italic>Hdh</italic><sup>Q150/Q150</sup> knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C18">18</xref>). Similarly, we have recently demonstrated that the distribution of polyQ aggregates throughout the peripheral tissues of 12&#x02013;14 week R6/2 mice and 22 month <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 knock-in mice is almost identical (H. Moffitt, G. McPhail, B. Woodman, C. Hobbs and G. Bates, manuscript in preparation) suggesting that HD pathology may not be restricted to the CNS in HD patients. Therefore, we applied the Seprion ELISA to measure the level of polyQ aggregation that had accumulated in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and brain stem from <italic>Hdh</italic><sup>Q150/Q150</sup> mice aged 6, 10, 18 and 22 months (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP467F1">1</xref>D). The striata and cerebella from this series of tissues had been used for RNA analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C18">18</xref>). As with the R6/2 mice, statistically significant levels were present in the hippocampus (6 months) before the cortex and brain stem (10 months). These ages correspond to those at which inclusions are apparent in the brain by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C18">18</xref>). In the periphery, statistically significant levels of aggregates could be detected in muscle and liver at 22 months (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP467F1">1</xref>E). The microplate readings were lower for the <italic>Hdh</italic><sup>Q150/Q150</sup> tissues than for the R6/2 tissues. However, the difference in these values does not necessary reflect differences in the levels of aggregates that have accumulated in the tissues of the two models. The S830 antibody has a different affinity to the mutated versions of human Htt (in the R6/2 mouse) and mouse Htt (in the <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 knock-in mice).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Immuno-EM reveals diverse oligomeric and fibrillar Htt species in brain tissue from Huntington's disease mouse models</title><p>We employed immuno-electron microscopy (EM) to investigate the morphology of the ligand-isolated aggregated Htt species.

In the case of the <italic>Hdh</italic><sup>Q150/Q150</sup> knock-in mice, fibrils were prominent at 22 months and were isolated from the cortex of mice as young as 2 months (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP467F2">2</xref>B).

In tissue lysates, all four antibodies detected the soluble R6/2 transprotein monomer that became less intense with age because of its sequestration into polyQ aggregates. The migration of the transprotein varied between lysates because the CAG repeat is unstable on transmission and therefore the polyQ repeat length differed between mice. Although an exon 1 Htt protein that carries a polyQ repeat of approximately 200Q is approximately 30 kDa in size, its migration by SDS&#x02013;PAGE was retarded to approximately 80 kDa by the polyQ tract.

In contrast, MW1 and 3B5H10 detected fragments in the bead-captured material that resolved at a similar size to the soluble transprotein, but that were not detected by either S830 or MW8 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP467F6">6</xref>C&#x02013;G). In material captured from the same lysates, MW1 and 3B5H10 produced comparable signals on western blots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP467F6">6</xref>C&#x02013;E). The signals obtained with MW1 were always prominent in lysates from 4-week-old mice (&#x0003e;15 separate experiments). However, the ligand captured Htt species that resolve as a soluble monomer were not only seen at younger ages and were also captured from lysates of 6, 8 or 12 week R6/2 mice as detected by 3B5H10 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP467F6">6</xref>F). These fragments were never detected with S830 or MW8. The consistency of the MW1 results make it unlikely that an interaction between soluble exon 1 Htt and the ligand is causing the exon 1 protein to adopt a structure (retained upon SDS&#x02013;PAGE), as if that were the case, there would be no reason to expect their detection to be disease-stage specific. Instead, the Seprion ligand has extracted either aggregated Htt species or misfolded monomers, which upon SDS&#x02013;PAGE exhibited a comparable migration to that of the soluble monomer but are differentially recognized by antibodies that detect the exon 1 Htt protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have shown that the Seprion ligand can be used to isolate and characterize aggregated Htt species that form in mouse models of HD. Using EM and AFM we have demonstrated that the brains of both the R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 knock-in mouse models contain a diverse and comparable range of Htt aggregate structures. The oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates that were captured by the Seprion ligand were remarkably similar to those that have previously been generated through the aggregation of exon 1 Htt proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C34">34</xref>). This similarity was particularly striking in the case of our AFM analysis where the dimensions of the nanometre globular oligomers isolated from the R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic><sup>Q150/Q150</sup> brains were practically identical to those generated from recombinant exon 1 Htt <italic>in vitro</italic>. This finding was unexpected given that <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 knock-in mice express full-length mouse Htt with approximately 150Q, R6/2 mice express a human exon 1 Htt transgene with approximately 200Q and the recombinant proteins were human exon 1 Htt with 46Q and 53Q. However, this observation is in keeping with our recent demonstration that the smallest N-terminal fragment generated from full-length Htt in the <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 knock-in mice is an exon 1 Htt protein (C. Landles, K. Sathasivam, A. Weiss, B. Woodman, H. Moffitt, S. Finkbeiner, B. Sun, J. Gafni, L. Ellerby, Y. Trottier, W. Richards, A. Osmand, P. Paganetti and G. Bates, manuscript in preparation), and demonstrates that the wide variation in polyQ length carried by these exon 1 proteins does not have a detectable impact on the dimensions of the globular oligomers.</p><p>We extracted a diverse spectrum of oligomeric and fibrillar structures from the brains of both the R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mouse models. In the case of R6/2, we analysed brain tissue from mice aged 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks of age, spanning the course of disease from a presymptomatic state to pronounced symptomatology. The entire spectrum of aggregate species was extracted from the brain tissue at each of these ages. However, the amount of fibrillar material increased considerably with disease progression to the extent that the EM grids were covered in fibrils from R6/2 mice at 12 weeks and <italic>Hdh</italic><sup>Q150/Q150</sup> mice at 22 months. At late-stage disease the high density of fibrillar aggregates most likely masked the presence of oligomeric and proto-fibrillar structures making it difficult to assess their relative contributions. Our analysis of <italic>Hdh</italic><sup>Q150/Q150</sup> mice focussed on very early time-points (2, 3 and 4 months), all of which precede overt symptomatology by several months, as we were interested in determining how early aggregated structures can be identified in these mice. Surprisingly, we were able to extract aggregate structures from <italic>Hdh</italic><sup>Q150/Q150</sup> brains as early as 2 months of age.</p><p>Fibrillar aggregates have previously been imaged in tissue sections from HD post-mortem brains and HD mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C35">35</xref>) by EM, and therefore, we can be confident that the fibrillar structures that we have extracted from tissue sections exist <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, without being able to image mutant Htt oligomers and proto-fibrils in tissue sections, we cannot be certain that the aggregates isolated by the Seprion ligand have the same structure as those that form <italic>in vivo</italic>. To address this, we propose that the complexity of the aggregate structures that have been isolated, and the consistent variability in their relative proportions at different stages of disease, make it extremely unlikely that they have been generated through an interaction between the ligand and the soluble mutant Htt protein. In addition, as well as being very comparable to those that have been generated <italic>in vitro</italic> from exon 1 mutant Htt constructs they are also remarkably similar to those formed by other amyloidogenic proteins that have been studied in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C39">39</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we used a panel of antibodies that recognize epitopes within the exon 1 Htt protein: MW8, MW1, 3B5H10 and S830. In all cases, these antibodies recognize a subset of exon 1 Htt structures. S830 is our in-house sheep polyclonal antibody that was raised against an exon 1 Htt recombinant protein with 53Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C23">23</xref>). We routinely use this antibody for western blots, on which it detects an exon 1 Htt monomer and the detergent-insoluble aggregated Htt that is retained in the stacking gel. We also use S830 for the detection of intranuclear inclusions and cytoplasmic aggregates by immunohistochemistry. MW8 also detects both the soluble exon 1 Htt monomer and detergent-insoluble aggregated forms on western blots. It is raised against an epitope at the C-terminus of exon 1 Htt and we have recently shown that although MW8 can be used to immunoprecipitate full-length Htt and all N-terminal proteolytic fragments thereof, if used to probe western blots, it behaves as a C-terminal exon 1 Htt neo-epitope antibody. On western blot, it only detects an exon 1 Htt protein and does not detect the C-terminus of exon 1 if it is embedded in a larger fragment of Htt (C. Landles, K. Sathasivam, A. Weiss, B. Woodman, H. Moffitt, S. Finkbeiner, B. Sun, J. Gafni, L. Ellerby, Y. Trottier, W. Richards, A. Osmand, P. Paganetti and G. Bates, manuscript in preparation). This suggests that MW8 is sensitive to the conformation of this epitope. In this study, MW8 detected monomeric Htt and detergent-insoluble aggregates on western blots as would be predicted. When immuno-gold labelled and used for EM, MW8 detected the fibrillar but, surprisingly, not oligomeric Htt that had been extracted from R6/2 brains. It would be surprising if the epitope had been cleaved or processed in oligomers, but not in fibrils and therefore the failure to detect oligomeric structures is more likely owing to the fact that the epitope has become inaccessible to MW8 or has adopted a conformation not recognized by MW8.</p><p>The monoclonal antibodies MW1 and 3B5H10 both recognize an expanded polyQ tract. It is known that the MW1 epitope is rapidly lost upon aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C10">10</xref>) and MW1 has been proposed to bind polyQ in a linear lattice model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C40">40</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that MW1 and 3B5H10 did not recognize the detergent-insoluble aggregated material that is retained in the stacking gel on western blots and failed to detect fibrillar structures by immuno-EM. We performed SDS&#x02013;PAGE and western blot analysis to examine the detergent solubility of the Seprion ligand material that had been captured from R6/2 mouse brains at different stages of disease. We had expected that the captured material would be retained in the stacking gel as was observed by immunoprobing with S830 and MW8. Unexpectedly, MW1 and 3B5H10 identified exon 1 Htt fragments with a comparable migration to the soluble monomer which were predominantly detected in lysates of brain tissue from R6/2 mice at 4 weeks of age. Both antibodies recognize the polyQ tract. A crystal structure of MW1 bound to polyQ showed that polyQ can adopt an extended coil-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C41">41</xref>) and an independent study demonstrates that 3B5H10 binds to a compact &#x003b2;-sheet-like structure of polyQ in a monomeric Htt fragment (M. Arrasate, J. Miller, E. Brooks, C. Peters-Libeu, J. Legleiter, D. Hatters, J, Curtis, K. Cheung, P. Krtishnan, S. Mitra, K. Widjaja, B. Shaby, Y. Newhouse, G. Lotz, V. Thulasiramin, F. Saudou, P. Muchowski, M. Segal, K. Weisgraber and S. Finkbeiner, manuscript in preparation). The Seprion ligand appears to extract structures from R6/2 brains that are detergent-soluble and are recognized by MW1 and 3B5H10 when fractionated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. It is not clear why these fragments are not detected by S830 and MW8, especially by S830, which gives very strong signals on western blots of brain lysates.</p><p>We have developed a highly quantitative ELISA-based assay for measuring the aggregate load in tissues from mouse models of HD with good statistical power. This has provided us with a rapid and sensitive pharmacodynamic read-out for the preclinical assessment of therapeutic approaches predicted to modify Htt aggregation. This assay can also be used to determine whether specific genetic manipulations can modify Htt aggregation and other mouse HD-related phenotypes, thereby facilitating a preclinical validation of potential therapeutic targets. This can be complemented with agarose gel electrophoresis for resolving aggregates (AGERA), an agarose gel-based method that has the potential to detect overall changes in aggregate size distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP467C42">42</xref>).
