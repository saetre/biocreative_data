Binding of Fkh2p requires prior binding by Mcm1p. Here we have investigated the molecular determinants governing the formation of the Mcm1p&#x02013; Fkh2p complex. Fkh2p exhibits cooperativity in complex formation with Mcm1p and we have mapped a small region of Fkh2p located immediately upstream of the FKH DNA binding domain that is required for this cooperativity. This region is lacking in the related protein Fkh1p that cannot form ternary complexes with Mcm1p. A second region is identified that inhibits Mcm1p-independent DNA binding by Fkh2p. The spacing between the Mcm1p and Fkh2p binding sites is also a critical determinant for complex formation. We also show that Fkh2p can form ternary complexes with the human counterpart of Mcm1p, serum response factor (SRF). Mutations at analogous positions in Mcm1p, which are known to affect SRF interaction with its partner protein Elk-1, abrogate complex formation with Fkh2p, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of coregulatory protein binding surfaces. Our data therefore provide molecular insights into the mechanisms of Mcm1p&#x02013; Fkh2p complex formation and more generally aid our understanding of MADS-box protein function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The transcription factor Mcm1p regulates several diverse processes including mating type determination, arginine metabolism and cell-cycle control in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c2">2</xref>). In each case, Mcm1p recruits distinct coregulatory proteins to promoters to enable specific responses to be elicited. During the cell cycle, Mcm1p controls the expression of early cell-cycle box-regulated genes at the M&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> phase boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c3">3</xref>) and the expression of the <italic>CLB2</italic> cluster in the G<sub>2</sub> and M phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c4">4</xref>), where it functions in a complex with the forkhead (FKH) transcription factor, Fkh2p (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c5">5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c9">9</xref>). Fkh2p cooperatively binds with Mcm1p to form swi five factor (SFF) complexes on the promoters of genes in the <italic>CLB2</italic> cluster including <italic>SWI5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c10">10</xref>). In contrast, the related transcription factor Fkh1p does not appear to form part of the SFF complex that forms on the <italic>SWI5</italic> promoter or exhibit binding cooperativity with Mcm1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c10">10</xref>), suggesting a specific role for Fkh2p in regulating gene expression through these complexes. The Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complex activates transcription in the G<sub>2</sub> and M phases of the cell cycle in conjunction with the coactivator Ndd1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c6">6</xref>) and, along with Fkh1p, appears to play a repressive role on target genes during the rest of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c8">8</xref>).</p><p>The Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complex exhibits several similarities with the mammalian Elk-1&#x02013;serum response factor (SRF) complex. The Elk-1&#x02013;SRF complex is also thought to play a role in cell-cycle control but acts to regulate cell-cycle entry in response to mitogenic signalling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c12">12</xref>). Together with SAP-1 and SAP-2, Elk-1 constitutes part of the ternary complex factor (TCF) subfamily of ETS-domain proteins. Like FKH transcription factors, ETS-domain proteins contain a winged helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix DNA binding domain. SRF and Mcm1p are both members of the MADS-box family of transcription factors and their core DNA binding domains are 70&#x00025; identical (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c2">2</xref>). This similarity is emphasised by their related DNA binding specificities and the abilities of Mcm1p and SRF to interact with several of their respective binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c15">15</xref>). In addition to protein&#x02013; DNA contacts, protein&#x02013;protein interactions are essential for the formation of the Elk-1&#x02013;SRF complex. Structural and mutagenic studies on the related Elk-1&#x02013;SRF and SAP-1&#x02013;SRF complexes have identified the reciprocal interaction surfaces in these transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c18">18</xref>). A key feature of this interaction is the insertion of an aromatic residue in the TCF component into a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of SRF. The analogous pocket on the surface of Mcm1p is used to bind to the coregulatory protein MAT&#x003b1;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c19">19</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have investigated the molecular determinants required for the formation of the Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complex. We show that the spacing of the Fkh2p and Mcm1p binding sites is important for permitting complex function. Moreover, Fkh2p contains an autoinhibitory domain that stops autonomous DNA binding in the absence of Mcm1p and a second motif that is required for cooperative DNA binding with Mcm1p. Upon disruption of the reciprocal binding pocket on Mcm1p, Fkh2p binding is abrogated. Mcm1p is essential for viability and versions containing mutations of the Fkh2p binding pocket cannot rescue a deletion of the <italic>MCM1</italic> gene. Similarly, a mutation in the Mcm1p binding motif of Fkh2p affects Fkh2p activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. The molecular determinants of Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complex formation therefore show several parallels with the Elk-1&#x02013;SRF complex although important differences also exist.</p></sec><sec><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructions and mutagenesis</title><p>The pBluescript-KS<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-derived plasmids, pAS1 (encoding core<sup>SRF</sup>; amino acids 132&#x02013;222), pAS37 (encoding METcore<sup>SRF</sup>; amino acids 142&#x02013;222) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c20">20</xref>), and pAS704 (encoding core<sup>Mcm1</sup>; amino acids 1&#x02013;98) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c21">21</xref>) and pAS798 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c22">22</xref>) have been described previously.</p><p>The following plasmids were created for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription&#x0002f;translation.

Ternary complex formation was still observed upon deletion of the C-terminus (amino acids 458&#x02013;862) of Fkh2p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f2">2</xref>B, lane 3), and was retained upon further N&#x02010;terminal deletion to amino acid 292 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f2">2</xref>B, lane 7). However, ternary complex formation was lost upon further N&#x02010;terminal truncation to amino acid 325 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f2">2</xref>B, lane 8). Unexpectedly, the formation of stable ternary complexes was lost in the Fkh2(180&#x02013;458) and Fkh2(216&#x02013;458) constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f2">2</xref>B, lanes 4 and 5) although the band smearing in these lanes is indicative of complex breakdown during electrophoresis (see Discussion). We did not expect the Fkh2p truncations to bind to the <italic>SWI5</italic> site in the absence of Mcm1p and indeed this was the case upon N&#x02010;terminal deletion to amino acid 254 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f2">2</xref>B, lanes 9&#x02013;14). However, upon N&#x02010;terminal truncation to amino acid 292, autonomous DNA binding by Fkh2p was revealed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f2">2</xref>B, lane 15). Thus, sequences located between amino acids 254 and 292 act to inhibit autonomous DNA binding by Fkh2p.</p><p>Previously we proposed that the Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complex might be functionally analogous to the human Elk-1&#x02013;SRF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c8">8</xref>). The Mcm1p and SRF core DNA binding domains exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity and related DNA binding specificities (70&#x00025; identity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c15">15</xref>), hence we next tested whether core<sup>SRF</sup> (amino acids 132&#x02013;222) could interact with Fkh2p on the <italic>SWI5</italic> site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f2">2</xref>C). As observed with Mcm1p, ternary complex formation with SRF was identifiable upon C- and N&#x02010;terminal deletion of Fkh2p to amino acids 292&#x02013;458. However, unlike Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p ternary complexes, ternary complexes between either Fkh2(216&#x02013;458) or Fkh2(254&#x02013;458) and SRF did not undergo dissociation during electrophoresis, suggesting a more stable interaction. However, the binding of longer Fkh2 derivatives was reduced compared with Fkh2(254&#x02013;458), suggesting a possible role for additional inhibitory regions in this context.</p><p>To further delineate the minimal part of Fkh2p that could form ternary complexes with Mcm1p, an additional series of N&#x02010;terminal truncations was made (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>A). In this series of experiments, Mcm1(1&#x02013;96) was used. DNA binding by the Fkh2p derivatives was similar in the absence of Mcm1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;4). However, ternary complex formation was reduced upon truncation beyond amino acid 312 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>B, lanes 5&#x02013;8). To further investigate this cooperativity, DNA binding was tested using titrations of Fkh2(312&#x02013;458) and Fkh2(325&#x02013;458) and DNA binding tested in the presence or absence of Mcm1p. Cooperativity in ternary complex formation was observed using Fkh2(312&#x02013;458) but greatly reduced upon N&#x02010;terminal truncation to amino acid 325 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>C and D). Thus these data demonstrate that sequences located between amino acids 312 and 325 are essential for cooperative ternary complex formation with Mcm1p.</p><p>To identify important residues within this region, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>E and F). We specifically targeted aromatic residues in this region as these had previously been shown to be important for the binding of coregulatory proteins to other MADS-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c19">19</xref>). Indeed alignment of amino acids 213&#x02013;333 from Fkh2p with the B-box SRF binding region of Elk-1 shows a potential conservation of several such residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>E). Mutation of amino acid Y315 in Fkh2p had little effect on its Mcm1p-independent DNA binding capacity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>F, lane 2), but abolished cooperative binding with Mcm1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>F, lane 5). In contrast, mutation of either Y321 or F324 had little effect on ternary complex formation with Mcm1p (data not shown).</p><p>Collectively, our truncation studies have identified Mcm1(1&#x02013;96) and Fkh2(312&#x02013;458) as minimal determinants for the cooperative formation of Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p ternary DNA-bound complexes. Y325 has been shown to be a key amino acid in Fkh2 that is required for the formation of these complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Cooperative ternary complex formation is not observed with Fkh1p</title><p>Previously we demonstrated that Fkh1p does not constitute a major part of the ternary complex that forms on the <italic>SWI5</italic> promoter in yeast cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c8">8</xref>). However, the regions encompassing the FKH DNA binding domains of Fkh1p and Fkh2p are very similar in sequence (72&#x00025; identity through amino acids 329&#x02013;454 of Fkh2p). However, this sequence similarity diverges in the region immediately upstream from the FKH domain that we have shown to be important for the formation of Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>A). We therefore compared analogously truncated Fkh1p and Fkh2p proteins for their ability to form ternary complexes with Mcm1p on the <italic>SWI5</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f4">4</xref>).</p><p>Fkh2(254&#x02013;458) efficiently formed ternary complexes with Mcm1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f4">4</xref>B, lane 7) but the analogous Fkh1p construct, Fkh1(227&#x02013;421) was unable to efficiently form ternary complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f4">4</xref>B, lane 5). The FKH domains of both proteins bind autonomously to the SWI5 site, albeit at a lower efficiency with Fkh1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f4">4</xref>B, lanes 2 and 4). Thus, Fkh1p exhibits a lower intrinsic binding propensity for the <italic>SWI5</italic> promoter and moreover, unlike Fkh2p, is unable to cooperatively form ternary complexes with Mcm1p.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding site spacing requirements for the formation of Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complexes</title><p>The DNA binding sites in the Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complex are closely juxtaposed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f5">5</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c8">8</xref>). Furthermore, our mapping data have identified a motif that is required for cooperative interactions with Mcm1p that is located close to the Fkh2p DNA binding domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>). This motif is likely to represent the Mcm1p interacting region of Fkh2p. In the SRF&#x02013;Elk-1 complex, the spacing between the DNA binding sites can be highly variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c32">32</xref>). We therefore tested the spacing requirements of the Fkh2p and Mcm1p binding sites, which permit efficient complex formation. A series of binding sites was created in which nucleotides were either added or removed from the spacer region located between the core Fkh2p and Mcm1p binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f5">5</xref>A).</p><p>The insertion of 2 or 5 bp between Fkh2p and Mcm1p binding sites led to a large decrease in ternary complex formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f5">5</xref>B, lanes 2 and 3). However, the addition of 10 bp (corresponding to one helical turn) restored ternary complex formation, albeit to a reduced level in comparison to the wild-type spacing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f5">5</xref>B, lane 1). The deletion of either 1 or 3 bp between the two binding sites also caused a large decrease in the efficiency of Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complex formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f5">5</xref>B, lanes 5 and 6). To ensure that the changes we had introduced did not affect protein&#x02013;DNA interactions mediated by the FKH domain of Fkh2p, we tested the ability of Fkh2(325&#x02013;458) to bind to each of the sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f5">5</xref>C). Binding of Fkh2(325&#x02013;458) to all the sites was readily detectable, in contrast to the large decreases observed in the context of ternary complexes. We also tested the requirement for binding site orientation by inverting the asymmetric Fkh2p binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f5">5</xref>D). Inversion of the binding site resulted in abrogation of complex formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f5">5</xref>E, lane 4) but still allowed autonomous binding of the Fkh2p FKH DNA binding domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f5">5</xref>F, lanes 1 and 2).</p><p>Collectively these data demonstrate the critical importance of binding site spacing and orientation for the efficient formation of DNA-bound Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p ternary complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of Fkh2p interaction determinants on Mcm1p</title><p>The observation that Fkh2p can form ternary complexes with both Mcm1p and its mammalian counterpart SRF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f2">2</xref>B and C) indicates that the binding surface on Mcm1p and SRF is likely to be conserved. To explore this further, a series of mutant SRF derivatives was examined for binding ability to Fkh2p on the <italic>SWI5</italic> promoter. One of these mutants, V194E, abolished ternary complex formation (data not shown). Previously, this mutation was shown to also abolish Elk-1 binding to SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c18">18</xref>). Predictions from structural studies suggest that this mutation would block the insertion of aromatic residues into a binding pocket on the surface of Mcm1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c16">16</xref>). Indeed, we have identified Y315 as a residue that has a critical role in mediating ternary complex formation between Fkh2p and Mcm1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>F). To establish whether the equivalent residue in Mcm1p was also important for Fkh2p interactions, a Mcm1(1&#x02013;98) mutant protein was constructed containing the V69E mutation. In addition, several additional mutants were obtained at T71 (T71A, T71E), which are known to be important for SRF interactions with its coregulatory partner, Elk-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f6">6</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c18">18</xref>). The T82E mutant Mcm1p protein was used as a negative control that is predicted not to effect ternary complex formation based on the SRF&#x02013;Elk-1 paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c18">18</xref>). The locations of these residues on the surface of Mcm1p are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f6">6</xref>B.</p><p>Ternary complex formation between Mcm1(1&#x02013;98)(V69E) and full-length Fkh2p was virtually abolished (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f6">6</xref>C, lane 7). In contrast, the introduction of the T71E mutation only had a moderate effect on ternary complex formation, while T71A actually exhibited enhanced binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f6">6</xref>C, lanes 8 and 9; see Discussion). The T82E mutation did not affect ternary complex formation as predicted. Similar results were obtained in the presence of the truncated Fkh2(254&#x02013;458) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f6">6</xref>D), demonstrating the importance of this region of Mcm1p in binding to the interaction surface we have mapped in Fkh2p.</p><p>To examine whether the abrogation of ternary complex formation between Mcm1(1&#x02013;98)(V69E) and Fkh2p was due to disruption of protein&#x02013;protein interactions, we carried out GST pulldown assays with GST&#x02013;Fkh2(254&#x02013;458) and wild-type and mutant Mcm1p derivatives (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f6">6</xref>E). The L68E mutant version of Mcm1p was previously shown to disrupt DNA bending and hence Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complex formation but does not disrupt protein&#x02013;protein interactions with Fkh2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c33">33</xref>). In comparison to wild-type and L68E mutant versions, the V69E mutant exhibited much reduced binding to Fkh2p, demonstrating that this mutation directly affects protein&#x02013; protein interactions between these two transcription factors.</p><p>Together, these results identify the pocket surrounding V69 in Mcm1p (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f6">6</xref>B) as a critical component of the Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p interface. This same pocket is also important for SRF&#x02013;Fkh2p and SRF&#x02013;Elk-1 interactions, demonstrating an evolutionary conservation of this pocket for driving cooperative ternary complex formation.</p></sec><sec><title>The effect of ternary complex disrupting mutations <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>We have identified mutations in both Mcm1p (V69E) and Fkh2p (Y315E) that disrupt ternary complex formation.

Indeed, we were able to rescue the lethality of an <italic>mcm1</italic>&#x00394; mutant with a plasmid encoding Mcm1(1&#x02013;98) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f7">7</xref>A). However, in contrast, a plasmid encoding Mcm1(1&#x02013;98)(V69E) was unable to support growth of the <italic>mcm1</italic>&#x00394; mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f7">7</xref>A).</p><p>Previously, it has been shown that the lethality associated with a deletion of the <italic>NDD1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c35">35</xref>) can be rescued by deletion of the <italic>FKH2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c6">6</xref>). Hence, to examine the function of mutations of Fkh2p we constructed a <italic>fkh2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ndd1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant strain (AP183) and co-transformed this strain with pMW20-NDD1, a <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid expressing the wild type <italic>NDD1</italic> gene, and either vector (pGBKT7) or a plasmid expressing amino acids 1&#x02013;458 of Fkh2p &#x0005b;pGBKT7 Fkh2(1&#x02013;458)&#x0005d;. Transformants were then plated onto 5-FOA medium to kill cells that were unable to lose the <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid pMW20-NDD1. As expected cells co-transformed with pKT7 were able to lose pMW20-NDD1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f7">7</xref>B). In contrast, cells co-transformed with pGBKT7 Fkh2(1&#x02013;458) were unable to grow on 5-FOA medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f7">7</xref>B) suggesting that the inviability of <italic>ndd1</italic>&#x00394; cells cannot be reversed by removing the C-terminal region of Fkh2p (amino acids 459&#x02013;862). The N&#x02010;terminal region (amino acids 1&#x02013;458) of Fkh2p contains the FKH DNA binding domain and also contains the region of Fkh2p required for ternary complex formation with Mcm1p.

In contrast to wild-type protein, the Y315E substitution reversed the lethality associated with the Fkh2(1&#x02013;458) construct in this background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f7">7</xref>B). The Y315E substitution blocks interactions with Mcm1p <italic>in vitro</italic> suggesting that the inviability of <italic>ndd1</italic>&#x00394; cells is linked to the inability of Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p ternary complexes to activate transcription of the <italic>CLB2</italic> gene cluster in the absence of Ndd1p.

Here we provide molecular details of how this complex forms. Importantly, we identify regions and critical residues in Mcm1p and Fkh2p required for cooperative binding of Fkh2p to Mcm1p-occupied sites and demonstrate the importance of optimal DNA binding site spacing for complex formation to occur. The validity of these conclusions is supported by the demonstration that mutations of the regions identified as important for the formation of Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complexes disrupt the activities of these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f7">7</xref>).</p><p>The mammalian TCF&#x02013;SRF complex represents a paradigm for understanding the basis for cooperative transcription factor complex formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c12">12</xref>). In this complex, a short region of the TCFs, the B-box, is presented on a flexible tether and binds to a surface exposed groove on the surface of SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c18">18</xref>). These protein&#x02013;protein interactions are essential for the recruitment of the TCF component into this complex. Due to the presence of the flexible tether, the spacing between the SRF and the TCF DNA binding sites can vary by over one helical turn with no discernable effect on ternary complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c32">32</xref>). The Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complex shows many similarities with this complex. The sequences and structures of the MADS-box DNA binding domains of Mcm1p and SRF are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c36">36</xref>). Similarly, both the TCFs and Fkh2p contain a winged helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix DNA-binding domain. Furthermore, both the TCF and Fkh2p binding sites are asymmetric. Here we demonstrate that Mcm1p and SRF use the same binding pocket on their surfaces to interact with Fkh2p and TCF, respectively (defined by the V69E mutation) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f6">6</xref>). The importance of this mutation is further underscored by the inability to rescue <italic>mcm1</italic> deleted strains with Mcm1(1&#x02013;98)(V69E), although this lethality probably reflects a loss of interaction with other coregulatory partners in addition to Fkh2p. Sequences located outside the DNA binding domain are required on both TCFs and Fkh2p to promote cooperativity in complex formation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f4">4</xref>). How ever, the Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complex differs in several key respects. Unlike in the TCFs, a long flexible linker does not exist in Fkh2p and the motif required for Mcm1p binding is closely juxtaposed to its DNA binding domain. This suggests that the DNA binding sites must be closely positioned. Indeed, this view is supported by our observation that alteration of the distance between the Mcm1p and Fkh2p binding sites in the <italic>SWI5</italic> promoter strongly reduces recruitment of Fkh2p by Mcm1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f5">5</xref>). In agreement with these data, inspection of the potential binding sites for Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p complexes in the promoters of genes that are known to be regulated by this complex, in conjunction with Ndd1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c37">37</xref>), shows little variability of this spacing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f8">8</xref>). Interestingly, some binding is regained upon addition of a full helical turn between the DNA binding sites. This suggests that contacts might be regained through bending of the intervening DNA when the proteins are located on the same side of the helix. Mcm1p is known to induce significant DNA bending and this might facilitate complex formation between Mcm1p and Fkh2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c38">38</xref>). Indeed, mutant Mcm1p proteins that are compromised in their DNA bending abilities exhibit reduced recruitment of Fkh2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c33">33</xref>).</p><p>The sequence of the region in Fkh2p that is required for cooperative binding of Fkh2p to Mcm1p shares some similarity with the B-box motif of the Elk-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f3">3</xref>F). In particular, the three critical aromatic residues in Elk-1 are conserved. The first two of these show identical spacing and encompass a conserved serine residue (Ser318 in Fkh2p) that also plays an important role in Elk-1 interactions with SRF. Apart from these amino acids, no other residues were identified as critical for complex formation between Elk-1 and SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c17">17</xref>). Of the amino acids tested, only Y315 appears critical in Fkh2p, suggesting a difference in how the interactions mediated by Fkh2p and Elk-1 take place. Presumably, in Fkh2p, other interactions compensate for the lack of effect seen by mutation of other positions, possibly due to direct contacts between the MADS-box and the FKH domains themselves due to their close juxtapositioning. By extrapolating from the SRF&#x02013;SAP-1 structure, the most likely role of Y315 is in making contacts with Mcm1p but also in determining and stabilising the trajectory of the Fkh2p motif across the surface of Mcm1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c16">16</xref>). In contrast, the increased binding of Fkh2p observed with the T71A mutant of Mcm1p is reminiscent of the binding of Fli-1 to the analogous SRF mutant (T196A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c18">18</xref>), suggesting that the interaction surface on Mcm1p used by Fkh2p retains characteristics from both TCF&#x02013; and Fli-1&#x02013;SRF interactions. Thus while Fkh2p uses the binding surface on Mcm1p that is analogous to that used by TCF and Fli-1 to bind to SRF, the exact interactions are likely to differ. Structural studies are required to define this interface more precisely.</p><p>Our DNA binding studies also uncovered additional regulatory activities acting on Fkh2p. In particular, deletion analysis identified an autoinhibitory domain that prevents the binding of Fkh2p to DNA in the absence of Mcm1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f2">2</xref>). Similar domains are found in many transcription factors (including mammalian TCFs) that act to block spurious DNA binding in the absence of coregulatory partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c39">39</xref>). In addition, our data revealed that deletion of the first 180 amino acids of Fkh2p destabilises Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p ternary complexes until further deletions of residues 180&#x02013;254 are made. This is not observed in complexes of Fkh2p with SRF, indicating that SRF&#x02013;Fkh2p complexes are likely to be stronger (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f2">2</xref>). This observation points to a potential role for the N&#x02010;terminal part of Fkh2p &#x0005b;that includes the FKH-associated (FHA) domain&#x0005d; in stabilising Mcm1p&#x02013;Fkh2p ternary complexes in combination with amino acids 180&#x02013;254. As FHA domains are often sites of protein&#x02013;protein interactions, this might have regulatory implications for the complex. Finally, it should be noted that the region of Fkh2p required for DNA binding cooperativity is not conserved with Fkh1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f4">4</xref>) and Fkh1p is incapable of cooperatively forming ternary complexes with Mcm1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg347f4">4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg347c10">10</xref>). Thus, our results clearly define in molecular terms why the highly related transcription factors Fkh1p and Fkh2p exhibit different propensities in forming complexes with Mcm1p and hence divergent functions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg347f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Fkh2p requires Mcm1p to bind the <italic>SWI5</italic> promoter.
