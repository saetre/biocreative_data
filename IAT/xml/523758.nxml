Here, the yeast SHI wild-type gene has been isolated by complementation and shown to be identical to RPB9, the gene encoding a small subunit of RNA polymerase II. A point mutation in the shi gene, changing a cysteine residue in a putative zinc ribbon motif into a phenylalanine residue, was demonstrated to permit the observed usage of upstream initiation sites. Deletion of the non-essential SHI gene also results in usage of upstream initiation sites and causes conditional growth defects.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0081-a" xlink:role="4935"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0078.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4932"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0079.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4933"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4934"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4935"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00047-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4936"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
