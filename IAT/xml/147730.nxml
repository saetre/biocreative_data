The ERbetacx transcript is expressed in testis, ovary, thymus and prostate as well as in human cultured cell lines such as HEC-1, HOS-TE85 and Saos-2 cells. ERbetacx protein is also immunodetectable in these human cells. Biochemical analysis reveals that the average dissociation constants ( K d) of ERalpha and ERbeta for 17beta-estradiol (E2) are 0.2 and 0.6 nM respectively, but ERbetacx has no ligand binding ability. ERalpha and ERbeta proteins bind to the estrogen response element, whereas ERbetacx does not form any shifted complex in gel shift assays. In a transient expression assay, ERbetacx shows no ligand-dependent transactivation ability of a basal promoter and also cannot interact with a cofactor, TIF1alpha, in the presence or absence of E2. ERbetacx preferentially forms a heterodimer with ERalpha rather than that with ERbeta, inhibiting DNA binding by ERalpha. Interestingly, however, it shows a significant dominant negative activity only against ERalpha transactivation. Thus, this study indicates that ERbetacx potentially inhibits ERalpha-mediated estrogen action and that alternative splicing of the C-terminal region and its inhibitory properties are characteristic of several members of nuclear receptor isoforms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
