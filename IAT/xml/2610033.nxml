We also identified a large number of transcripts that were misexpressed in both mutants suggesting that <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>gene products similarly regulate gene expression. By integrating gene expression data with a protein-protein interaction network, we found that mutations in <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>resulted in misexpression of common gene networks, and consequently predicted additional specific phenotypes previously not known to be associated with either gene.

For example, microtubule mediated trafficking and cell motility are inhibited during mitosis since centrosome and mitotic spindle mediated chromosome segregation requires dramatic reorganization of microtubules. In addition, actin/myosin mediated cell migration ceases during cell division when cortical actin must be reorganized in order to specify where the cleavage furrow is activated during cytokinesis. Consequently, gene expression patterns that control differentiation, morphogenesis and cell division must respond to a myriad of developmental cues and integrate them into a concerted cellular response in order to achieve proper tissue size and shape (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]).</p><p>It is also thought that changes in chromatin structure accompany developmental changes in order to establish and/or maintain tissue specific gene expression states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. How changes in chromatin are coordinated with cell division and cell differentiation remains poorly understood. However, it is clear that these processes must be linked in order to ensure accurate propagation of epigenetic states and maintenance of cell fates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As these are fundamental processes ubiquitous to all metazoans, it is of great interest to uncover the factors that link cell cycle progression, differentiation and morphogenesis to developmental changes in chromatin.</p><p><italic>Drosophila </italic>development, and oogenesis in particular, has proven to be an excellent model for understanding how developmental cues coordinate differentiation with cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The <italic>Drosophila </italic>model has recently been used to reveal novel epigenetic functions of <italic>sticky </italic>and the <italic>Fragile-X mental retardation-1 </italic>(<italic>dFmr1</italic>) gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, both genes have been shown to regulate actin/myosin cytoskeletal organization and mutants in both genes exhibit pleiotropy. These findings suggest that <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>may possess similar biological functions and may represent regulatory hubs that coordinate diverse cellular and developmental processes. If this is true, it would be expected that both of these genes would have many interactors as it has been suggested that pleiotropy may result from disrupting hubs in protein-protein interaction networks as well as in gene regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p><italic>sticky </italic>is the <italic>Drosophila </italic>homologue of mammalian <italic>citron kinase</italic>. It is related to protein kinase B, protein kinase C, Rho-Kinase (ROK), myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) and myotonin-related Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]). The only known substrate for citron kinase is myosin II, the primary motor protein responsible for cleavage furrow ingression during cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). Although it is clear that <italic>sticky/citron kinase </italic>plays a critical function in cytokinesis, this kinase has other functions as it likely has more than one substrate. In addition, it may possess activities not dependent upon its kinase domain. <italic>Citron kinase </italic>deficient mice exhibit cytokinesis failure and increased apoptosis in the central nervous system resulting in severe ataxia and epilepsy. However, some non-neuronal cells develop normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Normal development of non-neuronal cells suggests that, in mice, <italic>citron kinase </italic>has a neuron specific function. In a Down syndrome mouse model <italic>citron kinase </italic>is responsible for inhibiting neurite extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, this <italic>citron kinase </italic>mediated neurite inhibition is through a direct interaction with tetratricopeptide repeat protein TTC3, the ortholog of <italic>Drosophila dTPR2</italic>, which suppresses polyglutamine toxicity in a fly Huntington's disease model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Further support for a neuro-specific function comes from the observation that a splice variant of citron kinase protein, which lacks the kinase domain, directly interacts with post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and localizes to synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The Fragile-X mental retardation-1 protein (FMRP) is a microRNA regulator, and like citron kinase protein, FMRP is thought to have critical functions in neurodevelopment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Inactivation of the human <italic>FMR1 </italic>ortholog leads to Fragile-X syndrome, which is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and is associated with severe neurodevelopmental and behavioral abnormalities (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). FMRP is an RNA binding protein, and its molecular function is thought to be in regulating mRNA translation and mRNA trafficking in neurons. Interestingly, in <italic>Drosophila, dFmr1 </italic>has also been shown to regulate heterochromatin mediated gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore, it is clear that Fmrp is capable of affecting the expression of many genes, some of which produce mRNA molecules that are direct binding targets of the Fmrp protein while others may be targets of Fmrp chromatin mediated epigenetic gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Both <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>have been shown to genetically interact with the microRNA regulator <italic>Ago1</italic>, further supporting a connection between these genes in translational and epigenetic control of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Fmrp also regulates actin/myosin cytoskeletal dynamics through the Rac1 GTPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Similarly, in both <italic>Drosophila </italic>and mouse, <italic>sticky </italic>(<italic>citron kinase</italic>) is regulated by Rho and Rac GTPase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This raises the interesting possibility that both citron kinase protein and Fmrp could regulate actin/myosin cytoskeletal dynamics <italic>via </italic>a common signaling pathway. Given the phenotypic and genetic similarities between the <italic>Drosophila sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>genes, we first investigated whether mutations in these two genes exhibited a genetic interaction. Secondly, we assessed whether both mutants had a common suite of genes that were misregulated that could account for the similarities between <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutant phenotypes.</p><p>In this report, we show that the <italic>Drosophila citron kinase </italic>ortholog, <italic>sticky</italic>, exhibits a genetic interaction with <italic>dFmr1</italic>, and we show that <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>regulate a common set of genes. These findings have important implications for the functions of both citron kinase protein and FMRP in human neurodevelopment as well as human pathologies including Down syndrome and Fragile-X syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title><italic>sticky </italic>mutants dominantly suppress <italic>dFmr1 </italic>gain of function rough eye phenotype</title><p>We have previously shown that an <italic>Argonaute1 </italic>(<italic>Ago1</italic>) gain of function phenotype can be dominantly suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in <italic>sticky </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This observation suggested that wild-type Ago1 protein function was dependent on proper <italic>sticky </italic>dosage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Fmrp, like Ago1, is a regulator of microRNA mediated gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition, <italic>Drosophila dFmr1 </italic>mutants have been shown to have heterochromatin structure and gene silencing defects similar to those reported for <italic>sticky </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, we tested whether <italic>sticky </italic>genetically interacts with <italic>dFmr1</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>sticky </italic>mutations rescue <italic>dFmr1 </italic>overexpression phenotypes in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>eye</bold>.

Both Ago1 and Fmrp are known to directly control microRNA mediated gene regulation (solid arrows). Fmrp also directly targets Rac1 mRNA for repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. <italic>sticky </italic>and Fmrp proteins also control gene expression through heterochromatin gene silencing (bars and dashed arrows).

As previously reported the <italic>sev:dFmr1 </italic>eyes were rough (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). At higher magnification the <italic>sev:dFmr1 </italic>eye showed that 100% (n = 10 eyes) had &#x0003e;50 ommatidia with crater-like necrosis (see arrows in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Both <italic>sti</italic><sup>3 </sup>and <italic>sti</italic><sup><italic>Z</italic>3-5829 </sup>mutant alleles were able to dominantly suppress the <italic>dFmr1 </italic>gain-of-function rough eye phenotypes yielding a less severe rough eye (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Although the degree of suppression was variable, it occurred in 100% of progeny (n&#x0003e;100). Furthermore, the crater-like necrosis of the individual ommatidia was almost completely suppressed as all (n = 10) eyes we observed at high magnification had &#x0003c;5 of these defects per eye (see arrows, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). We conclude that Fmrp function is sensitive to <italic>sticky </italic>gene dosage. This also suggests that, in part, Fmrp effector functions are <italic>sticky </italic>dependent, and therefore we propose that <italic>sticky </italic>may function upstream of Fmrp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). However, since the Rac-GTPase may be positively or negatively regulated by Fmrp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], it is also possible that Fmrp activity modulates <italic>sticky </italic>through Rac activation or Rac mRNA translational repression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of <italic>dFmr1 </italic>function enhances <italic>sticky </italic>knockdown phenotypes in the eye</title><p>The ability of <italic>sticky </italic>mutations to rescue <italic>dFmr1 </italic>overexpression suggests positive regulation between these genes. In a model such as this (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), it would be predicted that a loss of function in both genes would result in phenotype enhancement. It has previously been shown that RNAi knockdown of <italic>sticky</italic>, under control of the eyeless promoter, results in a rough eye phenotype and a reduction in eye size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We have used this system to demonstrate that loss of function in <italic>dFmr1 </italic>can enhance the phenotypes caused by <italic>sticky </italic>RNAi knockdown in the fly eye (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>dFmr1 loss of function enhances sticky RNAi knockdown phenotypes</bold>.

Since mutations in the <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>genes have been demonstrated to affect chromatin structure, we also hypothesized that regulation of gene expression by sticky kinase and/or Fmrp could occur at the level of transcription and therefore mRNA levels would be altered in each of these mutants. To assess which specific transcripts were being regulated by these genes, we used NimbleGen <italic>Drosophila </italic>whole genome arrays containing ~385,000 features (12 unique features per gene, synthesized in duplicate on each array) to measure the levels of 15,634 specific transcripts in Cy3 labeled cDNA made from whole female fly total RNA.

Therefore, this second control stock had a genetic background identical to that of the <italic>dFmr1</italic><sup>3 </sup>mutant. This served to reduce the chance of identifying genes which showed different transcript abundance due to genetic background differences. The use of two independent wild type controls also served to reduce the chance of detecting transcripts which may have large natural variances in abundance but do not dramatically impact phenotype.

Though the <italic>Cbl</italic>-L transcript signal appeared to be higher in the <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutant than in the wild-type control, we could not conclude that this difference was statistically significant. This may be because <italic>Cbl</italic>-L is expressed at very low levels in all genotypes and our assay was simply not sensitive enough to detect such a small difference. Regardless, this RT-PCR validation provides general evidence that <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>both serve to normally repress a common set of genes, and these data suggest that a large number of similar processes may be affected by both <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>RT-PCR quantitation of mRNA levels for candidate genes</bold>.

To overcome this problem we associated our expression data with a network of <italic>Drosophila </italic>protein-protein interactions. Transcriptional regulation is only one of many levels of regulation found in biology. Though microarrays do not directly provide data on other types of regulation, the effects of transcriptional changes on other levels of biological regulation can be inferred based on additional information. For example, if a gene does not show a change in transcript abundance but nevertheless interacts with a number of genes that show significant expression changes, it is likely that its functionality will be altered. Thus, we used protein-protein interaction data to expand the scope of our microarray analysis. After associating our microarray gene expression data set with a protein-protein interaction network (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), we used jActiveModules to identify and score sub-networks of interacting genes that collectively showed significant changes in expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Expression Network</bold>.

First, we observed that for both mutants, the <italic>Mer</italic>, <italic>ci </italic>and <italic>aPKC </italic>genes emerge as common hubs for the two sub-networks even though none of these genes are being misexpressed in either mutant (gray nodes in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). As noted above, this is due to many of the same genes that are being misexpressed in both mutants. Second, we found that although both <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutants generally tend to overexpress genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), the <italic>dFmr1 </italic>sub-network shows many more underexpressed genes than the <italic>sticky </italic>sub-network (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, green nodes). Third, although the <italic>dFmr1 </italic>sub-network shows many more underexpressed genes than the <italic>sticky </italic>sub-network these are not necessarily genes that are misregulated only in the <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutant. For example, the DNA repair genes, <italic>Irbp </italic>and <italic>Pms2</italic>, are overexpressed in <italic>sticky </italic>mutants whereas both are underexpressed in <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Similarly, the Autophagy-specific gene 1 kinase, <italic>Atg1</italic>, gene is overexpressed in <italic>sticky </italic>mutants whereas it is underexpressed in <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Lastly, although DNA damage response and repair genes are common in both sub-networks, we noted that different subsets of these genes are misexpressed in each of the two mutants. For example, the <italic>Lig4 </italic>and <italic>mus309 </italic>genes are present in the <italic>sticky </italic>sub-network but not the <italic>dFmr1 </italic>sub-network, whereas the <italic>RecQ</italic>, <italic>mus209 </italic>and <italic>mus210 </italic>genes emerge from the <italic>dFmr1 </italic>sub-network and not observed in the <italic>sticky </italic>sub-network. This suggests that although both mutants may impinge on similar biological processes by altering expression of similar sets of genes, the mechanism by which <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>effect these same processes may be different. In the case of these DNA repair genes, it will be interesting to see whether these differences in the two sub-networks reflect physiologically different types of DNA damage and/or repair processes.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold><italic>sticky </italic>mutant active sub-network</bold>.

These GO-terms included many related to embryonic and larval development, nervous system development, oogenesis, cytoskeletal organization, axis specification, cell cycle regulation, and DNA damage responses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>).

However, since our RNA was prepared from whole adult flies, it was not possible to directly determine which tissues were misexpressing which genes. In order to address this issue we compared our data to the FlyAtlas dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This data set compares gene expression profiles between individual <italic>Drosophila </italic>tissues. However, the criteria used to define tissue specific genes in Chintapalli et al. were as strict as possible (no detectable signal in more than one tissue) and resulted in small lists of tissue specific genes. We wished to determine larger sets of "tissue enriched" genes from FlyAtlas that could be more robustly compared to our microarray data. Therefore, we defined our own sets of "tissue enriched" genes (see methods) based on the ratio of gene expression in a given tissue to that of the whole fly, as reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We were then able to calculate the probability of observing a given amount of overlap between sets.</p><p>By comparing our misexpression lists with tissue enrichment lists derived from FlyAtlas, we observed both significant over- and under-representation of tissue enriched genes. We found that genes enriched in the head, midgut, malphigian tubules, larval tubules, and larval fatbody were significantly over-represented in the lists of misexpressed genes for both <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutants (q&#x0003c;.001 and q&#x0003c;.01) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Hindgut enriched genes were also highly represented on both lists though this was just shy of significance for <italic>dFmr1 </italic>misexpressed genes. We also found that genes enriched in ovaries and testes were under-represented in both the <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>misexpression sets though the significance of this varied based on which q-value cutoff was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). The under-representation of testes enriched genes was expected since we used female total RNA. However, under-representation of ovary specific genes was surprising since nearly half the RNA of mature adult females comes from ovaries, and this could have biased our analysis toward ovary enriched genes. Alternatively, <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>could regulate genes that are not particularly abundant in ovaries but nevertheless have critical ovary specific functions, and therefore give rise to tissue specific phenotypes.</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p><bold>Tissue specificity of misexpressed genes</bold>. For each tissue (head, brain, crop, midgut, hindgut, Malpighian tubule, ovary, testes, accessory gland, larval Malpighian tubule, larval fat body, thoracico-abdominal ganglia, and thoracic and abdominal carcass), a list of genes enriched in that tissue was compiled based on the FlyAtlas data set (see methods). These lists were then compared to the lists of misexpressed genes in <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutants at q&#x0003c;.01 and q&#x0003c;.001.

GO-term analysis predicted that the <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutants may exhibit an oocyte axis polarity defect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This hypothesis was further supported by the common misexpression of the <italic>Cbl </italic>gene (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), which encodes for a receptor tyrosine kinase-associated, E3 ubiquitin ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The Cbl protein attenuates EGFR signaling, which is a major receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway in the developing ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, Fmrp has been shown to directly bind the <italic>Cbl </italic>mRNA, possibly regulating its stability and translation, thus adding an additional level of regulation to Cbl gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Disruption of EGFR signaling during oogenesis can lead to oocyte polarity defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and thus overexpression of <italic>Cbl </italic>could potentially lead to polarity defects by inappropriately dampening EGFR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

Similarly, stage 14 oocytes from <italic>dFmr1</italic><sup>3</sup>/<italic>dFmr1</italic><sup>3 </sup>mutant females were also severely ventralized, whereas a sibling heterozygous <italic>dFmr1</italic><sup>3</sup>/+ had normal oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12B,D,F</xref>). This oocyte ventralization defect suggests that localization of axis determining factors requires sticky kinase and Fmrp function and/or that <italic>Cbl </italic>overexpression in the ovary can lead to polarity defects. In either case, we conclude that the polarity defects predicted by the GO-term analysis are valid, and this points to clear and testable mechanistic models of <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>function in <italic>Drosophila </italic>oocyte axis formation.</p><fig position="float" id="F12"><label>Figure 12</label><caption><p><bold><italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutant oocytes exhibit predicted axis polarity defects</bold>.

We believe many of these diverse phenotypes are caused by effects on the populations of a wide range of transcripts, either through transcriptional regulation or mRNA stability. Genes that function to regulate such a diverse array of processes can be resistant to characterization by traditional genetic methods. This is because pleiotropic effects make it difficult to infer function from phenotypes. Thus, we have used a combination of genomic and protein-protein interaction network analyses in order to compare the effects of mutations in <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1</italic>. We have found that these two genes function to negatively regulate a large number of common transcripts and that their targets are involved in a number of similar biological processes. It is noteworthy that this interpretation is also supported by previous reports that both sticky kinase and Fmrp are regulators of chromatin mediated epigenetic gene silencing. It has been shown that Fmrp is required for centric heterochromatin assembly during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has also been shown that <italic>sticky </italic>wild-type gene function is required for proper silencing of genes by heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, the finding that both mutants display overexpression of many genes is consistent with genetic evidence demonstrating their general gene silencing functions.</p><p>Based on our analyses, we predict that <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>both function to control many aspects of development in imaginal disc derived appendages, oocytes, neurons, and possibly other tissues. Surprisingly, other biological processes that have not previously been associated with either gene are also predicted to be perturbed in <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutants. For example, a number of genes functioning in DNA damage repair such as <italic>DNA pol delta, Irbp, Ligase 4, mei-41, mre11, Mlh1, mus209, mus210, mus309, Pms2 </italic>and <italic>tefu</italic>, among others, are revealed in the high scoring sub-networks of either one or both mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>, Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). We have validated at least one GO-analysis prediction by showing that <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutants indeed exhibit an oocyte axis polarity defect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Drosophila </italic>mutants in DNA repair functions, including <italic>mei-41</italic>, disrupt receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR) signaling and results in oocyte polarity defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that the <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutant oocyte polarity defects could be due to failure to repair meiotic or germline chromosomal breaks.</p><p>Lastly, it is also noteworthy that the <italic>Drosophila Merlin </italic>(<italic>Mer</italic>) gene, the ortholog of the human tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis-2, emerged as a major hub for both <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>active sub-networks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This is important because the Mer protein serves to anchor actin to transmembrane proteins and is critical for establishing oocyte axis polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. It remains to be tested whether DNA damage repair, Cbl mediated attenuation of EGFR signaling, or actin/myosin defects is the primary cause of this axis polarity mutant phenotype. In addition, it remains to be tested whether other predictions from these analyses are correct.</p><p>Our claims of overlapping functions for the <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>genes are supported by the demonstration of a genetic interaction and phenotypic similarities. The phenotypes that we observe in these mutants also serve to validate our computational predictions about the functions of these genes. Genes that regulate many biological processes also tend to exhibit pleiotropic effects, leading to multiple and seemingly unrelated phenotypes. As is the case with many other proteins that function as hubs within biological networks, understanding the molecular mechanisms through which sticky kinase and Fmrp affect any cellular process is complicated by the very fact that they impinge on many other regulatory molecules. The idea that mutations with pleiotropic effects are common to genes whose products have many protein-protein interactions is supported by a recent study of yeast pleiotropic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Though few direct targets of Fmrp are known, and sticky kinase has only one known phosphorylation target, our expression data suggest these genes may nevertheless be hubs in the gene expression network (for reviews see, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]). In addition, the great number of genes that are transcriptionally misregulated in both <italic>dFmr1 </italic>and <italic>sticky </italic>loss-of-function mutations could also explain pleiotropic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Our systems level analysis of gene expression patterns in <italic>sticky </italic>and <italic>dFmr1 </italic>mutants has revealed gene networks, and potential direct downstream targets, that are regulated by both sticky kinase and Fmrp. It is our hope the future studies that seek to identify the molecular mechanisms causing the myriad phenotypes presented in these mutants may be facilitated by the gene networks reported in this study and the multiple testable hypotheses that arise from them, for example the predicted function of sticky kinase and Fmrp in cell polarity and DNA damage repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Drosophila strains</title><p>The <italic>P w</italic><sup>+ </sup><italic>[sev:dFmr1]</italic>, CyO and <italic>w</italic><sup>1118</sup>; +/+; <italic>dFmr1</italic><sup>3<italic>TJ</italic></sup>/<italic>dFmr1</italic><sup>3<italic>TJ </italic></sup>lines were previously described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

We then parsed out only the gene names and enrichment factors for each tissue (i.e. ratios of single tissue expression levels to whole fly expression). To construct lists with similar numbers of tissue enriched genes we had to determine an appropriate enrichment factor cutoff for each tissue. This was necessary because different tissues contribute different amounts of gene expression to the total observed in a whole fly. For each tissue, we plotted enrichment factors versus the total number of genes represented on the arrays that had an enrichment factors at least as great. We then fit power distributions (y = ax<sup>b</sup>) to these data and calculated the enrichment factor cutoffs predicted to provide the top 500 most enriched genes. These cutoffs had to be manually adjusted for ovaries and testes.
