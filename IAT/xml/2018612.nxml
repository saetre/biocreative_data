Either a stabilized form of Cdc18, the Cdc18-T6A phosphorylation mutant, or overexpression of wild type Cdc18, activate the Rad3-dependent S-M checkpoint in the apparent absence of detectable replication structures and gross DNA damage. This cell cycle block relies on the Rad checkpoint pathway and requires Chk1 phosphorylation and activation. Unexpectedly, Cdc18-T6A induces changes in the mobility of Chromosome III, affecting the size of a restriction fragment containing rDNA repeats and producing aberrant nucleolar structures. Recombination events within the rDNA appear to contribute at least in part to the cell cycle delay. We propose that an elevated level of Cdc18 activates the Rad3-dependent checkpoint either directly or indirectly, and additionally causes expansion of the rDNA repeats on Chromosome III.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Before a cell divides it must first faithfully copy its DNA so that each daughter cell receives a full complement of genetic information. In the eukaryotic cell cycle chromosomal duplication is restricted to S phase, and chromosomal segregation to M phase, with these phases separated by the gap phases G1 and G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Checkpoints are important for controlling these events, delaying the cell cycle in response to incomplete DNA replication or DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and are essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity and to prevent ploidy changes. Failure to arrest the cell cycle in these situations contributes to cancer development and may cause resistance to standard treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>The mitotic cell cycle and checkpoint controls of the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> resemble those of higher organisms with distinct G1-S-G2-M phases and with mammalian homologues identified for the major fission yeast checkpoint genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7">4&#x02013;7</xref>). Activation of the cyclin dependent kinase Cdc2 is required for entry into mitosis, and inhibitory phosphorylation on tyrosine 15 by Wee1 and Mik1 maintains the Cdc2-cyclin complex in an inactive state until dephosphorylation occurs through Cdc25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Six genes have been identified that are involved in activating the checkpoint response by an S phase block (the S-M checkpoint) or DNA damage, that are collectively referred to as the checkpoint <italic>rad</italic> genes (<italic>rad1, 3, 9, 17, 26 and hus1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13">8&#x02013;13</xref>). Cells mutated in these genes are hypersensitive to DNA damage and to hydroxyurea (HU), an inhibitor of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Rad3 phosphorylates and activates the Cds1 kinase after a DNA replication block, and also phosphorylates and activates the Chk1 kinase after DNA damage, although Chk1 can substitute for Cds1 in a DNA replication block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Checkpoint activation blocks mitotic onset by decreasing the activity of the mitotic Cdc2/cyclin complexes as a consequence of Cdc2 tyrosine 15 phosphorylation. Cds1 also plays a role in recovery from the S phase arrest, and in an HU-induced S phase block cells lacking Cds1 lose viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">16&#x02013;20</xref>).</p><p>Both Chk1 and Cds1 phosphorylation and activation are dependent on the presence of Rad3 and other checkpoint Rad proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, the sequence of upstream events leading to activation of Rad3 is unclear with the identity of the DNA damage/incomplete replication sensors and initial checkpoint activators remaining uncertain. One possibility is replication protein A (RPA) coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is a common structure generated at sites of DNA damage and is thought to play a role in recruiting two key complexes to damaged DNA: the human ATR (<underline>AT</underline>M- and <underline>R</underline>ad3-related) protein complexed with its regulatory partner ATRIP, and the Rad17 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). We set out to find new genes or a new role for known genes involved in checkpoint activation upstream of Rad3. We postulated that overexpression of such genes would ectopically activate the replication and/or damage checkpoint. In the presence of Rad3 this would activate the checkpoint and arrest the cell cycle, but in its absence cells would grow and divide normally. In this study we show that increased levels or stabilization of Cdc18/CDC6, a key factor initiating DNA replication in eukaryotes, induce a Rad3-dependent checkpoint response in the apparent absence of DNA replication structures, and we investigate how this system operates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and methods</title><p>All experiments were carried out in EMM2 minimal media unless otherwise stated.

For this screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), a <italic>rad3<sup>ts</sup></italic> strain (CCL3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) was used where <italic>rad3</italic> is active at 25&#x000b0;C and inactive at 36&#x000b0;C.

Overexpression of the C-terminus of Cdc18 also induces re-replication and a Rad3-dependent block of mitosis, whilst overexpression of the Cdc18 N-terminus induces a Rad3-independent block of mitosis but is unable to induce re-replication. The effect of the Cdc18 N-terminus is thought to be the result of a non-physiological interaction with Cdc2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). No re-replication was observed with the newly isolated plasmid as assessed by FACS, which was compared with the FACS profile of pRep3X <italic>cdc18</italic>-induced re-replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, D). Possible explanations for the lack of re-replication were that the cDNA was 16 base pairs shorter in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;UTR) compared with the previously studied re-replication-inducing cDNA, or that the pRep4X vector was used rather than pRep3X. In support of the 5&#x02032;UTR having an effect, re-replication was also not observed with the original <italic>cdc18</italic> cDNA isolate, which lacks the 5&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). We speculated that this moderate level of Cdc18 overexpression might induce the S-M checkpoint without re-replication, and to investigate this further sought to increase Cdc18 level in a more controlled manner by modifying Cdc18 stability. <table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>The variation in effects seen with different Cdc18 constructs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Construct</th><th colspan="4" align="center" rowspan="1">Effects</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Re-replication</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mitotic block</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rad3-dependent block</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transient block</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Changes in size/variability chromosome III</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>pRep3X <italic>cdc18</italic></bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not known</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Nishitani and Nurse, 1995)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>pRep3X C-terminus <italic>cdc18</italic></bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not known</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Greenwood <italic>et al</italic>., 1998)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>pRep3X N-terminus <italic>cdc18</italic></bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not known</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Greenwood <italic>et al</italic>., 1998)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>pRep4X <italic>cdc18</italic></bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not known</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(This article)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic><bold>cdc18-T6A</bold></italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(This article)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Phosphorylation of the 6 CDK consensus sites by Cdc2 regulates the stability of the Cdc18 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37 B38 B39">37&#x02013;39</xref>) and over-expression of a mutant lacking these phosphorylation sites (Cdc18-T6A) results in increased re-replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).

Cycling cells from these strains were analysed by PFGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) followed by Southern blotting and rDNA probing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). In 17 strains analysed (not all data shown), chromosome III was now found to form a discrete band with an approximate 1:1 split between a normal sized chromosome III (in 9 out of the 17) and increased (up to 7&#x02009;Mb) sized chromosome III (in 8 out of the 17). We selected 4 of these strains (2 with a large chromosome III, and 2 with a normal-sized chromosome III) for further analysis. Each strain was cultured both overnight and for 30 generations before processing the cells for PFGE. Southern blotting and rDNA probing demonstrated that after 30 generations of growth, the normal-sized chromosome IIIs remained unchanged, but in contrast the larger chromosome IIIs returned closer to a normal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). In strains derived from the cross that still contained the <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> mutant, chromosome III remained smeared as in the parent strain (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the Cdc18 phosphorylation mutant protein induces changes in the size of chromosome III. These changes disappear with removal of the mutant Cdc18. It is therefore unlikely that an additional unknown mutation is producing the size variability of chromosome III. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>The changes in the size and variability of chromosome III disappear with removal of the Cdc18 phosphorylation mutant.

PFGE was carried out under different conditions, first to resolve smaller fragments (in the Kb range), and then to resolve larger fragments (in the Mb range).

To see whether recombination was involved in activating the Cdc18-T6A-induced checkpoint, we tested several different situations where recombination frequency in the rDNA repeats was altered. In budding yeast, <italic>rad52</italic> is necessary for homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), and so we looked for the effects of deleting its <italic>S. pombe</italic> homologue, <italic>rad22</italic>, on the Rad3-dependent elongation of the <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> mutant strain (CCL11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). We found that there was less elongation of the <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> mutant strain in the <italic>rad22</italic>&#x00394; background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B), suggesting that the absence of recombination partially suppresses the <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> elongated phenotype.</p><p>Polar replication fork barriers (RBF) are a conserved feature of rDNA in eukaryotes, and rDNA copy number is maintained through recombination events associated with RBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). We speculated that inactivation of the RBF would suppress recombination in the rDNA repeats, and prevent activation of the Cdc18-T6A-induced checkpoint. <italic>S. pombe</italic> rDNA contains three RBFs (RBF1, 2 and 3) and the termination protein Reb1 is required for arrest of replication forks at RBF2 and RBF3, but not RFB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). We found that deletion of <italic>reb1</italic> reduced the extent of cell elongation seen with the <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> mutant strain (CCL5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). This result suggests that the failure to stall replication forks at the RFB2 and RFB3 sites within the rDNA repeats has an affect on the ability of Cdc18-T6A to delay entry into mitosis.</p><p>The Rqh1 helicase suppresses inappropriate recombination in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), and <italic>rqh1</italic> deletion leads to considerable variation in the size of chromosome III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). After deletion of <italic>rqh1</italic>, a <italic>rad3</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> strain was not viable, raising the possibility that Cdc18 is driving recombination events, which are lethal in the absence of the Rqh1 helicase. We suggest that recombination is contributing in part to the Cdc18-T6A-induced Rad3-dependent G2 delay, and that reducing rDNA recombination or the cause of recombination (that is replication fork stalling), partially relieves the G2 delay.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our results have shown that the <italic>cdc18</italic> phosphorylation mutant, <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic>, has moderately elevated levels of Cdc18 compared to a wild type strain. The presence of Cdc18-T6A leads to a transient activation of a Rad3-dependent checkpoint, blocking the onset of mitosis in the absence of detectable replication intermediates or DNA over replication. We found that moderately overexpressed wild-type Cdc18 also acts upstream of Rad3 in the checkpoint pathway to block the onset of mitosis. Cdc18-T6A acts via Rad3 to bring about Chk1 phosphorylation and activation, and the Rad checkpoint protein network is necessary for this cell cycle block. In contrast, Cds1 and Mrc1 are not required for the cell cycle block. In the absence of Rad3, the <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> cells containing elevated Cdc18 protein levels have the same generation time as those containing wild-type Cdc18, there is no difference in the timing of S phase initiation and completion, and there are no gross effects on mutation rate. We conclude that the increased level of Cdc18 transiently activates the Rad3-dependent checkpoint through Chk1, with no other obvious effects on the cell cycle. However, one unexpected consequence of an elevated Cdc18 level in the <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> mutant was an increase in the size of chromosome III, with expansion of Sfi1 restriction fragments, which contain rDNA repeats and with differences in the nucleolar structure, which contains the rDNA repeats.</p><p>Cdc18 may be inducing genome wide replication at a low level, which is not detectable by FACS analysis or by 2D DNA gels. In the regions containing the rDNA repeats on chromosome III, the presence of a low level of replication bubbles could increase recombination and unequal cross-over events leading to an increase in size of the rDNA containing restriction fragment. We found that decreasing recombination, either by deleting <italic>rad22</italic> or inactivation of the RFB, partially suppressed the cell elongation phenotype normally seen with the <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> mutant, whilst increasing recombination, by deletion of <italic>rqh1</italic> in a <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> mutant, causes cell death suggesting that high levels of recombination are lethal. These data suggest that recombination plays some role in activating the checkpoint. However, the reduction in recombination did not completely abolish checkpoint activation. This may be because some recombination still occurs in the mutants tested, or that Cdc18-T6A also activates the checkpoint independently of the effects on chromosome III.</p><p>It is possible that the effect on rDNA repeat number due to the increased level of Cdc18 in the <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> mutant may act through a mechanism involving cohesin. Proper sister chromatid cohesion enables DSB repair by recombination without any net change in the number of rDNA. Sister chromatids are held together by cohesin, a multi-subunit protein complex, from their synthesis in S phase until anaphase segregation. Cohesin loading in <italic>Xenopus</italic> has been shown to be dependent on the formation of the pre-replicative complex: Cdt1, MCM2-7, ORC and CDC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). The Sir2 histone deacetylase required for heterochromatin formation acts to silence the rDNA locus, and is a negative regulator of DNA replication in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) suppressing rDNA copy number changes via effects on cohesin association. Cohesin dissociation leads to sister chromatid misalignment and subsequent upward expansion of the rDNA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Therefore, in our experiments the increased levels of Cdc18 present after S phase in the <italic>cdc18-T6A</italic> mutant could interfere with cohesin association leading to mis-alignment and upward rDNA expansion.</p><p>It has also been shown in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> that perturbations in origin firing lead to lesions in the DNA, especially within the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). PFGE revealed high chromosome XII instability in ORC mutants, and the monitoring of abnormal initiation was found to be rDNA copy number-dependent. These findings led to the suggestion that the rDNA locus plays an important DNA damage surveillance role during the initiation of DNA replication.</p><p>Although the cell cycle delay seen is likely to be due at least in part to the observed changes in chromosome III, we cannot exclude that Cdc18 has more than one effect and that the elevated level of Cdc18 may also directly activate the cell cycle checkpoint. With this model, activation of the Rad3/Chk1 dependent S-M block would be a direct consequence of elevated Cdc18, and is not due to effects on DNA replication, recombination or damage. Consistent with this view is the fact that cells containing Cdc18-T6A and lacking Rad3 appear to grow normally which would not be the case if damaging changes were occurring to the DNA. It may also be that the Cdc18-T6A mutant protein has other effects independent of Cdc18 stabilization because the protein cannot be phosphorylated.</p><p>The replication origin <italic>ars3001</italic> has been mapped to a 600&#x02009;bp region within the non-transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats upstream of the rDNA genes. It has been confirmed that origin activity is restricted to this sequence, and is not detected in other regions of the 10.9&#x02009;Kb rDNA repeat. This is the most abundant origin in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> genome, and hence chosen for the 2D DNA gels performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). The same probe was used as to identify the rDNA as a marker of the presence of chromosome III. As the changes in chromosome III appear to localize to the rDNA and low level replication leading to recombination is a possible cause of these changes, the fact that the <italic>ars3001</italic> origin probe did not pick up any replication intermediates in the presence of Cdc18-T6A in G2 arrested cells suggests that any ongoing replication is very low-level indeed.</p><p>We have shown that a moderately elevated level of Cdc18, generated either by ectopic expression or by modifying Cdc18 stability, activates the Rad3-dependent checkpoint. We propose that this is the result of a low level of Cdc18-induced replication causing subsequent recombination and expansion of the rDNA repeat regions on chromosome III, but suggest other possibilities such as ectopic checkpoint activation in the absence of any replication or a Cdc18-T6A-specific effect on chromosome III.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Pablo Hernandez, Shao-Win Wang, Greg Freyer, Tony Carr, Pierre Hentges, Kathy Gould, Takashi Toda and Nancy Walworth for strains, plasmids and antibodies.
