Signalling from Eph receptors and ephrins has been proposed to provide a molecular mechanism that guides the cells restricting them to streams. In mice and frogs, cranial neural crest express a combination of Eph receptors and ephrins that appear to exclude cells from adjacent tissues by forward and reverse signalling. The objective of this study was to provide comparative data on the distribution and function of Eph receptors and ephrins in avian embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To distinguish neural crest from bordering ectoderm and head mesenchyme, we have co-labelled embryos for Eph or ephrin RNA and a neural crest marker protein. Throughout their migration avian cranial neural crest cells express EphA3, EphA4, EphA7, EphB1, and EphB3 and move along pathways bordered by non-neural crest cells expressing ephrin-B1. In addition, avian cranial neural crest cells express ephrin-B2 and migrate along pathways bordered by non-neural crest cells expressing EphB2. Thus, the distribution of avian Eph receptors and ephrins differs from those reported in other vertebrates. In stripe assays when explanted cranial neural crest were given the choice between FN or FN plus clustered ephrin-B1 or EphB2 fusion protein, the cells strongly localize to lanes containing only FN. This preference is mitigated in the presence of soluble ephrin-B1 or EphB2 fusion protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings show that avian cranial neural crest use Eph and ephrin receptors as other vertebrates in guiding migration. However, the Eph receptors are expressed in different combinations by neural crest destined for each branchial arch and ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 appear to have opposite roles to those reported to guide cranial neural crest migration in mice. Unlike many of the signalling, specification, and effector pathways of neural crest, the roles of Eph receptors and ephrins have not been rigorously conserved. This suggests diversification of receptor and ligand expression is less constrained, possibly by promiscuous binding and use of common downstream pathways.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>A defining feature of vertebrates is the neural crest (NC), a transient group of cells that originate within the dorsal neuroectoderm of the neural tube during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Following an epithelial to mesenchyme transition in which they lose affinity for the neuroectodermal epithelium, NC cells individualize and gain the capacity to migrate through the underlying mesoderm. Hindbrain cranial neural crest (CNC) cells migrate ventrally to the branchial arches, where they contribute to the development of the face, jaw, neck, and heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. There are 3 discrete streams of hindbrain CNC, each separated by zones free of neural crest. The most rostral stream extends from rhombomere 2 (r2) to the first branchial arch; a second stream adjacent to r4 migrates to the second branchial arch; and the third forms a bifurcating stream that extends from r6 to the third and forth branchial arches. The patterning of the cranial neural crest is distinct from the segmentation of the trunk neural crest, where the patterning can be specifically attributed to differences between rostral and caudal halves of somites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]</p><p>Eph family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their membrane-anchored protein ligands, the ephrins, are thought to regulate directed migration of CNC cells. In the mouse embryo EphA4, EphB1, and EphB3 are expressed by the streams of CNC cells, whereas ephrin-B2 is distributed around the clefts dividing each branchial arch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. When ephrin-B2 is mutated, these streams become scattered and CNC cells invade the regions where ephrin-B2 is normally expressed. It is concluded that in CNC migration, ephrin-B2 functions primarily as a ligand to activate Eph-induced forward signaling that guides migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. On the other hand, ephrin-B1 is expressed by the migrating neural crest cells and when it is deleted only in these cells, directional migration defects are apparent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As a mutation in the PDZ binding domain of ephrin-B1 produces the same defects, it was concluded that in cranial neural crest ephrin B1 acts as a receptor that activates a PDZ mediated signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>A number of Eph and ephrin genes are expressed in the hindbrain region of the early chicken embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Based on these observations, we set out to determine which Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed by neural crest and which are expressed by the surrounding mesenchyme and ectoderm. We have found that avian CNC cells express Eph receptors and ephrin ligands, and an in vitro functional test indicates they can function in guiding migration. However, the roles of the ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 subunits are switched by comparison to those shown to function in mice. We propose a mechanism by which orthologues of Eph receptors and ephrins can become canalized to different roles during evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Co-localization of Eph/ephrin RNA and neural crest</title><p>Although Eph receptors and ephrins are known to be expressed in the hindbrain and branchial arches, it is critical to developing a hypothesis for their functions to know which Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed by neural crest and which by surrounding head mesenchyme and ectoderm. To do this, we employed double labeling in which Eph and ephrin expression patterns were evaluated by RNA in situ hybridization and CNC cells were identified by double labeling with an antibody that recognizes a NC antigen, HNK-1. Based on findings from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] as well as our own cloning experiments, we focused our analysis on ephrin-A5, ephrin-B1, ephrin-B2, EphA1, EphA3, EphA7, EphB1, EphB2, and EphB3. The stages of development examined range from 11&#x02013;15, during which most of the CNC cell migration in the chicken embryo takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Embryos probed with control, sense transcripts developed only weak background staining or no color at all (data not shown). Analysis of the CNC subpopulation associated with the first branchial arch has been excluded due to technical problems with resolving NC staining from staining in the hindbrain. We were unable to detect expression of ephrin-A5 and EphA1 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Avian cranial neural crest cells express EphB3, EphA3, and EphA7</title><p>EphA3, EphA7 and EphB3 mRNA localize to streams of cells on either side of the otic vesicle. In the stage 14 embryos, one of these streams reaches from BAII to the upper rostral face of the otic vesicle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>; arrow 1). A second reaches from BAIII to the upper caudal face of the otic vesicle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>; arrow 2). A third reaches from BAIV to a point in the second stream around the lower level of the otic vesicle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, arrow 3). The HNK-1 antibody identifies streams of cells that have an identical distribution to those labeled by the EphA3, EphA7 and EphB3 probes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b&#x02013;f</xref>). At stage 12 and 13, the EphB3 probe labels a stream of cells rostral to the otic vesicle.

In stage 15 embryos, probe staining is also found in cells within BAII, and staining is strongest in the arch (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>; arrow 1). This region roughly corresponds to the same point where the stream of HNK-1-positive cells rostral to the otic vesicle comes to an end (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Ephrin-B1 probe also hybridizes weakly to a thin, diffuse strip of cells that extends from the caudal surface of the otic vesicle to the cleft between BAII and BAIII (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>, arrow 2). A second region of diffuse staining is caudal to the otic placode and extends to the first somite (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>, arrow 3). In combination, the boundaries of these 2 regions resemble an inverted v (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>, fine outline).

Therefore, CNC cells in the avian embryo have distributions that for the most part do not overlap with EphB2, and they appear to migrate along pathways bordered by cells expressing this receptor.</p><p>However, there are differences in the expression patterns for ephrin-B1 and EphB2 in non-neural crest cells. For instance, ephrin-B1 expression is concentrated inside of BAII (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a, c</xref>), whereas EphB2 has a more dorsal distribution in the same region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a, c</xref>). Similarly, ephrin-B1 expression caudal to the otic vesicle is focused around the dorsal half of the CNC stream in that region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a, c</xref>), whereas EphB2 expression brackets the CNC more ventrally around BAIII and BAIV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a, c</xref>).</p><p>These data indicate that a suite of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are expressed in the hindbrain region of the avian embryo during the course of CNC cell migration. RNA probes for EphA3, EphA4, EphA7, EphB1, and EphB3 label segregated streams of HNK-1 expressing cells that span the distance from the hindbrain to the branchial arches. We have therefore concluded that avian CNC cells express EphA3, EphA4, EphB1, and EphB3 and ephrin-B2. These CNC streams are positioned between groups of HNK-1-negative cells labeled by probes for ephrin-B1 or EphB2. Thus, avian CNC cells migrate along pathways bordered by cells expressing potential binding partners for EphA3, EphA4, EphA7, EphB1, and EphB3 or ephrin-B2. This led us to hypothesize that CNC cells in the avian embryo are channeled into streams and guided to their destinations by being excluded from ephrin-B1 or EphB2-expressing territories.</p></sec><sec><title>Proteins that bind to ephrin-B1 and EphB2 are expressed by avian cranial neural crest cells in vitro</title><p>In order to confirm that explanted avian CNC cells express proteins that interact with ephrin-B1 and EphB2, we exposed the outgrowth from cultured stage 10&#x02013;12 hindbrain explants to affinity probes comprised of the extracellular domain of either ephrin-B1 or EphB2 fused to the Fc domain of human IgG and then stained them with an FITC-conjugated antibody specific for the Fc domain of human IgG. In the control experiment, where cells were exposed to the Fc domain of human IgG alone, cells co-labeled with the HNK-1 antibody fail to bind the anti-Fc antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>).

In the control experiment, stage 10&#x02013;12 hindbrain explants were cultured on a substrate made up of lanes of FN alternating with lanes of FN plus an FITC marker and Fc protein pre-clustered with an anti-Fc antibody. Using Fc protein concentrations in the coating solution ranging from 8 to 64 &#x003bc;g/ml, HNK-1-positive cell outgrowth is always spread evenly across the two sets of lanes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). In contrast, substrate protein concentration has an effect on outgrowth pattern when ephrin-B1/Fc is used in place of Fc in the stripe assay. At 32 &#x003bc;g/ml in the coating solution, the outgrowth is even (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). When coated with 48 &#x003bc;g/ml, outgrowth shows a bias for the lanes between the FITC-marked stripes, but there are also a significant number of cells found on these stripes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). At 64 &#x003bc;g/ml in the coating solution, this bias is much stronger and there are almost no cells found on the FITC stripes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). In the corresponding experiments with EphB2/Fc, cell outgrowth also becomes increasingly restricted to the lanes between the FITC-marked stripes with increasing substrate protein concentrations (2 to 64 &#x003bc;g/ml) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The total cell outgrowth in these experiments is comprised almost entirely of cells labeled by the HNK-1 antibody (as revealed by DAPI nuclear staining) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Outgrowth of cranial neural crest cells from stage 10&#x02013;12 chicken neural tube explants onto ephrin-B1 or EphB2 stripe assay substrates.</bold> Representative results from the three experimental conditions.

Conversely, outgrowth is highly skewed on the substrate containing lanes of ephrin-B1/Fc, with 15% of cells being found on the FITC stripes and 85% between them (n = 9).

With both sets of experiments, the results from the control are similar to the assays in which no soluble protein was added to the culture medium. It should also be noted that soluble ephrin-B1/Fc or EphB2/Fc did not completely eliminate the striped outgrowth seen in the presence of soluble Fc alone, but made it less conspicuous.

Addition of soluble competitor resulted in a significantly more even pattern of outgrowth than in controls, presumably because the Ephs and ephrins expressed by the outgrowing cells were rendered less sensitive to the substrate-bound ephrin-B1 or EphB2 through their interactions with the soluble proteins. Taken together, these results indicate that avian CNC cells express proteins that bind to ephrin-B1 and EphB2 and mediate the repulsion of these cells from ephrin-B1 and EphB2 in the stripe assay.</p><p>This repulsion could explain how avian CNC cells are guided to their targets in vivo, given that the stereotypical pathways through which they migrate are bordered by cells expressing ephrin-B1 or EphB2. Furthermore, while the paradigm for Eph/ephrin function in directed cell migration is that Eph-expressing migratory cells or outgrowing axons are guided to their targets by receptor-mediated repulsion from ephrin-expressing cells, our results suggest that reverse signaling from Eph to ephrin can also play a role. Thus, Ephs and ephrins can regulate the path finding behavior of migrating avian CNC cells.</p><p>A remarkable aspect of these studies is the differences that are apparent within the vertebrates in the distribution of hindbrain Ephs and ephrins (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Although data are incomplete, it is apparent that the combination of Eph receptors and ephrins expressed by the different populations of hindbrain neural crest varies between the classes of vertebrates. Overall, hindbrain neural crest of mice, chickens and frogs express similar subsets of Eph receptors and ephrins, however, few of the receptors or ephrins are expressed by precisely the same populations of neural crest or bordering tissue. The patterns of hindbrain neural crest migration are similar, yet the molecules that are in part responsible for patterning the streams appear to differ. This is particularly striking with the data from mouse and chick with respect to ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2. In mice ephrin-B1 is expressed by migrating CNC cells and there is direct evidence that it functions as a reverse signaling receptor to regulate CNC path finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In chicks, ephrin-B1 is expressed by mesoderm cells that border the migratory pathways and it appears to function as a ligand that mediates repulsion of migrating neural crest. Similarly, ephrin-B2 is expressed by all three streams of neural crest cells in chicks, yet in mice ephrin-B2 functions as a ligand and is expressed in tissues bordering neural crest pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 appear to have evolved opposite roles in guidance of chicken and mouse embryos hindbrain neural crest.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of expression of Eph receptor and ephrin in branchial arches (BA) of 3 vertebrates</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Gene</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Organism</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>BA I</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>BA II</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>BA III</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>BA IV</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Reference</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Eph B1</italic></bold></td><td align="left"><italic>Frog</italic></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">NC/Meso</td><td align="left">NC/Meso</td><td align="left">12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Chick</italic></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">NC</td><td></td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Mouse</italic></td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">NC</td><td></td><td align="left">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Eph B2</italic></bold></td><td align="left"><italic>Frog</italic></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Chick</italic></td><td></td><td align="left">Meso</td><td align="left">Meso</td><td align="left">Meso</td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Mouse</italic></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Eph B3</italic></bold></td><td align="left"><italic>Frog</italic></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Chick</italic></td><td></td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Mouse</italic></td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">NC</td><td></td><td align="left">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Eph A4</italic></bold></td><td align="left"><italic>Frog</italic></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">NC/Meso</td><td></td><td align="left">12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Chick</italic></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">NC</td><td></td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Mouse</italic></td><td></td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">NC</td><td></td><td align="left">25</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>ephrin-B1</italic></bold></td><td align="left"><italic>Frog</italic></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Chick</italic></td><td></td><td align="left">Meso</td><td align="left">Meso</td><td align="left">Meso</td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Mouse</italic></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>ephrin-B2</italic></bold></td><td align="left"><italic>Frog</italic></td><td></td><td align="left">NC/Meso</td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Chick</italic></td><td></td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">NC</td><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><italic>Mouse</italic></td><td></td><td align="left">Ecto/Meso</td><td align="left">Ecto/Meso</td><td></td><td align="left">3</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Neural crest is a hallmark of vertebrates and many aspects of neural crest development are shared features. There are numerous examples of conservation of signaling pathways, transcription factors specification, and effectors genes in vertebrate neural crest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Reviews of neural crest frequently do not distinguish data from fish, frogs, birds, and mammals, as conservation of pathways and regulatory networks in neural crest is commonplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Why do the critical roles of Eph receptors and ephrins in guiding migration appear to be unconstrained by phylogeny? It may be that although there are multiple orthologous Eph receptors and ephrins, they bind promiscuously and they activate similar effector pathways. Diversification of expression patterns then results from a process of canalization in which similar receptor-ligand binding partners activate similar downstream events making migration independent of the precise receptor or ligand expressed. For example, if ancestrally ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 were both expressed by neural crest and head mesenchyme and the downstream signal transduction mechanisms were the same for both subunits, in one lineage expression of ephrin-B2 becomes fixed in neural crest, whereas in another lineage expression of ephrin-B2 becomes fixed in bordering mesenchyme. It may be significant that in <italic>Xenopus </italic>ephrin-B2 is expressed by both BAII neural crest cells and the mesoderm along the BAII pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The hypothesis that the Eph receptors and ephrins are interchangeable is supported by data on binding affinities of the subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However it is not known if similar signal transduction pathways are activated by orthologous Eph receptors and ephrins in different populations of neural crest. Comparative data on the molecular mechanisms of hindbrain neural crest patterning has the potential to contribute to a more complete picture of vertebrate evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that Eph receptors and ephrin ligands contribute to avian hindbrain neural crest cell pathfinding, as is the case in mouse and <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Avian hindbrain neural crest cells express a set of Eph receptors and migrate along pathways bordered by cells expressing ephrin-B1. In addition, avian CNC cells also express ephrin-B2 and migrate along pathways bordered by cells expressing a binding partner, EphB2. Our functional analyses show that EphB2 and ephrin-B1 have repulsive effects on avian CNC cells and suggest that these effects are mediated by Ephs and ephrins. The pattern of expression of Eph receptors and ephrins by different populations of hindbrain neural crest in vertebrates appears to be less constrained phylogenetically than other neural crest signalling and specification molecules. This may be a consequence of diversification of receptor and ligand expression that was unimpeded because of promiscuous binding affinities and common downstream events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>4.1 Probe plasmids and RNA in situ hybridization</title><p>To prepare probes for EphB1 and EphB2, small blocks of tissue bracketing the otic vesicle region were excised from stage 13&#x02013;15 embryos.

Once neural tube explants were ready to be transferred to the dish, the coverslip was rinsed with PBS and the dish was flooded with 900 &#x003bc;l of culture medium. The neural tube explants were positioned on these substrates such that they were perpendicular with the stripes.</p><p>For the soluble competitor experiments, soluble Fc proteins were added to a final concentration of 10 &#x003bc;g/ml after the stranding step. With the ephrin-B1/Fc substrate, either soluble ephrin-B1/Fc or soluble Fc alone was added. Likewise with the EphB2/Fc substrate, either soluble EphB2/Fc or soluble Fc alone was added. The medium added to the dish after the neural tube explants had been given time to attach to the substrate also contained 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of soluble Fc protein.</p></sec><sec><title>4.6 Antibody labeling and quantification of outgrowth cultures on stripe assay substrates</title><p>Neural tube explant cultures that showed exuberant cell outgrowth on stripe assay substrates after the overnight incubation period were processed for immunolocalization of HNK-1. Cultures were rinsed with PBS and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 minutes. Fixed cultures were rinsed successively with PBS and TBST, then incubated in blocking buffer (5% FBS in TBST). After 1 hour, the blocking buffer was replaced with HNK-1 antibody diluted 1:100 in fresh blocking buffer and the cultures were incubated in a humidified chamber at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. In some cases where the signal from the FITC-BSA marking the Fc protein stripes was weak, FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG was also added (1:100 dilution) to make the stripes more apparent. The next day, the cultures were rinsed thoroughly with TBST and incubated with secondary antibody diluted to 1:400 in blocking buffer. After 90 minutes, cultures were again rinsed thoroughly with TBST and incubated briefly with DAPI in TBST (1 ng/ml). The coverslip on which the explants were cultured was then gently removed from the dish and inverted onto a drop of mounting medium on a microscope slide.</p><p>For any given field of cell outgrowth, images were taken for the HNK-1 and DAPI signals as well as the underlying FITC-marked protein stripes. Layered composites of these images were assembled in Adobe Photoshop 6.0.1 (Adobe Systems Inc.) such that the total HNK-1-positive cell outgrowth was represented in each composite. The HNK-1 layer was used to identify and remove HNK-1-negative cells (i.e. those cells labeled by DAPI alone) as well as HNK-1-positive cells that were extensively intermingled with HNK-1-negative ones. The remaining cells in the DAPI layer were then divided according to their position relative to the FITC-marked stripes, resulting in a set of two images for each explant representing outgrowth on the stripes and outgrowth between the stripes. Cell counts were obtained with Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Inc.), converted to percentages of the total outgrowth, averaged for each treatment, and graphed with GraphPad Prism version 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Statistical analyses (standard error calculations and Fisher's exact tests) were done with GraphPad InStat (GraphPad Software, Inc.).</p></sec><sec><title>4.7 Image capturing and figure preparation</title><p>in situ hybridization images were captured with a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and DAGE-MTI 3CCD camera (DAGE-MTI, Inc.) using Scion Image 4.0.3 (Scion Corporation). Cell culture images were captured with a Leica DM 6000 B epifluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems) and Hamamatsu Orca-ER camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) using Openlab 4.0.4 (Improvision Ltd.). Images were captured as tif files and imported into Adobe Photoshop, where they were adjusted (e.g. brightness/contrast enhancement, cropping) and assembled into figures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DOM did all of the experiments and prepared the first draft of the paper.
