The changes in the expression of the PLZF gene of cultured HCECs were investigated at different times after cell-cell contacts were disrupted by incubation with EDTA. The cell proliferation rate was assessed with a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system after cultured HCECs were infected with either PLZF or LacZ encoding adenovirus vector (Ad-PLZF or Ad-LacZ).

On the other hand, the expression of the mRNA of PLZF decreased about 20 fold 3 h after EDTA exposure, and gradually returned to the original level as the cell-cell contacts were reformed at 72 h after the exposure. The assessment using the RT-CES system showed that the proliferation of cultured HCECs was inhibited for up to 72 h when infected by Ad-PLZF.

It is widely accepted that corneal endothelial cells do not proliferate in humans once the endothelial monolayer is formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. It is also known that the density of human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) decreases by approximately 0.5% per year throughout life, and that the enlargement of the remaining cells compensates for this reduction to maintain corneal endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. In addition, a variety of injuries such as surgical stress during intraocular surgery, corneal trauma, and viral infections often cause an extensive reduction in the number of corneal endothelial cells, which can result in corneal endothelial dysfunction known as bullous keratopathy. Although penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and other modern surgical procedures, including deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK), stripping and automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK), can restore vision in such patients, it would be more beneficial to regulate the proliferation of corneal endothelial cells by manipulating cell cycles.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that HCECs are arrested in the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle in vivo rather than resting in the G<sub>0</sub> phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. In fact, HCECs have been shown to possess a strong potential to proliferate depending upon the age they are cultured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Among the anti-mitotic factors associated with the G<sub>1</sub> arrest of the HCECs, transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;2 (TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>) is known to block the G<sub>1</sub>-S transition by blocking the phosphorylation of p27<sup>kip1</sup>, which is required for the nuclear export of the inhibitory molecules for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. The mechanisms involved in the cell cycling and proliferation of HCECs however have not been fully determined as yet.</p><p>In searching for a cell cycling mechanism, we focused on DNA binding transcriptional factors, including the members of the BTB/POZ-zinc finger protein family. The BTB/POZ-zinc finger proteins are sequence-specific transcriptional repressors characterized by a BTB/POZ domain, which is responsible for transcriptional repression, and a zinc finger domain that forms the DNA binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Among the family members, the <italic>PLZF</italic> gene was first identified by its fusion to the retinoid acid receptor (RAR) alpha locus in a therapy-resistant form of acute promyelocytic leukemia associated with the t(11;17) translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. <italic>PLZF</italic> is a sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional repressor that suppresses the transcription of genes such as <italic>cyclin A2</italic> and <italic>c-myc</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. In addition to these genes, it has been reported that pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (Pbx1) can be a target gene for PLZF to suppress melanoma cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p><p>In preliminary experiments, we investigated the expression pattern of several members of the BTB/POZ-zinc finger protein family that were considered to be negative regulators in the cycling of HCECs. Interestingly, the expression level of the mRNA of PLZF alone was found to vary according to the state of the cell-cell contact. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the sequential changes in the expression of the mRNA of PLZF in HCECs in the primary culture and after EDTA exposure. In addition, we examined what role PLZF plays in the proliferation of HCECs using an adenovirus vector carrying genes encoding PLZF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Media and culture conditions</title><p>All primary and passaged HCECs were cultured in a media consisting of Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 30 mg/l of L-glutamine, 2.5 mg/l of Fungizone (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY), 2.5 mg/l of doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St.Louis, MO), and 2 &#x003bc;g/ml of basic fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].

Human tissue was used in strict accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The corneoscleral buttons were stored in Optisol (Chiron, Irvine, CA) at 4 &#x000b0;C and were cultured within 10 days of enucleation. Small explants from the endothelial layer, including Descemet's membrane, were removed with sterile surgical forceps and cultured in 35 mm culture dishes coated with mouse collagen type IV (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).</p><p>When a sufficient density of proliferating cells was attained, the cultured HCECs were rinsed three times in Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS<sup>-</sup>), trypsinized for 2 min at 37 &#x000b0;C, and passaged at ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:4, depending on the number of proliferating colonies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. All subsequent passages were carried out using the same method, but at a ratio of 1:6. The approximate time to confluence after each passaging was 6 to 8 days. We used cultured human corneal endothelial cells at the fifth passage for the experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from HCECs and cultured HCECs using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).

Thus, in earlier studies, an enhanced expression of PLZF led to the suppression of proliferation in some cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. In murine 32Dcl3 cells, the cell cycling profiles of over-expressing PLZF were significantly altered, and up to 80% of the cells accumulated in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase with a significantly smaller proportion of cells than in the S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>].</p><p>Our results showed that, among the different members of the BTB/POZ-zinc finger family, PLZF was the only gene that varied in association with the alterations of HCECs. Thus, PLZF was not expressed in HCECs in the proliferative phase and was later expressed when the cultured cells reached confluency. We also found that the expression of the PLZF mRNA was profoundly decreased when the cell-cell contact was disrupted by EDTA treatment, and mRNA expression returned to the original level as the cell-cell contact was reformed. These changes in the expression pattern suggest that PLZF gene expression may be regulated by cell-cell contact and related to the proliferation of HCECs. In fact, our results are quite consistent with recent reports in which EDTA-exposed corneal endothelial cells were released from contact inhibition and subsequently proliferated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Another study has shown that the cell-cell contact-induced inhibition is mediated, at least in part, by p27<sup>kip1</sup> because the p27<sup>kip1</sup> protein level is 20 times higher in confluent rat corneal endothelial cells than in subconfluent cells. In addition, the level of the p27<sup>kip1</sup> protein is substantially lower in EDTA-treated confluent cells than in untreated control cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Although the link between PLZF and p27<sup>kip1</sup> has not been determined, both genes presumably contribute to the contact inhibition of HCECs.</p><p>The cell adhesion molecules expressed in corneal endothelial cells are ZO-1, connexin-43, and cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Among these, the cadherins are major intercellular adhesion molecules that mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion through homophilic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that a breakdown in the cadherin-mediated cell adhesion activates a &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated intracellular signaling pathway, inducing the expression of a set of genes, including cyclin D1, c-myc, and c-jun, that are critical for cell proliferation and cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>].</p><p>We have examined the expression of cadherin family mRNA in cultured HCECs and in vivo HCECs, and N-cadherin was found to be the major cadherin in HCECs. In addition, the expression of N-cadherin increased in proliferating HCECs before the expression of PLZF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). We have hypothesized that N-cadherin and its downstream signaling pathways are the candidate molecules involved in the regulation of the expression of the <italic>PLZF</italic> gene. Currently, experiments are being carried out in our laboratory to test this hypothesis.</p><p>The involvement of PLZF in suppressing the proliferation of cultured HCECs has been clearly demonstrated by infection of the <italic>PLZF</italic> gene in HCECs. The degree of the suppression was not as high as in murine 32Dcl3 cells, but considering an infection efficiency of 24% at an MOI of 100 with the Ad-GFP vector, an over-expression of PLZF led to a relatively high degree of suppression of the proliferation of HCECs. In addition, TSC-22 was found to be increased in HCECs which over-expressed the <italic>PLZF</italic> gene according to the DNA microarray analysis. TSC-22, a leucine zipper transcriptional factor, was found to be an immediate-early target gene of TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>] and has the characteristics of a suppressor of cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. Moreover, TSC-22 binds to and modulates the transcriptional activity of Smad3 and Smad4, and it enhances TGF&#x003b2; signaling by associating with Smad4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. Evidence has been showing that TGF&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> is present in high concentrations in normal aqueous humor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>], and it suppresses the proliferation of rabbit and rat corneal endothelial cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. Thus, <italic>TSC-22</italic> might be involved as a target gene for PLZF in suppressing HCEC proliferation in accordance with TGF&#x003b2; signaling pathway. This hypothesis, however, needs further investigation.</p><p>We have also examined the expression of PLZF mRNA in the corneal endothelial cells obtained from three patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome (ICE syndrome). Interestingly, the relative expression of the mRNA of PLZF in ICE syndrome was lower than in normal controls by real-time PCR. In particular, the expression of PLZF mRNA was undetectable in Chandler's syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). These findings suggest that the absence of the <italic>PLZF</italic> gene may lead to the abnormal proliferation of corneal endothelial cells, a hallmark of the ICE syndrome.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the mRNA of PLZF was closely associated with cell-cell contact phenomenon of human corneal endothelial cells. Further studies are needed to clarify the correlation of the <italic>PLZF</italic> gene with the intracellular signals governed by TGF-beta and with the expression of the cell adhesion molecule such as cadherin. As PLZF is normally expressed in the human corneal endothelium, it can serve as a possible target to modulate cell proliferation. It may be possible in the future to treat patients with severe corneal endothelial damage if the key factor regulating the expression of the <italic>PLZF</italic> gene and the genes regulated by PLZF are identified.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Y.
