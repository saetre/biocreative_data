The Arp2/3 complex is required in the formation of dendritic networks to provide sites for <italic>de novo </italic>nucleation of actin filaments and to form branch points from existing filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The mammalian Arp2/3 complex can be activated downstream of Rho family small GTPases by several known interacting proteins, in particular members of the Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein Family (haematopoietic WASP, ubiquitous <italic>N</italic>-WASP, and Scar/WAVE 1, 2, and 3 [Suppressor of Cyclic AMP Receptor mutation/Wiskott Aldrich VErprolin homologous protein]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Homology between these proteins consists of a core proline rich region, and C-terminal WH2 (Wiskott Homology 2) and Acidic (A) domains, of which the WH2 and A domains together are sufficient to activate the Arp2/3 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>N</italic>-WASP and the Scar/WAVE proteins differ the most at the amino-terminus, designated the Wiskott-Homology 1 (WH1) domain and the Scar/WAVE homology domain (SHD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Regulation of WASP-family proteins involves many interactions and is still the subject of intensive research. WASP and N-WASP are found in an inhibitory complex with WIP/CR16 proteins and can be activated by the small GTPase Cdc42 and a co-activating protein TOCA-1, recently described by Ho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in the N-terminal half of WASP/N-WASP can also enhance the activation and perhaps serve to prolong its duration ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). Original reports had suggested that WASP/N-WASP were autoinhibited in their pure form, but whether this form is ever present in cells is unclear, so the physiological relevance of autoinhibition is unclear as well ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). Recombinant Scar/WAVE proteins were constitutively active toward Arp2/3 complex <italic>in vitro</italic>, but have been postulated to be regulated by the small GTPase Rac <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In 2002, Eden et al purified Scar/WAVE1 from bovine brain extracts in association with a complex of four other proteins; p140-SRA1, p125 Nck-Associated Protein (NckAP1), HSPC300, and Abi2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. They proposed a model whereby active Rac could bind to p140-SRA1 and cause it plus NckAP1 and Abi2 to dissociate, releasing active Scar/WAVE in a complex with HSPC300.</p><p>Some of the members of this so-called "Scar/WAVE complex" had been previously studied by other groups and implicated in signalling. SRA1 (also called Cytoplasmic FMRP Interacting protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]) is a Rac associated protein which also binds to the SH3 domain containing adapter protein Nck, and the Fragile-X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. NckAP1 also interacts with active Rac and Nck, although the interaction appears to be indirect in both cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. HSPC300 is a small, ubiquitously expressed, uncharacterised Haematopoeitc Stem/Progenitor Cell protein, bearing considerable homology to the Maize actin cytoskeletal associated protein Brk1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Abi2 (Abl interactor 2) is a neuronally expressed SH3 domain containing protein associated with Abl tyrosine kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It has a close relative, Abi1, also referred to as e3B1 (eps8 binding protein 1) in early literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Since Eden et al., a similar complex has also been isolated in association with Scar/WAVE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This complex contains the more ubiquitously expressed Abi1 (as opposed to Abi2) consistent with the more ubiquitous expression of Scar/WAVE 2 compared to the other Scar/WAVE isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In these studies, the complex does not dissociate upon Rac activation and is not inhibitory during <italic>in vitro </italic>actin polymerisation assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Recombinant Abi1 is rather found to increase the Arp2/3 complex activating ability of recombinant Scar/WAVE 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Following these studies, the mechanism for regulation of the different Scar/WAVE proteins has been called into question. It has been proposed that differences between Eden et al. and the other two studies may be due to experimental conditions or to genuine differences between Scar/WAVE isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Knockdown of Abi1, SRA1 and NckAP1 in mammalian tissue culture cells causes severe defects in formation of lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], similar to loss of Scar/WAVE 2 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Mutations or RNAi knockdown of the only <italic>Drosophila </italic>Scar/WAVE protein severely affects the ability of cultured cells to produce lamellipodia, ruffles and filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Mutational and RNAi studies used to produce <italic>Drosophila </italic>cells deficient in the NckAP1 homologue, Kette, reveal a lack of actin based protrusions in the absence of functional protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. RNAi knockdown of <italic>Drosophila </italic>Abi1 and SRA1 also prevents the formation lamellipodia in tissue culture cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>knock out of Scar protein exhibits severe defects in chemotaxis and motility, but cells can still extend pseudopods and migrate directionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], whereas knockout of the <italic>PirA </italic>gene encoding an homologue of SRA1 causes an excessive lamellipodial protrusion phenotype, thought to be due to unregulated Scar protein activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>While the Scar/WAVE complex is currently thought to be the most likely regulator of Scar/WAVE activity in cells, several other Scar/WAVE binding proteins have been identified and proposed to regulate its activity. IRSp53, for example, binds to Scar/WAVE2 and also to Rac and was proposed to be a Scar/WAVE2 regulator prior to Eden et al. ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]). It was unclear whether IRSp53 binding was specific to Scar/WAVE 2, or ubiquitous among the Scar/WAVEs and where/when Scar/WAVE was associated with IRSp53 as opposed to the other binding partners. IRSp53 is also a scaffold protein, with several partners, raising the possibility of at least two different types of large protein complexes in association with Scar/WAVE proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>Scar/WAVE3 is the most tissue-specific of the three mammalian Scar/WAVE isoforms, being found in haematopoietic cells and brain tissue, but not yet being characterised in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. It has not previously been shown whether Scar/WAVE3 interacts with either Abi1/2 or HSPC300. This report presents data indicating that the interaction of Scar/WAVE proteins with Abi1, HSPC300 and IRSp53 is conserved among all three Scar/WAVE proteins, suggesting that multiple different protein complexes likely exist in cells that contain different Scar/WAVE isoforms. This observation suggests that the different Scar/WAVE isoforms are not regulated by exclusive participation in specific complexes, but rather that the regulation is likely to be more subtle, at the level of affinity or modifications/binding partners not yet discovered. Alternatively, Scar/WAVEs may have largely overlapping functions when present in the same cell type, although there is already some evidence against this idea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Association of the Scar/WAVE complex with Scar/WAVE 3</title><p>Protein sequence conservation between the three Scar/WAVE proteins in the N-terminal Scar Homology Domain (SHD) indicates a potential for association of binding partners with all three members of the family. Scar/WAVE1 and 2 have been shown to associate with the key adapter protein Abi1 through the SHD, so it is possible that Abi1 would also associate with Scar/WAVE3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To test for an interaction between Scar/WAVE3 and Abi1, immunoprecipitations were performed with antibodies recognising Abi1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and antibodies recognising Scar/WAVE3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Anti-Abi1 immunoprecipitates co-precipitate Scar/WAVE1 and 3 with endogenous Abi1 from mouse brain extracts, while Abi1, Scar/WAVE1 and Scar/WAVE3 are not present in immunoprecipitates with an unrelated control antibody or without antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Abi1 also co-immunoprecipitates with Scar3, but is not detected in the absence of antibody or in unrelated control immunoprecipitates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Since Abi1 is thought to bind directly to Scar/WAVE proteins and to connect them with the rest of the Scar/WAVE complex, interaction with Abi1 is a strong indicator Scar/WAVE3 associates in an analogous complex to Scar/WAVE1 and 2 isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Co-immunoprecipitation of Scar3 and Abi1 from mouse brain extract.

HA-Abi1 precipitated with each of the three SHDs, but not in the absence of antibody or Myc-SHD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

An ability to bind to IRSp53 is conserved between all three human members of the Scar/WAVE family, although the binding appears to be strongest for Scar/WAVE2. Conservation of this interaction may indicate that all three Scar/WAVE proteins are regulated by common mechanisms, but the increased binding of Scar/WAVE2 to IRSp53 highlights the possibility that differing affinities for binding partners between the three Scar/WAVE isoforms may affect their roles in cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>IRSp53 interacts with Scar/WAVE1, 2 and 3.

Myc-Scar/WAVE 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Di</xref>), and 3 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Fi</xref>) SHD also co-localises with HA-HSPC300 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Dii, 6Fii</xref>) in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and particularly strongly at areas of ruffles, shown as yellow in merge images (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Diii, 6Fiii</xref>). All three human isoforms behave the same in the presence of HSPC300 consistent with a conservation of the interaction between Scar/WAVEs and HSPC300.</p><p>HA-Abi1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Cii</xref>) strongly co localises with Myc-Scar 1 SHD (yellow, Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Ciii</xref>), in unidentified punctate spots (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Ci</xref>). Myc-Scar 2 SHD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Ei</xref>) shows a similar co localisation with Abi1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Eii</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6iii</xref>), whilst Myc-Scar 3 SHD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Gi</xref>) shows partial co-localisation to Abi1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Gii</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6iii</xref>). Although Myc-Scar3 SHD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Gi</xref>) co-localises to the HA-Abi1 spots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Giii</xref>) to a lesser extent than Scar/WAVE1 and 2 SHD, leaving some diffuse staining in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Abi1 expression affects the localisation of all three human Scar/WAVE isoforms in Cos7 cells, providing further evidence for a role of the Scar/WAVE complex in regulation of the activity and localisation of Scar/WAVE proteins. The staining pattern seen for overexpressed HA-Abi1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Aii, Cii, Eii</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Gii</xref>) does not strongly correlate with the cellular localisation of endogenous Abi1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5Cii</xref>). Although the punctuate staining pattern seen in cells over-expressing Abi1 has been described as being characteristic of the reticulovesicular system (Ziemnicka-Kotula, 1998), it is also possible that these spots are protein aggregates induced by overexpression of Abi1. The relocalisation of Scar/WAVE1, 2 and 3 SHDs to these vesicles or aggregates may or may not be biologically important, but it does demonstrate the possibility that Abi1 can affect Scar/WAVE protein localisation in cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We show that Abi1 and HSPC300 interact with three human Scar/WAVE isoforms, via the Scar Homology Domain. Conservation of Abi1 binding between all three Scar/WAVEs is indicative of the association of the "Scar/WAVE complex" with all three isoforms, as Abi1 seems to be the link between Scar/WAVE and NckAP1 and SRA-1/PIR121 in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Association of the complex with all three Scar/WAVE proteins is a possibility, as all the complex members are widely expressed throughout the body and seem to be found in all tissues where a Scar/WAVE protein is expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>Little is known about the role of Scar/WAVE3 in cells. Expression of the mammalian Scar/WAVE3 gene is largely limited to the brain and lung with relatively little expression in other adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The major suggestion has been a role in lamellipodial and filopodial protrusion indicated by localisation in neuronal growth cones and interaction with the Arp2/3 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Association with a Abi1-NckAP1-SRA1 does indicate a further potential role for Scar/WAVE3 in lamellipodial protrusion given the requirement for these proteins in the ruffling process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Scar/WAVE3 is also implicated as a potential tumour suppressor protein in some ganglioneuroblastomas when the gene is down-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>The role of interaction of HSPC300 with the Scar/WAVE3 complex is unknown. Loss of function of the <italic>brk1 </italic>gene product, the Maize homologue of HSPC300, causes aberrations in cellular morphology and filamentous actin distribution of leaf epidermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This could indicate a role in regulating the localisation of actin polymerisation machinery, but this idea awaits further testing. HSPC300 is also implicated in the frequency of occurrence of renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Association of all three Scar/WAVE isoforms with an Abi-NckAP1-SRA1 complex may show that there is some functional redundancy between Scar/WAVE family members but data from mice deficient in a Scar/WAVE isoform indicates that Scar/WAVE1 and 2 do not have completely overlapping functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The identification of specific binding partners for Scar/WAVE1, such as WRP, BAD or the RII subunit of PKA suggests a potential for differing roles between Scar/WAVE proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. The conservation of the Abi1-NckAP1-SRA1 complex between three Scar/WAVE isoforms suggests that regulation of individual Scar/WAVE proteins is likely to involve components that we have not yet studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Other proteins that associate with the complex may perform this regulation, or tissue specificity may occur between the complexes formed where differentially expressed related proteins, such as Abi1 or 2, bind to alternative Scar/WAVE isoforms with different affinities. Further study of the Scar/WAVE family and associated proteins will be required to fully understand the true roles and mechanisms of function of these complexes in cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that Scar/WAVE3 is likely to participate in similar signalling complexes to Scar/WAVE1 and 2 and that the differences between these Scar/WAVE proteins is likely to be at the level of tissue expression, differences in affinity for certain binding partners and possibly interaction with yet undiscovered binding partners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and chemicals</title><p>All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, UK unless otherwise specified.
