While JC virus is highly prevalent in the human population, PML is a rare disease that exclusively afflicts only a small percentage of immunocompromised individuals including those affected by HIV (AIDS) or immunosuppressive drugs. Viral- and/or host-specific factors, and not simply immune status, must be at play to account for the very large discrepancy between viral prevalence and low disease incidence. Here, we show that several amino acids on the surface of the JC virus capsid protein VP1 display accelerated evolution in viral sequences isolated from PML patients but not in sequences isolated from healthy subjects. We provide strong evidence that at least some of these mutations are involved in binding of sialic acid, a known receptor for the JC virus. Using statistical methods of molecular evolution, we performed a comprehensive analysis of JC virus VP1 sequences isolated from 55 PML patients and 253 sequences isolated from the urine of healthy individuals and found that a subset of amino acids found exclusively among PML VP1 sequences is acquired via adaptive evolution. By modeling of the 3-D structure of the JC virus capsid, we showed that these residues are located within the sialic acid binding site, a JC virus receptor for cell infection. Finally, we go on to demonstrate the involvement of some of these sites in receptor binding by demonstrating a profound reduction in hemagglutination properties of viral-like particles made of the VP1 protein carrying these mutations. Collectively, these results suggest that a more virulent PML causing phenotype of JC virus is acquired via adaptive evolution that changes viral specificity for its cellular receptor(s).</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>JC virus is a highly prevalent human polyomavirus. Infection with this virus is generally benign and asymptomatic despite viral persistence in the kidney of many people. However, in immunocompromised individuals, very rarely, the infection can progress to become a potentially deadly brain disease called Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). The discrepancy between very high viral prevalence and low incidence of PML suggests that there could be some unique viral characteristics that regulate the progression from the asymptomatic infection to the PML. Identification of such factors will help us to understand the basis of PML development and hopefully will lead to the creation of new diagnostic and treatment tools for managing PML. In this work, we demonstrate that the part of the viral surface protein that is thought to be responsible for viral interaction with cellular receptors and infection acquires specific mutations that appear to be critical for the development of PML. These mutations are found more frequently than by simple chance and therefore are thought to be &#x0201c;positively selected.&#x0201d; Based on these results, we hypothesize that the specific mutations in the viral VP1 protein that we have identified are critical for the evolution of JC virus to the version associated with PML.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>JC virus (JCV) is highly prevalent in the human population with over 70&#x00025; of people showing anti-JCV antibody responses and up to 40&#x00025; of the population displaying persistent viral shedding in the urine (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Knowles1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). These epidemiological data indicate that the virus establishes chronic infection in a large fraction of the human population. Though normally asymptomatic, factors leading to immune deficiency, such as HIV or immunosuppressive drug therapy, can trigger an uncontrolled infection and replication of JCV in oligodendrocytes causing their death and resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Despite such a high infection rate and viral occurrence, JC virus causes PML in a very small fraction of immune deficient patients, including 4&#x02013;5&#x00025; of AIDS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Berger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and less than 1&#x00025; of patients with lymphoproliferative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-GarciaSuarez1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. No pharmaceutical treatment option for PML currently exists and the only chance for patient survival is afforded by reconstitution of the patient's own immune response via HAART in AIDS or via drug tapering in pharmaceutically immunocompromised individuals. Identification of genetic and environmental risk factors influencing the development of PML is of great importance both for finding of therapeutic interventions and for the development of early diagnostic methods to help reducing the risks associated with immunosuppressive therapies.</p><p>Both host and viral genetics may contribute to PML.

Changes in the affinity and specificity of the virus for its cellular receptor(s) affect viral infectivity and transmission, hence playing a crucial role in virulence. For example, a study of the mouse polyomavirus showed that VP1 amino acid changes rather than changes in the non-coding regulatory region are responsible for the increased pathogenicity of the virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Dubensky1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Freund1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Consequently, we focused on VP1 protein and its relationship to PML. We relied on methods of molecular evolution to determine the presence of putative adaptive changes in the VP1 amino acid sequence associated with PML. The advantage of this approach over simple statistical association of sequence variants with the disease, is that it takes into account the phylogenetic relationship of viral strains and also allows identification of functionally significant amino acid positions by examining the rate of sequence evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>JCV <italic>VP1</italic> gene sequences were downloaded from GenBank (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000368.s002">Table S1</xref>) and used to construct a phylogenetic tree for a random subset of sequences isolated from healthy individual and full-length sequences isolated from distinct PML patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000368-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

It is possible that those residues went undetected by the PAML analysis due to the small sample size and that the development of PML is accompanied by positive selection for amino acids involved in sialic acid binding in a majority of cases. The length of the phylogenetic tree in our analysis is short thus limiting power to detect positive selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Anisimova1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Anisimova2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, additional PML-specific VP1 mutations can also be positive selected. Mutations at residue 107 are also found exclusively in the PML sample. However, it did not show evidence of positive selection according to PAML and is not located in the sialic acid binding pocket.</p><p>In order to experimentally verify the role that these substitutions play in sialic acid binding by the VP1 capsid, we recombinantly produced viral like particles (VLP) from VP1 protein encoded by several different naturally occurring viruses. We generated VLPs from viral <italic>VP1</italic> sequences encoding substitutions with one of the two strongest signals of positive selection identified by PAML, one with phenylalanine at position 269 (F269) and another one with phenylalanine at position 55 (F55). As controls we used two different <italic>VP1</italic> genes that do not harbor any of the identified PML-associated mutations, one from a healthy individual (WT) and another one from a PML patient (Mad-1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000368.s004">Table S3</xref>). Viral hemagglutination of red blood cells (RBCs) has been shown to be a reliable measure of sialic acid binding by polyomaviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Freund1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Liu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We tested all four VLPs in a hemagglutination assay. Strikingly, both F55 and F269 variants displayed more than 8000-fold lower HA activity than either control VLP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000368-t002">Table 2</xref>). Specifically, the F55 variant completely failed to agglutinate human type O RBCs even at 200 &#x000b5;g/ml, the highest concentration tested, and the F269 variant displayed very low HA activity as it caused hemagglutination only at concentrations above 25 &#x000b5;g/ml. At the same time both L55 and S269 carrying variants (WT and Mad-1) caused hemagglutination of RBCs at concentrations down to 0.375 ng/ml and 6.25 ng/ml, correspondingly. We note that the F55 mutant has the single amino acid difference with its corresponding wild type variant (WT). Therefore the change in hemagglutination can be specifically attributed to this amino acid replacement. In addition to the change in position 269 the F269 mutant variant has two additional amino acid positions that are different from its corresponding control variant (Mad-1). Both of those amino acid changes are not PML specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000368.s004">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000368.s003">Table S2</xref>) and are unlikely to explain the difference in hemagglutination. While the Mad-1 isolate had originated from a PML patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Padgett1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> it does not contain any of the PML-specific mutation which correlates well with its ability to hemagglutinate RBCs. The lack of PML-genic mutations in this PML isolate suggests that VP1 mutations are not an exclusive mechanism leading to PML development.</p><table-wrap id="pgen-1000368-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000368.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Residues 55 and 269 in VP1 protein play very important role in hemagglutination of RBCs by Viral Like Particles (VLPs).</title></caption><graphic id="pgen-1000368-t002-2" xlink:href="pgen.1000368.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pgen-1000368-t002-2"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Viral variant</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimum HA VLP concentration, ng/ml</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WT1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55F</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;200,000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WT2 (Mad-1)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">269F</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50,000</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt102"><label/><p>Hemagglutination was conducted as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> using serial dilutions of VLPs starting from 200 &#x000b5;g/ml.

Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that changes in glycan specificity would allow JCV to loose its specificity to sialated glycans expressed outside of the CNS (e.g. RBCs). Thus, such a virus would avoid getting trapped on &#x0201c;pseudoreceptors&#x0201d; in the periphery and travel unhindered from sites of viral shedding to enter the brain. Mutated virus must still maintain its specificity to glycans expressed on oligodendrocytes. This would be consistent with the observation from the mouse polyomavirus model where a mutation in a position orthologous to position 269 of JCV affected viral ability to bind RBCs and also lead to the dramatic increase in viral dissemination through the animal with a lethal outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Dubensky1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Freund1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, there are several reports of JCV detection in tonsils of many asymptomatically infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Kato2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Monaco1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this observation was taken as a support for the JCV infection of tonsil cells, it could be alternatively explained by the viral trapping in lymphoid tissues. That would be consistent with JCV binding to sialic acid in the tonsil tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Eash1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An alternative but not mutually exclusive hypothesis would be that PML associated <italic>VP1</italic> mutations increase JCV tropism for brain white matter cells leading to the increased viral infectivity and replication in oligodendrocytes. Finally, another non-mutually exclusive explanation of the role these mutations in PML might be immune-escape by the virus. It is theoretically possible that out of the polyclonal immune response directed against the VP1 molecule only a limited number of antibodies directed against the cell receptor binding site (i.e. sialic acid) would provide protection against the spread of the viral infection. Mutation of an amino acid within an epitope crucial for the protective immunity could allow virus to bind to its target cells and spread uninhibited. Given the large number of mutations that are specific for PML it is likely that not a single mechanism but rather a multiplicity plays a role in PML etiology in different PML cases.</p><p>How do these mutations occur in PML and why, despite a very high prevalence of JCV, do only a small proportion of immune deficient patients develop PML? Absence of clustering of the mutations on the viral phylogenetic tree suggests that they arise independently in individual patients rather than persist in the general populations as pathogenic viral variants. It is worth noting that this hypothesis appears to be strongly supported by the original observation of Loeber and Dorries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Loeber1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> where the investigators reported the isolation of two viral strains from kidney and brain of the same PML patient. The genome of the virus isolated from the brain was almost identical to that isolated from the kidney with two exceptions; presence of phenylalanine instead of leucine in position 55 and a rearrangement of the regulatory region. Previously no significance could be attached to the L55F mutation and that observation led to the generation of the hypothesis on the sole importance of viral control region rearrangement in &#x0201c;PML-genic&#x0201d; adaptation of the virus. Based on our findings we would like to propose that <italic>VP1</italic> mutations play a very significant role in the mechanism of PML emergence. Once a specific mutation affecting sialic acid binding occurs it allows virus to spread to the brain and infect oligodendrocytes. The fact that the mutant virus was not detected in the kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000368-Loeber1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> may suggest that that particular change in glycan binding does not offer any selective advantage to the mutated virus in kidney. The mutations might have occurred and hence allowed the virus to establish the residence in the brain under the conditions of immune suppression shortly or long before the PML. Since no viral replication was detected in brains of asymptomatic individuals we believe it is unlikely that compartmentalized evolution (i.e. intra CNS) prior to PML development could account for the presence of mutated VP1 in CNS of PML patients. However, the issue of JCV latency in normal brain still remains controversial so it is still formally possible that non-mutated virus had entered the brain and mutations arose in the brain and not periphery, e.g. kidney.</p><p>It appears that the healthy immune system effectively controls viral activation in the brain. However, as soon as the immune system fails in the misfortunate individual harboring such a mutated virus, the virus begins actively proliferating in oligodendrocytes causing PML. It is also possible that a healthy immune system efficiently suppresses newly developed mutants in their peripheral site (e.g. kidney) and prevents them from spreading and infecting new target cells. Thus the timing of PML development may be mutation limited and the interplay with environmental or host genetic factors contributed to the non-deterministic development of PML. Alternatively, PML development may be controlled by interactions of <italic>VP1</italic> mutations with additional genetic alterations of the virus including rearrangement of the viral regulatory region as it might give the virus additional selective advantage in increasing viral replication in oligodendrocytes.</p><p>Altogether our findings suggest that JCV <italic>VP1</italic> mutations affecting its receptor specificity may be responsible for PML pathology. These results pave the way for the discovery of novel anti-polyomavirus therapeutics and diagnostics of diseases caused by these viruses. The exact role that these mutations play in etiology of PML as well as how and where they arise requires further extensive investigation that would involve VP1 sequence analysis of longitudinal and time matching samples from different organs (e.g. urine, blood, CSF) and from a variety of PML patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Sequence Analysis</title><p>35 full length <italic>VP1</italic> sequences of JC viruses isolated from PML patients and 253 full length <italic>VP1</italic> sequences of JC viruses isolated from healthy subjects were downloaded from Genbank.
