By Northern blot analysis, the embryonic RNA class shows a broad RNA band of hybridization of 1.3 kb and a more sharply defined, less abundant RNA band at 1.6 kb. The thoracic class of RNAs, on the other hand, consists of a broad hybridization band at 1.7 kb and a more sharply defined band at 1.9 kb. Each size class of RNA encodes a different tropomyosin isoform. The two classes of alternatively spliced RNAs utilize the same 3' terminal exon of the gene. The DNA sequence of this exon reveals a cluster of several polyadenylation signals (AAUAAA) or polyadenylation-like signals. We show here by S1 nuclease protection analysis that at least five and possibly seven of these polyadenylation or polyadenylation-like sequences are associated with in vivo embryonic and thoracic mRNA cleavage processing sites. Six of these S1 sites are clustered within 119 bp and a seventh is located 255 bp downstream. At least one of the polyadenylation-like signal sequences appears to be an unusual AACAAA sequence. In addition we also show that these mRNAs function in vitro to synthesize muscle tropomyosins.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0333-a" xlink:role="1766"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0335-a" xlink:role="1768"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0338-a" xlink:role="1771"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0339-a" xlink:role="1772"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0330.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1763"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0331.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1764"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0332.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1765"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0333.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1766"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0334.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1767"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0335.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1768"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0336.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1769"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0337.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1770"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0338.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1771"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0339.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1772"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0340.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1773"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0341.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1774"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0342.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1775"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0343.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1776"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
