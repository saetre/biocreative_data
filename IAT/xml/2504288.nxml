In addition, a distinct process called large loop repair (LLR) corrects heteroduplexes up to several hundred nucleotides in bacteria, yeast and human cells, and in cell-free extracts. Only some LLR protein components are known, however. Previous studies with neutralizing antibodies suggested a role for yeast DNA polymerase &#x003b4; (Pol &#x003b4;), RFC and PCNA in LLR repair synthesis. In the current study, biochemical fractionation studies identified FEN1 (Rad27) as another required LLR component. In the presence of purified FEN1, Pol &#x003b4;, RFC and PCNA, repair occurred on heteroduplexes with loops ranging from 8 to 216 nt. Repair utilized a 5&#x02032; nick, with correction directed to the nicked strand, irrespective of which strand contained the loop. In contrast, repair of a G/T mismatch occurred at low levels, suggesting specificity of the reconstituted system for looped mispairs. The presence of RPA enhanced reactivity on some looped substrates, but RPA was not required for activity. Although additional LLR factors remain to be identified, the excision and resynthesis steps of LLR from a 5&#x02032; nick can be reconstituted in a purified system with FEN1 and Pol &#x003b4;, together with PCNA and its loader RFC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are capable of repairing DNA loop mismatches ranging from one to over 5000 nt in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">1&#x02013;8</xref>). Two major pathways are involved in the correction of these heterologies: mismatch repair (MMR) and large loop repair (LLR). Although there appears to be some substrate overlap between the two, MMR corrects loops of 1 to &#x0223c;8&#x02013;17 nt, depending on the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">9&#x02013;14</xref>). The bacterial MMR system consisting of the MutS, MutL, MutH and UvrD proteins can efficiently repair loops up to about 4 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Although heterologies from 5 to 8 nt are also repaired, the efficiency decreases as the loop size increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Eukaryotic MMR uses the MutS homolog (MSHs) and the MutL homologs (MLHs). In yeast and humans, MMR can repair loops up to &#x0223c;16&#x02013;17 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). As in bacteria, repair efficiency decreases with increasing loop size.</p><p>The poorly defined LLR pathway corrects loops larger than those repaired by MMR and has been reported in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, yeast and mammalian cells. <italic>In vivo</italic> evidence for LLR in <italic>E. coli</italic> includes transfection experiments showing that MMR-deficient bacteria can repair a heteroduplex containing a 800-nt loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments using extracts deficient in the MutH, MutL and MutS proteins demonstrated correction of loops up to 429 nt in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Transformation, microinjection and gene targeting experiments using mouse and monkey cells revealed that mammalian cells can repair loops as large as 2.8 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies using extracts from human cells have indicated that loops as large as 993 nt can be repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Extracts deficient in the mismatch repair proteins Msh2, Msh6, Mlh1, Pms2, the nucleotide excision repair proteins XPA, XPG, XPF/ERCC4 and ERCC1, and in Werner syndrome protein (WRN) are proficient at rectifying large loops, which suggests they may be dispensable for LLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). To date, none of the proteins involved in the repair of large loops in <italic>E. coli</italic> or mammalian cells has been identified.</p><p>The capacity of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to repair large loops is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26">21&#x02013;26</xref>). However, LLR in yeast appears to be a complex process, as three distinct LLR pathways have been described. Two of these pathways appear to function only during meiotic LLR. One meiotic LLR pathway that can repair heterologies as large as 5.6 kb employs the MMR proteins Msh2 and Msh3 and the NER endonucleases Rad1 and Rad10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). A second meiotic pathway has been postulated since meiotic LLR still occurs in strains in which <italic>RAD1</italic> is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The third LLR pathway functions in proliferating cells, and it has been demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> and in nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Although these studies did not identify the proteins involved in mitotic LLR, the use of deletion mutants suggested that Msh2, Msh3, Mlh1, Pms1, Rad1, Rad2 and Rad27 may be dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Based on neutralizing antibody experiments with yeast extracts, PCNA, DNA polymerase &#x003b4; (Pol &#x003b4;) and replication factor C (RFC) were implicated in DNA repair synthesis necessary for LLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). To identify additional LLR components, we fractionated extracts to look for proteins that reconstituted LLR when supplemented with purified PCNA, Pol &#x003b4; and RFC. Mass spectrometric analysis of such a fraction revealed the presence of flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1; Rad27p). Using purified proteins, we present evidence that FEN1, Pol &#x003b4;, PCNA and RFC are sufficient for 5&#x02032; nick-directed repair of heteroduplex substrates containing 8&#x02013;216 nt loops. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a biochemically defined system that can support LLR <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of DNA substrates</title><p>The substrates are summarized in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn446/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>. Heteroduplexes containing a G/T mismatch and unstructured loops of 8, 16, 27, 30, 45 and 216 nt were prepared from f1 bacteriophages as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Each substrate contained a site-specific nick generated by cleavage with <italic>Sau96I</italic> 114 bp 5&#x02032; to the loop. We use the following nomenclature to describe the substrates: C substrates contain a loop on the complementary strand of the heteroduplex, while V substrates contain a loop on the viral strand. The numeric descriptor indicates the number of unpaired bases. For example, C<sub>27</sub> refers to a substrate with a 27-nt loop on the outer complementary strand, while V<sub>27</sub> contains a 27-nt loop on the inner viral strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>C<sub>27</sub> and V<sub>27</sub> heteroduplex substrates used for <italic>in vitro</italic> large loop repair assays. The C<sub>27</sub> substrate (<bold>A</bold>) contains a 27-nt loop and a 5&#x02032; nick on the complementary (C) strand. An NheI site is on the strand containing the loop, while an EcoRI site is on the opposite strand. The presence of the loop renders the DNA resistant to digestion by either NheI or EcoRI. Therefore, double digests of ClaI with either NheI or EcoRI result in a full-length (6.4 kb) linear product. If repair of C<sub>27</sub> is targeted by the loop (top arrow) or by the nick (bottom arrow), both become sensitive to EcoRI. The V<sub>27</sub> substrate (<bold>B</bold>) contains a 27-nt loop on the viral (V) strand and a nick on the complementary strand. Loop-directed repair of V<sub>27</sub> results in loop removal and sensitivity to EcoRI. Nick-directed repair results in retention of the loop and sensitivity to NheI.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn446f1"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Nuclear extracts were prepared from strain DY6 (<italic>MATa ura3-52 leu2 trp1 prb1-1122 pep4-3 prc1-407</italic>) obtained from B.

For example, C<sub>27</sub> denotes a loop of 27 nt located on the C strand. All substrates contain a site-specific nick on the C strand 114 bp 5&#x02032; to the heterology. <italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in yeast have demonstrated the existence of two modes of correction of large loop heterologies: a loop-directed mode and a nick-directed mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In loop-directed repair, the loop is removed irrespective of the presence of a nick. In nick-directed repair, the strand containing the nick is the target for excision and resynthesis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, the nick and loop are both on the complementary strand of C<sub>27</sub>. Loop- and nick-directed repair therefore remove the loop to create the same EcoRI-sensitive product. In contrast, the nick and the loop are on opposite strands in the V<sub>27</sub> substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Loop-directed repair is detected as EcoRI sensitivity due to removal of the loop. Nick-directed repair, which results in retention of the loop, yields sensitivity to NheI. We use the terms loop removal and loop retention to denote these two possible outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast nuclear extracts and whole-cell lysates support LLR</title><p>Previous studies of LLR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> utilized nuclear extract preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). These studies showed that nuclear extracts efficiently repair unstructured loops of 16, 27, 30 and 216 nt. Although LLR activity is robust in nuclear extracts, limited quantities of protein are obtained, which hindered efforts to fractionate extracts. Instead, we utilized a simpler and more rapid method of preparing large amounts of whole-cell extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). These whole-cell extracts are active for LLR, with repair rates 42&#x02013;61% those in nuclear extracts on C<sub>27</sub> and V<sub>27</sub>, including both loop removal and loop retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Whole cell lysates were further tested on a range of heteroduplexes, including a G/T mismatch and loops of 8, 16, 30, 45 and 216 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Consistent with previously published data from nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), repair of the G/T mismatch and C<sub>8</sub> loop removal occurred at low levels in whole-cell extracts. In contrast, loop removal was much more efficient on C substrates of 27&#x02013;45 nt and V substrates of 16&#x02013;216 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, unfilled bars). Whole-cell extracts also exhibited substantial loop retention activity for V heteroduplexes from 8 to 216 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, filled bars). Consistent with an earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), the differential repair activity on larger loops, compared to G/T and C<sub>8</sub> substrates, suggest that the repair reaction is specific for large loops rather than the result of nonspecific heteroduplex clipping by nucleases. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Yeast nuclear extracts and whole-cell lysates support large loop repair.

Purified RPA was also included, although as shown later RPA is not essential for reconstitution. Chromatography of whole-cell extracts over Q Sepharose produced a fraction, eluted with 100 mM NaCl (Q<sub>100</sub>), that was devoid of LLR activity on both C<sub>27</sub> and V<sub>27</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The addition of purified Pol &#x003b4;, PCNA, RFC and RPA resulted in high levels of C<sub>27</sub> loop removal and V<sub>27</sub> loop retention activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). V<sub>27</sub> loop removal was not observed in the Q<sub>100</sub> fraction, even with addition of purified proteins. These results indicate that nick-directed LLR, but not loop-directed LLR, occurs when the Q<sub>100</sub> fraction is added to Pol &#x003b4;, PCNA, RFC and RPA (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Since loop-directed LLR (i.e. V<sub>27</sub> loop removal) was not observed, these results also suggest that nick- and loop-directed LLR have different protein requirements.

First, there is a similar pattern of LLR activity in the Q<sub>100</sub> fraction and with purified FEN1 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). Second, drop-out experiments showed that all four protein components (FEN1, Pol &#x003b4;, PCNA and RFC) were required for C<sub>27</sub> loop removal and V<sub>27</sub> loop retention activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Omission of dNTPs from the reaction mixture also eliminated repair (data not shown). Third, the ratio of C<sub>27</sub> loop removal and V<sub>27</sub> loop retention was similar in the reconstituted system as in the whole-cell extract with about twice as much C<sub>27</sub> loop removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Fourth, assays were performed with the mutant enzyme fen1-D179A, which retains flap cleavage activity but is defective in exonuclease and gap endonuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This mutant enzyme failed to support LLR in the reconstituted system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), consistent with a model where FEN1 exonuclease activity is required for LLR (see Discussion section). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FEN1, Pol &#x003b4;, RFC and PCNA are necessary and sufficient for nick-directed repair of the C<sub>27</sub> and V<sub>27</sub> substrates. Each 10 &#x003bc;l reaction contained 30 fmol FEN1, 30 fmol Pol &#x003b4;, 150 fmol RFC, and 60 fmol PCNA unless indicated otherwise. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 24 fmol C<sub>27</sub> or V<sub>27</sub> and were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 5 min. Aside from the specified values, the extent of repair was &#x0003c;5%. (<bold>B</bold>) Exonuclease-deficient FEN1, fen1-D179A, fails to support LLR in the reconstituted system. Reaction conditions were as in (A) except the incubation time was 10 min, 300 fmol RPA was added to V<sub>27</sub> reactions, and the presence of 30 fmol each FEN1 and fen1-D179A in the indicated lanes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn446f4"/></fig></p><p>To further examine the relevance of FEN1 for nick-directed LLR, repair activity was measured on a number of substrates using the reconstituted system of FEN1, Pol &#x003b4;, RFC and PCNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn446/DC1">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>). The addition of RPA was also examined, because in other repair systems RPA has been shown to bind to and stabilize excision intermediates at single-stranded regions and removing secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). RPA also stimulates the activity of FEN1 and facilitates repair synthesis by increasing the processivity of DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In our hands, addition of RPA had no discernible effect on low-level G/T repair, nor on loop removal on C substrates of 8, 27 or 30 nt loops. In contrast, RPA stimulated by about 2-fold V loop retention for loops of 8&#x02013;216 nt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn446/DC1">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>). Thus, the presence of RPA in the reconstituted system results in approximately equal levels of C<sub>27</sub> loop removal and V<sub>27</sub> loop retention. When the reconstituted LLR activity data with RPA were displayed graphically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), there was 3- to 4-fold higher LLR removal activity for C<sub>27</sub> and C<sub>30</sub> compared to repair of G/T or C<sub>8</sub>. Similarly, V loop retention activity in the presence of RPA was 2- to 3-fold higher for most loops of 8&#x02013;216 nt, compared to G/T. These results compare quite closely to the substrate specificity seen in whole-cell extracts (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C).</p><p>The RPA results provide additional support that FEN1 activity in the reconstituted LLR system is specific. Flaps up to 73 nt are efficiently cleaved by FEN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, in the presence of RPA, flaps longer than about 25 nt are not a substrate for FEN1 because RPA coats the flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). We found that addition of RPA to our reconstituted system did not inhibit LLR; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn446/DC1">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link> shows there was either no effect (for C substrates) or stimulation of repair (on V substrates). Since our ssDNA regions are long (e.g. 27 nt is long enough to bind RPA tightly) this is evidence that FEN1 acts in a coupled repair system, as opposed to nonspecific cleavage by FEN1.</p><p>While the results above support the idea of specificity in the reconstituted system, we addressed in one additional way the alternative possibility of a nonspecific, nick-translation-like reaction. In this scenario, Pol &#x003b4; might displace 5&#x02032; flaps that could be removed by FEN1. Processing in this manner from the 5&#x02032; nick through the loop could potentially yield nonspecific repair. We tested this possibility with a mutant version of Pol &#x003b4;, called Pol &#x003b4;-01. Wild type Pol &#x003b4; has an intrinsic 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease activity that provides a proofreading function, and limits excessive strand displacement synthesis by the polymerase through a mechanism called &#x02018;idling&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Pol &#x003b4;-01 is defective for this exonuclease activity and the mutant polymerase shows drastically increased strand displacement synthetic capacity. Therefore, one would expect that if flap displacement activity is important in our reconstituted LLR reaction, substituting Pol &#x003b4;-01 for wild-type enzyme should enhance repair. Instead, we saw no evidence of accelerated LLR activity with Pol &#x003b4;-01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Time course reactions with wild-type Pol &#x003b4; or with Pol &#x003b4;-01 gave very similar results. Taken together, the specificity data and the Pol &#x003b4;-01 result support the contention that the partially reconstituted system containing FEN1 conveys a substantial fraction of the specificity for large loops. It is of course possible that additional LLR factors, still unidentified, augment LLR specificity and/or repair efficiency. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>LLR assay using Pol &#x003b4; or the exonuclease-deficient polymerase Pol &#x003b4;-01.

The DNA was incubated with PCNA, RFC and RPA for 1 min at 30&#x000b0;C before the addition of FEN1 and Pol &#x003b4; or Pol &#x003b4;-01.

Presumably, this occurs by Pol &#x003b4;-mediated DNA synthesis from the 3&#x02032; end of the nick to create small flaps that are cleaved by FEN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). If so, omitting dNTPs should limit synthesis and gap formation downstream of the nick. This idea was tested by examining restriction enzyme cleavage at sites close to the nick (DraIII) or close to the loop (BanII) in LLR reactions on C<sub>27</sub> with or without dNTPs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A provides a schematic diagram of the relevant sites, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B shows the outcome. BanII cleavage occurred about equally well with or without dNTPs, suggesting the excision tract does not extend to this location 77 bp from the nick (compare lanes 3&#x02013;4 with 5). There is some reduction in size of the upper band, consistent with partial excision, but clearly the BanII site remains intact because the DNA is almost completely cleaved to form the &#x0223c;3.3 and 3.1 kb bands. In contrast, DraIII cleavage 3 bp from the nick was ablated by LLR in the absence of dNTPs, as shown by the presence of the 6.4 kb band (compare lanes 6&#x02013;7 with 8). This result indicates that LLR-associated excision in the reconstituted system initiates at the nick, and that excision in the absence of dNTPs occurs over a limited range. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Analysis of single-strand gap formation in the absence of dNTPs.

Our previous work presented evidence with neutralizing antibodies and yeast extracts that Pol &#x003b4;, RFC and PCNA are involved in the resynthesis step of LLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The current study used fractionation and mass spectrometry to identify FEN1 as an additional LLR factor. Reconstitution experiments showed that purified FEN1, Pol &#x003b4;, RFC and PCNA repair loops of 8&#x02013;216 nt in a 5&#x02032; nick-directed manner, regardless of which strand contained the loop. RPA was stimulatory on some substrates, but not required for repair. In contrast to nuclear and whole-cell extracts, however, nick-independent loop removal was not detected with the purified proteins. This finding indicates that nick-stimulated and loop-stimulated LLR require a different set of proteins, some of which remain unidentified. Nonetheless, the reconstituted system showed a similar substrate specificity profile as seen in whole-cell extracts for nick-directed repair. Furthermore an exonuclease-deficient Pol &#x003b4; variant protein, Pol &#x003b4;-01, with increased flap-displacement activity was no different than wild-type Pol &#x003b4; in the reconstituted reaction. The substrate specificity data and the Pol &#x003b4;-01 argue against a simple nick-translation type model. Instead, the results suggest partial reconstitution of 5&#x02032; nick-directed LLR with FEN1, Pol &#x003b4;, RFC and PCNA. While additional factors may enhance the activity or specificity of the reaction, to our knowledge this is the first report of a biochemically defined system for LLR.</p><p>FEN1 is the first nuclease to be implicated in mitotic LLR. This finding adds to the impressive list of activities in which FEN1 participates, including Okazaki fragment processing, long patch base excision repair and nonhomologous end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>). Other studies showed that FEN1 interacts functionally and physically with Pol &#x003b4;, PCNA and RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>), lending additional support to the idea that these four proteins plus RFC could catalyze 5&#x02032; nick-directed LLR.</p><p>How might this group of five proteins act to elicit repair of large loops? Excision tract mapping of 5&#x02032; nick-directed LLR in nuclear extracts demonstrated that repair involves excision of the DNA from the nick to a location past the loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Based on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, and the existing literature, 5&#x02032;-nick directed repair by purified FEN1, Pol &#x003b4;, PCNA and RFC likely proceeds by initiation at the nick. Initial cleavage at the loop is not supported by our data; otherwise, V27 loop removal would be expected but it was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Furthermore, FEN1 in general does not efficiently cleave loops or bubbles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), and the putative gap endonuclease activity reported for FEN1 requires significantly higher enzyme concentrations than used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). In our current working model, recognition of the free 3&#x02032;-OH at the nick by RFC results in the loading of PCNA and subsequent recruitment of FEN1 and Pol &#x003b4; to the nick. FEN1 cleavage near the nick would primarily produce a 1-nt gap; it is unlikely that FEN1 alone is responsible for excising the DNA all the way from the nick to the loop since its exonuclease activity is relatively weak. It is more likely that excision requires the concerted activity of Pol &#x003b4; and FEN1 in a manner similar to that observed in Okazaki fragment processing, where flaps are formed by displacement synthesis and then simultaneously cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Thus, one putative function of FEN1 in LLR is to assist in traversing between the nick and the loop. Once the PCNA/Pol &#x003b4;/FEN1 complex reaches the 5&#x02032; side of a loop on the C strand, a flap will be generated that is equal in length to the original loop. FEN1 could then track along the flap and endonucleolytically cleave it at the base. By this model, FEN1 endonuclease activity at the 5&#x02032; side of the flap is also required for LLR. For a loop on the V strand, an intact single-stranded region rather than a flap would occur. RPA may stimulate repair synthesis through the single-stranded region. Final processing of both C and V containing loops would require sealing of the nick by DNA ligase, although we did not test this prediction directly. A likely candidate for nick-directed LLR is DNA ligase I since it interacts with and is stimulated by PCNA. Cdc9, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homolog of DNA ligase I, was detected in the PS<sub>450</sub> fraction by mass spectroscopy (Sommer,D. and Lahue,R. unpublished observations). Ligase I has been shown to limit the length of nick translation patch lengths and nick ligation is the signal for the unloading of PCNA by RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>Kolodner and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) originally showed that <italic>rad27</italic> mutant strains, lacking FEN1, accumulate duplication mutations of 5&#x02013;108 bp flanked by direct repeats of 3&#x02013;12 bp. This phenotype was attributed to the production of displaced 5&#x02032; flaps in the absence of FEN1, followed by annealing of the 5&#x02032; end of the flap to a region of homology. The flaps could be ligated to create a covalent looped heteroduplex, which would template for a duplication mutation in a subsequent round of replication. Thus, the belief was that FEN1 acted only to cleave 5&#x02032; flaps and therefore prevent duplications. Our results with LLR reconstitution lead to the hypothesis that <italic>rad27</italic> mutants not only produce excess flaps, but these mutants may also be at least partially defective in their repair of the looped heteroduplex by LLR. Thus, the duplication phenotype associated with <italic>rad27</italic> mutants may be due to both excessive flap production and defective loop repair. In support of this idea, the size range of mutations observed in <italic>rad27</italic> strains, 5&#x02013;108 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), overlaps with the range of large loops repaired in the partially reconstituted LLR reaction described here. However, a yeast <italic>&#x00394;rad27</italic> strain can repair large loops <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and extract from a <italic>&#x00394;rad27</italic> mutant was also LLR proficient <italic>in vitro</italic> (this study; data not shown). Therefore, there may be one or more nucleases that are functionally redundant to FEN1 that could replace it in 5&#x02032;-directed LLR. Precedent for partial redundancy with FEN1 comes from studies of Okazaki fragment maturation, where backup activities of Exo1 and Dna2 are likely involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Mismatch repair in <italic>E. coli</italic> also requires several redundant nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Accordingly, we found that wild type yeast extract produced at least one additional active fraction from phenyl sepharose, eluting at a different salt concentration than FEN1. This additional fraction contained Rad2, as shown by mass spectrometric analysis, and purified Rad2 added to Pol &#x003b4;, PCNA and RFC gave LLR activity, albeit at a significantly reduced level compared to the FEN1-containing system. The potential role of Rad2 in LLR remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In summary, fractionation of yeast lysates revealed that 5&#x02032; nick-directed repair of large loops can be separated from loop-directed repair. Further fractionation lead to the identification of FEN1, a nuclease that in combination with Pol &#x003b4;, PCNA, and RFC is able to support 5&#x02032; nick-directed repair of 27 nt loops. These factors may assemble at the nick and act in a concerted fashion to excise and re-synthesize the DNA, thus correcting the heterology.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn446/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn446_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkn446_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Ron Cerny of the Nebraska Center for Proteomics for mass spectrometric analysis.
