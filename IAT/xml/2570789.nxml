One of the TLR family members, TLR4, is constitutively expressed at RNA level on renal epithelium and this expression is enhanced upon renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The functional relevance of this organ-specific upregulation remains however unknown. We therefore investigated the specific role of TLR4 and the relative contribution of its two downstream signaling cascades, the MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent cascades in renal damage by using TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212;, MyD88&#x02212;/&#x02212; and TRIF-mutant mice that were subjected to renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our results show that TLR4 initiates an exaggerated proinflammatory response upon I/R injury, as reflected by lower levels of chemokines and infiltrating granulocytes, less renal damage and a more preserved renal function in TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice as compared to wild type mice. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrate that renal tubular epithelial cells can coordinate an immune response to ischemic injury in a TLR4-dependent manner. <italic>In vivo</italic> we found that epithelial- and leukocyte-associated functional TLR4 contribute in a similar proportion to renal dysfunction and injury as assessed by bone marrow chimeric mice. Surprisingly, no significant differences were found in renal function and inflammation in MyD88&#x02212;/&#x02212; and TRIF-mutant mice compared with their wild types, suggesting that selective targeting of TLR4 directly may be more effective for the development of therapeutic tools to prevent I/R injury than targeting the intracellular pathways used by TLR4. In conclusion, we identified TLR4 as a cellular sentinel for acute renal damage that subsequently controls the induction of an innate immune response.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammation at the site of tissue injury is a hallmark of almost all forms of renal injury and is an important factor in the development of many kidney diseases. Inflammatory cells can either mediate the initiation and progression of damage by direct cytotoxicity, secretion of soluble factors and regulation of immune responses, or can promote tissue repair and remodeling by production of growth factors and clearance of injured cells. It has become clear that renal epithelium plays a crucial role in the attraction of leukocytes upon injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Daha1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, at least partially in a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Leemans1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The family of TLRs consists of highly conserved pattern recognition receptors that detect specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as peptidoglycan (TLR2) or lipopolysaccharide (TLR4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-West1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, TLRs also recognize specific endogenous danger molecules that have been altered from their native state or accumulate in non-physiologic sites or amounts during tissue injury, such as heat-shock proteins, hyaluronan, high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and fibrinogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Johnson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon ligand recognition, TLRs are activated and initiate a proinflammatory response by the release of cytokines/chemokines and attraction of inflammatory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Schnare1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Zhong1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Except for TLR3, all TLRs control these innate immune responses through a conserved downstream signaling pathway, starting with the translocation of the adapter molecule MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88) that ultimately leads to the early activation of NF&#x003ba;B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Akira1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides this pathway, TLR4 and TLR3 can use an alternative signaling cascade, the MyD88-independent route <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Takeda1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, which specifically involves the translocation of adapter molecule TRIF (TIR domain &#x02013;containing adapter inducing IFN-&#x003b2;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Yamamoto2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, in combination with the adapter protein TRAM (TRIF-related adapter molecule) that subsequently leads to the production of IFN- &#x003b2; and the expression of Interferon &#x003b2;-inducible genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Yamamoto3">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Rowe1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The diversity and specificity of the function of TLRs is determined by the selective use of these intracellular adapter molecules.</p><p>Where it was first thought that TLRs were mainly expressed on antigen-presenting cells, recent observations demonstrate that TLR mRNA expression is also present within solid organs such as the heart, liver and kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Nishimura1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In the kidney, the majority of the constitutive TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA is expressed by tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and is enhanced upon renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury as shown by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Wolfs1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, the endogenous ligands that can activate TLR2 and TLR4 are strongly upregulated in these TECs upon I/R injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Kim1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, these data suggest a potential role for renal TLR2 and TLR4 in the primary mechanism through which the kidney monitors renal injury and initiates and regulates inflammation. Indeed, we already demonstrated that renal-associated TLR2 plays a proinflammatory and subsequent detrimental role during I/R injury in the kidney of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Leemans1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. TLR4 can however exert different immunological effects as demonstrated by studies showing diverse effects of TLR2 and TLR4 in infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-ArkoMensah1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Gil1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Rodriguez1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and tissue injury models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Goldstein1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Zhai1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This could be due to the fact that TLR4 detects other (endogenous danger) ligands, can signal via an alternative signaling cascade and does not hybridize with other TLRs as TLR2 does. The particular role of TLR4 in I/R injury remains therefore unknown. The definition of the specific roles of the MyD88-dependent and &#x02013;independent pathways in TLR signaling might offer new possibilities for the selective blockade of pathways downstream of TLRs. Together, this prompted us to investigate the role of TLR4 and the relative contribution of the two individual downstream signaling cascades of TLR4 in I/R injury and repair in the kidney.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Preserved renal function in TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice after I/R induction</title><p>To evaluate the role of TLR4 in renal I/R injury, plasma urea and creatinine levels were determined in TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212; and wild type mice.

Especially renal tubular epithelial cells are central players, since injury of these cells can result in the local synthesis of proinflammatory mediators and the subsequent attraction and migration of inflammatory cells into the injured renal parenchyma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Daha1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. It is already demonstrated that tubular epithelial cells constitutively express TLR2 and TLR4, whose expression levels are upregulated upon I/R injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Wolfs1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Whereas we have already shown that TLR2 plays a proinflammatory and subsequent detrimental role upon I/R injury <italic>in vivo</italic> contributing to renal dysfunction and injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Leemans1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, the functional relevance of increased TLR4 expression remains unknown. As TLR4 can recognize other endogenous ligands than TLR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Tsan1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, can use an alternative signaling cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Akira2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and does not hybridize with other TLR family members as TLR2 does, the functional significance of TLR4 during tissue injury could be different from TLR2. Indeed, different effects of TLR2 and TLR4 were found in both infection models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-ArkoMensah1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Gil1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Rodriguez1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> as in tissue injury models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Goldstein1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Zhai1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in this study we investigated the individual role of TLR4 upon renal I/R injury and demonstrated that TLR4 plays a proinflammatory role, as reflected by a reduced amount of infiltrating granulocytes and the chemokine KC in kidneys of TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice compared with wild type mice. Since an exaggerated inflammatory response could lead to more severe tissue damage, this enhanced inflammation could explain why TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice showed less tubular injury and a more preserved renal function compared with wild type mice upon I/R injury. These results are in line with studies describing an import role for TLR4 in lung and hepatic I/R injury models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Shimamoto1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Wang1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Zhai1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, another study also reports that activation of TLR4 mediates renal I/R injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Wu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Whereas our <italic>in vitro</italic> data showed that primary murine TECs need TLR4 in order to produce significant amounts of cytokines/chemokines after simulated ischemia, the use of chimeric mice in a model of severe I/R injury revealed that there was a comparable relative contribution of renal-associated and leukocyte-associated TLR4 to the observed renal dysfunction and tubular injury <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results are partially in contrast to the report of Wu et al. which demonstrated that intrinsic renal cells play the dominant role in mediating kidney damage. A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be that the study of Wu et al. induced sublethal renal ischemia, whereas we subjected our chimeric mice to prolonged severe I/R injury. The abundant infiltration of inflammatory cells during lethal I/R injury thereby might overwhelm the primary response initiated by epithelium-derived TLR4. Interestingly, Cunningham et al. showed that extrarenal TLR4 rather than renal TLR4 mediated LPS-induced acute renal failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Cunningham1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this model used a microbial ligand instead of endogenous stress molecules; it emphasizes the role extra-renal TLR4 can play in the kidney during disease. Moreover, Tsung et al. showed in a model of hepatic I/R injury that functional TLR4 signaling in non-parenchymal cells in particular is important for recognizing the initial damage from ischemic cells.</p><p>The diversity and specificity of a TLR function is determined by the selective use of the intracellular adapter molecules. The definition of the specific roles of the MyD88-dependent and TRIF&#x02013;dependent pathways in TLR signaling might offer new possibilities for the selective blockade of pathways downstream of TLRs. We therefore investigated their relative contributions <italic>in vivo</italic>. This revealed that the TRIF-dependent cascade does not play an important role early after I/R injury, as reflected by a similar degree of renal dysfunction, tubular injury and granulocyte influx in the TRIF-mutant mice as compared with their wild types. That would point towards a more important role for the MyD88-dependent cascade in this model. Surprisingly however, we did not find differences in renal function, tubular damage and in numbers of infiltrating granulocytes between MyD88&#x02212;/&#x02212; and wild type mice in two independent experiments. In accordance with our observations, no important role for the TRIF-dependent pathway upon renal I/R injury was found in a study of Shigeoka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Shigeoka1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas they did observe functional differences between wild type and MyD88&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. MyD88&#x02212;/&#x02212;&#x000d7;TRIF&#x02212;/&#x02212; (double KO) mice were found to have a similar phenotype as the MyD88&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, suggesting that the TRIF-dependent pathway is indeed not important.</p><p>From our data it became clear that the absence of TLR4 protected the kidneys to a higher degree that the absence of the downstream signaling molecule MyD88. Shigeoka et al. observed similar results showing that TLR2 deficiency provided more protection than a deficiency in MyD88 or TRIF individually or a combination of those two adapter molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Shigeoka1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. They suggested the possible existence of additional TLR2-dependent/MyD88-independent signaling pathways. Likewise, it seems reasonable that there are also yet unknown TLR4-dependent/MyD88-independent/TRIF-independent signaling pathways in this renal I/R injury model. Moreover, it is known that other receptors, including members of the Interleukin (IL)-1R/TLR superfamily such as IL1 and IL18, signal via the MyD88 adapter protein as well, and could thereby abolish the proinflammatory effects of TLR4 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Fitzgerald1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-ONeill1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternative explanation is that endogenous ligands that are released upon I/R injury might activate other TLR-family members signaling via the MyD88-dependent cascade that could have an anti-inflammatory effect abolishing the proinflammatory signal of TLR4. Indeed, it is already demonstrated that TLR9 can trigger anti-inflammatory functions in experimental colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Katakura1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and it has been shown that upon TLR-signaling the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 can be enhanced within dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Samarasinghe1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, a study reported that individual molecules of signaling pathways can differentially regulate the TLR-mediated production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Martin1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent reports even suggested the existence of non-TLR-dependent adapter molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Ruse1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Obviously, further experimental work is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms through which TLR signaling leads to differential downstream responses.</p><p>Besides the initiation of a proinflammatory response, we also investigated if TLR4 activation was involved in the repair and regenerative processes that take place upon I/R injury, such as the clearance of damaged tubular epithelial cells by apoptosis and subsequent replacement of epithelium by proliferation of TECs. In contrast to the results we had already demonstrated for TLR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Leemans1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, these findings suggest that TLR4 does not play a major role in the induction of apoptotic processes, despite a tendency towards less apoptotic TECs found in the TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice after one day of I/R injury. The latter would be in line with the less renal dysfunction and less inflammation that were observed at this time in TLR4 deficient mice, since apoptosis is thought to contribute to the initiation of reperfusion-induced inflammation and subsequent tissue injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Daemen1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, despite similar levels of tubular injury five days after I/R injury, the amount of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in kidneys of TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice compared with wild type mice. This agrees with a previous study demonstrating that TLR4 signaling protects against apoptosis in the injured intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Fukata1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, in contrast to the effect what we already described for TLR2 deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Leemans1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, no effect of TLR4 deficiency was found on the amount of proliferating TECs on early time points, while after ten days of I/R injury the amount of proliferating TECs was lower in the TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice compared to wild type mice. This agrees with previous studies demonstrating that TLR4 signaling is required for proliferation in the injured intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-Fukata1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, and the demonstration that HSP60-mediated TLR4 activation stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003596-deGraaf1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. However, apoptosis and proliferation of TECs do not appear to contribute to the differences in renal function and morphology that were observed between wild type and TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice one day after renal I/R injury.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that TLR4 can initiate an exaggerated proinflammatory response early after renal I/R injury, contributing to renal injury and dysfunction, and indicates that both epithelium-associated and leukocyte-associated TLR4 contribute to the I/R induced effects <italic>in vivo</italic>. As deficiency of the intracellular adapter molecules MyD88 and TRIF did not influence the degree of renal injury and inflammation, selective targeting of TLR4 may be more effective for the development of therapeutic tools to prevent I/R injury than targeting the intracellular pathways used by TLR4. Moreover, these findings support the idea that the function of TLRs extends beyond host defense against invading pathogens; TLR4 seems to be a cellular sensor for acute renal damage that controls innate immunity and tissue integrity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>Pathogen-free 8&#x02013;12 week-old male wild type (Wt) C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.

Erythrocytes were lysed for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C in 160 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 10 mM KHCO<sub>3</sub> and 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and the remaining leukocytes were brought to a concentration of 4&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.5&#x00025; BSA, 0.01&#x00025; NaN<sub>3</sub> and 100 mM EDTA) and stained for CD45.1 (clone A20, BD Biosciences) and CD45.2 (clone 104, BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. Chimerism was determined by analyzing the populations of CD45.1 and CD45.2 positive cells. To correct for background staining unlabeled cells were used. All analyses were performed using a FACSCalibur (BD) and WinMDI 2.5 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4m"><title>Statistics</title><p>Differences between groups were analyzed using the independent samples T-Test.
