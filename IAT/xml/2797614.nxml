To clarify the cause of abnormal behavior in PACAP deficient-mice, we attempted the identification of genes whose expression was altered in the dentate gyrus of PACAP-deficient mice using the differential display method. Expression of stathmin1 was up-regulated in the dentate gyrus at both the mRNA and protein levels. PACAP stimulation inhibited stathmin1 expression in PC12 cells, while increased stathmin1expression in neurons of the subgranular zone and in primary cultured hippocampal neurons induced abnormal arborization of axons. We also investigated the pathways involved in PACAP deficiency. Ascl1 binds to E10 box of the stathmin1 promoter and increases stathmin1 expression. Inhibitory bHLH proteins (Hes1 and Id3) were rapidly up-regulated by PACAP stimulation, and Hes1 could suppress Ascl1 expression and Id3 could inhibit Ascl1 signaling. We also detected an increase of stathmin1 expression in the brains of schizophrenic patients. These results suggest that up-regulation of stathmin1 in the dentate gyrus, secondary to PACAP deficiency, may create abnormal neuronal circuits that cause abnormal behavior.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>PACAP is a neuropeptide that is expressed in the brain as well as in the neurons of a number of peripheral organs and it is involved in various neurobiological functions, such as neurotransmission and neural plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Vaudry1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Hashimoto1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. It also has a neurotrophic effect via three heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors, one of which is specific for PACAP (PAC<sub>1</sub> receptor) and two others that are shared with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VPAC<sub>1</sub> and VPAC<sub>2</sub> receptors) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Hashimoto2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, mice that lack <italic>Adcyap1</italic>, the gene encoding PACAP, (<italic>Adcyap1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice) were developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Hashimoto1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Shintani1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Adcyap1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice display remarkable behavioral abnormalities providing evidence that PACAP plays a previously uncharacterized role in the regulation of psychomotor behavior. When placed into a novel environment, such as an open field, the mutants display significantly increased locomotor activity with minimal time spent habituating themselves to the environment, and less time engaged in licking and grooming behavior. The mutants also show explosive jumping behavior in the open field and increased exploratory behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Hashimoto1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Hashimoto3">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These behavioral abnormalities may be due to perturbation of monoamine neurotransmission because serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is slightly decreased in the cerebral cortex and striatum of PACAP-deficient mice, and hyperactive behavior is ameliorated by the antipsychotic drug, haloperidol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Hashimoto1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the jumping behavior is suppressed by drugs that elevate extracellular serotonin, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Shintani2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Adcyap1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice also showed increased immobility in a forced swimming test, which was reduced by the antidepressant, desipramine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Hashimoto4">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition it is known that PAC<sub>1</sub>-deficient mice exhibit reduced social behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Nicot1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

A previous association study reported that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of the PACAP gene locus were associated with schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Hashimoto5">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, none of genome wide association studies showed association of this gene with schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-International1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1</italic> (<italic>DISC1</italic>) has been identified as a potential susceptibility gene for major psychiatric disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Millar1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Millar2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

DISC1-binding zinc finger protein (DBZ) is one of these factors. We found that PACAP up-regulates DISC1 expression and markedly reduced the association of DISC1 with DBZ in PC12 cells, and that a DISC1-binding domain of DBZ reduces neurite length in PC12 cells following PACAP stimulation in primary cultured hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Millar1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, these results suggest that PACAP may play a role in mental disorders such as schizophrenia.</p><p>However, nothing is known about the mechanisms of PACAP deficiency-induced psychiatric illness, so this study was performed to investigate these mechanisms.</p><p>The localization of PAC<sub>1</sub> mRNA in the neurons of rat and mice brains has been examined by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Hashimoto6">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

To elucidate molecular events associated with PACAP deficiency in the mouse brain that could be relevant to schizophrenia, therefore we attempted to detect PACAP deficiency-regulated genes in the dentate gyrus using the differential display (DD) method and found that stathmin1 expression was up-regulated in the dentate gyrus of PACAP-deficient mice.

Hes1 and Id3 expression increased rapidly after PACAP stimulation, indicating that expression of bHLH inhibitors (Hes1 and Id3) was induced by PACAP stimulation.

Therefore, we next examined whether the ERK or p38 pathway regulates the induction of Hes1 and Id3 after PACAP stimulation.

From BLAST search, it indicates that the stathmin1 promoter region contains multiple bHLH binding sites. In addition, human and mouse stathmin1 promoters have several E boxes, and these transcriptional sites should be key motifs for regulating stathmin1 expression. As mentioned above, stathmin1 was co-localized with DCX and PSA-NCAM in the SGZ. Neuronal transcription factors from the family, such as Ascl1 and NeuroD, are expressed before the migration stage, which is when expression of DCX or PSA-NCAM occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Massari1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. We examined the effect of Ascl1 and NeuroD on the stathmin1 promoter by using a luciferase assay. Ascl1 was shown to enhance luciferase activity related to the stathmin1 promoter, but NeuroD did not (data not shown). Ascl1 and all the members of the bHLH family heterodimerize through their HLH domain with ubiquitously expressed bHLH E proteins, such as E2A gene products (E12 and E47).

Thus, it can be suggested that heterodimers of Ascl1 and E47 bind to the E10 box motif of the stathmin1 promoter region and activate stathmin1 expression.</p><p>The present study suggested the molecular cascade by which PACAP inhibits stathmin1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008596-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008596-g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008596-g006">6</xref>). Neuronal differentiation is known to be not only regulated by transcriptional bHLH activators, but also by inhibitory bHLH proteins, such as the Hes and Id family of repressors. We found that Hes1 and Id3 were rapidly up-regulated by PACAP, and activation of Ascl1 was inhibited by both Hes1 and Id3. Hes1 expression was increased via both the PACAP-PAC<sub>1</sub>-ERK and PACAP-PAC<sub>1</sub>-p38 pathways, whereas Id3 was up-regulated via the PACAP-PAC<sub>1</sub>-p38 pathway only. We also detected different mechanisms for the inhibition of Ascl1 by Hes1 and Id3. First, Hes1 regulates the transcription of Ascl1. We observed that Hes1 was up-regulated by PACAP, but Hes5 was unchanged (data not shown). The Hes family can inhibit gene expression either by directly binding (as homodimers) to cognate-binding elements known as N-boxes (CACNAG) or indirectly by dominant-negative regulation (i.e., forming non-functional heterodimers with transcriptional activators) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Kageyama1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been shown that the repressive effect of Hes1 is directly mediated by its binding to a class C site in the hAsh1 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Chen1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Hes1 is thought to regulate the onset of neuronal differentiation, at least partly, by repressing the transcription of downstream positive factors, such as the neuronal commitment gene, Ascl1. Therefore, Hes1 (which was up-regulated by PACAP) binds the Ascl1 promoter and inhibits Ascl1 expression. On the other hand, Id3 regulates the function of Ascl1 protein. Id proteins have been identified as negative regulators of bHLH transcription factors and Id1 through Id4 have been characterized in mammals. It was previously shown that Id3 is a cAMP-responsive gene, the up-regulation of which could be involved in PACAP signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Ghzili1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed that Id3 was up-regulated by PACAP stimulation, but Id1, Id2 and Id4 increased at a later phase (data not shown). These transcriptional regulators inhibit bHLH factors by sequestering them in inactive heterodimers, which are unable to bind with DNA due to the absence of a basic DNA-binding region in the Id proteins. In addition, previous findings have indicated that Id1 and E protein levels not only regulate the transcription but also the stability of Ascl1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Vials1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, our results suggest that Id3 binds E protein and suppresses Ascl1.</p><p>The present study indicated that PACAP signaling increased the levels of Hes1 and Id3, following these inhibitory bHLH proteins decreased the expression of stathmin1 (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008596.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Increased stathmin1 expression in SGZ neurons due to PACAP deficiency and psychiatric illness</title><p>PACAP and PAC<sub>1</sub> knock-out mice show abnormal behavior resembling psychiatric disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Hashimoto3">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and some SNPs in the vicinity of the PACAP gene locus are associated with schizophrenia. These findings suggested that the brains of schizophrenic patients may be deficient in PACAP and PAC<sub>1</sub>, resulting in increased expression of stathmin1 in the SGZ neurons of the dentate gyrus. In addition, up-regulation of stathmin1 has previously been implicated in schizophrenia pathogenesis from the results of scanning and from comparing the anterior cingulate cortex gray matter proteomes between schizophrenia and control post-mortem human tissue using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Clark1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. As expected, the present study revealed an increase in the expression of stathmin1 mRNA in the brains of schizophrenic patients, but not in the brains of patients with bipolar disorder. The fold-index indicated about 1.5 (schizophrenia/control), which corresponded well to the level (1.8) in the report above. However, no SNPs displayed any allelic, genotypic, or haplotypic associations with schizophrenia (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008596.s004">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have provided reliable evidence that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Frankle1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Heinz1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008596-Mueser1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. The present study revealed that PACAP deficiency causes increased stathmin1 expression in SGZ neurons and leads to abnormal sprouting of their axons, showing that PACAP deficiency and consequently over-expression of stathmin1 in SGZ neurons could lead to a disturbance of the neural circuits in the dentate gyrus. This raises the possibility that abnormal expression of PACAP and stathmin1 could interfere with dentate gyrus functions, leading to an increased susceptibility to psychiatric illnesses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008596.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>P38 or ERK activation in PC12 cells in response to PACAP stimulation.
