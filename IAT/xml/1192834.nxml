Immunodepletion of KSRP enhanced iNOS 3&#x02032;-UTR RNA stability in <italic>in vitro</italic>-degradation assays. In DLD-1 cells overexpressing KSRP cytokine-induced iNOS expression was markedly reduced. In accordance, downregulation of KSRP expression increases iNOS expression by stabilizing iNOS mRNA. Co-immunoprecipitations showed interaction of KSRP with the exosome and tristetraprolin (TTP). To analyze the role of KSRP binding to the 3&#x02032;-UTR we studied iNOS expression in DLD-1 cells overexpressing a non-binding mutant of KSRP. In these cells, iNOS expression was increased. Mapping of the binding site revealed KSRP interacting with the most 3&#x02032;-located AU-rich element (ARE) of the human iNOS mRNA. This sequence is also the target for HuR, an iNOS mRNA stabilizing protein. We were able to demonstrate that KSRP and HuR compete for this binding site, and that intracellular binding to the iNOS mRNA was reduced for KSRP and enhanced for HuR after cytokine treatment. Finally, a complex interplay of KSRP with TTP and HuR seems to be essential for iNOS mRNA stabilization after cytokine stimulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gene expression is controlled by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. A central part of the post-transcriptional modulation of gene expression is mediated by regulation of mRNA stability. The stability varies considerably between mRNAs and can be modulated by extracellular stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). A tight control of mRNA stability permits rapid changes in the level of mRNAs and provides a mechanism for prompt termination of protein production. The rate of mRNA decay is determined by <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences within the mRNA, which are recognized by <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. Dysregulation of the expression of RNA-bps or mutation of important <italic>cis</italic>-acting binding sequences and thereby dysregulation of mRNA stability has been associated with different human diseases like chronic inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), &#x003b1;-thalassemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>AU-rich elements (AREs) are critical <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated regions (3&#x02032;-UTRs) of many inherently unstable mRNAs that code for cytokines, transcription factors and proto-oncogenes and are targets for <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins regulating mRNA stability and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). A number of ARE binding proteins (ARE-bps) have been identified that can interact with AU- and U-rich regions. These include the ELAV protein family members (most important HuR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), the ARE/poly-(U)-binding/degradation factor 1 (AUF-1, also named hnRNP D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), the heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), the KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), tristetraprolin (TTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), the T cell-restricted intracellular antigen (TIA)-1 and the TIA-related protein (TIAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which AREs mediate mRNA decay is not clear. In yeast, 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle. Chen <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) have purified and characterized the human exosome by mass spectrometry (MS) and found its composition to be similar to its yeast counterpart. Using a cell-free RNA decay system, these authors also demonstrate that the mammalian exosome is required for degradation of ARE-containing RNAs. However, the mammalian exosome does not seem to recognize the ARE-containing RNAs on its own but requires certain ARE-bps, like KSRP or TTP. These ARE-bps interact with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting their rapid degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). By siRNA-mediated depletion of KSRP in HeLa cells and by creating a dominant negative KSRP isoform (by deletion of the most carboxyterminal located RNA binding domain, KH4) Gherzi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) showed that KSRP is essential for ARE-RNA decay <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) can be induced in different types of cells and tissues following exposure to immunologic and inflammatory stimuli such as cytokines or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Once synthesized, the enzyme is active for hours to days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and generates large amounts of NO that can have beneficial effects, such as anti-microbial, anti-atherogenic or anti-apoptotic actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). However, inappropriate iNOS induction can have detrimental consequences, such as cellular injury in arthritis or colitis and in septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). The expression of human iNOS is controlled in large part by post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). In human epithelial A549, AKN or DLD-1 cells, nuclear run-on and transfection experiments revealed a significant basal activity of the human iNOS promoter that was only enhanced 2- to 5-fold by cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In contrast, only after cytokine induction a significant iNOS mRNA expression could be detected.</p><p>Sequence analysis of the human iNOS mRNA reveals the presence of five AREs in the 3&#x02032;-UTR. In transfection experiments with human A549 or DLD-1 cells, the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the human iNOS mRNA destabilized the mRNA of a heterologous reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>Gel retardation experiments showed interaction of the ARE-bp HuR with the human iNOS 3&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). HuR is known to stabilize ARE-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Stable overexpression of HuR in human DLD-1 cells resulted in an upregulation of cytokine-induced iNOS expression. Accordingly, downregulation of HuR expression resulted in a reduction of cytokine-induced iNOS expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>In recent studies, we showed that in addition to HuR TTP is essentially involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of human iNOS expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). In contrast to its published destabilizing effect, overexpression of TTP in DLD-1 cells resulted in a marked increase in iNOS expression, without any TTP binding to the human iNOS mRNA.</p><p>UV-crosslinking experiments with cellular extracts from DLD-1 cells and a <sup>32</sup>P-radiolabeled probe of the iNOS 3&#x02032;-UTR revealed that several proteins formed RNA&#x02013;protein complexes in this sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Therefore, it seems very likely that in addition to HuR other RNA-bps are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of human iNOS expression.</p><p>In the current study, we identified KSRP as a key regulator of human iNOS expression. KSRP destabilizes iNOS mRNA by binding to its 3&#x02032;-UTR and interaction with the exosome. For cytokine induction of iNOS expression a complex interaction of the iNOS mRNA 3&#x02032;-UTR and the RNA-bps KSRP, TTP and HuR seems to be essential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Trypsin-, glutamine-, and pyruvate-solutions, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, agarose, isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside, tRNA, BSA, actinomycin D, streptavidin-coated agarose beads, horseradish-peroxidase-coupled anti-goat and anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany.

These cell pools were analyzed for stable integration of the DNA (data not shown) and KSRP expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As a control, DLD-1 cells stably transfected with the pcDNA3 vector were generated as well (pcDNA3). Overexpression of a His-tagged KSRP protein resulted in nearly complete inhibition of cytokine-induced iNOS mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with these results, reduction of KSRP expression by the antisense approach markedly enhanced cytokine-induced iNOS mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Also cytokine-induced iNOS-dependent NO-production was decreased by KSRP overexpression in DLD-1-pcDNA-His-KSRP cells and increased by KSRP downregulation in DLD-1-pcDNA-KSRPas cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>To support these results of KSRP-mediated reduction of iNOS expression we aimed to downregulate KSRP expression using the RNA interference technique.

This binding activity was not observed with the GST protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, left panel). To localize the KSRP binding site within the iNOS 3&#x02032;-UTR, the region was first dissected into two subfragments, one without AU-repeats (non-AU) and the other containing these putative regulatory elements (AU). Only the subfragment containing the AU-repeats interacted with the KSRP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, right panel). Subsequently, the AU-fragment was dissected into three subfragments: subfragment A (232&#x02013;329, no AU-repeats), subfragment B (327&#x02013;428, three AUUUA-motifs), and subfragment C (387&#x02013;477, one AUUUA and an AUUUUA element).

PABP is known to bind to the poly-A-tail of mRNAs and seems to be important for different levels of post-transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). However recent data suggest that PABP also binds specifically to ARE-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>).</p><p>KSRP has been described as a protein essential for exosome-mediated degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). As recent data from our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) indicated that KSRP is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of human iNOS expression, we analyzed the role of KSRP in human iNOS expression in more detail.</p><p>Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> degradation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we were able to show that immunodepletion of KSRP of extracts from DLD-1 cells resulted in enhancement of the stability of a 5&#x02032;-capped and 3&#x02032;-polyadenylated iNOS 3&#x02032;-UTR RNA. Deletion of the AREs (non-AU) resulted in an enhancement of the stability of this RNA in these <italic>in vitro</italic> decay assays. Most important is that, without the AREs the depletion of KSRP has no effect on the stability of the 3&#x02032;-UTR RNA. In the limitations of such <italic>in vitro</italic> decay assays this confirms an important role of KSRP in the regulation of iNOS expression at the level of mRNA stability.</p><p>To analyze the influence of KSRP on iNOS expression in intact cells, we generated stably transfected DLD-1 cell lines with enhanced or reduced KSRP expression. Results obtained with these cell lines as well as results generated using a RNA interference approach in DLD-1 and A549/8 cells confirmed the negative regulatory effect of KSRP on iNOS expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, we observed downregulation of TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA expression in DLD-1 cells overexpressing KSRP (data not shown). Actinomycin D experiments revealed a reduced decay of iNOS mRNA in cells with diminished KSRP expression, confirming that its effect occurs at the level of mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, cotransfection experiments showed no influence of KSRP on the cytokine-induced activity of the human iNOS promoter (see Supplementary Figures). Therefore, in accordance with its proposed destabilizing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), KSRP is an important factor for the degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs in DLD-1 cells.</p><p>The results reported above indicate a direct negative effect of KSRP on human iNOS expression. Since induction of iNOS expression in DLD-1 cells depends on a complex CM we analyzed the effects of CM-incubation on endogenous KSRP expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> CM-incubation of DLD-1 cells did not change endogenous KSRP protein expression. Additionally, no clear evidence for modified KSRP localization was found (data not shown). Also analyses of KSRP phosphorylation revealed no changes in tyrosine or serine phosphorylation after cytokine treatment (data not shown). Therefore, the enhancement in iNOS mRNA expression measured after CM-incubation does not seem to correlate with changed KSRP expression, post-translational modifications or localization. In summary, these data imply that an interplay of different proteins in a complex network could be necessary to explain changes in iNOS mRNA expression after cytokine stimulation.</p><p>For example, KSRP has been described to recruit the exosome to ARE-containing mRNAs and thereby enabling exosome-mediated degradation of these RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The exosome is a complex of 10 different proteins important for 3&#x02032;&#x02013; &#x0003e; 5&#x02032; degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the interaction of KSRP with the exosome in DLD-1 cells by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. To exclude that binding of different RNA-bps to the same RNA resulted in a RNA-dependent co-immunoprecepitation we always pretreated the extracts with RNases. These analyses showed that KSRP displayed a protein&#x02013;protein interaction with the exosome in DLD-1 cells (data not shown) as shown before for other human cell lines. However, this interaction was not modified by cytokine incubation of DLD-1 cells (data not shown). Therefore, KSRP seems to destabilize iNOS mRNA in interplay with the exosome independent of cytokine stimulation. This implies that for stabilization of iNOS mRNA after cytokine treatment, other factors must be involved that prevent KSRP-mediated decay.</p><p>In addition to KSRP, TTP has been shown to interact with the exosome and to recruit this nuclease complex to ARE-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, KSRP also interacts with TTP in DLD-1 cells. This interaction was enhanced by cytokine incubation, most likely due to increased TTP expression under these conditions. Interestingly, we have found that overexpression of TTP increases cytokine-induced iNOS expression in DLD-1 cells without any TTP binding to the human iNOS mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p><p>To verify that KSRP binding to the human iNOS mRNA is necessary for its regulatory action, we analyzed the effect of a non-binding KSRP mutant lacking the most carboxyterminal RNA binding domain KH4, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Loss of binding activity was tested in UV-crosslinking experiments using the iNOS 3&#x02032;-UTR (data not shown). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref> overexpression of this KSRP isoform (KSRPdel) in DLD-1 cells resulted in an enhancement of cytokine-induced iNOS mRNA expression and iNOS-dependent NO-production. Therefore, KSRP binding to the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the human iNOS mRNA is essential for the negative regulation of iNOS mRNA stability by this RNA-bp.</p><p>Mapping of the exact binding sequence revealed the most 3&#x02032;-located AU-rich element as binding site for KSRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In former experiments we have shown that the ELAV protein HuR binds to the same ARE in the human iNOS mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) using fixed amounts of KSRP and increasing amounts of HuR (or vice versa) a mutually exclusive binding of KSRP or HuR to the human iNOS 3&#x02032;-UTR sequence was observed.</p><p>Analysis of the affinity of KSRP binding to the iNOS mRNA in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using externally added iNOS 3&#x02032;-UTR RNA (RNA-affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation/UV-crosslinking) revealed no differences between untreated and cytokine-stimulated cells (data not shown). Therefore, enhanced iNOS mRNA expression after cytokine induction cannot be explained by changes in the affinity of KSRP binding to the human iNOS mRNA.</p><p>In contrast to this <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches, analysis of the relative intracellular binding of KSRP and HuR to the endogenous iNOS mRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) revealed a clear cytokine-induced change of the ratio of HuR and KSRP-bound to the iNOS mRNA. Whereas in intact DLD-1 cells KSRP binding was reduced, the binding of HuR was enhanced by cytokine incubation. Therefore, the enhanced expression of iNOS mRNA after cytokine stimulation can be explained by the shift from degradation mediated by KSRP to enhanced stabilization mediated by HuR resulting from these changes in RNA binding.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest the following mechanism of iNOS mRNA stabilization after cytokine stimulation: In untreated DLD-1 cells KSRP binds to the human iNOS mRNA 3&#x02032;-UTR and recruits the exosome to the mRNA, thus enabling mRNA degradation. After cytokine treatment TTP expression and TTP/KSRP interaction are enhanced. In consequence, since TTP does not bind to the iNOS mRNA this is supposed to result in a dislodgement of the KSRP/exosome complex from the iNOS mRNA. As HuR and KSRP compete for the same binding site in the iNOS 3&#x02032;-UTR sequence, this dislodgement of KSRP enhances HuR binding to the iNOS mRNA. This interaction results in an increase in iNOS mRNA stability and thus enhanced iNOS expression.</p><p>Finally complex interactions in a RNA-bp network seem to be required for regulation of human iNOS expression. In this network, KSRP appears to be a key regulator. It connects actions of other RNA-bps like TTP and HuR essential for iNOS mRNA stabilization. Subtle changes within this system may be responsible for the marked induction of iNOS expression after cytokine stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_33_15_4813__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_15_4813__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr W.
