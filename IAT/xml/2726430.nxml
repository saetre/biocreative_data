Using chromosome microdissection/hybrid selection approach we recently isolated a candidate oncogene <italic>CHD1L</italic> from 1q21 region. Our previous study has demonstrated that <italic>CHD1L</italic> had strong oncogenic ability, which could be effectively suppressed by siRNA against <italic>CHD1L</italic>. The molecular mechanism of <italic>CHD1L</italic> in tumorigenesis has been associated with its role in promoting cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>To further investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> oncogenic role of <italic>CHD1L</italic>, <italic>CHD1L</italic> ubiquitous-expression transgenic mouse model was generated. Spontaneous tumor formations were found in 10/41 (24.4&#x00025;) transgenic mice, including 4 HCCs, but not in their 39 wild-type littermates. In addition, alcohol intoxication was used to induce hepatocyte pathological lesions and results found that overexpression of CHD1L in hepatocytes could promote tumor susceptibility in <italic>CHD1L</italic>-transgenic mice. To address the mechanism of <italic>CHD1L</italic> in promoting cell proliferation, DNA content between <italic>CHD1L</italic>-transgenic and wildtype mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) was compared by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry results found that <italic>CHD1L</italic> could facilitate DNA synthesis and G1/S transition through the up-regulation of Cyclin A, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, CDK2, and CDK4, and down-regulation of Rb, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, and p53.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>Taken together, our data strongly support that <italic>CHD1L</italic> is a novel oncogene and plays an important role in HCC pathogenesis</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common solid tumors in the world affecting one million individuals annually <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006727-Llovet1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Activation of oncogene plays critical role in cancer development and one common mechanism of oncogene activation is overexpression caused by DNA amplification. Our previous study showed that amplification of 1q21 is an early event in HCC development, implying that the putative oncogene within this region may play important role in the initiation of HCC pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006727-Wang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, one candidate oncogene, <italic>CHD1L</italic>, was isolated from 1q21 and our previous study has demonstrated its oncogenic ability. In this report, we described the generation and characterization of a <italic>CHD1L</italic>-transgenic mouse model.</p><p><italic>CHD1L</italic> transgenic mouse model established in this study provides a very useful tool for investigating <italic>CHD1L</italic> function and role in cancer development. Two founders (#21 and #38) were capable of transmissing the transgene <italic>CHD1L</italic> to their offspring and Southern blot analysis found that their integrating sites are different. Therefore, these two lines were selected for further study. Spontaneous tumor formation was found only in old <italic>CHD1L</italic>-transgenic mice (over 20 months old), implying that the initiation and progression of HCC carcinogenesis caused by abnormal <italic>CHD1L</italic> expression is a long process. Several different types of tumors were found in <italic>CHD1L</italic>-transgenic mice including HCC, salivary, colon, uterine, and gall bladder adenocarcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Amplification of 1q has been also frequently detected in other solid tumors, including colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006727-He1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, uterine cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006727-Schulten1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, and rhabdomyosarcoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006727-KiuruKuhlefelt1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that <italic>CHD1L</italic> may play an important role in cancer development in many solid tumors.</p><p>To shorten the latency of tumor onset, alcohol intoxication was employed to induce hepatocyte pathological lesions. Alcohol is one the major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in western countries. Alcohol intoxication is a simple but efficient way to induce liver lesions in cancer-prone marine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006727-Pani1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, after 12 weeks alcohol treatment, 5/6 of <italic>CHD1L</italic>-transgenic mice had liver lesions, including HCC, adipoma, and severe dysplasia. However, no obvious precancerous lesion was detected in wildtype controls. In addition, overexpression of CHD1L could increase hepatocyte proliferation and induce AFP expression in transgenic liver post alcohol treatment. These results suggest that overexpression of CHD1L in liver increases the tumor susceptibility.</p><p>Promotion of cell proliferation is a major molecular mechanism of oncogene in cancer development. In this study, we demonstrated that <italic>CHD1L</italic> could facilitate DNA synthesis and promoted G1/S phase transition in <italic>CHD1L</italic>-transgenic MEFs. This result is consistent with our previous finding, in which overexpression of CHD1L in QGY-7703 (HCC cell line) cells could also promote G1/S phase transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006727-Ma1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. To further explore the molecular mechanism of <italic>CHD1L</italic> in cell cycle promotion, expressions of several G1/S phase transition checkpoint related proteins were compared between <italic>CHD1L</italic>-transgenic and wildtype MEFs. The results showed that <italic>CHD1L</italic> could up-regulate Cyclin A, Cyclin D1, CDK2 and CDK4, and down-regulate Rb, p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and p53. p27<sup>Kip1</sup> serves as a key mediator in G1/S transition through Cdk inhibition and regulating the activity of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex which are essential for S phase entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006727-Sherr1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006727-Vogelstein1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The reduced expression of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> facilitates the activation of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex, resulting in the cyclin D-Cdk4/6-medicated Rb phosphorylation and destruction of Rb-E2F binding. The releasing E2F activates the transcription of genes necessary for S phase entry and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006727-Harbour1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Overexpression of CHD1L might serve as mitogenic signal to induce expression of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 and inhibit the expression of p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. In addition, the p53 protein is a transcription factor that upregulates the expression of p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1</sup>, which in turn functions as a Cdk2 inhibitor to control S phase entry via the inactivation of cyclinE-Cdk2 complex. The notable upregulation of Cdk2 in <italic>CHD1L</italic>-transgenic MEFs suggested that the dysregulation of the p53&#x02013;cyclinE-Cdk2 pathway might be also involved in CHD1L-induced G1/S transition. Taken together, the observations in the present study strongly support that <italic>CHD1L</italic> is a novel oncogene responsible for the 1q21 amplification event in HCC and plays an important role in the development of HCC via promoting cell cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of CHD1L-transgenic mice</title><p>For construction of <italic>CHD1L</italic>-transgenic mice, a 2.8-kb <italic>EcoR</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>EcoR</italic>I fragment containing the open reading frame of human <italic>CHD1L</italic> gene (Gene Bank accession no.
