Such enhanced intrinsic excitability is mediated by long-term reduction in the post-burst after-hyperpolarization (AHP) which is generated by repetitive spike firing. AHP reduction is due to decreased conductance of a calcium-dependent potassium current, the sI<sub>AHP</sub>. We have previously shown that learning-induced AHP reduction is maintained by persistent protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) activation. However, the molecular machinery underlying this long-lasting modulation of intrinsic excitability is yet to be fully described. Here we examine whether the CaMKII, which is known to be crucial in learning, memory and synaptic plasticity processes, is instrumental for the maintenance of learning-induced AHP reduction. KN93, that selectively blocks CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr286, reduced the AHP in neurons from trained and control rat to the same extent. Consequently, the differences in AHP amplitude and neuronal adaptation between neurons from trained rats and controls remained. Accordingly, the level of activated CaMKII was similar in pirifrom cortex samples taken form trained and control rats. Our data show that although CaMKII modulates the amplitude of AHP of pyramidal neurons in the piriform cortex, its activation is not required for maintaining learning-induced enhancement of neuronal excitability.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Learning-induced cellular changes can be divided into two general groups: modifications that occur at synapses and modifications in the intrinsic properties of the neurons.

A strong effect of KN93 on the AHP amplitude was apparent within 10 min after the beginning of application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004289-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This relatively short exposure time was sufficient to induce a maximal effect; further exposure for up to one hour did not result with further AHP reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004289-g001">figure 1B</xref>). Thus, in each cell the AHP amplitude measurements were performed prior to and 30 min after KN93 application. KN93 decreased significantly the amplitude of the post burst AHP at the two time point at which it was measured. At the peak of the post burst AHP, the amplitude in neurons from the control group was reduced significantly to 7.37&#x000b1;1.9 mV and in neurons from trained rats to 5.36&#x0002b;1.6 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004289-g002">figure 2A</xref>). These values correspond to an averaged decrease of 11.4&#x00025; in the peak amplitude for control neurons and 9.9&#x00025; for trained neurons. Consequently, after KN93 application, the post burst AHP was still significantly lower in neurons from trained rats (P&#x0003c;0.05). In most piriform cortex pyramidal neurons, the peak of the post burst AHP is mediated by two calcium activated potassium currents, the I<sub>AHP</sub> and the sI<sub>AHP</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004289-Brosh1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

We found that at this time point the effect of KN93 is indeed more pronounced. However, it was similar for neurons from trained rats and controls. At this time point, the amplitude of the AHP in neurons from the control group was reduced significantly from 4.83&#x0002b;3.3 to 3.3&#x0002b;2.0 (p&#x0003c;0.01), and in neurons from trained rats from 2.97&#x0002b;0.8 to 2.02&#x0002b;0.4 (p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004289-g002">figure 2A</xref>). These values correspond to an averaged decrease of 30.5&#x00025; in the AHP amplitude for control neurons and 30.9&#x00025; for trained neurons. Thus, while the effect of the CaMKII blocker is much more pronounced on the late AHP, it is not modified after learning.</p><fig id="pone-0004289-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004289.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>training apparatus and AHP measurements.</title><p>A. Schematic description of the 4-arm maze. Protocols for trained and pseudo- trained rats are similar: an electronic &#x02018;start&#x02019; command opens randomly two out of eight valves (V), releasing a positive-cue odor (P) into one of the arms and a negative-cue odor (N) into another. Eight seconds later, the two corresponding guillotine doors (D) are lifted to allow the rat to enter the selected arms. Upon reaching the far end of an arm (90 cm long), the rat body interrupts an infrared beam (I, arrow) and a drop of drinking water is released from a water hose (W) into a small drinking well (for a trained rat - only if the arm contains the positive-cue odor, for pseudo- trained rat- randomly). A trial ends when the rat interrupts a beam, or in 10 seconds, if no beam is interrupted. A fan is operated for 15 seconds between trials, to remove odors. B.

Behavioral experiments were approved by the university of Haifa institutional committee for animal experiments, in accordance to the NIH guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Training</title><p>Olfactory training consisted of 20 trials per day for each rat as previously described (Saar et al., 2001). In short, in each trial the rat had to choose between two odors (positive- and negative-cue) presented simultaneously. Rats designated to the trained group were rewarded upon choosing the positive cue. Rats in the pseudo-trained group were rewarded in a random fashion, upon choosing any odor. The criterion for learning was at least 80&#x00025; positive-cue choices in the last 10 trials of a training day, as was previously used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004289-Saar2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004289-Saar4">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004289-Zelcer1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Rats in the naive group were water restricted, but not exposed to the maze. Typically, 2&#x02013;3 trained rats and 2&#x02013;3 pseudo-trained rats were trained at the same training period, and all the rats in the trained group had to meet the criteria for the first pair of odors before all trained and pseudo trained rats were exposed to a second pair of odors. Training for a new pair began only after training for the second pair was completed for all rats. Rats were trained to discriminate between 3 pairs of odors, to confirm that rule learning was achieved and to ensure that rats are always sacrificed three days after the last training session. As previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004289-Saar2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004289-Zelcer1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, rats indeed learned the second and third pairs of odors much faster than the first pair (7&#x02013;8 days of training for the first pair and 1&#x02013;2 days for the second and third pairs). A detailed description of OD learning efficacy is described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004289-Zelcer1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Slice preparation, stimulation and recording</title><p>400 &#x000b5;m coronal brain slices were cut as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004289-Saar3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and kept in oxygenated (95&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub>&#x0002b;5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>) normal saline Ringers' (NSR) solution (in mM: NaCl 124, KCl 3, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 2, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2 and glucose 10). Intracellular recordings were obtained from pyramidal cells in layer II of the piriform cortex, with 4M K-Acetate-filled sharp glass microelectrodes, at 35&#x000b0;C. Several piriform cortex slices were obtained from each rat.</p><p>AHPs were recorded within minutes after good recording conditions were established (resting potential of at least &#x02212;65 mV and action potential amplitude of 80 mV or more). To standardize AHP recordings, neurons were depolarized to holding potential of &#x02212;60 mV by direct current application via the recording electrode. Post-burst AHP amplitude was then measured following a 100 ms depolarizing current step with intensity that generates 6 action potentials. The AHP amplitude was determined from average of 8 consecutive measurements of AHP evoked in responses to stimuli applied once every 10 seconds.</p><p>The post-burst AHP amplitude was measured at two points. The first at the peak of the hyperpolarizing voltage deflection that follows an evoked train of six action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004289-g001">figure 1B</xref>) and the second at delay of 200 msec after pulse offset. In these neurons, the peak post-burst AHP amplitude is usually composed of both the I<sub>AHP</sub> and the sI<sub>AHP</sub>, while the later time point reflects the sI<sub>AHP</sub> current only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004289-Brosh1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The stimulus intensity required to evoke 6 action potentials always remained constant throughout the recording period of each neuron, before and after drug application. Such stability of the required stimulus intensity well coincides with the stability of basic membrane properties, such as the neurons' input resistance or resting potential, which are not affected by the drugs.</p><p>The identity of the rat from which neurons were recorded (naive, trained, or pseudo-trained) was not known to the person conducting the experiments and measurements.</p><sec id="s4b1"><title>Kn93 and Kn92 application</title><p>The CaMKII inhibitor Kn93, and its inactive isomer Kn92, were applied via to the perfusing Ringer solution, at the concentration of 10 &#x000b5;M. All cells were recorded before and 30 min after drug application. Usually a maximal effect of Kn93 was observed within 10 min after beginning of application. Application of the inactive form of this inhibitor, Kn92 had no effect on five control neurons, on which it was tested.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p>Rats were trained in olfactory discrimination task and were sacrificed 3 days after the acquisition of the third pair of odors. After decapitation and extraction of the brain from the skull, the piriform cortex was dissected out; Fresh piriform cortex was transferred into glass/glass 5 ml tissue grinder and added with 4 ml. homogenization buffer.

Membranes were bloted with antibodies for CaMKII&#x003b1; (1;1000) or p-CaMKII&#x003b1; Thr 286 (1&#x02236;1000) that were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, California, USA). Goat anti-mouse (IgG) horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated was from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA, USA) and the enhanced chemiluminescense (ECL&#x0002b;) kit from Amersham (Piscataway, NJ, USA). For each gel we performed a cross bloting with the second antibody after striping. Results for both orders were indistinguishable. Quantification was performed using a CCD camera (ChemiDoc XRS -BioRad) and image analyzer (quantity one - BioRad). Each sample was measured relative to the background and phosphorylation levels were calculated as the ratio between the results from the antibody directed against the phospho-proteins divided by the antibody directed against the phosphorylation state-independent form of the proteins. Protein phosphorylation (phospho-protein/protein) is expressed as the ratio between trained and naive values. Values of 1 indicate no difference in protein phosphorylation following behavioral manipulations, while values different from 1 indicate an increase or decrease in phosphorylation.
