Bacterial and mammalian homologs of MutT protein share the phosphohydrolase module (MutT: Gly37&#x02192;Gly59). By saturation mutagenesis of conserved residues in the MutT module, four of the 10 conserved residues (Gly37, Gly38, Glu53 and Glu57) were revealed to be essential to suppress spontaneous A:T&#x02192;C:G transversion mutation in a <italic>mutT</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> mutator strain. For the other six residues (Lys39, Glu44, Thr45, Arg52, Glu56 and Gly59), many positive mutants which can suppress the spontaneous mutation were obtained; however, all of the positive mutants for Glu44 and Arg52 either partially or inefficiently suppressed the mutation, indicating that these two residues are also important for MutT function. Several positive mutants for Lys39, Thr45, Glu56 and Gly59 efficiently decreased the elevated spontaneous mutation rate, as seen with the wild-type, hence, these four residues are non-essential for MutT function. As Lys38 and Glu55 in human MTH1, corresponding to the non-essential residues Lys39 and Glu56 in MutT, could not be replaced by any other residue without loss of function, different structural features between the two modules of MTH1 and MutT proteins are evident.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The <italic>mutT</italic> mutant of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a well characterized mutator mutant with an increased spontaneous occurrence of unidirectional A:T&#x02192;C:G transversion mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c4">4</xref>). MutT protein catalyzes hydrolysis of an oxidized form of dGTP, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2&#x02032;-dGTP (8-oxo-dGTP) to the monophosphate form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c5">5</xref>). The &#x003b1; subunit of <italic>E.coli DNA</italic> polymerase III inserts 8-oxo-dGTP into the nascent strand opposite adenine in the template, the efficiency being almost equal that of cytosine. During the next round of replication the polymerase may insert dCTP opposite previously incorporated 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-G), the result being A:T&#x02192;C:G transversion mutation after another round of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c7">7</xref>).</p><p>Lack of the <italic>mutT</italic> gene increases occurrence not only of this type of transversion mutation in the <italic>E.coli</italic> genome 1000-fold over the wild-type level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c4">4</xref>), it also causes transcriptional errors, an event known as non-genomic mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c8">8</xref>). MutT protein hydrolyzes 8-oxo-GTP, an oxidized form of a ribonucleotide GTP which can be inserted into transcripts by RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c8">8</xref>). These findings indicate that a significant level of oxidation of dGTP&#x0002f;GTP occurs in <italic>E.coli</italic> cells and that MutT eliminates mutagenic nucleotides from nucleotide pools. Thus, MutT protein functions as a guardian for both DNA and RNA synthesis.</p><p>Genes for MutT homolog proteins with dGTPase or 8-oxo-dGTPase activity were identified in <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae,</italic> bacteria distantly related to <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c10">10</xref>). All three MutT homolog proteins have a molecular mass ranging from 13 to 18 kDa, and the degree of identity ranges from 19 to 40&#x00025;. Most of the identical residues are in a region corresponding to the 23-residue sequence from Gly37 to Gly59 of <italic>E.coli</italic> MutT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c11">11</xref>). Structural analyses of the <italic>E.coli</italic> MutT protein revealed that the region containing this 23-residue sequence constitutes the active center of dGTPase, with a loop and an &#x003b1;-helix structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian cells also possess 8-oxo-dGTPase encoded by the <italic>mutT</italic> homolog gene, <italic>MTH1</italic>, and expression of MTH1 protein in <italic>mutT</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells suppresses the increased occurrence of A:T&#x02192;C:G transversion mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c17">17</xref>). Despite functional identity, the MTH1 and MutT proteins share only 30 residues (23&#x00025;), 14 of which constitute the conserved 23-residue module, while the other 16 residues are scattered throughout the molecules. We reported that the 23-residue sequences of human MTH1 and <italic>E.coli</italic> MutT proteins are exchangeable so that they constitute functionally equivalent modules for 8-oxo-dGTPase, designated as the phosphohydrolase module; however, the chimeric MTH1 protein with the 23-residue module of MutT is thermolabile in structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c18">18</xref>). Saturation mutagenesis of the module in MTH1 revealed that six non-conserved residues among MutT homologs are essential for MTH1 function, as are eight of the 10 identical residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c19">19</xref>). These results indicate that the phosphohydrolase module of the MutT and MTH1 proteins is functionally equivalent, yet each possesses unique features of function or structure.</p><p>To better define the unique features of the phosphohydrolase module of MutT, we carried out saturation mutagenesis of the 10 conserved residues in the module. We now provide the first evidence that six conserved residues are essential for MutT function while the other four can be replaced by other residues without loss of function. Among the four non-essential residues, Lys39 and Glu56 correspond to the essential residues Lys38 and Glu55 in MTH1. Different structural features between the two modules of MTH1 and MutT proteins are evident.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>&#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dGTP and <sup>125</sup>I-labeled protein A were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK).

To better understand the roles of the conserved residues in the phosphohydrolase module of <italic>E.coli</italic> MutT, saturation mutagenesis of 10 residues in the module was done, in combination with negative and positive mutant screening, using mutagenesis primers that contain a completely degenerated codon for each residue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd499f1">1</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd499tb1">1</xref>).</p><p>First, we isolated mutants of pHS:MutT that lost the capacity to suppress the mutator phenotype of <italic>E.coli</italic> strain CC101T, and which were designated as negative mutants (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd499tb2">2</xref>). Next, we used as a template one of the negative mutants for each residue in the second round of saturation mutagenesis, the objective being to isolate positive mutants that acquired the capability to suppress the increased occurrence of LacZ<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> reversion in CC101T cells. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd499tb3">3</xref>, mutation rates of CC101T cells harboring negative mutants, used as templates for the second mutagenesis, were as high as that of the cells with vector pBR322.

Expression levels of the negative mutant proteins with missense mutation were lower than that of wild-type MTH1, and low 8-oxo-dGTPase activity was detectable in only a few cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd499f2">2</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd499tb3">3</xref>).</p><p>Negative and positive mutants isolated for each amino acid residue are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd499tb2">2</xref>.

The two residues, Lys39 and Glu56 in MutT correspond to Lys38 and Glu55 in human MTH1 that could not be replaced by any other residue without loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c18">18</xref>); thus, different structural features between the two modules of MTH1 and MutT proteins are evident.</p><p>The 23-residue sequence in <italic>E.coli</italic> MutT constitutes the active center for dGTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c28">28</xref>), and perhaps also for 8-oxo-dGTPase activity. The module consists of loop I (Gly37&#x02192;Thr45) and &#x003b1;-helix I (Pro46&#x02192;Gly59) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c29">29</xref>). The &#x003b1;-helix I in MutT is apparently amphipathic and MutT has two hydrophobic cores, one consisting of Val50, Val51, Leu54 from the helix I clustering with Phe65 and Leu67 from loop II, Val87 from &#x003b2;-strand D and Trp95 from loop III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c29">29</xref>). Interactions between the phosphohydrolase module and other secondary structures may be important to support stability or to provide functional moieties for the active center. It was proposed that residues Gly38, Glu56 and Glu57 in the module of MutT are involved in coordination of enzyme-bound metal (Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>), Glu57 provides the largest contribution (factor &#x0003e;10<sup>5</sup>) to the catalytic power of MutT enzyme and residues Glu53, Arg52 and Lys39 are involved in the catalytic reaction, each residue contributing a factor of 10<sup>4.7</sup>, 10<sup>3.0</sup> and 10<sup>0.9</sup>, respectively, to catalytic power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c30">30</xref>).</p><p>The data presented herein are largely consistent with the proposed mechanism of the MutT pyrophosphohydrolase reaction by Harris <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c30">30</xref>), because residues Gly37, Gly38, Glu44, Arg52, Glu53 and Glu57 cannot be replaced by any other residue without loss of function, and are therefore essential for MutT function. The essential residues are likely to contribute to a factor of &#x0003e;10<sup>3</sup> to the catalytic power of MutT. However, Lys39 and Glu56, whose contribution to MutT catalytic power is a factor of 10<sup>0.9</sup> and 10<sup>1.4</sup>, respectively, can be replaced by other residues without loss of function, thus indicating that the MutT reaction may differ somewhat from the proposed mechanism, as discussed below.</p><p>Lin <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c13">13</xref>) reported that the &#x003b4;-CH<sub>2</sub> of Lys39 on loop I interacts with the hydrophobic face of the ribose ring of &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-methyleneadenosine 5&#x02032;-triphosphate (AMPCPP), and its side chain ammonium group approaches an oxygen of &#x003b1;-phosphoryl group at a distance of 4.7 &#x000b1; 1.1 &#x000c5;. Mutation of Lys39 to Gln results in an 8-fold decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and a 5.3-fold increase in <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>(dGTP) in the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-activated dGTPase reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c30">30</xref>). Based on these data, it was suggested that Lys39 is positioned in the MutT reaction to interact electrostatically with the &#x003b1;-phosphoryl group and thereby facilitate departure of the nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) group.</p><p>In contrast to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c30">30</xref>), we isolated the K39Q mutant as one of the positive mutants for K39ochre which completely suppresses the <italic>mutT</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> mutator phenotype, and retains 58&#x00025; of the level of specific activity for 8-oxo-dGTPase of wild-type MutT. Using saturation mutagenesis combined with negative and positive mutant screening, we isolated seven different positive mutants for Lys39, all of which are stable and retain &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of the specific activity of wild-type MutT. We obtained only two negative mutants, K39ochre (eight clones) and K39P (one clone) from 152 clones examined, and the latter missense mutant, while stable, possesses little 8-oxo-dGTPase activity. Thus, it is likely that most amino acid residues, but not proline, may be able to replace Lys39 without loss of the potential to suppress the <italic>mutT</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> mutator phenotype. Thus, the Lys39 residue is apparently not essential for MutT function. We wish to emphasize that this conclusion can be reached only by using saturation mutagenesis in combination with negative and positive mutant screening.</p><p>For catalytic analysis of MutT, we used 8-oxo-dGTP while other workers used dGTP as substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c30">30</xref>), to which MutT protein exhibits a high <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value (1100 &#x000b5;M), 2200-fold higher than that for 8-oxo-dGTP. With 8-oxo-dGTP, K39Q exhibits &#x0223c;58&#x00025; of the specific activity for wild-type; however, with dGTP its <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> value was decreased 8-fold with a 5.3-fold higher <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value, which means that the specific activity may be &#x0003c;5&#x00025; of the wild-type. We suggest that the MutT protein interacts with dGTP and 8-oxo-dGTP in a different manner, and that Lys39 has a more crucial role for dGTPase than for 8-oxo-dGTPase of MutT.</p><p>8-Oxo-dGTP but not dGTP appears to favor a <italic>syn</italic> conformation at the glycosidic bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c31">31</xref>), and it has been shown that AMPCPP in the quaternary MutT&#x02013;Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;AMPCPP&#x02013;Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> complex takes a high <italic>anti</italic> torsional angle at the glycosylic bond, which is part of the a <italic>syn</italic> conformation near the <italic>syn&#x02013;anti</italic> boundary, with interaction between Lys39 and the ribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c13">13</xref>). Lys39 may be involved in binding to dGTP or AMPCPP but not to 8-oxo-dGTP, thus contributing to dGTP hydrolysis. It is essential to analyze interactions between MutT and 8-oxo-dGTP or its non-hydrolyzable derivatives in order to delineate substrate recognition by MutT. Identification of a negative mutant, K39P MutT, suggests that substitution of Lys39 for proline altered its secondary structure because the proline residue assumes only two fixed angles in the polypeptide. While loop I seems flexible in structure with most amino acid residues, proline may destroy the flexibility, leading to loss of catalytic potential.</p><p>It has been proposed that Glu56 contributes to metal binding in the active quaternary complex and its contribution to the catalytic power of MutT enzyme is calculated to be a factor of 10<sup>1.4</sup>, as based on the data from mutants E56D or E56Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c30">30</xref>). In the present work, we isolated E56V as a positive mutant for Glu56. This mutant retained the full capability to suppress the increased mutation rates in <italic>mutT</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells, to the level of the wild-type. Since no positive mutant was isolated for the essential residue, Glu57, which is likely to contribute a factor of &#x0003e;10<sup>5.0</sup> to the catalytic power of MutT enzyme as a ligand-to-metal residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c30">30</xref>), we suggest that Glu56 is not crucial as a ligand-to-metal residue, or rather that valine at the 56th position can act as an efficient ligand-to-metal residue.</p><p>We reported that the chimeric MTH1 protein carrying the phosphohydrolase module of MutT is functional but thermolabile, suggesting that phosphohydrolase modules of MutT and MTH1 have different features regarding function or structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c18">18</xref>). The functional significance of each conserved residue in the module of MutT is mostly equivalent to that of MTH1 protein, because six and eight out of 10 conserved residues are essential for MutT and MTH1 function, respectively, and two non-essential residues, Thr45&#x0002f;Thr44 and Gly59&#x0002f;Gly58 are shared between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c19">19</xref>). However, we found differences in the requirement of Lys38&#x0002f;Lys39 and Glu55&#x0002f;Glu56 for MTH1&#x0002f;MutT reaction, that is, these two residues are essential in human MTH1 but not in MutT, as summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd499f3">3</xref>. This may be due to different semi- or non-conserved residues between MTH1 and MutT in or surrounding the modules, which may build up a different microenvironment for each phosphohydrolase module. We reported that some of the semi- or non-conserved residues in MTH1 are essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c18">18</xref>). Thus, there are different structural features between the phosphohydrolase modules of MTH1 and MutT proteins, and saturation mutagenesis of the semi- and non-conserved residues in the module of MutT protein is expected to reveal their molecular basis.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd499f3">3</xref>, the residues in MTH1 corresponding to the Gly37, Gly38, Lys39, Glu44, Arg52, Glu53, Glu56 and Glu57 in MutT are essential in MTH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c19">19</xref>). In our recent NMR analysis of MTH1 (N.Itoh, M.Mishima, Y.Nakabeppu and M.Shirakawa, unpublished results), we found that MTH1 essentially has a tertiary structure similar to that previously proposed based on computer analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c32">32</xref>). We suggest that the proposed mechanism of pyrophosphohydrolase reaction for MutT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd499c30">30</xref>) may be applicable to the MTH1 reaction. That is, Lys38 in MTH1 interacts electrostatically with the &#x003b1;-phosphoryl group of 8-oxo-dGTP and thereby facilitates the departure of the 8-oxo-dGMP group, or Glu55 in MTH1 plays a crucial role as a ligand-to-metal residue. To demonstrate this model of MutT or MTH1, it will be necessary to analyze protein complexes with 8-oxo-dGTP or 8-oxo-dGDP, a non-hydrolysable substrate of MTH1.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd499f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Schematic representation of saturation mutagenesis.
