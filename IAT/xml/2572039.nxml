Tumor cells adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is the first step to the tumor metastasis. MMPs degrade the ECM to promote tumor metastasis. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against CD147 (si-CD147) on hepatocellular carcinoma cells' (SMMC-7721) architecture and functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Flow cytometry and western blot assays were employed to detect the transfection efficiency of si-CD147. Confocal microscopy was used to determine the effects of si-CD147 on SMMC-7721 cells' cytoskeleton. Invasion assay, gelatin zymography and cell adhesion assay were employed to investigate the effects of si-CD147 on SMMC-7721 cells' invasion, gelatinase production and cell adhesive abilities. Western blot assay was utilized to detect the effects of si-CD147 on focal adhesion kinase (FAK), vinculiln and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression in SMMC-7721 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Downregulation of CD147 gene induced the alteration of SMMC-7721 cell cytoskeleton including actin, microtubule and vimentin filaments, and inhibited gelatinase production and expression, cells invasion, FAK and vinculin expression. si-CD147 also blocked SMMC-7721 cells adhesion to collagen IV and phosphorylation level of SAPK/JNKs. SAPK/JNKs inhibitor SP600125 inhibited gelatinase production and expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CD147 is required for normal tumor cell architecture and cell invasion. Downregulation of CD147 affects HCC cell structure and function. Moreover, the alteration of cell behavior may be related to SAPK/JNK Pathway. siRNA against CD147 may be a possible new approach for HCC gene therapy.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>CD147 is a member of immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that takes an essential role in several normal tissues but is particularly enriched on the surface of malignant tumor cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. CD147 stimulates production of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by fibroblasts and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Gelatinase, including MMP-2 and MMP-9, is one of the important MMPs and has been proposed to participate in human tumor invasion and metastasis. Other names for CD147 include human basigin, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), and human leukocyte activation-associated M6 antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Homologues in other species include rat OX-47 antigen, mouse basigin or gp42 and chicken HT7 molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. CD147 has been thought to act outside the cell, primarily through MMPs, even though CD147 has also been shown to interact with several different molecules suggesting that at a molecular level it may be multifunctional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Lim et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] found that EMMPRIN up-regulated MMP-1 mRNA expression, which was dependent on tyrosine kinase activity. Our previous studies have demonstrated that HAb18G/CD147 stimulates fibroblast cells to produce elevated levels of several MMPs, including MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9, which are well known for prompting invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and antisense RNA of HAb18G/CD147 inhibited the invasion of HCC cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The expression of HAb18G/CD147 reduced the sensitivity of the store-operated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>entry to NO/cGMP and enhanced the metastatic potentials of HCC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our previous work has identified 9 binding peptides by screening a random 12-mer phage peptide library. The roles of these peptides inhibiting HCC cell invasion, adhesion and angiogenesis were analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Metastasis formation is a multistep process that requires tumor cells to progress through many different stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Proteolysis of the extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as increased locomotion, leads to intravasation and dissemination of tumor cells. Experimental evidences have shown that cancer cells are armed with an array of proteolytic enzymes that appear to be essential for the process of cancer dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Tumor cell adhesion, deformability, motility, and cell receptors also play important roles in cancer invasion.</p><p>In all mammalian cells, the cytoskeleton is represented by three types of filamentous structures, including actin microfilaments (AFs), intermediate filaments (IFs), and microtubules (MFs). The cytoskeleton is a dynamic cell's internal filamentous network whose formation and remodeling underlies the fundamental processes of cell motility and shape determination. The cytoskeleton not only has function in maintaining cell shape, also involves in cell motility and mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Tumor cell motility is a critical step in tumor invasion and metastasis. In particular, it is known that membrane-associated cytoskeletal proteins are required for tumor cell movement and infiltration to surrounding tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Vinculin, which is one kind of cytoskeletal proteins involved in formation of the cytoplasmic scaffolding, takes an important role in cell adhesion and migration by providing the link between the actin cytoskeleton and the transmembrane receptors, integrin and cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Vinculin can regulate the ability of cancer cells to move away from tumors and spread cancer to other parts of the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. FAK is a critical regulator of cell adhesion and migration and active FAK can recruit additional structural and signaling molecules to contribute to the assembly of focal adhesion complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily is composed of three major sets of kinases, namely, the extracellular-receptor kinases (ERK), the stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (SAPK/JNKs) and the p38 MAPKinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. SAPK/JNKs are members of the MAPK family and are activated by a variety of environmental stresses. SAPK signaling cascade is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes and the research has recently demonstrated a functional role for SAPK in the suppression of metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi) technology has been rapidly adopted for the discovery and validation of gene function through the use of a sequence-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA), which was originally identified as 21&#x02013;23-nucleotide double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) fragments, generated by a cellular enzyme called Dicer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The use of RNAi is spreading rapidly to nearly every aspect of biomedical research. The gene silencing capability of RNAi is being used to study individual gene's biological function and role in biochemical pathways.</p><p>Our previous studies have showed that siRNA of CD147 inhibited HAb18G/CD147 expression in HCC cells by RT-PCR and the inhibitory rate was more than 70% (the results have been submitted). Recently, our results showed that dsRNA targeted for CD147 inhibits MMP-2 secretion and FAK expression in HCC cell line FHCC98 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The results of microarray results showed that downregulation of CD147 leads to some cytoskeletal genes alteration (the results have been submitted).</p><p>Although many studies on CD147 functions have been widely carried out, the mechanism of tumor metastasis induced by CD147 is still not clear, especially in HCC. In order to further explore the mechanism, we employed RNAi method to study the effects of si-CD147 on HCC cell cytoskeleton, cell invasion, cell adhesion, the expression of vinculin, FAK and MAPK. Our data indicated that si-CD147 inhibited HCC cells' invasion, adhesion, gelatinase production and induced cytoskeleton alteration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Human HCC cell line SMMC-7721 was obtained from China Centre for Type Culture Collection, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Thus, a potentiality of regulating tumor cell invasion and metastasis by controlling actin cytoskeleton to control cell migration has been provided. Although there are many factors to regulate cell motility, the bundling and subcellular distribution of the actin cytoskeleton directly determines cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In this study the siRNA targeted CD147 was designed and synthesized and the effects of si-CD147 on SMMC-7721 cell's invasive abilities and cytoskeleton were investigated. Our findings showed that si-CD147 induced SMMC-7721 cytoskeleton alteration including actin, tubulin and viment filaments. Recently, in our lab the results of microarray results showed that downregulation of CD147 leads to some cytoskeletal genes alteration, such as vimentin gene is upreglated more than twice in hepatocellar carcinoma cells transfected si-CD147 (data not shown). Tsai WC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] showed that actin and vimentin expression in breast phyllodes tumors correlates with tumor grades of the WHO grading system. Recent reports have reported the expression of vimentin in numerous neoplasms, including melanoma, which has been linked to metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It has been reported by the University of Iowa Health Care research group and by others that the co-expression of vimentin along with keratins in human melanoma is associated with recurrent and metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Khunkeawla et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] studied that U937 cell aggregation induced by CD147 mAbs is associated with cytoskeleton reorganization and the results showed that cell aggregation induced by the engagement of CD147 with specific mAbs depended upon the activation of protein kinases and a functional cytoskeleton. Together with the recent findings that antibodies to CD147 also neutralize cell aggregation mediated by CD98 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], it may be speculated that CD147 plays a central role in cellular events associated with cytoskeleton rearrangement. Curtin et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] showed that D-basigin is necessary for cell to maintain normal architecture. D-basigin (EMMPRIN/CD147) interacts with integrin to affect cellular architecture and D-basigin partially colocalizes with actin in High Five cells. Schlosshauer, et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] was also previously reported that D-basigin partially colocalizes with actin in chick retinal pigment epithelium.</p><p>Tumor cell invasion and adhesion are very critical steps in tumor metastasis. In this study, the invasive abilities of SMMC-7721 cells were inhibited by si-CD147. The results further confirm that CD147 plays critical roles in tumor cell invasion. Wang, et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] showed that downregulation of CD147 by RNAi decreased the invasive capability of prostate cancer cells. Tumor cell metastasis involves a complex series of interdependent events, including repeated invasion of basement membranes (BM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The major component of the BM is known to be collagen IV. The results showed that si-CD147 inhibited SMMC-7721 cells adhesion to collagen IV but not FN and LN. This suggests that si-CD147 may inhibit specific receptors of collagen IV. Two specific receptor molecules of collagen IV, &#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 have been identified. Integrin &#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 are the key regulators of hepatocarcinoma cell invasion across the fibrotic matrix microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Vinculin is a highly conserved cytoskeletal protein that is essential for regulation of cell morphology and migration, and is a critical component of both cell-cell and cell-matrix complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The results of this study showed that si-CD147 inhibited vinculin expression. It indicates the decrease of vinculin expression maybe affects both cell-cell and cell-matrix complexes formation and finally influences SMMC-7721 cell motility and adhesion. Kuroda, <italic>et al</italic>, has reported that vinculin may serve as a useful marker of renal neoplasms with collecting duct system phenotype such as chromophobe-type renal cell carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Focal adhesion formation is an essential step in cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our data also showed that si-CD147 inhibited FAK expression in SMMC-7721. A number of reports have showed that Elevated FAK expression has been linked to the increased invasive potential of human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Lu, <italic>et al </italic>has reported that downregulation of FAK activity might be essential and required for early metastatic spreading, enabling vascular circulation of tumor cells without adhesion. Once tumor cells reattach to the ECM, integrin stimulation of FAK promotes adhesion and the growth of a metastatic tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>SAPKs/JNKs function in a protein kinase cascade transducing cellular stress signals and are activated by a highly diverse group of extracellular signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Simon, et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] showed that SAPK pathway regulates the expression of the MMP-9 collagenase via AP-1-dependent promoter activation. Our results showed that siRNA of CD147 inhibited phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK. It suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent MAP kinases SAPK/JNK but not ERK 1/2 and p38 kinases control the response to CD147. Moreover, SAPK/JNK specific inhibitor SP600125 blocked gelatinase expression and production, so it indicated that SAPK/JNK maybe participated in regulating gelatinase production.</p><p>Lim, et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] studied that EMMPRIN-mediated stimulation of MMP-1 synthesis in human lung fibroblasts is dependent on the activity of the MAP kinase, p38, but not ERK1/2 or SAPK/JNK. Si-CD147 inhibits phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK, which further confirms that gelatinase expression induced by CD147 depends on SAPK/JNK pathway. Our previous findings indicated that siRNA targeted against HAb18G/CD147 inhibits ERK1/2 pathway in HCC cell line FHCC98 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The disparity may be related to different siRNA sequence and different cell lines, and the further mechanism is under study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CD147 is required for normal tumor cell architecture and cell invasion. siRNA targeted to CD147 inhibited HCC cell invasion, adhesion to Collagen IV and gelatinase production, and affected cytoskeleton structure. Moreover, the inhibition of gelatinase production may be related to the downregulation of phosphorylation-dependent SAPK/JNK.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>MMPs: matrix metalloproteinase; ECM: extracellular matrix; dsRNA: double-stranded RNA; siRNA: small interfering RNA; si-CD147: siRNA against CD147; HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma; FN: fibronectin; LN: laminin; EMMPRIN: extracellular matrix metallproteinase inducer; FAK: focal adhesion kinase; AFs: actin microfilaments; MFs: microtubules filaments; IFs: intermediate filaments; BM: basement membranes; FAK: focal adhesion kinase; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK: extracellular-receptor kinases; SAPK/JNKs: stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinases.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>My coauthors and I have no financial or other conflicts of interest that might influence the results or interpretation of our study.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ARQ and PS carried out the design of the study, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
