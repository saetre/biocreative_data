Mutations in <italic>Perk </italic>(EIF2AK3) underlies the complex genetic disorder of the Wolcott Rallison syndrome, which includes permanent neonatal diabetes (PND), exocrine pancreas deficiency, growth retardation, hepatic dysfunctions, and skeletal dysplasias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. All of the dysfunctions in WRS are mirrored in mice deficient for PERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and detailed genetic studies in mice have shown that the diabetes is caused by the loss of expression of PERK in the insulin secreting beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], whereas the exocrine pancreas deficiency is caused by the absence of PERK in the pancreatic acinar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The initial interpretation of the molecular basis of these dysfunctions in humans and mice was based upon studies performed in vitro with cultured fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These studies showed that the catalytic domain of PERK resides in the cytoplasm where it phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2 alpha, which results in either repression of global protein synthesis or activation of translation of specific mRNAs encoding gene regulatory proteins. PERK regulatory domain resides in the lumen of the ER and is controlled by the binding of the ER chaperone proteins, GRP78/BiP and GRP94, and calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Disturbances in the ER such as ER stress and accumulation of unfolded proteins, or normal physiological changes in calcium levels can activate PERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Based upon these studies it was proposed that PND in humans and mice deficient in PERK was caused by uncontrolled ER stress and apoptotic cell death of the beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However a recent comprehensive analysis of the islet and beta cell development revealed that the cause of diabetes in <italic>Perk </italic>deficient mice is due to failure to expand beta cell mass and defects in beta cell development and insulin secretion during the critical fetal and neonatal periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus three distinct defects are seen in <italic>Perk</italic>-deficient beta cells, which raises questions about the causal connection and progression of beta cell dysfunction. The chronic loss of PERK expression over the four-week period between when defects in beta cell development are first seen during the fetal stage and the onset of overt diabetes three weeks after birth confounds resolving these questions and determining the molecular basis of the defects in <italic>Perk</italic>-deficient mice. To investigate the acute effects of PERK ablation we have expressed a dominant negative mutation of <italic>Perk </italic>in the transformed INS1 832/13 beta cell line. We found that acute ablation of PERK in 832/13 beta cells mimics all of the defects seen in the beta cells of <italic>Perk</italic>-deficient mice and detailed temporal studies suggest that defects in the function of the endoplasmic reticulum may give rise to the defects in beta cell developmental and proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Ablation of PERK in INS1 832/13 beta cells results in reduced insulin gene expression, insulin content, and insulin secretion</title><p>To investigate the acute effects of ablating PERK expression, the transformed rat INS 832/13 insulin-secreting beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] were transduced with a dominant negative mutant of <italic>Perk </italic>using the adenoviral vector (<italic>AdDNPerk</italic>) yielding <italic>AdDNPerk</italic>-832/13 beta cells.

These defects include reduced cell proliferation (without changes in cell death), reduced expression of proinsulin and insulin, reduced glucose-stimulated insulin-secretion, and abnormal retention of proinsulin in the ER leading some cells to have a highly distended ER. That these defects underlie the cause of neonatal diabetes in <italic>Perk KO </italic>mice, and by inference in humans with the Wolcott Rallison syndrome, was shown by the study of tissue-specific <italic>Perk KO </italic>mice and the ability of a beta cell specific-Perk transgene to rescue diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Given the close correspondence of cellular pathology of the <italic>AdDNPerk</italic>-832/13 beta cells to the beta cells of <italic>Perk KO </italic>mice, we were encouraged to take advantage of cultured beta cells to elucidate the molecular function of PERK in regulating beta cell development and physiology.</p><p>Acute ablation of Perk, afforded by transduction of the dominant negative <italic>Perk </italic>transgene, allowed us to determine the progress and order of the ensuing defects over time. As we had seen in <italic>Perk KO </italic>mice, the expression of insulin synthesis genes <italic>Ins-1</italic>, <italic>Ins-2</italic>, and <italic>MafA</italic>) and cell cycle genes was reduced but the reduction in their expression lagged behind the induction of the ER chaperone genes <italic>ERp72 </italic>and <italic>GRP78/BiP </italic>thus suggesting that a perturbation in the ER may result in repression of genes involved in beta cell function and proliferation. Initial reports showing that loss of PERK function resulted in neonatal diabetes in humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] suggested that the molecular defect was related to the function of PERK in the regulation of the ER stress - Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Our extensive analyses of <italic>Perk</italic>-deficient beta cells in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and in <italic>AdDNPerk</italic>-832/13 beta cells in culture have not supported this hypothesis. The original hypothesis assumed that global protein synthesis would be derepressed as a direct consequence of the absence of PERK, and that this would result in uncontrolled protein synthesis and overloading of the ER culminating in apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although the ER in <italic>Perk</italic>-deficient beta cells show marked accumulation of proinsulin, we found that global protein synthesis was not elevated nor was there an elevation in the proinsulin content in beta cells. Cell death did not increase, but instead cell proliferation was ablated. Moreover, the expression of <italic>ERp72 </italic>and <italic>GRP78/BiP </italic>was still induced in <italic>AdDNPerk</italic>-832/13 beta cells after blocking protein synthesis with cyclohexamide suggesting that their induction was not due to protein overload.</p><p>ERp72 and GRP78/BiP are positively regulated and insulin gene expression is negatively regulated by ATF6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and we found that the processed nuclear form of ATF6 was substantially increased in PERK-ablated AD293 cells. Treatment of cells with Brefeldin-A also induces the processing of the ATF6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], which is caused by relocalization of the S2P protease from the Golgi to the ER. We found that the S2P protease is indeed mislocalized in PERK-ablated AD293 cells and is associated with ER markers (Gupta, et al. unpublished data), which suggests that the increased basal level of the nuclear form of ATF6 is due to mislocalization of the proteases that cleave precursor ATF6 rather than by ER stress. Further studies are required to confirm the importance of these findings in insulin-secreting beta cells.</p><p>In addition to its role in repressing global protein synthesis during ER stress, PERK positively regulates the translation of ATF4, which in turn upregulates GADD153/CHOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Mutations in these downstream genes, however, do not lead to diabetes in mice, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] thus arguing against the hypothesis that diabetes associated with <italic>Perk </italic>deficiency is related to the role of PERK in regulating the unfolded protein response. Considerable evidence suggests that PERK is important for mediating the ER stress response in adult beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], but we argue that the primary function of PERK in beta cells is to regulate beta cell development and function during the fetal-neonatal period. Interestingly IRE1, another mediator of the ER stress response, has also been shown to have an important beta cell function by positively regulating insulin biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>We speculate that the Impacted-ER phenotype, characterized by gross distension of the endoplasmic reticulum and abnormal retention of proinsulin observed in <italic>Perk</italic>-deficient beta cells, represents the extreme manifestation of ER dysfunction. The induction of ERp72 and GRP/78 mRNA expression is the first hint of ER dysfunction, and is followed by increased levels of these proteins and the oxidized isoform of ERp72 and ERp57. The increased oxidized isoforms of ERp72 and ERp57 suggests that redox state of the ER is abnormal or that the oxidation and reduction of protein disulfides is imbalanced. The formation of disulfide bonds is essential for the proper folding proinsulin and subsequent maturation of insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The protein disulfide isomerase family including ERp72, PDI, and ERp57, mediate their oxidative protein folding functions by forming transient mixed disulfides with ER client proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] such as proinsulin. In addition to catalyzing the proper folding of proteins in preparation for transport from the ER to the Golgi, the PDI enzymes participate in ER associated protein degradation (ERAD) by reducing thiols of misfolded proteins in preparation for retrotranslocation to the cytoplasm for proteosomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Recently Forster and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] have shown that ERp72 and PDI have opposing functions in the ER. ERp72 assists proper protein folding whereas PDI facilitates unfolding of misfolded proteins in preparation for proteosomal degradation. We propose that PERK regulates the expression of key genes that encode ER redox and protein folding functions in the insulin-secreting beta cells during the dynamic metabolic changes that occur during the developmental transitions through embryonic, fetal, neonatal, and juvenile stages. PERK enzyme activity is regulated through its ER luminal domain via binding of GRP78/BiP complexed with calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Physiological changes in ER calcium modulate PERK activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] as well as insulin secretion. The regulation of ER calcium is coupled to the redox state of specific ER proteins including SERCA, the major ER calcium pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We speculate that PERK acts as an ER calcium sensor that couples ER functions of folding, quality control, and protein trafficking that are intimately tied to the redox state of the ER as a function of the dynamic changes in the physiological environment of the beta cell during the early developmental transitions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that acute ablation of PERK in the transformed 832/13 beta cell line leads to reduced proliferation and reduced insulin gene expression, insulin content, and insulin secretion, demonstrating that acute ablation of PERK recapitulates the major cellular and molecular defects seen in <italic>Perk KO </italic>mice. In addition proinsulin accumulates abnormally in the ER, which occurs after the elevation of two key chaperone proteins GRP78/BiP and ERp72. ERp72 accumulates in a sub compartment of the ER and its oxidized isoform is substantially increased. Because the changes in the expression of GRP78/BiP and ERp72 are the earliest changes observed after ablation of <italic>Perk</italic>, we suggest that ER dysfunctions give rise to defects in proinsulin trafficking, insulin secretion, and cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>INS-1 832/13 insulin-secreting beta cells were obtained from Dr. Christopher Newgard (Duke University).

Non-transfected cells were treated with 10 mM DTT or 5 mM diamide for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C as reduced and oxidized controls.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p>(ERAD): endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation; (eIF2&#x003b1;): eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 alpha.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DF carried out the cellular and molecular biology experiments and wrote the original draft of the manuscript.
