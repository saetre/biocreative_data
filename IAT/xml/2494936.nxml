A series of different experimental strategies suggests that blockage of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation induces <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA hypermethylation. Previous data showed that inhibition of PARP<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7">6</xref> activity introduces an anomalous hypermethylated pattern in genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>) and in some CpG island regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), suggesting that in the absence of ADP-ribose polymers some DNA regions are no longer protected from methylation. Further experiments showed that PARP activity can also affect the methylation pattern of transfected foreign DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). The combined results of these different experimental approaches allowed us to propose the first method to induce DNA hypermethylation <italic>in vivo</italic> by treatment of cells in culture with PARP activity inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) and to study by atomic force microscopy the effect of the addition of new methyl groups to DNA on chromatin structure <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>).</p><p>To provide an explanation for how ADP-ribose polymers control and/or protect DNA methylation patterns, several experimental approaches were used. A mechanism has been suggested in which PARP-1 in its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated isoform makes DNMT1 catalytically inactive and, thus, inefficient in DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). In this model modified PARP-1 is considered as a molecular adaptor of high negative charge onto which chromatin proteins can be attracted and hosted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Several proteins show a greater affinity for ADP-ribose polymers than for DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), so that these polymers compete with DNA for binding of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). This noncovalent link, which is very strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), is not specifically guided by an attraction between charges; proteins showing high affinity for ADP-ribose polymers have an amino acid domain that is responsible for the interaction with these polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Deeper analysis demonstrated that the affinity of the noncovalent PAR interactions with specific binding proteins depends on the PAR chain length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>).</p><p>Dnmt1 possesses two possible consensus amino acid domains for binding with ADP-ribose polymers and shows a very strong affinity for PARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments have shown that the interaction between DNMT1 and ADP-ribose polymers is stable even in the presence of a 30-fold excess of double strand DNA. Furthermore, the ADP-ribose polymers on automodified PARP-1 almost completely inhibit the catalytic activity of DNMT1, whereas unmodified PARP-1 is not able to inhibit the enzyme. These data, taken together with the facts that PARP-1 and DNMT1 co-immunoprecipitate <italic>in vivo</italic> and that in this complex PARP-1 is in its modified form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>), suggest that modified PARP-1, trapping DNMT1 through the ADP-ribose polymers, is responsible for the catalytic inactivation of the enzyme in chromatin. This mechanism could be responsible for the protection of the nonmethylated state of CpG islands. In such a scenario, the lack of proper (ADP-ribosyl)ation may lead to new aberrant methylation; in other words, inhibition of PARP activity could allow new methyl groups to be inserted onto DNA. An additional mechanism involved in the functional interplay between PARP and DNA methylation is implied by the observation that inhibition of PARP activity increases both mRNA and protein levels of Dnmt1, the major maintenance methyltransferase, at the G<sub>1</sub>/S phase border, anomalously increasing the formation of the active complex PCNA-Dnmt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>).</p><p>To establish whether poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by itself is involved in the regulation of the promoter region of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> gene or of another gene whose product is, in turn, involved in the regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression, we looked at transcription factors that undergo covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). CTCF, the highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed nuclear factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), attracted our attention as this protein, which is one of the major players in imprinting and insulator processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>), brings together the following two epigenetic events in which we are interested: poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA methylation. As a chromatin insulator, CTCF links specific consensus sequences located in imprinting control regions. Importantly, it is able to link these regions only if they are unmethylated; furthermore, CTCF binding protects them from <italic>de novo</italic> methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). It has recently been shown that CTCF, in the control of imprinting, binds the consensus sequences in its covalently poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) (the ADP-ribose polymers, present on the N-terminal region of CTCF, increase its molecular mass from 130 to 180 kDa). The functional importance of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the control of imprinting has been shown by experiments in which treatment of cells with 3-aminobenzamide, a competitive inhibitor of PARP activity, affects insulator function of most of the CTCF target sites. Further studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>) indicate that following ectopic overexpression of full-length CTCF, the 180-kDa CTCF poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated form localizes to the nucleolus; the use of 3-aminobenzamide suggests that translocation of CTCF to the nucleolus is dependent on poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, and it is the epigenetic event involved in the control of transcription from rDNA in the nucleolus. The N-terminal domain of CTCF, which is the one that undergoes poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, seems to be necessary in determining the severe inhibition of cell proliferation and clonogenicity observed following ectopic overexpression of CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>).</p><p>Our present data provide, for the first time, evidence that CTCF is involved in the cross-talk between poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA methylation. Here we show by transient ectopic overexpression of CTCF and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments the following. (<italic>a</italic>) PAR accumulation is increased without higher <italic>Parp-1</italic> and <italic>Parp-2</italic> mRNA and protein expression. (<italic>b</italic>) PARP-1 and CTCF become poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated. (<italic>c</italic>) CTCF is capable <italic>per se</italic> of activating PARP-1 automodification. (<italic>d</italic>) CTCF interacts with PARP-1 both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. (<italic>e</italic>) DNA methyltransferase activity is inhibited without down-regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA and/or decrease of its nuclear level. (<italic>f</italic>) Genomic DNA is diffusely hypomethylated, and severe widespread hypomethylation characterizes both centromeric and B1 repetitive DNA sequences. (<italic>g</italic>) Overexpression of CTCF in PARP-1<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> cells shows direct involvement of PARP-1 in CTCF-induced PAR synthesis. As CTCF does not affect <italic>per se</italic> the activity of DNMT1, these data altogether confirm the important role played by PARs on DNMT1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cell Culture, Treatments, and Transfection</italic>&#x02014;L929 mouse fibroblasts and A1 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PARP-1<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup>) were maintained as subconfluent culture in high glucose (4.5 g/liter) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, with 10% fetal calf serum (Cambrex Corp.), 2 m<sc>M L</sc>-glutamine (Cambrex Corp.), and 50 units/ml Pen-Strep (Cambrex Corp.).

The use of anti-PAR antibodies showed that CTCF overexpression induced PARP activity, leading to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of chromatin proteins, including PARP-1. Anti-CTCF antibodies allowed the identification of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated form of CTCF as a band running at &#x0223c;180 kDa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref><italic>, top panel</italic>); it was impossible to detect this band using the anti-ADP-ribose polymer antibodies because the smearing of polymers, which occurs following PARP-1 automodification, covers the molecular weight region corresponding to the 180 kDa of the modified CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). PARP-1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation increased with CTCF overexpression time with a maximum reached at 48 h.

Recombinant PARP-1 was incubated in the presence or absence of different amounts of recombinant <italic>bv</italic>CTCF under conditions that are typically adopted to induce PARP-1 automodification. The immunometric PARP-1 activity assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>) was carried out in the presence of human recombinant PARP-1 and DNase I-activated DNA without (<italic>lane 1</italic>) or with (<italic>lane 2</italic>) PJ-34 (20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), a competitive inhibitor of PARP activity. DNase I-activated DNA is DNA on which some nicks are present, this condition being necessary to induce the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the nick-sensor PARP-1.

It was surprising that CTCF acted as an activator of PARP-1 modification <italic>per se</italic>, being able to induce poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1 even in the absence of nicked DNA, which is required to allow PARP-1 activity. The presence of CTCF reduces the effect of the competitive inhibitor PJ-34, meaning that there may be conformational change of PARP-1. In fact, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1 was not completely inhibited by a PJ-34 concentration of 20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref> refers to the radiometric assay carried out in presence of [<sup>3</sup>H]NAD.

This assay confirms the finding that CTCF is capable <italic>per se</italic> of inducing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1 even in absence of activated DNA. In fact, the presence of CTCF at 0.4 pmol allows &#x0223c;8.5-fold increase in the modification of PARP-1.

We expected that this condition would induce permanent inhibition of Dnmt1 and consequently genomic DNA hypomethylation. We thus tested whether the increased amount of modified PARP-1 influenced the endogenous DNA methyltransferase activity. The activity assay, carried out on nuclear extracts obtained from cells ectopically overexpressing CTCF and the respective control cells, showed that DNA methyltransferase activity decreased by about 65&#x02013;70% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>).

In physiological conditions, the active, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 molecules constitute a small proportion of the total population of PARP-1 molecules, whereas upon injury to the cell, the number of active PARP-1 molecules increases causing an up to 500 times higher level of PARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). In this environment PARP-1 plays an important role as it is responsible for about 90% of PAR production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). However, the basal level of polymers is rapidly restored thanks to the intervention of PARG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>), which shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>), digesting the excess of nuclear PARs in a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>A possible model describing the sequence of events occurring in cells following CTCF ectopic overexpression.</bold> CTCF activates (<italic>gray arrow</italic>) PARP-1 inducing its automodification and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of CTCF and of other nuclear proteins yet to be identified. The persistence of PARs in the nuclear environment induces &#x0201c;stable&#x0201d; inhibition of Dnmt1 activity. Modified PARP-1, binding noncovalently the Dnmt1, inhibits its enzymatic activity, and as a consequence, the genomic DNA becomes widely hypomethylated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0340845820005"></graphic></fig></p><p>Over the years, it has been shown that the decrease and increase of PAR level can both threaten the normal cellular physiology. Treatment of cells with competitive inhibitors of PARP activity has demonstrated that delay in DNA damage repair and genomic instability occur when nuclear levels of PARs are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Research on cells knocked out for PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>) or PARP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>), the two best-known members of the PARP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), has indicated that both enzymes are involved in the mechanism of DNA damage repair: knocking out of either enzyme is not lethal, whereas the cell cannot survive the double knock-outs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). Likewise harmful is the accumulation of PARs, which is even perceived as a signal for cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). Cell death, observed when PAR level is high, has long been attributed to NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion and thus to energy insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). Without excluding that more than one event leads to cellular death, it has been shown that PARs by themselves cause cell mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). Cytoplasmic long and branched polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>), interacting with mitochondrial membrane stimulate the release of the pro-apoptotic factor AIF, an apoptotic signal downstream of PARP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>).</p><p>In the above-mentioned research attention was focused on what happens to the cell when high levels of PARs are present in the cytosol. We have focused our attention on events that occur in the nucleus. Based on our experimental data, we suggest a model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) that depicts the order in which molecular events take place. The starting point is when the increased nuclear level of CTCF induces a higher level of nuclear PARs. It is surprising that at all observation times, 24, 48, and 72 h following ectopic transfection of CTCF, the nuclear level of PARs remained high not depending on an increased PARP-1 expression, even though the PAR level returns to basal level in a few minutes following stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>).</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> experiments show that CTCF is by itself capable of activating PARP-1. This activation happens even in absence of activated DNA, and this is different from YY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>) and VP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of the PJ-34 inhibitor is diminished in presence of CTCF. Co-immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiments confirmed interaction between CTCF and PARP-1 both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Our previous data show that both free PARs and PARs present on modified PARP-1, through a noncovalent interaction with DNMT1, inhibit its enzymatic activity. Here we investigated whether prolonged elevated PAR levels could stably inhibit the activity of Dnmt1. We show that DNA methyltransferase activity is decreased by about 70% in nuclear extract in cells overexpressing CTCF <italic>versus</italic> cells transfected with empty vector. A more thorough examination of Dnmt1 has shown that the inhibition is not because of a decreased level of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression. An <italic>in vitro</italic> approach allowed us to exclude direct inhibition of DNMT1 activity by CTCF, in line with our previous observation that PARs present on modified PARP-1 inhibit DNMT1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). The persistence of a high PAR level affects the DNA methylation machinery; Dnmt1 activity is inhibited, leading to wide hypomethylation of the genome, involving both centromeric and B1 repeats. Ectopic overexpression of CTCF in PARP-1<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> cells demonstrates a specific functional relationship between CTCF and PARP-1.</p><p>This finding underscores the importance of a rapid reversal of PARP-1 automodification because is affects DNA methylation patterns considered to be part of the epigenetic code. DNA hypomethylation could decondense chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>), cause genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>), direct cells toward apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>), and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>). The unusual cellular environment, in which a large amount of ADP-ribose polymers are present for several days, mimics the situation in PARG knock-outs and provides a model for the study of damage because of excess of ADP-ribose polymers in cells. Our data suggest that deregulation of DNA methylation pattern is one of the molecular mechanisms causing lethality in PARG knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>).</p><p>The finding that high PAR levels induce hypomethylation is intriguing, because in tumor cells the hypomethylation of repeat-rich heterochromatin contributes to genomic instability, through increased mitotic recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>). The introduction of new methyl groups onto DNA or the diffuse hypomethylation in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>) could occur through deregulation of PARP or PARG activities. This demethylation is a passive mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>) that does not depend on decreased expression of Dnmt1 but on the absence of an active Dnmt1.</p><p>In the cellular scenario dependent on ectopic overexpression of CTCF, the cytotoxicity is accounted for by a decreased level of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>), whereas the increased number of apoptotic cells can be explained by recent data showing that the higher ADP-ribose polymer production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>) and DNA hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>) induce apoptosis. The connection between DNA methylation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation inferred from our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) is strengthened by our new findings showing that activation of PARP-1, dependent on CTCF, affects DNA methylation machinery. It is clear that, because of the complexity of pathways that occur in cells, despite evidence showing the connection between poly-ADP-ribosylated PARP-1 and Dnmt1, other additional and/or alternative mechanism(s) cannot be excluded. Based on our extensive research on poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA methylation, we think that the control of DNA methylation pattern is among the multiple housekeeping roles of PARP-1; this role could be played by the inhibitory effect exerted by PARs on the Dnmt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). The balance of PARs constitutively present in cells may be extremely important; their decrease causes anomalous DNA hypermethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), whereas their increase leads to widespread DNA hypomethylation.</p><p>Further research will be carried out to define in depth the role played by CTCF in the cross-talk between poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA methylation and to establish whether and how the normal functions of PARG are affected in this new cellular scenario. We will assess whether CTCF represses PARG expression, inhibits its enzymatic activity, or impairs its physiological shuttling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M801170200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M801170200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Zardo, G., D'Erme, M., Reale, A., Strom, R., Perilli, M., and Caiafa, P.
