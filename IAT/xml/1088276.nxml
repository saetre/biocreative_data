By two-photon microscopy of intact lymph nodes, we show that upon exposure to antigen, B cells migrate with directional preference toward the B-zone&#x02013;T-zone boundary in a CCR7-dependent manner, through a region that exhibits a CCR7-ligand gradient. Initially the B cells show reduced motility, but after 1 d, motility is increased to approximately 9 &#x003bc;m/min. Antigen-engaged B cells pair with antigen-specific helper T cells for 10 to more than 60 min, whereas non-antigen-specific interactions last less than 10 min. B cell&#x02013;T cell conjugates are highly dynamic and migrate extensively, being led by B cells.

Naive lymphocytes, antigen-primed T cells, and DCs showed very similar motility in these two experimental configurations. These studies have revealed that T lymphocytes move in lymph node T zones at 10&#x02013;12 &#x003bc;m/min, and B cells move within follicles at about 6 &#x003bc;m/min, with both cell types exhibiting what appears as a random walk. Surprisingly, despite the many studies of lymphocyte chemotaxis in vitro and our understanding of chemokine requirements for lymphocyte homing and architecture in the lymphoid organs, evidence of directional migration of lymphocytes has not yet been obtained from ex vivo or in vivo microscopy of lymph nodes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

We show that relocation of antigen-engaged B cells to the B/T boundary is achieved by random migration far from the follicle boundary in combination with directional migration in the region extending up to approximately 140 &#x003bc;m from the boundary. Directional migration was dependent on CCR7 expression by the B cells and a gradient of CCL21 was detected extending into the follicle. Furthermore, we have tracked the dynamics of B-T encounters and demonstrate that cognate B-T interactions can last for at least 1 h, whereas noncognate interactions last only a few minutes. Antigen-specific B-T conjugates are usually monogamous and migrate extensively in the interfollicular region at approximately 9 &#x003bc;m/min.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Directional Migration of Antigen-Engaged B Cells to the B/T Boundary</title><p>To investigate the migration dynamics of antigen-engaged B cells, we transferred fluorescently labeled hen egg lysozyme (HEL)-specific Ig-tg B cells (green) and nontransgenic (non-tg) B cells (red) into syngeneic mice, allowed 1 d for the cells to equilibrate within lymphoid tissues, and then tracked migration of the cells in inguinal lymph nodes excised from the recipient animals 1 h after intravenous HEL injection. By flow cytometric analysis of dissociated lymph node cells, the B cell receptors on the Ig-tg B cells were shown to be fully occupied by HEL antigen (data not shown). Extensive immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of Ig-tg B cells in lymphoid tissues isolated at various times after HEL injection has established that the HEL-engaged B cells accumulate at the boundary of the follicle and T zone, including in interfollicular regions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;. With our current microscope configurations, two-photon imaging through the capsule was restricted to depths of approximately 200 &#x003bc;m. This was too shallow to permit extensive imaging of the follicle boundary distal to the capsule, but it did allow analysis of boundary regions at the sides of follicles, which typically corresponded to interfollicular regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figures 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">S1</xref>). Images of intact lymph nodes at the time of isolation showed that HEL-specific B cells were distributed together with non-tg B cells throughout the follicles (0 min in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figures 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">1</xref>B, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">S1</xref>). Within 1 h of imaging, accumulation of HEL-specific B cells along the rim of the follicles became evident, whereas non-tg B cells remained uniformly distributed in the follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">1</xref>C; Videos <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv002">S2</xref>). Analysis of individual naive non-tg B cells revealed that these cells moved in an apparently random manner in the follicle with a velocity of approximately 7 &#x003bc;m/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">1</xref>E), in agreement with previous studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d;. By contrast, HEL-binding B cells tracked 1&#x02013;3 h after antigen injection showed reduced velocities, moving at about 4 &#x003bc;m/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Within 6 h after antigen challenge, the velocities of activated B cells were restored, and by 24 h, the cells became more motile than naive B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>F; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv003">Video S3</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether antigen-engaged B cells accumulated at the B/T boundary because of directional movement or as a result of random migration followed by retention, we tracked the migration of HEL-specific and non-tg B cells. Of 44 HEL-specific cells that could be tracked for more than 30 min, 22 cells migrated to reach the B/T boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, tracking data for 12 HEL-specific cells are shown, with seven of the cells reaching the boundary), whereas of 20 non-HEL-specific cells, only four were found at the boundary after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, tracking data for 11 non-tg cells are shown, with two cells reaching the boundary). Of the Ig-tg B cells that failed to localize to the boundary, 11 cells were only marginally displaced from their starting positions (maximum displacement &#x0003c;20 &#x003bc;m; two examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>C as green and light-purple tracking lines). The remaining cells (11/44) did show substantial migration despite failing to move to the boundary (maximum displacement &#x0003e;20 &#x003bc;m; examples shown in beige, dark-brown, and yellow tracking lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). To quantify the directionality of migration, we constructed double-logarithmic plots of the net displacement of cells from their starting point against their cumulative path length. In the case of linear motion, a slope of one is expected, whereas the net displacement increases as the square root of path length for random motion, resulting in a slope of 0.5 on log/log axes. The HEL-engaged cells that reached the boundary showed a slope closer to one than either HEL-engaged cells that failed to move to the boundary or naive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figure 1</xref>G). These data indicate that the migration path taken by antigen-engaged B cells that reached the boundary was closer to a straight line than that of cells not reaching the boundary or of naive B cells, suggesting that migration to the boundary was directional.</p><p>A difficulty with measuring migration of activated B cells to the B/T boundary was that the cells being tracked would frequently leave the imaging volume before reaching the boundary. To further quantify directionality and also test its relationship to distance from the boundary, cells that migrated through randomly selected cubic volumes of follicle were tracked for short periods to determine whether they were migrating toward or away from the B/T boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We defined 30 &#x003bc;m (<italic>x</italic>-axis) &#x000d7; 30 &#x003bc;m (<italic>y</italic>-axis) &#x000d7; 30 &#x003bc;m (<italic>z</italic>-axis) cubes at various positions within follicles that had been imaged from 1 to 3 h after antigen injection, and the migration of cells emerging from each cube was tracked. The <italic>xy</italic> positions of the follicle&#x02013;T zone boundary were not greatly changed throughout the 50-&#x003bc;m <italic>z</italic> depth (not shown), and we therefore plotted the cell tracking lines in the <italic>xy</italic> coordinate of the <italic>z</italic>-projection view and counted the number of cells that crossed the sides of the square facing the follicle&#x02013;T zone boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">2</xref>C, sides shown as solid lines) versus those that crossed the opposite sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">2</xref>C, sides shown as dashed lines). For boxes located 20 to approximately 80 &#x003bc;m away from the B/T boundary (shown in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), 50&#x00025; of the cells emerged across the sides facing the boundary whereas 18&#x00025; migrated across the opposite sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Similarly, for the boxes located 80 to approximately 140 &#x003bc;m away from the follicular boundary (shown in purple in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), more cells migrated across the two sides facing the boundary than across the other sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). However, for boxes located 140 to approximately 200 &#x003bc;m away from the boundary (pink box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), the number of cells that migrated across the sides facing the boundary was not significantly higher than the number of cells that migrated across the opposite sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). In contrast, the fraction of non-tg B cells that migrated across the sides of the box facing the B/T boundary versus the other sides was essentially even for every box examined, showing no directionality of migration toward the boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Although the B/T boundary was also located below the box, the number of cells leaving via the top and bottom of each box was not included in this analysis because the <italic>z</italic> distance to the boundary could not be accurately determined in two of the experiments. However, as with the above observations, we observed a tendency for more cells to leave via the bottom of the boxes than via the top (data not shown). Plots of displacement over path length for antigen-engaged B cells emerging from each of the cubes revealed that when cells were within approximately 140 &#x003bc;m of the boundary, they showed less turning when migrating toward the boundary than when migrating away from the boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). By contrast, non-antigen-engaged B cells and antigen-engaged B cells that were more distant from the boundary showed low displacement to path-length ratios irrespective of their direction of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Taken together, these observations indicate that when antigen-engaged B cells are within approximately 140 &#x003bc;m of the B/T boundary, they are able to conduct directional migration toward the boundary.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Detection of a CCL21 Gradient</title><p>As observed previously for cells in the spleen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;, CCR7 was required for antigen-engaged B cells in lymph nodes to localize at the B/T boundary, shown by comparing the distribution of Ig-tg B cells from CCR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and CCR7<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice in HEL-injected recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g003">3</xref>B). We also observed that in the absence of antigen-receptor engagement, CCR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells tended to localize in regions of lymph node follicles that are distal to the T zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), suggesting that CCR7 is required for naive B cells to migrate efficiently through the region of the follicle near the T-zone border. The CCR7 ligand CCL21 is abundantly expressed within the T zone &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;. To test whether a CCL21 gradient could be detected extending from the T zone into the follicle, we performed immunohistochemical staining of adjacent lymph node sections for a B cell marker (B220), to locate the boundary between the follicle and the T zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), and for CCL21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). CCL21 was concentrated in the T zone as expected, but staining was also observed in regions of B cell follicles that are proximal to the T zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g003">3</xref>D). To quantify the CCL21 staining in the follicle, we converted the images to gray scale and measured the intensity of gray pixels along lines drawn from the outer follicle to the T zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). This approach confirmed that CCL21 was present in an increasing gradient from regions of follicles that are distal to the T zone, to the B/T boundary. An increasing CCL21 gradient could also be observed extending 150&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;m from inside the follicle to the interfollicular region, the boundary region typically imaged in this study by two-photon microscopy. The gradient was not observed in lymph nodes from <italic>plt/plt</italic> mice, which lack CCL21 expression in lymphoid tissues, although a weak signal was sometimes detected in interfollicular regions, perhaps due to small amounts of CCL21 entering the lymph node via afferent lymphatics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g003">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g003">3</xref>E, &#x0201c;plt/plt LN&#x0201d;) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d;.

One day after cell transfer, which corresponds to ~30 h after challenge with antigen in adjuvant, Ig-tg B cells and TCR7 T cells were observed in focal clusters and were highly motile. On the basis of immunohistochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g005">Figures 5</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g005">5</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv002">S2</xref>) and the fact that the inguinal lymph nodes were imaged in the same orientation and at similar depths as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g002">2</xref>, we presume that these clusters were in interfollicular regions. The Ig-tg B cells formed stable conjugates with TCR7 T cells, but typically the conjugate pair remained highly motile (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv005">Videos S5&#x02013;S7</xref>; Ig-tg B cells, red; TCR7 T cells, green). As conjugates moved, B cells always moved in front of helper T cells, and when making turns, B cells turned first and the T cell partner followed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g006">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g006">6</xref>C; see also Videos <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv006">S6</xref>), suggesting that the conjugate pair was led by the B cell partner. Moreover, the instantaneous three-dimensional velocity of B cells in monogamous conjugates (approximately 9 &#x003bc;m/min) was similar to the motility of B cells free of helper T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g006">6</xref>E). In contrast, the motility of T cells in monogamous conjugates (approximately 9 &#x003bc;m/min) was virtually identical to the motility of the activated B cells and lower than the motility of free helper T cells (approximately 14 &#x003bc;m/min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g006">6</xref>E). Further imaging made at various times between 40 and 64 h after immunization revealed similar dynamics of B-T interaction. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv007">Video S7</xref> provides four time-lapse image segments showing the spatiotemporal changes induced in Ig-tg B cell and TCR7 T cell distribution, motility, and interactions from the time of antigen challenge until 64 h after challenge, when extensive T cell division is occurring.</p><p>Although stable B-T conjugates were largely monogamous, polygamous conjugates consisting of one B cell sandwiched by multiple T cells were also observed.

On the other hand, we never observed a single T cell forming stable conjugates with multiple B cells for more than 5 min. In instances when one T cell contacted multiple B cells, the T cell typically followed one of the B cells within several minutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv009">Video S9</xref>). Some B cells were also observed to switch T cell partners instead of keeping contacts with both T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv010">Video S10</xref>).</p><p>Encounters of B and T cells took place in a variety of ways: T cells approached B cells, B cells approached T cells, and T cells and B cells collided while migrating. During the initial formation of a conjugate pair, T cells sometimes remained attached by a tether to the B cell before rounding up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g006">Figure 6</xref>G). As the conjugate pair moved, contact was sometimes maintained by a B cell tether extending from the trailing edge of the B cell to the T cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g006">Figure 6</xref>G; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv011">Video S11</xref>). Such tethers are consistent with a motile B cell dragging a passive T cell behind it.</p><p>To determine whether the formation of stable B-T conjugates was due to cognate-antigen specificity, we examined the interactions that occurred between B and T lymphocytes specific for two different antigens. OT-II CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which have a class II&#x02013;restricted ovalbumin (OVA)&#x02013;specific TCR, were transferred together with Ig-tg B cells into recipient mice immunized as for the above studies except using a combination of HEL and OVA. By this approach, both B cells and T cells become activated, but the HEL-specific B cells are not expected to present OVA peptides to the T cells. In contrast to antigen-specific interactions, contacts between Ig-tg B cells and OT-II T cells were short lived (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv012">Video S12</xref>). Measurements of B-T contact times in time-lapse recordings made 30&#x02013;50 h after immunization with antigen in adjuvant revealed that many (81/150, or 54&#x00025;) of the antigen-specific contacts lasted longer than 8 min, whereas the great majority (90/93, or 97&#x00025;) of the noncognate interactions lasted less than 8 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Of the 81 stable antigen-specific conjugates that were tracked, at least 15&#x00025; (12/81) persisted longer than 40 min. It was difficult to determine entire contact periods for many (75/150, or 50&#x00025;) of the long-lasting antigen-specific conjugate pairs because the cells entered or left the field of view as a conjugate. Of the 75 conjugates in which cell&#x02013;cell association and dissociation were recorded, 23&#x00025; (17/75) had a measured contact time of between 8 and 40 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Some of the conjugates that moved in or out of the field may also fall in this time window, so this measurement is most likely an underestimate. A small number of conjugates remained in the field of view and did not dissociate for the entire 60&#x02013;90 min imaging period, establishing that B-T interactions can persist for at least 1.5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030150-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using time-lapse two-photon imaging, we have shown that after antigen engagement, B cells reduce their migration speed and display a clear bias in migration toward the B/T boundary in lymph nodes. By contrast, co-transferred CCR7-deficient Ig-tg B cells failed to show preferential migration toward the boundary. Moreover, the CCR7 ligand CCL21 was present as a gradient within the follicle, increasing toward the boundary over a region where B cell migration bias was observed by two-photon imaging. We propose that after antigen capture and CCR7 upregulation, B cells use this long-range chemokine gradient to navigate to the B/T boundary. Within 1 d of antigen encounter, the B cells had increased their motility, and they maintained this behavior while making stable conjugates with helper T cells. Many cognate interactions between antigen-engaged B cells and helper T cells lasted 10 to 40 min, and some interactions persisted for more than 1 h, whereas cells forming noncognate interactions dissociated in less than 10 min. Taken together, these experiments provide evidence of B cell chemotaxis in vivo; they also reveal that interactions between antigen-engaged B cells and cognate T cells are dynamic and may involve multiple, serial contacts.</p><p>Chemotaxis has been implicated in many biological processes within multicellular organisms, including positioning of cells during development and homing of leukocytes during immune surveillance and in the immune response.

Our findings indicate that in lymph nodes, antigen-stimulated B cells migrate up a chemokine gradient toward the B/T boundary, providing an in vivo example of chemotaxis in a multicellular organism.</p><p>Our results suggest the following sequence of events during the spatiotemporal reorganization of antigen-engaged B cells within the follicle. During the first few hours after encountering antigen, B cells upregulate CCR7 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Initially, the random motility of B cells promotes intermingling of individual cells within the follicle and allows them to get close to the follicle edge. Once B cells are within 80 to approximately 140 &#x003bc;m of the edge, antigen-engaged B cells begin to respond via CCR7 to the CCL21 gradient and move in a directed manner toward the B/T boundary. Deviations from a linear migration path occur due to collisions with randomly migrating naive B cells and small-scale irregularities in the CCR7 ligand gradient. At the boundary region, the cells continue to migrate extensively. When activated CD4 T cells are present, the B cells and T cells co-cluster in interfollicular regions, areas that also contain many DCs. Antigen-engaged B cells form conjugate pairs with T cells and continue to migrate actively in the interfollicular region, pulling the T cell partner behind. Activated B cells remain within these regions for 1&#x02013;2 d, most likely undergoing many consecutive 10&#x02013;40 min interactions with helper T cells before B cell proliferation begins.</p><p>Despite the large displacement of many of the antigen-engaged B cells, all of the cells showed reduced migration speeds in the first hours after antigen-injection, a behavior that may be due to enhanced adhesion of B cells to follicular stromal cells or other neighboring cells.

Early after antigen challenge, some HEL-engaged B cells in the part of the follicle distal to the T-zone were not significantly displaced during 30-min imaging experiments. In this regard, it is notable that antigen-receptor stimulation in T cells induces transient &#x003b1;<sub>L</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> activation that persists for about 30 min &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;.

The factors determining the distribution of CCL21 are not clear, but it seems likely that the chemokine is distributed along stromal cells that are present throughout the follicle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Previous studies have shown that T-zone CCL21 is concentrated on the stromal cell surface &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;. We also consider it likely that the naive B cells migrating through the part of the follicle that is proximal to the T zone bind and transiently display CCL21 in a manner that permits engagement of receptors on other B cells. In addition to displaying directional migration in a CCR7-dependent manner, some antigen-engaged B cells appear to arrive at the B/T boundary by random migration from the follicle and, possibly, other locations because some CCR7-deficient cells were found at the boundary. However, CCR7-deficient cells fail to accumulate at the boundary over time &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;, and it is likely that CCR7 functions both to promote directional migration of antigen-engaged cells and to help retain cells in the boundary region. A dense network of stromal cells is present on the T-zone side of the boundary, an area known as the outer cortex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b38">38</xref>&#x0005d; or cortical ridge &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;, and it will be important to determine whether these cells contribute to retaining antigen-engaged B cells in this region. The finding that antigen-engaged B cells at the B/T boundary are highly motile indicates that the mechanisms retaining cells in this region are unlikely to be solely adhesion based. At the start of our imaging experiments, the transferred B cells had equilibrated in the host for at least 1 d and the majority of Ig-tg B cells were located within lymphoid follicles. Because soluble HEL rapidly gains access to lymphoid follicles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b39">39</xref>&#x0005d;, we assume that most of the B cells in our studies are encountering the antigen while migrating within the follicle. Although we believe our findings should be generalizable for B cells encountering any type of follicular antigen, including antigens displayed by follicular dendritic cells, in some cases B cells may encounter antigens in the blood or at the point of entry into the lymph node, and in this situation, movement to the B/T boundary most likely occurs by a different path from the one examined in this study. The B/T boundary region imaged in our experiments corresponds to the boundary of the follicle and interfollicular region. Although our frozen-section analysis suggested that antigen-engaged B cells accumulated similarly along the length of the B/T boundary in lymph nodes and spleen, it remains possible that cell behavior will vary in different subregions of the boundary.</p><p>Similar to B cells encountering a foreign antigen, autoantigen-binding B cells localize at the B/T boundary &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Because their chronic exposure to autoantigen excludes these cells from accessing follicles during their short life span, the term &#x0201c;follicular exclusion&#x0201d; has been used to describe this process for autoreactive B cells. In some cases, autoantigen-binding B cells appear to lodge at the B/T boundary because of reduced expression of CXCR5 rather than increased expression of CCR7 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b40">40</xref>&#x0005d;. It will be interesting in future studies to examine the migratory behavior of autoantigen-binding B cells at the B/T boundary.</p><p>Unexpectedly, conjugates of antigen-specific B and T cells were found to migrate extensively, being led by B cells. We propose that T cells in the conjugates are not themselves motile but are dragged by B cells through firm adhesion based on the following observations: (1) in B-T conjugate pairs, B cells turn first and T cells follow; (2) trailing T cells in a conjugate are often rounded and yet the conjugate pair is moving; and (3) conjugate pairs move with the velocity of activated B cells. Conjugate velocities (approximately 9 &#x003bc;m/min) were substantially greater than velocities of DC&#x02013;T cell conjugates (&#x0003c;4 &#x003bc;m/min), although here also the T cells followed along after their antigen-presenting partner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, most of those data were obtained by imaging cells in a collagen matrix, and although this system provides information on the spectrum of B-T interactions that are possible, these conditions differ substantially from the environment within a lymph node, in which much of the collagen is sheathed by stromal cells (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;).

By migrating while conjugated with T cells, B cells may continue to survey for helper T cells, a process that could promote T cell exchange. During a response involving a diverse repertoire of T cells, continued surveillance might allow B cells to exchange weakly interacting, low-affinity T cells for cells with higher-affinity TCRs that are likely to provide more robust help &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b49">49</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our results show that many cognate B-T interactions last for more than 8 min, with some interactions lasting more than 1 h, whereas non-antigen-specific interactions between B cells and helper T cells typically last less than 8 min.

Although we were unable to obtain precise measurements of the persistence times of many of the stable conjugates because of their unexpectedly high motility, we can conclude that at least 21&#x00025; of the conjugates that last longer than 8 min dissociate within 40 min. Therefore, the development of a stable antigen-specific conjugate does not automatically mean that the conjugate will persist for a period of hours. Reciprocally, at least some of the conjugates persisted for at least 40 min, and some for longer than 80 min. Given that the antigen-receptor specificities on all the B cells and T cells in our system are identical, the basis for the different contact duration is not clear at present. It is also notable that many of the noncognate B-T contacts lasted for several minutes, similar to the duration of noncognate interactions imaged in vitro and an amount of time that may be sufficient for initial clustering and scanning of MHC class II peptide complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b51">51</xref>&#x0005d;. A large fraction of cognate B-T contacts were as short as noncognate contacts, suggesting that many initial antigen-specific contacts fail to achieve adequate signaling and changes in adhesiveness to proceed to stable interactions.</p><p>At present little is understood about the cumulative amount of T cell stimulation that is required for ensuring B cell commitment to proliferation and differentiation. Our studies reveal that interactions between B and T cells begin taking place within 1 d of immunization with antigen in adjuvant, whereas T cell&#x02013;dependent B cell proliferation does not begin for another 12&#x02013;24 h. Using a slightly different system, Garside et al. reported that cognate B-T contacts were not observed in lymph node sections until 2 d after antigen challenge, but again there was about a 1-d lag before B cell proliferation occurred &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b07">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Experiments with anti-CD40 antibodies have indicated that prolonged antibody exposure over a period of days is necessary to induce B cell proliferation, although these studies typically did not employ antigen-stimulated B cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b52">52</xref>&#x0005d;. In our studies so far, we have not observed differences in the duration of B-T contacts at day 1 versus day 2 of antigen priming (data not shown). Therefore, at present, we favor the view that most B cells interact consecutively with multiple T cell partners over a period of approximately a day before B cell proliferation is induced.</p><p>Instead of being distributed along B/T boundaries, antigen-specific B cells were localized in interfollicular zones when TCR7 antigen&#x02013;specific helper T cells were present. This clustering was not seen when recipients of Ig-tg B cells alone were immunized with antigen in adjuvant, indicating that clustering was not directly induced by the adjuvant and that the low, endogenous HEL-specific T cell response of the B6 mice was insufficient to cause the relocalization. The relocalization may be caused by the activated TCR7 T cells making chemokines or inducing chemoattractant production by other cells, such as antigen-bearing DCs. Ingulli et al. showed that 18 h after subcutaneous injection of fluorochrome-labeled OVA, a subpopulation of antigen-bearing CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs was present in paracortical regions adjacent to follicles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b53">53</xref>&#x0005d;. Interfollicular regions are also rich in high endothelial venules, and other studies have indicated that DCs newly arriving in lymph nodes are often found near follicles or clustered around high endothelial venules &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b54">54</xref>&#x0005d;, and small, soluble antigens can reach these regions via conduits that connect with the subcapsular sinus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b39">39</xref>&#x0005d;. The congregation of cells in interfollicular regions may also foster B cell&#x02013;DC interactions, which themselves may be important during T cell&#x02013;dependent antibody responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b02">2</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In regions that were not crowded with helper T cells, B cells mainly formed one-to-one contacts with helper T cells. However, antigen-engaged B cells occasionally formed stable contacts simultaneously with multiple helper T cells, especially in areas crowded with helper T cells. These observations suggest that in physiological conditions, antigen-specific B-T interactions are initially monogamous, but polygamous interactions may occur after antigen-specific T cells expand in number. The ability of B cells to form stable interactions with more than one T cell has also been observed in vitro and is consistent with evidence that B cells do not undergo cytoskeleton-dependent polarization toward the T cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b51">51</xref>&#x0005d;. This may also be important in allowing the continued motility of the B cell in the B-T conjugate pairs. Future studies are needed to learn whether simultaneous interactions with multiple T cells induce different signaling outcomes in B cells compared to one-to-one interactions. In contrast, we did not find helper T cells forming stable conjugates with multiple B cells simultaneously. Instead, when contact was made with multiple B cells, helper T cells followed only one of the B cells. These findings are in good accord with in vitro studies showing that individual T cells use their cytoskeleton to actively polarize toward a single B cell partner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030150-b51">51</xref>&#x0005d;.

The pixel intensity at each position along the filled line extending from the follicle into the deep T zone (line 1) or the interfollicular T zone (line 2) was averaged across 50 &#x003bc;m perpendicular to the line (the width shown by the bar at the T zone end of each line) and plotted against distance from the follicular end of the line (E) in red for line 1 and blue for line 2. As a negative control, the pixel intensity was determined along a line located in the equivalent location in a CD3-stained section (bottom panel of &#x0005b;C&#x0005d; and shown as a green line in &#x0005b;E&#x0005d;). Pixel intensity was measured using Metamorph software after converting colored pixels to gray scale. A decrease in transmitted light intensity indicates an increase in CCL21.
