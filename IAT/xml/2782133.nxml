These proteins contain two related domains known as the chromo- and the chromoshadow-domain. The chromo-domain binds histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have shown that the affinity of HP1 proteins to native methylated chromatin is relatively poor and that the opening of chromatin occurring during DNA replication facilitates their binding to nucleosomes. These observations prompted us to investigate whether HP1 proteins have additional histone binding activities, envisioning also affinity for regions potentially occluded by the nucleosome structure. We find that the chromoshadow-domain interacts with histone H3 in a region located partially inside the nucleosomal barrel at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome. Interestingly, this region is also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex. <italic>In vitro</italic>, efficient SWI/SNF remodeling requires this contact and is inhibited in the presence of HP1 proteins. The antagonism between SWI/SNF and HP1 proteins is also observed <italic>in viv</italic>o on a series of interferon-regulated genes. Finally, we show that SWI/SNF activity favors loading of HP1 proteins to chromatin both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Altogether, our data suggest that HP1 chromoshadow-domains can benefit from the opening of nucleosomal structures to bind chromatin and that HP1 proteins use this property to detect and arrest unwanted chromatin remodeling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>HP1 proteins are transcriptional regulators frequently associated with gene silencing, a phenomenon involving masking of promoter DNA by dense chromatin. Owing to their chromo-domain, these proteins can read and bind an epigenetic mark that on many non-expressed genes is present on histone H3 at the surface of the nucleosome (the fundamental packing unit of chromatin). However, the binding to this mark does not explain the repressing activity of HP1 proteins. Here, we show that these proteins can establish a second contact with histone H3, independently of the epigenetic mark. This second contact site is located inside the nucleosome, in a position likely to be inaccessible. Interestingly, this site is also contacted by a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex and this contact is required for the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling catalyzed by SWI/SNF. We provide evidence suggesting that HP1 proteins use the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling to gain access to the contact site inside the nucleosome and to prevent further remodeling by competing with SWI/SNF for binding at this position. These observations lead us to suggest that HP1 proteins function as gatekeepers on promoters, detecting and stopping unwanted exposure of internal nucleosomal sites.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>HP1 proteins are important regulators of heterochromatin-mediated silencing and chromosome structure in diverse eukaryotes (for recent reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Lomberk1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Fanti1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). In mammalian cells, the HP1 family is composed of HP1&#x003b1;, HP1&#x003b2;, and HP1&#x003b3;. So far, only HP1&#x003b2; has been inactivated in the mouse, resulting in defective development of neuromuscular junctions and cerebral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Aucott1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Within the nucleus, the three HP1 isoforms all concentrate in foci of dense pericentromeric heterochromatin but are also present in the rest of the nucleoplasm. Consistent with this very general distribution, the mammalian HP1 proteins are detected not only in dense heterochromatic regions but also on active euchromatic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Hediger1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>On these active genes, HP1 proteins seem to be present both during phases of silencing and transcriptional activity. For example, on the Survivin gene and on an integrated HIV1 LTR, HP1&#x003b2; is detected on the repressed promoter, while HP1&#x003b3; is recruited after transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Mateescu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Smallwood1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. HP1&#x003b3; is however not always associated with active transcription as it participates in the repression of the MMTV LTR and the Sox2 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Vicent1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Papanayotou1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. It is noteworthy also that on the HIV1 LTR and on the &#x003b2;-major gene, HP1 proteins are co-localized with the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), indicating that they are not creating an environment incompatible with recruitment of this polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Mateescu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Vakoc1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these observations suggest that, at least in euchromatin, HP1 proteins are not &#x0201c;chromatin condensers&#x0201d; <italic>per se</italic>, but more likely regulators of enzymatic activities involved in transcription initiation or elongation.</p><p>HP1 proteins contain two very similar domains known as the chromo-domain (CD) and the chromoshadow-domain (CSD) separated by a less structured hinge region. The CSD is required for dimerization and interaction with many molecular partners that share a PXVXL motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Smothers1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. It is also necessary for the recruitment of HP1 proteins to sites of DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Luijsterburg1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Concurrently, the CD recognizes and binds histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9 (K9), an epigenetic mark frequently associated with transcriptional repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Lachner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Bannister1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the hinge region of HP1 proteins harbors DNA- and RNA-binding activities and the targeting of these proteins to chromatin likely results from the integration of multiple contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Muchardt1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Meehan1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to the strong binding to peptides mimicking histone H3 tails methylated on K9, HP1 proteins bind only weakly to reconstituted methylated nucleosomal arrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Eskeland1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this, binding of HP1 proteins to purified native chromatin <italic>in vitro</italic> seems relatively inefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Meehan1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Dialynas1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This binding can be improved by auxiliary factors that may help the recognition of chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Eskeland1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, but it has also been suggested that HP1 can benefit from chromatin opening. Indeed, a more stable incorporation of HP1 proteins occurs in S phase when DNA replication disrupts the histone octamers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Dialynas1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Earlier reports also describe the presence in the nucleus of two populations of HP1 proteins with either high or low mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Schmiedeberg1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and it has been proposed that the more stable interaction creates the HP1 population of low mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Aucott1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Binding of HP1 proteins may also benefit from ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling as HP1&#x003b2; co-localize with the ACF1-ISWI remodeling complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Collins1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, HP1&#x003b1;, but not HP1&#x003b2; and HP1&#x003b3;, interacts with Brg1 and Brm, the mutually exclusive catalytic subunit of the human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) complex, and this interaction favors repression of a reporter construct by a transfected Gal4-HP1&#x003b1; fusion protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000769.s001">Figure S1A, S1B, S1C, S1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Nielsen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Lechner1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>To gain better understanding of HP1 chromatin binding and transcriptional regulation, we have here examined whether these proteins could establish alternative interactions with the histones. This allowed us to identify a contact between the CSD and a region of histone H3 located at the border of the globular domain. This region is also contacted by the hSWI/SNF subunits Brg1 and Brm, and we show that HP1 proteins have a negative effect on hSWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling. Finally, we provide evidence indicating that hSWI/SNF activity is involved in the recruitment of HP1 proteins to chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The chromoshadow-domain interacts with the globular domain of histone H3</title><p>We investigated whether HP1 proteins could bind histone H3 independently of the well-characterized association of the CD with methylated K9. To this end, we tested the binding of HP1&#x003b1; and HP1&#x003b3; to either purified or recombinant B10-epitope-tagged histones immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane. As expected, the HP1 proteins bound strongly to purified histone H3 but not to histone H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4).

This binding was not observed on the tail region alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 2).

To this end, we further mutated HP1&#x003b1; V22M at position I126 inside the CSD. This position is equivalent to I25 in the CD, an amino acid that, when mutated, prevents the domain from interacting with histone H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Nielsen2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mutation of the CSD at I126 also affected the repressing activity of HP1&#x003b1;.

A non-modified histone H3 truncation mutant spanning from aa 1 to 76 produced in <italic>E.coli</italic> was sufficient to interact with HP1&#x003b1;, while a shorter construct containing only the H3 tail region (aa 1&#x02013;47) failed to do so.

We noted also that all mutations affecting HP1 dimerization abolished the CSD-H3 interaction, while this interaction resisted incubation with a DNA intercalating agent (data not shown). This series of experiments also showed that HP1&#x003b3; and <italic>Drosophila</italic> dHP1a had binding activities similar to that of HP1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, bottom panels).</p><p>We finally identified aa 35 to 66 as the minimal region binding both HP1&#x003b1; and HP1&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g001">Figure 1H</xref>, lane 2 and 4).

Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that HP1 chromatin binding and repression activities are largely mediated by the histone binding activity of the CSD.</p><p>ChIP and ChIP reChIP assays show that Brm is required for the loading of HP1&#x003b3; to the IFIT3 promoter during transcriptional activation. We note that on this promoter, we have another example of the switch from HP1&#x003b1;/HP1&#x000df; to HP1&#x003b3; during transcriptional activation, also observed on the HIV1 LTR and on the Survivin promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Mateescu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Smallwood1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the ChIP approach did not allow us to estimate the impact of hSWI/SNF remodeling on the recruitment of HP1&#x003b1;, as depletion of Brm leads to repression of the IFIT1 and IFIT3 promoters. Under these conditions, it was not possible to part between enhanced recruitment due to increased histone H3K9 methylation and decreased recruitment associated with reduced hSWI/SNF activity. However, our <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome-array binding assay suggests that HP1 proteins other than HP1&#x003b3; can benefit from chromatin remodeling to bind nucleosomes. It must here be noted that this assay does not allow us to discriminate between histone and DNA binding. Nevertheless, repression of hSWI/SNF remodeling does not appear to rely on DNA binding as an HP1&#x003b1; mutant no longer binding DNA still represses. In addition, HP1&#x003b3; does not bind to DNA in our hands and prefers nucleosomes (data not shown). Yet, it is efficient in repressing hSWI/SNF remodeling. Finally, we note that methylation of histone H3 on K9 is not required for repression of hSWI/SNF remodeling <italic>in vitro</italic>, further suggesting that the contact of the CSD with the Shadock, and not other contacts, is important for the repressing activity of HP1 proteins.</p><p>The interaction of HP1&#x003b1; CSD with histone H3 required HP1 dimerization and was disrupted by the mutation of V46 in the PXVXL-like sequence in the Shadock.

While this manuscript was in revision, it was shown that phosphorylation of histone H3 on tyrosine 41 by JAK2 compromises the binding of the chromoshadow-domain of HP1&#x003b1; to an H3 peptide spanning from aa 31 to 56 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Dawson1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. This modification is outside the HP1&#x003b3; binding site and it therefore seems possible that HP1&#x003b1; and HP1&#x003b3; are differentially regulated by post-translational modifications in the H3 Shadock region.</p><p>The region of histone H3 contacted by the HP1 proteins also associates with the hSWI/SNF subunits Brg1 and Brm. This is compatible with earlier studies in yeast showing that residues K56 and L61 are involved in SWI/SNF recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Duina1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Xu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. In yeast, it was suggested that the H3 &#x003b1;N helix is targeted and remodeled by the SWI/SNF complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Matsubara1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, mutagenesis within this region was shown to affect the efficiency of yeast SWI/SNF remodeling <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Somers1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Our competition experiments with polypeptides mimicking the H3 &#x003b1;N helix further suggest that interaction of Brg1 with this region is essential for the chromatin remodeling activity of the hSWI/SNF complex. Consistent with this, the sequences downstream of the helicase domain of Brg1/Brm that mediate the interaction with the H3 Shadock domain have earlier been reported as essential for efficient remodeling <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Fan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore speculate that the competing binding of Brg1/Brm and HP1 proteins to a same region of histone H3 during unwanted remodeling can at least in part explain the inhibiting effect of HP1 on chromatin opening by hSWI/SNF.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> binding assays suggest that Brg1 has an affinity for the globular domain of H3 that is higher than that of HP1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000769.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In a mechanism based on competition of Brg1 and HP1 proteins for binding to overlapping sites on histone H3, this difference in affinity may explain that a 7-fold excess of HP1&#x003b1; over Brg1 is required to obtain 50&#x00025; inhibition of hSWI/SNF remodeling in the REA assays. It must finally be noted that the activity of the hSWI/SNF complex is also inhibited by the Polycomb Group (PcG) class II complex <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Francis1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Lavigne1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. This complex, involved in gene silencing, includes a CD protein that, like HP1 proteins, binds methylated histone H3 tails with a preference for methylation on K27 rather than K9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Cao1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Czermin1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Polycomb proteins contain no CSDs and it seems that PRC1 relies essentially on a structuring effect on the nucleosomal template, repressing remodeling by creating more condensed chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Francis2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>hSWI/SNF and HP1 proteins have many common target promoters including E2F1, human thymidine kinase, c-Myc, Sox2, Cyclin E, and the MMTV and HIV1 LTRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Mateescu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Vicent1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Nagl1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Trand1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, we show here that several interferon-inducible genes that require hSWI/SNF for their activation are under the negative control of HP1&#x003b1; and HP1&#x003b2;. We note however that not all hSWI/SNF target genes we tested were affected by knock-down of HP1 proteins, including for example DraL and SPARC. These genes were both expressed at relatively high levels in the cells we used and may therefore not have any repressive structure on their promoter (data not shown). All considered, we suggest that on promoters where SWI/SNF functions as a repressor, the opening of the chromatin may, as previously suggested, be the event initiating HP1 stable recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Papanayotou1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000769-Nielsen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Where SWI/SNF functions as an activator, HP1 proteins recruited by methylated histone H3 tails may instead function as sensors of unwanted SWI/SNF activity, binding nucleosome domains uncovered by the remodeling, and thereby block the reaction (see proposed model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000769-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Finally, after the activation, additional HP1 proteins may be involved in controlling excessive remodeling activity. In that sense, HP1 proteins could very generally function as gatekeepers using the exposure of domains internal to the nucleosome to detect and restrict chromatin opening.</p><fig id="pgen-1000769-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000769.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Model suggesting how HP1 proteins may gain access to internal nucleosomal regions and control remodeling by SWI/SNF.</title><p>(A) When the chromatin is methylated on H3K9, HP1 is brought in the vicinity, attracted by the methylation mark.
