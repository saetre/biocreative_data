RON&#x00394;165 was strongly expressed in fresh gastric carcinoma tissue, corresponding paraneoplastic tissue, and perigastric lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma.

In China, gastric carcinoma is the top malignant tumor in both categories of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that belongs to the MET proto-oncogene family. Recent studies of a RON knockout mouse model shows that complete disruption of the RON gene is embryonic lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], demonstrating that RON is essential in embryonic development. RON is activated by a serum-derived, macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) growth factor, and studies have shown that RON is expressed in many malignant tumors and plays a role in their occurrence and progression.</p><p>Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] found that RON is strongly expressed in colorectal carcinomas, and they identified three splicing variants of RON (RON&#x00394;160, RON&#x00394;165, and RON&#x00394;155). The expression of RON and its variants was associated with the progression of colorectal carcinoma. Other studies have shown that the expression of RON and its splice variants can precipitate colon epithelial cell colony formation and increase their viability. When expression of RON and its splice variants were targeted by siRNA in rectal tumor cell strains, proliferation and metatasis were significantly inhibited, concomitant with increased apoptosis. Based on these data, RON and its splice variants are hypothesized to have an important role in the occurrence, progression, and metastasis of rectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Similarly, studies of RON expression in both breast and bladder cancer tissues has shown increased levels of RON expression and a correlation with histological grade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, the role of RON in gastric cancer has only been studied by Collesi et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this study the splice variant of RON, RON&#x00394;165, was detected in the gastric carcinoma cell strain, KATO-III. RON&#x00394;165 was shown to enhance the invasion of gastric cancer cells, indicating a role for the splice variant of RON in the malignant transformation of gastric cells to a carcinoma. In this study, we examine the expression of RON in the gastric carcinoma tissue of 98 patients using the Envision immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. To examine expression of RON&#x00394;165, Western blotting of fresh gastric carcinoma tissue was performed. The patients enrolled in our study were monitored between 3 and 89 months post-operation to investigate the association of RON expression, including its splice variant, to the clinicopathological characteristics of gastric carcinoma and prognosis. Due to the complex pathogenesis of gastric carcinoma, therapeutic efficacy has not proven to be very effective. Thus, it is important to investigate the pathogenesis of gastric carcinoma to find new therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient samples</title><p>Paraffin embedded tissue samples from 98 patients who underwent surgery for pathologically confirmed gastric carcinoma in the First Affiliated Hospital of College of Medicine of Zhejiang University between 1998 and 2003 were obtained. Gastric samples were used with the consent of the patients and permission of the Ethics Committees of Hospitals. Seventy men and 28 women, ranging in age from 21 to 76 years (median age 58 years), were included in this study. Patient diagnosis included 78 cases of sinus ventriculi carcinoma, 16 cases of gastric cardia carcinoma, and 4 cases of total gastric carcinoma. Post-surgery pathological reports diagnosed 2 well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, 21 moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas, 69 poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, 1 signet-ring cell carcinoma, 2 mucinous adenocarcinomas, and 3 severe dysplasia with cancerization. According to UICCTNM (1998), the histological grade of the samples was determined to include 26 stage I cases, 14 stage II cases, 30 stage III cases, and 28 stage IV cases. The follow-up rate for our patients was 92%, with 8 patients not available to complete the follow-up. The follow-up period was between 3 and 89 months (median time of 22 months) following surgery. Ten samples of normal gastric mucosa were examined as controls. Nineteen samples of fresh gastric carcinoma tissue, paraneoplastic tissue, and positive perigastric lymph node tissue were collected for Western blot analysis. Ten samples of normal gastric mucosa were also included as controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Paraffin samples were sectioned into 4 &#x003bc;m thick slices which were deparaffinized, hydrated and incubated for 20 min in 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. For antigen retrieval, samples were incubated with 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and heated in a pressure cooker for 8 min. After rinsing in TBS, the slides were incubated with 3% normal donkey serum (NDS) in TBS for 20 min to prevent non-specific binding of the first antibody. Anti-RON rabbit monoclonal antibody Ron &#x003b2; (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, USA) was used at 1:400. The Envision kit (DAKO) was used according to the manufacturer's directions, and bound antibody was detected using DAB. Samples were also co-stained with hematoxylin. Samples were observed under a light microscope and a PBS-only staining sample was used as a background control.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation criteria for RON detection by immunohistochemistry</title><p>The assessment of the grade of staining was determined using a blinded evaluation procedure by experienced pathologists. High-power fields (400&#x000d7;) using standard light microscopy were divided into ten sections which were randomly scored. Tumor cells with buffy particles in the intracytoplasm were scored as positive, and the percentage of positive tumor cells and staining intensity for each sample was recorded. Tumor cells that did not stain for RON expression were scored as negative, cells that weakly stained were scored as 1, moderate staining was scored with a 2, and strongly staining samples were scored as 3. Of the positive tumor cells detected,&#x0003c; 5% were negative, between 5 and 24% were scored as 1, 25&#x02013;49% were scored with a 2, and &#x0003e; 50% were scored with a 3. The cumulative score of the tumor cells identified in a sample determined a sample's final score. Based on the final score, the tumor tissue was determined to be negative (score of 0&#x02013;2), or positive (score of 3&#x02013;6) for RON expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein immunoblotting</title><p>Fifty micrograms of total protein for each sample was separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore). Detection of RON protein was performed using an anti-RON rabbit monoclonal antibody Ron &#x003b2; (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, USA) (1:400). Antibody binding was visualized using an anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and an Enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL) (Biological Industries, Inc.

These observations are consistent with results from Okino et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, staining of RON in carcinoma tissues and corresponding paraneoplastic tissues by IHC showed significant expression of RON relative to normal gastric mucosa samples. Western blot analysis provided more specific information regarding RON expression with detection of RON&#x00394;165 in gastric carcinoma tissues, corresponding paraneoplastic tissues, and lymph nodes with carcinoma metastases. These data indicate that expression of full-length RON, as well as a variant of RON, are expressed during the process of malignant transformation of gastric epithelial cells. Based on these data and work in other studies on the role of RON in tumorigenic phenotypes, we hypothesize that RON may act as an oncogene to promote the occurrence, progression, invasion, and metastasis of gastric cancer.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that expression of RON correlates with the invasion of tumor cells. Maggiora et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] reported that RON was expressed in 55% of ovarian cancer tissues. Furthermore, if an ovarian cancer cell line that strongly expresses RON is induced by MSP, tumor growth and invasion is significantly enhanced. Based on these data, it was hypothesized that RON plays a role in the progression of ovarian cancer. Similarly, Chan et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] showed that expression of RON promoted the growth and malignant transformation of skin papillomas, and Cheng et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] showed that strong expression of RON in bladder cancer cell lines correlated with increased proliferation and apoptosis inhibition. The latter study also demonstrated that the expression of RON in gastric carcinoma positively correlated with the invasive depth of the gastric cancer cell and lymph nodes metastasis, and the level of expression increased significantly with higher clinical pathologies of gastric cancer. Therefore, strong expression of RON in gastric cancer tissues may serve as a marker to indicate a conversion of normal cells to a malignant phenotype, which associated with increased tumor cell invasion and metastasis, would be associated with a poor prognosis for long-term survival. The proximity of gastric cancer tissue to the epithelial dysplasia of the stomach results in the susceptibility of the epithelial dysplasia of the stomach to precancerous lesions. Therefore, by reporting the expression of RON in paraneoplastic tissue, which was collected ~0.5 cm away from the gastric carcinoma samples, we are providing data to support our hypothesis that RON plays an important role in promoting gastric cancer and may serve as a marker for the conversion of tissues to a malignant phenotype.</p><p>In previous studies looking at the relationship between RON expression and survival rates, Lee et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] found that MET and RON were independent prognostic factors of long-term recurrence of breast cancer, and that specimens positive for MET and RON expression had a significantly lower 10-year disease-free survival rate. Similarly, Cheng et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] reported a lower survival rate for bladder cancers positive for both MET and RON. In contrast, we found that the survival rate of patients positive for RON expression was not lower than the survival rate for the RON-negative patient group. It is possible that the survival rate of patients with gastric cancer can be affected by many factors, and our follow-up data was not sufficient to provide additional insight into which factors might be important.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study show that RON is expressed in gastric cancer, but not in normal gastric mucosa. Furthermore, the expression rate of RON in gastric cancer positively correlates with the invasive depth, the clinical pathologic stage, and extent of lymph node metastasis. We hypothesize that RON plays an important role in the occurrence, progression, invasion, and metastasis of gastric cancer, and therefore could be an important marker in assessing the biological behavior of gastric cancer. The results of our studies provide a foundation from which to further identify the mechanistic details of the role of RON in gastric cancer in order to identify RON as a therapeutic target in gastric cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZDH carried out study design, final data analysis, drafted the manuscript and revisions to the manuscript.
