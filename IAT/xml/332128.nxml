Here we show by Southern analyses that the 5' breakpoint between both loci is located approximately 7.5 kb upstream of the RNAP II genes. Northern analyses revealed that the 5' duplicated segment contains at least four other genes, which are transcribed in both bloodstream and procyclic trypanosomes. The gene located immediately upstream of the RNAP II gene in both loci was characterized by sequence analyses. The deduced amino acid sequences show a high degree of similarity to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase class 1 (PP1) genes. S1 mapping provided strong evidence in support of the fact that the PP1 and RNAP II genes belong to a single transcription unit.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00201-0106-a" xlink:role="5091"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00201-0107-a" xlink:role="5092"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00201-0108-a" xlink:role="5093"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00201-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5089"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00201-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5090"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00201-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5091"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00201-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5092"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00201-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5093"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00201-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5094"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00201-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5095"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
