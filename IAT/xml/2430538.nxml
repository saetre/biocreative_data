However, the mechanism of their differentiation and effect on neural tissues has not been fully elucidated. This study evaluates the effect of BMSCs on neural cell growth and survival in a retinal ganglion cell (RGCs) model by assessing the effect of changes in the expression of a BMSC-secreted protein, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), as a putative mechanistic agent acting on RGCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>The effect of co-culturing BMSCs and RGCs <italic>in vitro</italic> was evaluated by measuring the following parameters: neurite outgrowth, RGC survival, BMSC neural-like differentiation, and the effect of TSP-1 on both cell lines under basal secretion conditions and when TSP-1 expression was inhibited. Our data show that BMSCs improved RGC survival and neurite outgrowth. Synaptophysin, MAP-2, and TGF-&#x003b2; expression are up-regulated in RGCs co-cultured with BMSCs. Interestingly, the BMSCs progressively displayed neural-like morphology over the seven-day study period. Restriction display polymerase chain reaction (RD-PCR) was performed to screen for differentially expressed genes in BMSCs cultured alone or co-cultured with RGCs. TSP-1, a multifactorial extracellular matrix protein, is critically important in the formation of neural connections during development, so its function in our co-culture model was investigated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. When TSP-1 expression was decreased with siRNA silencing, BMSCs had no impact on RGC survival, but reduced neurite outgrowth and decreased expression of synaptophysin, MAP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2; in RGCs. Furthermore, the number of BMSCs with neural-like characteristics was significantly decreased by more than two-fold using siRNA silencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data suggest that the TSP-1 signaling pathway might have an important role in neural-like differentiation in BMSCs and neurite outgrowth in RGCs.

Koc and colleagues concluded that patients with Hurler syndrome and metachromatic leukodystrophy, both associated with skeletal muscle and neurological manifestations, might experience a reversal of disease pathology in some tissues treated with allogeneic BMSC infusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Koc2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, Osiris, Inc. (Baltimore, MD) has been granted &#x0201c;Fast Track&#x0201d; designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration; patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation and experiencing graft-versus-host disease are being enrolled into a Phase III trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Some researchers, including our group, have reported that BMSCs can differentiate into neural-like cells, with the expression of neural-associated proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Woodbury1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Yu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, we reported that BMSCs can express NF and MAP-2 after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, NF, and the schwann cell conditioned medium, or when co-cultured with neonatal rat retinal ganglion cells. However, the criteria for judging such transdifferentiation have been incomplete in many studies, often relying on genetic expression studies and morphological changes, rather than definitive proof of neuron-like characteristics such as synapse formation and appropriate electrophysiological properties. Conversely, several studies have demonstrated little or no neural differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic> after BMSC transplantation, although functional recovery appeared improved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Castro1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Ono1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Still, based on additional observations, some investigators support the hypothesis that BMSCs secrete factors that promote neural recovery and survival. For example, BMSC treatment in an experimentally-induced ischemic stroke rat model facilitated axonal sprouting and remyelination in the cortical ischemic boundary zone and corpus callosum, which might have accounted for the neurological functional improvement observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Gao1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Zhang2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Intravenously administered BMSCs from male rats increased basic fibroblast growth factor expression, reduced apoptosis, promoted endogenous cellular proliferation, and improved functional recovery after ischemic stroke in female rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Zhang3">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Chen1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In order to elucidate the underlying reparative mechanisms, BMSCs and RGCs were co-cultured to evaluate for morphological changes. Additionally, RD-PCR was performed to detect differentially expressed BMSC genes when BMSCs were co-cultured with RGCs versus BMSCs cultured alone. Our data show that BMSCs and RGCs affect each other when co-cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>, resulting in BMSCs progressively displaying neural-like features over the seven-day study period, which is not likely achievable with simple chemical treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Woodbury1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, RGC survival and neurite outgrowth were improved. Synaptophysin, MAP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2; expression were up-regulated in RGCs co-cultured with BMSCs compared to RGCs cultured alone.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that TSP-1, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein with a variety of functions and best known for its antiangiogenic properties, was up-regulated in BMSCs co-cultured with RGCs compared to BMSCs cultured alone. TSP-1 is critically important in the formation of neural connections during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Hoffman1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Buee1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. TSP-1 is highly expressed in the early postnatal rat cortex and superior colliculus during the period of intense synaptogenesis, but levels progressively decline as juvenile rats mature into adults. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed a 25&#x02013;40&#x00025; decrease in the density of synaptic puncta in the cortices of postnatal P8 and P21 mice lacking TSP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Christopherson1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether TSP-1 expression by BMSCs plays a role in neurite outgrowth of RGCs by co-culturing them with BMSCs. In order to evaluate the role of TSP-1, double siRNA transfection was used to transiently and selectively decrease endogenous expression of TSP-1. Silencing of TSP-1 with siRNA in BMSCs did not affect survival but reduced neurite outgrowth and expression of synaptophysin, MAP-2, and TGF-&#x003b2; in RGCs. Also, the number of neural-like BMSCs was significantly decreased by more than two-fold. Therefore, our data suggest that BMSCs and RGCs affect each other when co-cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>. The TSP-1 signaling pathway may play an important role in BMSC neural-like morphological change. We are unaware of any other study describing that BMSC-derived TSP-1 enhances RGC neurite formation, survival, and expression of synaptophysin, MAP-2, and TGF-&#x003b2;. Other researchers have shown that TSP-1 is involved in the healing process by suppressing inflammation which may result after an acute injury such as a wound or infarct. For example, Chatila and colleagues concluded that TSP-1 plays a critically important role after a myocardial infarct by limiting the expansion of fibrosis into the non-infarcted surrounding myocardium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Chatila1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, while Uno and colleagues have suggested that TSP-1 accelerates corneal wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Uno1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Uno2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

The tibias and femurs were extracted aseptically and rinsed with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). A sterile 18-gauge needle was inserted into each bone marrow (BM) cavity, and the BM was extruded by injecting 10 ml of cold Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). The extruded BM was filtered through a 70-&#x000b5;m cell strainer (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min. The BM pellet was resuspended in a flask containing DMEM, supplemented with 10&#x00025; inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The culture medium was replaced to remove non-adherent cells after plating the cells for 24 hr.

TSP-1 is expressed at high levels in the early postnatal rat cortex and superior colliculus, during the period of intense synaptogenesis, but its expression is reduced in the adult. We sought to determine whether TSP-1 secreted by BMSCs affects neural cell survival and neurite outgrowth. In order to answer this question, siRNA interference was performed to silence TSP-1 expression. Transfection of BMSCs with siRNA oligos using a cationic lipid might affect expression of other proteins and reduce experimental reliability. Thus, we also used controls to overcome siRNA silencing of TSP-1 by transducing BMSCs with a recombinant adenovirus with a CMV-promoter containing TSP-1 cDNA (pAd/CMV-Myc-TSP-1). We used a two-time tandem RNA transfection approach at an interval of 1 day, then transduced BMSCs with the recombinant adenovirus (pAd/CMV-Myc-TSP-1) expressing TSP-1, a fusion protein, and Myc-TSP-1, coincident with the second siRNA transfection. The cells were harvested on the third day after the first transfection. This protocol produced a marked reduction in TSP-1 expression.

Real-time RT-PCR data showed that synaptophysin, MAP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2; expression in RGCs were up-regulated by co-culturing with BMSCs, and normalized when RGCs were co-cultured with BMSCs with endogenous TSP-1 silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002470-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002470-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002470.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>RGC synaptophysin, MAP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2; expression level were determined with and without BMSC (&#x0002b;/&#x02212; TSP-1 siRNA silencing) co-culturing.</title><p>BMSCs were transfected with siRNA oligos and infected with a recombinant adenovirus (pAd/CMV-Myc-TSP-1) expressing TSP-1 before co-culturing as described above.

BMSCs are multipotent stem cells, which can differentiate into various cell types depending upon their local environment. When BMSCs were co-cultured with RGCs in vitro for over a week, the BMSCs differentiated into cells that exhibited some morphological characteristics of neural cell lineages, a result which is not likely achievable with simple chemical treatments. It is known that BMSCs can progressively assume neural-like morphological characteristics within the first 3 hours when treated with certain chemicals, such as DMSO, butylated hydroxyanisole, and isobutylmethylxanthine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Woodbury1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the mechanism underlying the induction of neural-like differentiation in BMSCs in RGC-conditioned medium in our experiments is likely different from that of chemical treatments because chemical treatments cause rapid morphological changes and cell death, whereas co-culturing causes a slower progression of morphological changes and delayed cell death.</p><p>Various factors secreted by RGCs might induce BMSC neural-like differentiation. For example, Mizobe and our group have reported that Thy-1.1, NF and MAP-2 expressed by RGCs accelerates neural-like differentiation in BMSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Mizobe1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, we found in our study that the TSP-1 gene in BMSCs was up-regulated after co-culturing with RGCs. And real-time RT-PCR data showed that TSP-1 receptors (CD36, CD47) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Petrik1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Saumet1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref> are up-regulated in RGCs co-cultured with BMSCs. TSP-1 may, in part, be responsible for the neurite-like outgrowth we observed in BMSCs. These observations suggest the possibility of using BMSCs as therapeutic agents in neurological diseases.</p><p>Furthermore, BMSCs significantly increased the propensity of RGCs to form neurites with branching growth cones and yielded an increased survival compared to controls. RGC survival increased by approximately 1.7 fold and more than 70&#x00025; had intact neurites after 5 days of co-culturing with BMSCs, indicating that factors secreted by BMSCs may improve RGC survival and neurite outgrowth. And real-time RT-PCR data showed that synaptophysin, MAP-2 and TGF-&#x003b2; is up-regulated in RGCs co-cultured with BMSCs.</p><p>Therefore, BMSCs and RGCs seem to affect each other when co-cultured in vitro through increased expression of various proteins in both cell types. Likewise, the specific interactions leading to BMSC neural-like differentiation probably involve complex interactions with multiple proteins and/or signaling pathways that will need further elaboration.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>TSP-1 is up-regulated in BMSCs co-cultured with RGCs</title><p>Why is TSP-1 up-regulated in BMSCs co-cultured with RGCs? TSP-1 is secreted by a wide variety of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, in patterns that mirror developmental changes in the embryo and response to injury in the adult, and is critically important in the formation of neural connections during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Chen2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Mizobe1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Brain macrophages contribute actively to neurite growth and regeneration during the development or in pathological states through the secretion of TSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Chamak1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. After co-culturing with RGCs, the conditioned medium progressively induced neural-like differentiation in BMSCs. Initially, in the first day of co-culturing, the cytoplasm in one percent of BMSCs retracted toward the nucleus and began forming a rounded cell body. During such morphological changes, cell adhesion occurs in three distinct and identifiable stages: shrinking, spreading, and attaching. These stages involve interactions between integrins, along with accessory receptors such as syndecans, and their extracellular matrix substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-MurphyUllrich1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, TSP-1 likely plays a key role when BMSCs are induced by co-culturing with RGCs to differentiate into neural-like cells. This supposition is supported by our TSP-1 silencing and rescue experiments. These experiments showed that TSP-1 silencing reduced BMSC neural-like differentiation in RGC-conditioned medium; whereas, TSP-1 rescue in BMSCs with infection by a TSP-1-expressing adenovirus reversed the effect of siRNA silencing.</p><p>Thrombospondin family includes five members (TSP-1, TSP-2, TSP-3, TSP-4, and TSP-5)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Adams2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. TSP-1 and TSP-2 are distinguished from the other three thrombospondins by a further set of three repeats, originally termed thrombospondin type 1 repeats. But our experimental data showed that only TSP-1 is up-regulated in BMSCs co-cultured with RGCs, TSP-2 is kept at the same level.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>TSP-1 secreted by BMSCs contributes to RGC neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis</title><p>Thrombospondins are a family of multimeric, calcium-binding extracellular glycoproteins. The first identified thrombospondin, TSP-1, was discovered as a stored protein in a-granules that are released upon platelet activation. Initial studies of the function of TSP-1, therefore, focused on its role in platelet aggregation and fibrin clot formation, and also its effect on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Adams3">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Adams4">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. In recent years, TSP-1 was found widely distributed in the embryonic extracellular matrix and expressed at high levels in the developing nervous system. Especially, in the postnatal but not adult CNS, TSP-1 is broadly localized in astrocytes and synapses, as expected for an astrocyte-secreted extracellular matrix molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Alder1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, when peripheral nerves are damaged, TSP-1 expression is up-regulated and promotes neural growth and repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-OShea1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the expression patterns and actions of TSP-1 in vitro suggest its potential role in the guidance of cell and growth cone migration. One report has shown that TSP-1 secreted by astrocytes is necessary and sufficient to induce synapse formation of ultrastructurally normal RGCs in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Christopherson1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Mice lacking both TSP-1 genes have substantially fewer synapses in many CNS regions, indicating that TSP-1 helps promote normal CNS synaptogenesis in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Christopherson1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Our RT-PCR and Western blot data show that TSP-1 is up-regulated in BMSCs co-cultured with RGCs. When TSP-1 expression was decreased with siRNA, BMSCs did not affect RGC survival, but rather reduced neurite outgrowth and the expression of synaptophysin in RGCs. Synaptophysin was the first cloned synaptic vesicle (SV) protein. Since its discovery in 1985 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Jahn1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, synaptophysin has been used by many laboratories around the world as an invaluable marker to study the distribution of synapses in the brain and to uncover the basic features of the life cycle of SVs. Although single gene ablation of synaptophysin does not lead to an overt phenotype, a large body of experimental data, both in vitro and in vivo, indicate that synaptophysin (alone or in association with homologous proteins) is involved in multiple, important aspects of SV exo-endocytosis, including the regulation of SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) assembly into the fusion core complex, formation of the fusion pore initiating neurotransmitter release, activation of SV endocytosis, and SV biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Alder1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Thomas1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Tarsa1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, our results suggest that TSP-1 secreted by BMSCs plays a key role during synaptogenesis of RGCs in vitro.</p><p>How does TSP-1 induce RGC neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis? Real-time RT-PCR data showed that TGF-&#x003b2;, activated by TSP-1, is up-regulated in RGCs co-cultured with BMSCs. TGF-&#x003b2; is a multifunctional cytokine with anti-inflammatory, reparative and neuroprotective functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Hogg1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Gomes1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. Dhandapani and Brann demonstrated that the lack of TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression in neonatal TGF-&#x003b2;1 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice results in a widespread increase in degenerating neurons accompanied by prominent microgliosis and reduced expression of synaptophysin and laminin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Brionne1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, TGF-&#x003b2;1 loss also strongly reduces survival of primary neurons cultured from TGF-&#x003b2;1 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice. The authors suggest that TGF-&#x003b2;1 regulates the expression and ratio of apoptotic (Bad) and antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-&#x000d7;1), creating an environment favorable for cell survival of death-inducing insults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002470-Dhandapani1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. This evidence strongly suggests the possibility that TSP-1 may act, in part, by inducing neurons to alter expression of proteins that participate in synaptogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that BMSCs improve RGC survival and neurite outgrowth. Meanwhile, the RGC-conditioned medium induces neural-like differentiation in BMSCs. During differentiation, TSP-1 in BMSCs is up-regulated after co-culturing with RGCs, and TSP-1 is probably involved in RGC neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis. This study provides new insights into BMSC-mediated reparative mechanisms that might one day be translated into novel treatments for neurological disorders.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0002470-Orlic1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
