Establishing a risk profile on the basis of the traditional features of adenoma is therefore not always straightforward.</p><p>The addition of molecular profiling to polyp description offers hope of a more objective and therefore reproducible approach to the classification of colorectal adenomas. The genetic evolutionary paradigm envisages a linear sequence of changes beginning with bi-allelic inactivation of <italic>APC</italic>, followed by oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation and culminating in inactivation of <italic>TP53</italic> at the transition from adenoma to carcinoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> While there is good evidence that <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation is associated with advanced adenoma features<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and could therefore be used as objective evidence of aggression, this approach has a number of limitations. First, <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation also occurs frequently in dysplastic aberrant crypt foci (microadenomas) and in some small tubular adenomas, suggesting that <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation may initiate a subset of small adenomas with limited potential for progression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> Second, around 70% of CRCs lack mutation of <italic>KRAS</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> From this it follows that most of the precancerous lesions that eventually become cancers do not in fact have <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation. There is increasing evidence that CRC evolves through a number of pathways and the traditional adenoma&#x02013;carcinoma sequence, with its accompanying genetic steps, provides a surprisingly narrow window of understanding of this multipathway reality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref></p><p>In recent years, the fundamental division of colorectal polyps into precancerous adenomas and innocent HPs has begun to erode and the concept of an alternative serrated pathway has gained support. This revision began with the description of an intermediate lesion described as serrated adenoma (SA).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> Initially, however, SA was not conceived as an intermediate category of polyp but essentially as an adenoma with a superimposed serrated architecture that conferred only a superficial likeness to a HP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> Additionally, the mixed polyp (MP) was perceived as a chance collision between a HP and an adenoma, giving a combined polyp. These preliminary interpretations did not represent a major departure from the traditional classification of colorectal polyps but preserved the fundamental distinction of neoplastic adenomas versus non-neoplastic HPs.</p><p>Subsequently, it was argued that HP and SA are related lesions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> The latter could arise within the former (giving a MP) or could develop as <italic>de novo</italic> SA but through mechanisms shared with HPs. This proposal subsequently received strong support through the demonstration of molecular alterations common to both types of serrated polyp, notably mutation of <italic>BRAF</italic> and extensive DNA methylation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> This viewpoint was consolidated through the formal recognition of two largely independent pathways of colorectal tumorigenesis: (i) the traditional adenoma&#x02013;carcinoma sequence associated with chomosomally unstable CRCs,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and (ii) the &#x02018;serrated pathway&#x02019; culminating in CRCs with DNA microsatellite instability (MSI), mutation of <italic>BRAF</italic> and extensive DNA methylation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref></p><p>This paper explores the possibility that the early evolution of colorectal cancer is not limited to two essentially independent pathways, but often combines components of these pathways. Indeed, the successful &#x02018;fusion&#x02019; of the hyperproliferation and crypt fission that characterize adenomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> with the inhibition of apoptosis that has been linked with serrated polyps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> may generate lesions with enhanced aggressiveness. Specifically, it is suggested that methylation of the DNA repair gene <italic>O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase</italic> (<italic>MGMT</italic>), mutation of <italic>KRAS</italic> and inactivation of <italic>TP53</italic> provide critical combinations of molecular &#x02018;cross-over&#x02019; between the two pathways that occur at the stage of precancerous polyps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Tissues</title><p>The colorectal polyps used in this study were from a previously characterized subset of a consecutive series of 1250 colonoscopically derived lesions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> The study group included all SAs (sessile and traditional) and MPs and a subset of conventional adenomas and HPs. The previous study analysed proliferative indices and there was therefore selection of HPs that were large and well-oriented and likely to provide sufficient numbers of longitudinally sectioned crypts. Polyps were eliminated from the present study if there was insufficient residual tissue, blocks contained more than one polyp, polyps contained foci of invasive cancer, or there was failure of DNA amplification for both the <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation assays. Fifteen additional polyps from the parent series generated a total study group of 190 polyps. These were reviewed by the first author and classified as: HPs (<italic>n</italic> = 49), tubular adenomas (TAs) (<italic>n</italic> = 62), tubulovillous and villous adenomas (TVAs/VAs) (<italic>n</italic> = 22), sessile SAs (SSAs) (<italic>n</italic> = 32), MPs (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and traditional SAs (<italic>n</italic> = 15). SSA has also been termed sessile serrated polyp and serrated polyp with atypical proliferation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> SSA is distinguished from HP on the basis of greater size, aberrant architecture, atypical proliferation, hypermucinous epithelium, predilection for proximal colon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and molecular features including a higher frequency of <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation and more extensive DNA methylation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> However, the combination of architectural and cytological changes is insufficient for a diagnosis of dysplasia. Serrated polyps with dysplasia include MPs and SAs. MPs may be conceived as a combined lesion that includes: (i) a serrated component that is non-dysplastic and resembles HP or SSA, and (ii) a dysplastic component that may resemble either SA or conventional adenoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> For the purposes of this study, lesions were also included as MPs if they comprised separate serrated and non-serrated components that were both dysplastic. SAs are homogeneous lesions in which there is epithelial serration reminiscent of a HP or SSA together with architectural and cytological changes warranting a diagnosis of dysplasia. The cytological atypia of SA may appear similar to that of conventional adenoma in which nuclei are elongated, hyperchromatic and pseudostratified. However, some SAs may be characterized by non-adenomatous forms of dysplasia in which the nuclei are enlarged, ovoid, vesicular and contain a prominent nucleolus, while the cytoplasm is relatively abundant and eosinophilic. The anatomical site of polyps was grouped as proximal colon (up to splenic flexure) versus distal colon and rectum combined.

The cycling conditions were as follows: 50&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 60 s. After amplification, samples were subjected to a temperature ramp from 60&#x000b0;C to 99&#x000b0;C, rising 1&#x000b0;C each step. For wild-type samples, single peaks were observed at 80&#x000b0;C while samples containing mutant alleles produced single peaks at 85&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>p53 immunohistochemistry and scoring</title><p>This was undertaken on all adenomas and all serrated polyps with dysplasia (traditional SA and MP).

They were subsequently incubated with the primary anti-p53 antibody <bold>(</bold>DO-7, from DakoCytomation, Mississauga, Canada) at a dilution of 1 : 100 for 60 min at 37&#x000b0;C. After washing, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody (EnVision bottle 2) for 30 min, washed again and then developed with the chromogen AEC for 30 min. Finally, the sections were counterstained with Gill's haematoxylin. Polyps were scored as showing loss of expression of MGMT if there was complete absence of nuclear expression throughout one or more crypts. Polyps were scored as positive for aberrant p53 expression if there were distinct subclones characterized by strong nuclear expression that implicated at least 50% of nuclei.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were analysed by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, Fisher's exact test or <italic>T</italic>-test, as appropriate, using SAS software, version 8.2 (Cary, NC, USA). <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05 were interpreted as significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation</title><p>DNA failed to amplify in the <italic>KRAS</italic> assay for one SSA and one TA &#x0003c;&#x0200a;10 mm.

Recommendations for the management of patients with colorectal polyps currently recognize only a single principal type of clinically important polyp: the adenoma. The current study includes additional types of polyp that are likely to have malignant potential, namely serrated polyps with (MP and SA) and without (SSA) dysplasia. This discussion will focus first on adenomas, second on non-dysplastic serrated polyps and will then conclude with the concept that features of these two types of polyp can co-occur or become &#x02018;fused&#x02019; in subtypes of advanced polyps with mixed cytomorphology (hyperplastic and dysplastic) and a serrated and/or villous architecture.</p><sec><title>Adenomas</title><p>The adenomas in this study were grouped as TAs &#x0003c;&#x0200a;10 mm, TAs &#x0003e;&#x0200a;10 mm and TVAs/VAs.

Three of the four <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations occurred in adenomas that also had <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation.

Age was not a predictor of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation in this study. However, many of the patients were undergoing continuing colonoscopic surveillance for colorectal polyps and it is known that after clearance of large polyps, time is required for the growth of newly initiated polyps.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> This could explain why adenomas were smaller in subjects aged &#x0003e;&#x0200a;60 years than in subjects aged &#x0003c;&#x0200a;60 years (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Non-dysplastic serrated polyps: HP and SSA</title><p>Non-dysplastic serrated polyps comprise conventional HPs and the variant lesion which has been described as SSA.

Particular histological features among the Group A polyps were: marked serration, a papillary or villous architecture, a relatively abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, columnar cells with apical mucin droplets, nuclei that were enlarged, ovoid, vesicular and contained a prominent nucleolus, and adjacent non-dysplastic serrated polyp. Particular histological features among the Group B polyps were: some glandular serration, frequent villous change and epithelial dysplasia that appeared adenomatous (cytoplasmic basophilia and nuclei that were elongated, pseudostratified and hyperchromatic without a prominent nucleolus). Importantly, <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation occurred more frequently among Group A polyps (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.03), whereas there was a trend for <italic>KRAS</italic> to be more frequent among Group B polyps (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06).</p><p>The preceding findings indicate that serrated polyps with dysplasia evolve through at least two independent histogenetic pathways. Group A polyps are likely to be initiated by <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation and are serrated lesions at the outset. Group B polyps may begin as conventional adenomas and then become serrated and villous following mutation of <italic>KRAS</italic>. There may be instances in which <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation can initiate lesions which are serrated at the outset and become dysplastic. While this suggestion remains speculative, it may apply to the Group A serrated polyps that show a distinct likeness to the goblet cell variant of HP in which columnar cells are eosinophilic and lack mucin-filled microvesicles and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation is frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1E,F</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> The literature refers to the concept of &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; SA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> Based on the current findings, it is likely that several mechanisms can account for adenomatous lesions with glandular serration and that &#x02018;traditional&#x02019; SA is not a single entity.</p></sec><sec><title>Concept of &#x02018;fusion&#x02019; pathways to crc</title><p>Colorectal polyps have traditionally been classified into distinct histogenetic types that may progress to CRC through independent pathways of colorectal tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).
