Translation is most commonly initiated by cap-dependent scanning, but many eukaryotic mRNAs contain internal ribosome entry segments (IRESs), providing an alternative means of initiation capable of independent regulation. Here, we show by using dicistronic luciferase reporter vectors that the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the mRNA encoding human insulin receptor (hIR) contains a functional IRES. RNAi-mediated knockdown showed that the protein PTB was required for maximum IRES activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that PTB1, PTB2 and nPTB, but not unr or PTB4, bound to hIR mRNA, and deletion mapping implicated a CCU motif 448 nt upstream of the initiator AUG in PTB binding. The IR-IRES was functional in a number of cell lines, and most active in cells of neuronal origin, as assessed by luciferase reporter assays. The IRES was more active in confluent than sub-confluent cells, but activity did not change during differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes. IRES activity was stimulated by insulin in sub-confluent cells. The IRES may function to maintain expression of IR protein in tissues such as the brain where mRNA translation by cap-dependent scanning is less effective.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Regulation of mRNA translation is an important mechanism determining the level of expression of many proteins in eukaryotic cells. At least two distinct mechanisms are used to bring ribosomes to the mRNA. In the most commonly used process, termed cap-dependent scanning, a protein complex eIF4F (comprised of eIF4E, the cap-binding protein eIF4G, a large scaffold protein and eIF4A, a dead box helicase) interacts initially with the 5&#x02032;-end of the mRNA and, via the interaction of eIF3 with eIF4G, recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the alternative process (internal ribosome entry), the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) of the mRNA is capable, in the presence of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, of adopting a highly complex structure (internal ribosome entry segment, IRES) that allows the ribosome to be acquired to a site that can be a considerable distance from the 5&#x02032;-end of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The proteins required for this process have yet to be fully identified although it has been found that many cellular and viral IRESs require polypryimidine tract binding protein (PTB) for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Cellular IRESs are generally used under patho-physiological conditions when cap-dependent scanning is compromised, for example during polio virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Overall, around 10% of mRNAs have potential for their translation to be initiated by internal ribosome entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, the subsets of mRNAs that are still translated under different conditions are distinct, suggesting that in each condition there is co-ordinated translational regulation dependent on specific elements. Certain families of highly related mRNAs have also been shown to be translated by internal ribosome entry, for example the Myc family of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15">12&#x02013;15</xref>). The IRESs found in the c-, L- and N-<italic>myc</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTRs require a common set of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors (ITAFs) for their activity suggesting that they may be regulated in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). IRES-mediated translational regulation is also prevalent amongst growth factors and growth factor receptors. Translation initiation on a number of growth factor mRNAs (IGFII, PDGF2, TGF-&#x003b2;, FGF-2 and VEGF) is specifically regulated during differentiation, growth and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The mRNAs encoding mammalian insulin like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), angiotensin type I receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), vasopressin v1b receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and TrkB neurotrophin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) all contain functional IRESs. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like receptor mRNA contains an IRES that coordinates physiological signals responsible for monitoring nutrient and cell growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>The level of insulin receptor (IR) expression is an important determinant of cellular insulin sensitivity, but mechanisms regulating IR expression are poorly understood. The IR is widely distributed in almost all mammalian tissues but levels of expression vary widely in different cell types, being highest in classical insulin target tissues such as liver and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The IR gene promoter was characterized almost 20 years ago and shown to contain elements typical of housekeeping genes as well as elements responsive to glucocorticoids and insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). More recently, up-regulation of IR mRNA induced by serum deprivation was shown to involve the transcription factor FOXO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). It has long been known that prolonged exposure of cells to insulin induces IR down-regulation via internalization and enhanced protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, the regulation of mammalian IR expression at the level of mRNA translation has not previously been reported. Here, we show that the mRNA encoding human IR contains an IRES which is dependent on PTB and nPTB for activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The activity of this IRES differs between cell types and it is stimulated by insulin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning and sequencing of HIR 5&#x02032;-UTR</title><p>Primers were designed to amplify human insulin receptor (HIR) 5&#x02032;-UTR based on previously identified transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and using RNA extracted from human epithelial carcinoma (HeLa) cells.

The 5&#x02032;-UTR of the human IR mRNA is long and GC-rich and is highly conserved between species, the mouse and rat mRNAs showing &#x0223c;70% identity to the human sequence consistent with functional significance of this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The IR 5&#x02032;-UTR is similar in this regard to that of the highly related type I IGF-1R which has been shown to contain an IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). To test whether the IR 5&#x02032;-UTR also contains an IRES the corresponding DNA was obtained by RT&#x02013;PCR and inserted into the dicistronic reporter vector pRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This vector contains the <italic>Renilla</italic> and firefly luciferases as the upstream and downstream cistrons respectively and an increase in firefly luciferase activity is indicative of an IRES in the preceding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The resulting plasmid (pRIRF) was transfected into HeLa cells and luciferase activity was determined. The presence of the IR 5&#x02032;-UTR stimulated the translation of the firefly luciferase approximately nine times over that attributable to read-through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>Bi). To rule out apparent IRES activity resulting from enhanced read-through the IR 5&#x02032;-UTR was inserted into the vector phpRF that contains a stable hairpin upstream of the <italic>Renilla</italic> cistron. The presence of the hairpin reduced the activity from the <italic>Renilla</italic> cistron by 70% but had no effect on the amount of firefly luciferase produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>Bii). To ensure that the IRES activity was not due to the presence of cryptic promoters in the 5&#x02032;-UTR of IR the DNA corresponding to this region was inserted into the vector pBRRF which does not contain a promoter. This vector was again transfected into HeLa cells and luciferase activity was determined. No luciferase activity was detected showing that there was no promoter present in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>Biii). To determine whether increases in firefly luciferase expression were due to an increase in monocistronic mRNAs being produced by alternative splicing events that removed the <italic>Renilla</italic> ORF or by cryptic promoter activity, a quantitative real-time PCR assay was carried out to determine the amount of reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>Biv). Two amplicons were chosen within the <italic>Renilla</italic> ORF (Ren1 and Ren2) with the firefly amplicon (Fire1) selected close to the AUG initiation codon. A ratio of 1 : 1 of firefly : <italic>Renilla</italic> mRNA would be expected in an intact dicistronic message and is indeed observed in mRNA from the control vector pRF, and also in a vector containing the IRES from EMCV. Insertion of the insulin receptor 5&#x02032;-UTR between the cistrons of the pRF vector results in a change in the ratio between the cistrons. However, as the resulting ratios are less than 1, this suggests that there is no cryptic promoter activity in the IR 5&#x02032;-UTR, and there is no evidence for a cryptic splicing event that results in loss of the <italic>Renilla</italic> cistron (both events which would lead to the production of functional, capped, monocistronic firefly luciferase mRNAs that would be translated by the cap-dependent scanning mechanism). Taken together these data strongly suggest that IR 5&#x02032;-UTR contains a functional IRES. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>5&#x02032;-UTRs of human and rat IR mRNA.

IR-IRES activity was reduced to 50% of the untreated values by RNAi suggesting strongly that PTB is an ITAF for IR-IRES cells grown in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>Aii). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The IR-IRES requires PTB for activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.

After extensive washing, proteins were eluted with buffer containing 300 mM NaCl and the products were separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and immunoblotted for PTB.

The RNAi used would decrease the levels of PTBs -1, -2 and -4 therefore assays were performed <italic>in vitro</italic> to identify whether any one of these proteins preferentially interacted with the IR-IRES. EMSAs were carried out using purified PTB isoforms and additional proteins that have been shown to bind other cellular and viral IRESs. Radiolabelled IR-IRES RNA generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions was incubated with the purified proteins. A complex that migrated more slowly was observed when IR-RNA was incubated with hnRNPK, PTB1, PTB2 and nPTB but not unr or PTB4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>Bii) or a number of additional potential ITAFs including PCBP1, PCBP2 or La (data not shown). It has been shown for the Apaf-1 IRES that unr only binds in the presence of PTB1, however no binding of unr to the IR-IRES was observed in the presence of PTB1 (data not shown). To confirm that the interaction with these proteins and the IR-IRES-RNA was specific, EMSAs were performed using GAPDH RNA. In this case, there was no shift in the presence of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>Bii). Interestingly, although the molecular weights of PTB1, PTB2 and nPTB are almost identical the IR-IRES RNA migration was delayed to very different extents by these three proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>Bii). This could suggest that the number of PTB molecules interacting with the RNA differs for different isoforms, or that the IR-IRES RNA adopts alternative structures upon binding to these three different yet highly related proteins.</p><p>Most cellular IRESs are inactive <italic>in vitro</italic> suggesting an absolute requirement for ITAFs that are not present in these systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).

There was no additive effect on IRES activity by combinations of PTB and unr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) or hnRNPK with PTB isoforms (data not shown). To confirm that the stimulation of protein synthesis from the firefly cistron was due to enhanced IRES activity, RNA transcripts were derived which contain an &#x02018;A&#x02019; cap rather than a &#x02018;G&#x02019; cap and these were used to prime rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The data show that, as expected, there is a reduction in the synthesis of <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase from these transcripts but no effect on IRES-mediated firefly luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>Cii). Moreover, addition of PTB or nPTB to the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reaction that contained the &#x02018;A&#x02019; cap mRNAs caused the same degree of stimulation of IRES-activity as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>Cii).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the minimal active element</title><p>It has been shown previously that PTB interacts with cellular IRES RNA in polypyrimidine rich regions of RNA that contain one or more repeats of (CCU)<italic>n</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Deletion mapping was performed to identify the minimal active element of the IR-IRES to locate any such motifs. Primers were designed to various regions of the IR 5&#x02032;-UTR and a series of fragments was generated. For example, using primer 1 as the forward primer and primer a, as the reverse primer, the fragment 1a was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These fragments were then sub-cloned into the dicistronic vector pRF, and the corresponding set of constructs were transfected into HeLa cells and luciferase activity was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Using this approach the minimal active element was found to reside in fragment 2a which spans a 180-nt region from 90 to 270 in the IR 5&#x02032;-UTR (451&#x02013;271 nt upstream of the translation start site) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

Since the IR-IRES was shown to be activated <italic>in vitro</italic> by PTB isoforms and particularly by nPTB the IR-IRES function in a number of cell lines was determined particularly those of neuronal origin, which have been shown previously to express high levels of nPTB including SY5Y, N2a, NIE115, NB2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). These cell lines were transfected with pRIRF and luciferase activity determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The IR-IRES was found to be active in a range of cell lines but especially so in certain neuronal cell lines, e.g. in SY5Y cells the IR-IRES is twice as active as in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A) and is similar in this regard to both the N-<italic>myc</italic> and Apaf-1 IRESs that also require nPTB for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The exception to this was the cell line B50, originally derived from rat hippocampal neurons, in which IR-IRES activity was low.

The 5&#x02032;-UTR of IGF-1R mRNA also contain an IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), as does the <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin/IGF-like receptor (dINR) mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Despite a high degree of sequence similarity between the IR and IGF-1R coding regions, there is no discernable sequence similarity between the respective 5&#x02032;-UTRs, although for both receptors the 5&#x02032;-UTRs are well conserved between species (&#x0223c;70% identity, human vs rat/mouse). The human IR 5&#x02032;-UTR is &#x0223c;540 nt in length, and deletion analysis indicated that a region 90&#x02013;270 from the transcription start site (or 451&#x02013;271 nt upstream of the translation start site) contained the minimal active IRES element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The IGF-1R mRNA has an even longer 5&#x02032;-UTR (1038 nt in human, 943 nt in rat) and has the potential to form stable secondary structure which is inhibitory to scanning by the 43S ribosomal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The IGF-1R IRES has been localized to a region of 85 nt immediately upstream of the translation start site and downstream of the elements that are proposed to be inhibitory to cap-dependent ribosomal scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The 3&#x02032;-end of the 5&#x02032;-UTR is highly pyrimidine-rich and predicted to form a stem loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Like many cellular IRESs the IR-IRES requires PTB for activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Within cellular IRESs PTB interacts with polypyrimidine rich sequences that contain the motif CCU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The hIR 5&#x02032;-UTR contains several such motifs, of which those at 6, 30, 93, 172, 387 and 456 relative to the transcription start site (&#x02212;535, &#x02212;511, &#x02212;448, &#x02212;369, &#x02212;154 and &#x02212;85, respectively relative to the translation start site) are conserved in the rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, two of these CCU motifs lie within the minimal IRES-containing region (90&#x02013;270) defined by deletion mapping, which was also shown by EMSA to bind PTB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). A model of the structure of the IR 5&#x02032;-UTR, derived by constraining the Mfold algorithm with experimental data identifying double- and single-stranded regions, predicts that the CCU motifs at 93 and 172 are both situated in bulges within stem structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) and that the structural context of the motif at 172 would be preserved in the minimal active IRES fragment. Thus, it is highly likely that binding of PTB at one or both of the CCU motifs located at 93&#x02013;95 and 172&#x02013;174 (448&#x02013;446 and 369&#x02013;367 nt upstream of translation start site) is critical for IRES function.</p><p>The IGF-1R IRES also binds PTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and several other proteins, including the ELAV RNA stability factor HuR, which is inhibitory to both cap-dependent scanning and especially IRES-mediated translation, and hnRNP C which competes with HuR for binding and enhances IRES-mediated translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). It remains to be seen whether these or other proteins also bind to the IR IRES, although the differences in location and sequence of the IR and IGF-1R IRESs are strongly suggestive of different mechanisms of regulation.</p><p>The IR-IRES is similar to IRESs in the Apaf-1 and N-<italic>myc</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTRs in that it is activated <italic>in vitro</italic> by nPTB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

Both IR and IGF-1R are expressed in the nervous system and have been proposed to function both during neuronal development and in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>). Indeed, the IR is widely expressed throughout the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), with highest levels in the hypothalamus, olfactory bulb and cerebellum, and a specific receptor-mediated transport system exists for insulin at the blood brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Numerous functions have been proposed for neuronal insulin receptors, including roles in neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), maintenance of energy balance and reproductive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), and both protection from and promotion of age-related neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). It would not be surprising therefore if sophisticated mechanisms exist to regulate the expression of brain IR in response to diverse stimuli.</p><p>It is known that in both fully differentiated tissues, such as the brain, and in cells grown to high confluency there is a reduction in cap-dependent ribosomal scanning of mRNAs due to changes in the levels and/or phosphorylation states of the eIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). IRESs can potentially be used to maintain expression of key proteins in terminally differentiated tissues. For instance, it has been shown that the FGF-2-IRES (but not the c-<italic>myc</italic>-IRES) functions in adult mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). It is possible therefore that the IR-IRES is active in certain (but not all) cells arrested in G0 and in some terminally differentiated tissues, such as adult brain, to maintain expression of the IR and/or to allow regulation of that expression in response to external stimuli.</p><p>We found that the activity of the IR-IRES was dependent not only on cell type but also on cell density. In common with the PKC&#x003b4; IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) the IR-IRES was most active at high cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), when levels of total protein synthesis will be reduced. However, cellular IRESs found in the 5&#x02032;-UTRs of Apaf-1, c-<italic>myc</italic> or Bag-1 are not sensitive to changes in cell density (unpublished data). Insulin itself stimulated IRES activity in sub-confluent but not in confluent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> it was proposed that cap-dependent translation is used for dINR synthesis when nutrients and insulin-like peptides are available, and that the dINR IRES is used to drive increased receptor synthesis under conditions of low availability of nutrients and insulin-like peptides, when transcription of the dINR gene is enhanced while cap-dependent translation is inhibited by dephosphorylation of d4E-BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Interestingly, nutrient and growth factor deprivation of cultured mouse muscle cells was similarly accompanied by a 6- to 8-fold increase in IR protein and 2-fold up-regulation of IR mRNA, suggestive of an analogous FOXO-mediated coupled transcription/translation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>There is little published information describing regulation of expression of mammalian IR at the level of mRNA translation. The human IR mRNA is one of only a very small number of transcripts that remain associated with polysomes when cap-dependent translation is inhibited by poliovirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), consistent with IRES-dependent translation initiation under these conditions. However, studies of factors determining IR expression in different mammalian tissues and under different patho-physiological conditions have focused on mRNA transcription and protein degradation as regulatory mechanisms. It is possible that the IR-IRES simply functions to maintain expression of IR under conditions where cap-dependent initiation is compromised, including perhaps in some differentiated cells. However, in the case of the IGF-1R there is evidence that regulation of expression does occur at a translational level. The IGF-1R was among a number of transcripts shown by cDNA array screening of polysome-associated mRNAs to be translationally regulated during antigenic stimulation of human T-lymphocytes, although underlying mechanisms were not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). Recently, it was shown that binding of inhibitory HuR and stimulatory hnRNP C to the IGF-1R IRES was influenced by changes in cellular environment or proliferative status, and it was suggested that dysregulation of the IGF-1R-IRES through changes in expression of RNA-binding translational-regulatory proteins could contribute to over-expression of IGF-1R in some tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). It will be interesting now to investigate whether the IR-IRES is similarly capable of dynamic regulation, and whether this influences the expression of IR protein under different patho-physiological conditions, especially in neuronal tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp623/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp623_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp623_nar-00698-r-2009-File009.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (to L.C.C., M.D., A.B., A.E.W., K.S.); Diabetes UK (R.D.
