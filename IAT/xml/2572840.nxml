Less is known of the role of dystroglycan in more fundamental aspects of cell adhesion in other cell types, nor of its role in myoblast cell adhesion.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>We have examined the role of dystroglycan in the early stages of myoblast adhesion and spreading and found that dystroglycan initially associates with other adhesion proteins in large puncta morphologically similar to podosomes. Using a human SH3 domain phage display library we identified Tks5, a key regulator of podosomes, as interacting with &#x003b2;-dystroglycan. We verified the interaction by immunoprecipitation, GST-pulldown and immunfluorescence localisation. Both proteins localise to puncta during early phases of spreading, but importantly following stimulation with phorbol ester, also localise to structures indistinguishable from podosomes. Dystroglycan overexpression inhibited podosome formation by sequestering Tks5 and Src. Mutation of dystroglycan tyrosine 890, previously identified as a Src substrate, restored podosome formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We propose therefore, that Src-dependent phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-dystroglycan results in the formation of a Src/dystroglycan complex that drives the SH3-mediated association between dystroglycan and Tks5 which together regulate podosome formation in myoblasts.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular adhesion, migration and invasion are fundamental properties of most cell types during development and normal tissue/cellular function. For these cells, cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion is essential to the maintenance of polarity, differentiation and tissue architecture. During development some cells, including myoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Anderson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, migrate large distances. Others, such as macrophages are actively migratory as part of their normal function. In both instances, in order to migrate these cells need to overcome the physical and biochemical barrier of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Matrix degradation is most often seen at specialised adhesion sites known as podosomes or adhesion/protrusion sites known as invadopodia, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Linder1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Such sites are proposed to mediate the polarised migration of cells that cross ECM boundaries. Podosomes are transient peripheral adhesion structures often formed in migrating tumour and other cells and contain a dense actin-rich core and a ring of actin regulatory/binding and adhesion proteins. Podosome assembly is regulated by non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Tarone1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and by Rho family GTPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Zhang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Linder2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Related structures called invadopodia contain a similar complement of proteins, but are larger, centrally located and more persistent. In addition to which they have the ability to invade the matrix beneath them presumably as a prelude to tissue invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Gimona1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We have demonstrated a key role for dystroglycan (DG) in cell migration and adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-James1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Batchelor1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and recently identified DG as a component of podosomes.</p><p>Dystroglycan was first identified as a laminin binding protein from brain, and as part of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) of skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Smalheiser1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-IbraghimovBeskrovnaya1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. DG is a transmembrane adhesion receptor comprising &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits that are post-translationally cleaved from a single precursor peptide and subjected to extensive and functionally important glycosylation. The extracellular &#x003b1;-subunit mediates the link to laminin in the ECM and also binds the transmembrane &#x003b2;-subunit through non-covalent interactions, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Winder1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. As we have shown previously, the intracellular domain of &#x003b2;-DG mediates direct and indirect attachments to the actin cytoskeleton via a number of actin binding proteins, and also makes associations with a number of signalling and adaptor proteins (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Higginson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and references therein). Loss of DG or any of the associated DGC proteins in muscle leads to loss of the entire complex with loss of membrane-cytoskeleton stabilisation and consequent muscle damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Ervasti1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. DG is a key component of the DGC of skeletal muscle and plays an important role in costameric cell adhesion. By anchoring the costamere, the principle adhesion structure along the length of the individual myofibres, stably to the ECM, DG serves to preserve membrane integrity by protecting the cell against contraction induced membrane damage. In addition a number of signalling functions are also associated with DG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Batchelor2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to a specific role in the maintenance of muscle integrity, DG has a more ubiquitous role in cell adhesion, signalling and polarity, and DG protein levels are reduced in almost all epithelial tumours so far examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Thompson1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. We have identified DG as a component of small adhesion puncta during the early stages of myoblast spreading and characterised these puncta as podosomes containing a regulatory complex comprising dystroglycan, Tks5 and Src.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse myoblast cells (H-2K<sup>b</sup>-tsA58) were maintained as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Morgan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Following extensive dialysis, coverslips were coated in rhodamine-gelatin by immersion for 5 minutes. Excess was drained off and coverslips fixed in 0.5&#x00025; (v/v) gluteraldehyde for 15 min. Coverslips were washed 3 times in PBS, incubated in ice-cold NaBH<sub>4</sub> (3 min) with agitation, washed with PBS, and stored in 70&#x00025; ethanol.

To evaluate binding of &#x003b2;-DG to the GST-SH3 domains, myoblast lysate prepared in radio immune-precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer was passed over a GST-SH3 domain affinity column.

We therefore examined the role of DG in the formation of cell adhesions during spreading and adhesion of myoblasts. During the early phases of cell spreading, and independent of the substrate on which the cells were spreading on, DG could be seen in relatively large and densely staining puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These puncta were often located more centrally, and appeared morphologically distinct from peripheral focal adhesion-like structures. Whilst both &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-dystroglycan as well as utrophin co-localised in these puncta, other more traditional adhesion proteins including vinculin, talin and FAK as well as the more generic phospho-tyrosine also typically seen in adhesion structures were also localised in the puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, neither &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-dystroglycan nor utrophin appeared to localise in more peripheral focal adhesion type structures, compare vinculin staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The dystroglycan-staining puncta do not appear morphologically to resemble focal adhesions and the differential staining of dystroglycan also suggests that the puncta are somehow different to focal adhesions stained by vinculin. Whilst it is possible that the puncta are focal contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Nobes1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Hotchin1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> their more central position in the cell and their relatively large size would argue against this. One other adhesion structure that has a larger and rounder morphology is the podosome, typically found in cells of the monocyte lineage, osteoclasts and smooth muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Gimona1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Myoblasts have not previously been demonstrated to form podosomes. Therefore in order to determine if myoblasts could form podosomes, we subjected well-spread myoblasts to stimulation with the phorbol ester PDBu, in order to activate Src downstream of PKC as part of a pathway leading to podosome formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Tatin1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Myoblast cells were then co-stained for classical markers of podosomes: actin and cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Podosomes contain a dense actin-rich core surrounded by a loose meshwork of adhesion proteins and actin binding and regulatory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Gimona1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In this regard the structures formed in myoblast cells appear morphologically similar to podosomes seen in other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Linder1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and thus henceforth will be considered as podosomes. Podosome formation was also independent of the substrate that the cells were adhered to. Actin- and cortactin-containing structures formed in a band behind the leading edge of the cell equally well on glass, gelatin, fibronectin and whole or E3 fragment of laminin, compared to the unstimulated cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). A further characteristic of podosomes and structurally related invadopodia, is the ability to degrade the matrix beneath the adhesion site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Gimona1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The dystroglycan-containing structures in myoblasts appear to share this property too, in that there are zones of clearance of rhodamine-gelatin beneath the dystroglycan-containing adhesion structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, DG co-localised in podosomes with plectin and integrin, other proteins known to be resident in podosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Gimona1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Gad1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003638.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Other well-characterised myoblast cells such as C2C12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Bains1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> were also able to form podosomes in response to PDBu (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003638.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). To ascertain whether or not the localisation of DG to podosomes was unique to myoblasts we also examined the localisation of DG in A7r5 smooth muscle cells in response to PDBu stimulation. A7r5 cells are a well-established model for podosomes and as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003638.s001">Figure S1C</xref>, DG also colocalised in podosomes with actin, cortactin or vinculin. Thus it appears that myoblasts can form podosomes and that dystroglycan is localised to podosomes along with other well recognised podosome proteins.

The DG cytoplasmic domain comprises 25&#x00025; proline residues which form six PxxP motifs suggestive of potential SH3 domain interaction sites. Given the importance of SH3 domain adaptors in mediating connections between proteins at adhesion sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-ZaidelBar1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> we undertook a human proteome-wide SH3 domain phage-display screen using the cytoplasmic domain of &#x003b2;-DG as an affinity ligand, in order to identify potential adaptor proteins. In agreement with the predicted SH3 binding sites, significant enrichment of clones from the SH3 domain displaying phage library was observed upon selection with &#x003b2;-DG, some of these currently form the basis of ongoing studies in our laboratories. Sequencing of the clones identified the third SH3 domains of the homologous adapter proteins Tks5 and Tks4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Lock1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> among the most frequent &#x003b2;-DG binders. Although the adapter protein Grb2 has been suggested in the literature as an SH3-containing binding partner of &#x003b2;-dystroglycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Yang1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, neither of the two SH3 domains of Grb2 were found among the affinity selected clones. When we produced homogeneous phage preparations carrying either the third SH3 domain of Tks5, or the N- or C-terminal SH3 of Grb2, only Tks5 but not Grb2 SH3-displaying phages bound to &#x003b2;-dystroglycan-immobilized plates better than to negative control plates (data not shown). Moreover, no &#x003b2;-dystroglycan binding could be observed by Grb2 SH3 domains expressed as recombinant GST fusion proteins (data not shown). Thus, the failure to identify Grb2 SH3 domains in the phage library screen was in agreement with undetectable &#x003b2;-dystroglycan binding capacity in these individual assays, suggesting that the previous studies on Grb2 binding to &#x003b2;-dystroglycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Russo1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> may have overestimated the affinities of these SH3 interactions. Based on use of this library for affinity selection of a large number of ligands, some with no known partners and some with well characterized SH3 partners, it has become clear that only moderately strong binding (with reference to SH3 binding in general) is needed in order to positively select individual SH3 clones from this library. Based on Kd values previously established for SH3 interactions that we have selected or failed to select in our screens, we have estimated that a binding affinity of approximately 10&#x02013;20 &#x000b5;M would be generally required to support positive selection. Considering that selection of the third SH3 of Tks4 and Tks5 was relatively inefficient, we would anticipate the affinity in these cases to be in the 5&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M range. Compared to some other protein interactions, this would be rather weak, but among SH3-mediated interactions represents a perfectly respectable value.</p><p>Tks5 is a 140 kDa protein comprising an amino terminal PX domain followed by five SH3 domains and was first identified in a screen for Src substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Lock1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly Tks5 has also been found to associate with ADAMs family proteases and to localise to podosomes in response to Src activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Seals1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Abram1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Tks4 was identified from databases and like Tks5 has a PX domain but lacks the fourth of the five SH3 domains. More recently it has been suggested that Tks5 may undergo alternative splicing to remove the first SH3 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Blouw1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, however the relationship between this putative alternatively spliced Tks5 and Tks4 are not clear. No further evidence of a role for Tks4 is available, we therefore concentrated our efforts on the Tks5 SH3 domain interaction.</p><p>We verified an interaction between Tks5 and &#x003b2;-DG by reciprocal immunoprecipitation from myoblast lysates. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g003">figure 3A</xref>, antibodies against either &#x003b2;-DG or Tks5 were able to immunoprecipitate the other protein. To further substantiate a role for the 3<sup>rd</sup> SH3 domain we used a GST-SH3 pulldown to recover &#x003b2;-DG from myoblast lysates. DG was recovered specifically with the 3<sup>rd</sup> but not the 5<sup>th</sup> SH3 domain of Tks5 fused to GST. Significantly the &#x003b2;-DG bound to the Tks5 was only recognised by an anti-phospho &#x003b2;-DG antibody that is able to recognise DG that is phosphorylated on tyrosine 890 (Y890). A monoclonal antibody that recognises a similar epitope, but that can't bind to &#x003b2;-DG that is phosphorylated on Y890 did not detect any &#x003b2;-DG in either pulldown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This result suggests that not only is Src activation necessary for podosome formation, and for the recruitment of Tks5 to podosomes, but that when &#x003b2;-DG is associated with Tks5 in cells, it too is phosphorylated on tyrosine at Y890. In order to demonstrate an interaction between DG and Tks5 in a cellular context, we employed a GFP-tagged Tks5 construct fused with a mitochondrial targeting sequence at its amino terminus. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, the mito-Tks5-GFP construct was efficiently targeted to mitochondria and localised extensively with mito-tracker red staining in the myoblast cells. We then co-expressed the mito-Tks5-GFP construct with a construct comprising the cytoplasmic domain of &#x003b2;-DG only with an amino-terminal Myc tag. As we have demonstrated previously this construct is entirely cytosolic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Batchelor1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Higginson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, and therefore its localisation should respond to that of a binding partner that was localised to a discrete domain such as the mitochondrion. As can be seen, this is indeed the case; the cytoplasmic Myc-c&#x003b2;-DG construct is colocalised with the mito-Tks5-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) rather than appearing diffusely in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) substantiating an interaction between the two proteins. We further verified the association between Tks5 and DG by immunfluorescence localisation of the two proteins with F-actin in myoblasts before and after stimulation with PDBu. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g004">Figure 4</xref>, whilst there is a faint and indistinct area of colocalisation between Tks5 and &#x003b2;-DG towards the leading extremities of unstimulated myoblasts, which may correspond to the podosome cluster precursors described by Matsudaira and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Evans1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, following PDBu stimulation all three proteins colocalise robustly to distinct podosome structures behind the leading edge of the cell. And as in typical podosome structures, there is a clear actin core with a more diffuse and wider distribution of dystroglycan and Tks5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g004">Figure 4 inset</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0003638-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003638.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Interaction of DG with Tks5.</title><p>A. &#x003b2;-DG (43 kDa) was co-immunoprecipitated from myoblast extracts with Tks5 antiserum and Tks5 (150 kDa) was co-immunoprecipitated with &#x003b2;-DG antibodies.

In order to address this we examined myoblast cells either overexpressing or depleted for DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g005">Figure 5A&#x02013;C</xref>). As determined by assessing the characteristic actin morphology of podosomes and compared to control cells, siRNA-mediated depletion of DG to 50&#x00025; of endogenous levels in myoblast cells had a modest but statistically significant effect on the number of cells producing podosomes in response to PDBu. By contrast, over-expression of DG (tagged with either Myc or GFP) dramatically and completely abolished the ability of myoblasts to form podosomes following PDBu stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In both dystroglycan knockdown and dystroglycan overexpressing cells there was a reduction in Tks5 to an approximately equal level. But despite this reduction in Tks5, the levels of reduction did not correlate with the change in podosome levels in these cells. Thus the effect on podosome assembly of altering DG expression levels either up or down was not a simple consequence of affecting Tks5 levels in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>) as Tks5 levels were equivalent in both knockdown and overexpressing cells. We hypothesised therefore, that in over-expressing DG we are potentially titrating out factors such as Tks5 that are crucial to podosome formation. The relative levels of Tks5 and dystroglycan would therefore appear to be as important in the regulation of podosome assembly as the actual levels of each protein. From this one could propose that podosome formation should be restored in cells overexpressing DG by the concomitant overexpression of Tks5 in the same cell, restoring the ratio of dystroglycan to Tks5. By co-transfecting myoblasts with Tks5-GFP and DG-Myc we could observe a restoration of podosome formation in response to PDBu, but only once Tks5 overexpression reached some threshold level of expression that balanced the level of DG-Myc overexpression and permitted podosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). However, if DG-myc levels predominated over Tks5-GFP, podosome assembly is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Quantification of the relative fluorescence intensity for the two fluors (GFP for Tks5 and rhodamine for DG-Myc) per &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> of cell area in the cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref> revealed that a fluorescence ratio of DG&#x02236;Tks5 of 1&#x02236;0.6 was permissive for podosome formation, whereas a DG&#x02236;Tks5 fluorescence ratios of 1&#x02236;0.47 or 1&#x02236;0.2 was inhibitory to podosome formation. These ratios represent ratios of fluorescence and not ratios of the actual proteins, but nonetheless changing the amount of dystroglycan relative to Tks5 appears to alter the ability of cells to form podosomes in a &#x02018;dose-dependent&#x02019; manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>).

By mutating potential binding sites or phosphorylation sites within the cytoplasmic domain of &#x003b2;-DG we could also potentially restore podosome formation by inhibiting the dominant-negative effect of DG overexpression. We therefore mutagenised potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites and proline residues in the SH3 domain binding consensus PxxP motifs within the &#x003b2;-DG cytoplasmic domain that might mediate SH3 domains interactions with Tks5. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g007">Figure 7</xref>, most mutations did not significantly reduce the inhibition of podosome formation compared to control, as dystroglycan-GFP carrying these mutations still had a dominant-negative effect. This was not due to the constructs failing to express as can be seen from the inset, the levels of DG-GFP, despite being a transient expression, are relatively similar. The fact these mutants did not behave exactly like wild-type and completely inhibit podosome formation, may reflect short range conformational effects induced by the mutations that perturbed interactions in neighbouring regions of the &#x003b2;-dystroglycan cytoplasmic domain. However mutations in Y890 restored podosome formation in myoblasts suppressing the dominant-negative effect of over-expressing dystroglycan-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This result suggests that the phosphorylation of Y890 by Src is an important event in podosome formation. Overexpression of Y890A DG significantly restored podosomes to 70&#x00025; of control levels, whereas mutation of other tyrosine residues or mutation of potential SH3 binding sites did not significantly affect podosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These results highlight the importance of phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-DG Y890 in podosome assembly and corroborate the finding that DG associated with Tks5 is tyrosine phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Earlier work has shown dystroglycan Y890 to be a substrate for Src family kinases. We therefore treated early spreading myoblast cells with the Src inhibitor PP2 to observe the effect on podosome assembly. Compared to untreated cells, PP2 completely prevented the formation of the dystroglycan-rich puncta or podosomes instead DG was localised to the cell periphery along with actin and cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g008">Figure 8AB</xref>). As we have shown previously inhibition of Src does not affect focal adhesion formation per se <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Fincham1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, accordingly paxillin, talin and vinculin are all visible in peripheral focal adhesion-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g008">Figure 8AB</xref>), rather Src activity appears to be essential for focal adhesion turnover or disassembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Fincham2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast in podosomes, Src activity appears to be required for the phosphorylation of Tks5 and &#x003b2;-DG in podosome <italic>assembly</italic>. Phosphorylation of DG Y890 would form a potential SH2 domain interaction site and DG phosphorylated at this site has been demonstrated previously to interact with Src itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Sotgia1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore carried out cell fractionation experiments in cells expressing different levels of dystroglycan and examined the distribution of dystroglycan and Src between cytoplasmic, membrane and cytoskeletal fractions. Due to its association with the actin cytoskeleton, DG is not readily extracted from membranes by Triton, but rather partitions with the insoluble cytoskeletal fraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Campbell1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore utilised a protocol first extracting in CHAPS to release DG from the membrane, followed by a triton extraction step to precipitate the cytoskeleton and associated proteins in the triton insoluble fraction. This method has been employed with previous success to extract ERM family proteins and dystroglycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Lamb1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Spence2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Overexpression of DG results in increased levels of free DG in the CHAPS soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Batchelor1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g009">Figure 9A&#x02013;D</xref>). Furthermore, compared with the cytoskeleton associated (triton insoluble) dystroglycan a greater proportion of the CHAPS soluble DG is phosphorylated on Y890. In control cells the distribution of Src is almost exclusively in the triton insoluble fraction, but in cells overexpressing DG-GFP, Src localisation switches dramatically to the CHAPS soluble fraction. It would therefore appear that Y890 phosphorylation results in the creation of an SH2 domain binding site which also recruits Src to the CHAPS soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g009">Figure 9A</xref>,). This is supported by the finding that Src can be co-immunoprecipitated with both Tks5 and dystroglycan, suggesting the existence of a ternary complex between Tks5, Src and dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003638-g009">Figure 9E</xref>). DG overexpression can therefore redirect the regulatory functions of both Tks5 and Src, the combined effects of which result in the inhibition of podosome formation. This adds further support to the idea that levels of dystroglycan must be finely balanced to maintain an appropriate level of scaffolding and signalling to regulate podosome formation.</p><fig id="pone-0003638-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003638.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Mutation of the DG phosphorylation site restores podosome formation.</title><p>Myoblast cells were transiently transfected with dystroglycan-GFP wild-type sequence, or containing the indicated point mutation in the cytoplasmic domain.

Furthermore, studies from the Lisanti group have demonstrated that Y890 is a substrate of Src family kinases and in addition phosphorylation of Y890 by Src provides an SH2 domain interaction site for Src itself and other tyrosine kinases or adaptor proteins including Fyn, Csk, Nck, and Shc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Sotgia1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Whilst previous studies have identified &#x003b1;-dystroglycan in focal adhesion and cell adhesion type structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Spence2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Belkin1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, and its intracellular linker utrophin in focal adhesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Belkin2">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref> there is little convincing evidence for &#x003b2;-dystroglycan in such structures even though it is presumed to be there to link between &#x003b1;-dystroglycan and utrophin. In this study we have identified &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-dystroglycan with utrophin in adhesion structures in spreading myoblasts. But these adhesion structures have a morphology more typical of podosomes rather than focal adhesions or focal contacts. The identification of the podosome regulatory protein Tks5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Seals1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Abram1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> as binding partner for &#x003b2;-dystroglycan and the demonstration that the two proteins were co-localised in podosome like structures but not in focal adhesions, further substantiates the identity of the adhesion structures in myoblasts as podosomes.</p><p>Activation of Src downstream of PDBu-mediated activation of PKC leads to the phosphorylation of DG on Y890. Y890 is within a potential SH3 domain interaction consensus PYVP, and as such could be involved in a direct interaction with Tks5 through the 3<sup>rd</sup> SH3 domain identified in the original proteomic screen. However as co-immunoprecipitation of Tks5 and &#x003b2;-DG revealed that &#x003b2;-DG was phosphorylated on Y890, it is likely that Tks5 interacts with a different SH3 interaction site in dystroglycan as tyrosine phosphorylation in this context would be likely to disrupt the SH3 domain interaction. Furthermore overexpression of dystroglycan was able to direct the localisation of Src away from the triton insoluble cytoskeletal fraction and into the CHAPS soluble membrane and cytoplasmic fraction. Thus we have demonstrated a binary complex between dystroglycan and the Tks5 SH3 domain <italic>in vitro</italic>, and by GST-affinity chromatography demonstrated that dystroglycan from cell extracts can also bind the Tks5 SH3 domain, but in the cellular context the dystroglycan recovered on these columns appears to be phosphorylated on Y890. If the association of dystroglycan and Tks5, whilst mediated at least in part by an SH3 interaction, is strengthened by phosphorylation on Y890, this would suggest the involvement of a third protein capable of interacting with Tks5 and the potential SH2 domain interaction site on dystroglycan generated by Y890 phosphorylation. Such a protein could be Src, as both Tks5 and dystroglycan are substrates for Src <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Seals1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Abram1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Sotgia1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> and Src can bind to dystroglycan via an SH2 mediated interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Sotgia1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The redistribution of Src from triton insoluble to CHAPS soluble fraction on dystroglycan overexpression, is also in agreement with a Src-dystroglycan interaction. The distribution of Src between triton-soluble and triton insoluble fractions is dependent on a number of factors, including the cell type, the adhesion status of the cell, extracellular matrix ligands, presence or absence of serum or other factors that stimulate signalling cascades. Whilst often found associated with the triton soluble fraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, growth of cells on different extracellular matrix substrates can dramatically alter this distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Kaplan2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. In fibronectin-stimulated NIH3T3 fibroblasts for example, active Src is almost exclusively recovered in the triton insoluble fraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Schlaepfer1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Finally, Tks5, Src and dystroglycan were recovered by immunoprecipitation apparently as a ternary complex. Based on this notion, one could postulate a potential mechanism for the roles of Tks5 and DG in podosome assembly. Under normal circumstances Tks5 and &#x003b2;-DG are not associated and not present in podosomes or other adhesion structures. Following activation of Src, DG is phosphorylated on Y890 creating an SH2 domain interaction site leading to the recruitment of active Src to DG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Sotgia1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The dystroglycan-Src complex then also binds to Tks5 leading to its phosphorylation and the participation of the whole complex in the podosome assembly process. In the presence of excess dystroglycan, for example when DG is over-expressed, DG can still be phosphorylated by Src, but the excess DG in the cell effectively titrates out the Src signal with respect to Tks5 levels, thus reducing Tks5 phosphorylation and inhibiting podosome formation. A 50&#x00025; reduction in dystroglycan has a moderate effect on podosome formation compared to overexpression, possibly because it allows some dystroglycan&#x02236;Src&#x02236;Tks5 complexes to form and these are sufficient to allow a limited number of podosomes to form. However too much dystroglycan is completely inhibitory due to the mislocalisation of Src likely reducing Tks5 phosphorylation removing a key stimulus to podosome formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Seals1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Tks5 has also recently been shown to be involved in other ternary complexes that facilitate podosome formation. In Src-transformed NIH3T3 (NIH-Src) cells, Tks5 was found to be associated with the adaptor protein Grb2, and N-WASP a regulator of actin polymerisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003638-Oikawa1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. In this system, Src expression drives the Grb2-Tks5 interaction which then associates with N-WASP via numerous SH3 mediated interactions targeting actin polymerisation to sites of podosome formation. This and our study would suggest that Tks5 is a multifunctional scaffold able to recruit other adaptors, signalling, regulatory and adhesion proteins such as dystroglycan to podosomes via its multiple SH3 domains.</p><p>Dystroglycan is therefore a new addition to the increasing number of podosome components, though rather than a spectator is appears to be a key player in the Src and Tks5-dependent regulation of podosome formation in myoblasts. Moreover the demonstration of podosome formation in myoblasts opens new avenues to dissect cell migration during early stages of development and in muscle repair, where myoblast cells and their precursors travel large distances to populate newly developing muscles or to mend damaged or diseased muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003638.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Localisation of dystroglycan and the indicated core podosome proteins in H2k myoblasts (A), C2C12 myoblasts (B) and A7r5 smooth muscle cells (C).
