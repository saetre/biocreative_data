This may be related to the gradients of stress and strain experienced in vivo across the ventricular wall. We tested the hypothesis that within the rat left ventricle there are transmural differences in the expression of genes for proteins that are involved in mechanosensitive pathways and in associated physiological responses. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to measure messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of selected targets in sub-epicardial (EPI) and sub-endocardial (ENDO) myocardium. Carbon fibres were attached to single myocytes to stretch them and to record contractility. We observed that the slow positive inotropic response to stretch was not different between EPI and ENDO myocytes and consistent with this, that the mRNA expression of two proteins implicated in the slow response, non-specific cationic mechanosensitive channels (TRPC-1) and Na/H exchanger, were not different. However, mRNA levels of other targets, e.g. the mechanosensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel TREK-1, Brain Natriuretic Peptide and Endothelin-1 receptor B, were significantly greater in ENDO than EPI. No targets had significantly greater mRNA levels in EPI than ENDO. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that the response of the ventricle to stretch will depend upon both the regional differences in stimuli and the relative expression of the mechanosensitive targets and that generally, stretch sensitivity is predicted to be greater in ENDO.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Stretch</kwd><kwd>Cardiac myocytes</kwd><kwd>Gene expression</kwd><kwd>TRP channels</kwd><kwd>Stretch-activated channel</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2007</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is known that mechanical stimulation of the myocardium (stress and strain) can lead to both acute and chronic changes in the electrical and mechanical activity of the heart and contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Targets (e.g. in the present study caveolin-3 and TRPC-1) whose mRNA expression are not regionally different might still be differentially regulated by transmural variation in the mechanical stimuli, whereas other permutations of increased/decreased mRNA expression and protein activity with increased/decreased stimuli are possible. Based upon our present observations and those from the literature reporting increased stretch sensitivity of various responses in ENDO, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], it seems that in general, ENDO tissue is likely to be more influenced by, and be responsive to, mechanical stimulation than EPI tissue.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by The British Heart Foundation and The Wellcome Trust</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Antzelevitch</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Modulation of transmural repolarization</article-title><source>Ann N Y Acad Sci</source><year>2005</year><volume>1047</volume><fpage>314</fpage><lpage>323</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1196/annals.1341.028</pub-id></citation><citation citation-type="display-unstructured">Antzelevitch C (2005) Modulation of transmural repolarization.
