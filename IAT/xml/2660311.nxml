STAT3 in the brain was activated after peripheral or central LPS administration, and in LPS-stimulated cultured primary glia. Inhibition of STAT3 expression, function, or activation reduced by ~80% IL-6 production by primary glia, demonstrating the dependence on active STAT3. GSK3 promotes STAT3 activation, and array analysis of inflammatory molecules produced by LPS-stimulated primary glia demonstrated that IL-6 was the cytokine most diminished (&#x0003e;90%) by GSK3 inhibition. Inhibition of GSK3, and knockdown of GSK3&#x003b2;, not GSK3&#x003b1;, greatly inhibited IL-6 production by LPS-stimulated primary glia. Conversely, expression of active STAT3 and active GSK3 promoted IL-6 production. In vivo inhibition of GSK3 reduced serum and brain IL-6 levels, brain STAT3 activation, and GFAP upregulation following LPS administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>STAT3 and GSK3 cooperatively promote neuroinflammation, providing novel targets for anti-inflammatory intervention.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The inflammatory system is hyperactivated during sepsis, a potentially lethal condition induced by bacterial infection that affects nearly 1 million people in the United States every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Inflammation is controlled by a balance of activating and inhibitory signals delivered intracellularly by transmembrane receptors that recognize components of invasive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sepsis ensues due to hyperactivation of the innate immune system that causes a massive production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that cause vascular leakage and septic shock, impairing the function of vital organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Encephalopathy is a common feature in sepsis, often occurring before failure of other organs such as kidney, liver and lung. Surviving individuals often suffer deleterious consequences of sepsis, such as cognitive deficits and other signs of long-term impairments in the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is considered one of the major markers of lethal sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], for example as demonstrated in studies using IL-6 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] but is not a target for treatment because in short-term mortality studies anti-IL-6 strategies were unsuccessful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, increased brain IL-6 has been associated with severe cognitive impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and likely contributes to the cognitive and neuroanatomical long-term consequences of sepsis, such as persistent behavioral deficits and neuronal loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These findings indicate that strategies to reduce IL-6 production may be particularly valuable for protecting the CNS from damage caused by sepsis.</p><p>Recently, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) was identified as a crucial regulator of innate inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. GSK3 is a constitutively active Ser/Thr kinase consisting of two isoforms, GSK3&#x003b1; and GSK3&#x003b2;. GSK3 was found to strongly promote Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes, and GSK3 inhibition rescued 60&#x02013;70% of mice from an otherwise lethal septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Subsequently, inhibition of GSK3 was shown to protect rodents from several peripheral inflammatory conditions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). Members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors have central roles in inflammatory reactions, and STAT3 was considered anti-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], mediating SOCS-3 or IL-10 signals, and endothelial STAT3 contributes to anti-inflammatory responses to LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although STAT3 is activated in numerous neuropathological conditions such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and has been implicated in reactive astrogliosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the inflammatory role of STAT3 in the brain is poorly understood. We report here that in contrast to its systemic role, STAT3 has proinflammatory properties in the context of septic shock-induced neuroinflammation. This occurs in cooperation with proinflammatory GSK3, which is known to participate to the activation of STAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], as inhibition of STAT3 or GSK3 greatly reduced IL-6 production by stimulated glia. These results identify STAT3 and GSK3 as potential targets to control brain IL-6 production and neuroinflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Protein-free <italic>E. coli </italic>(K235) LPS was prepared as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

The concentrations of 62 inflammatory proteins (listed in Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) were measured with inflammatory molecule antibody arrays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Raybiotech).</p></sec><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Male C57Bl/6 mice (8&#x02013;10 weeks) were housed in a light and temperature controlled room, Mice were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with <italic>E. col</italic>i K235 LPS (10 &#x003bc;g/g in 200 &#x003bc;L saline) followed by measurements of cytokines by ELISA in the serum and brain regions. In some mice, lithium was administered in pelleted food containing 0.2% lithium carbonate (Harlan-Teklad) for 3 weeks before LPS treatment, which resulted in serum lithium concentrations of 0.53 &#x000b1; 0.03 mM (n = 4). For central administration using ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg) anesthesia, LPS (10 &#x003bc;g/1 &#x003bc;L) was slowly infused stereotaxically into each lateral ventricle (icv; relative to bregma 0.4 mm posterior, &#x000b1; 1 mm lateral, 2.2 mm depth), mice were sacrificed 2, 4, or 8 hr after treatment, and tissue from the hippocampus adjacent to the ventricle (ventricular infusion zone) and from the distant occipital cortex was analyzed for cytokines by ELISA.

Cells were plated in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.3% glucose, 2 mM glutamine, 10 U/mL penicillin and 10 &#x003bc;g/mL streptomycin in poly-D-lysine-coated six-well plates. Twelve hours after plating, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and 0.5 mM glutamine (Invitrogen) to promote neuronal survival and to inhibit the growth of non-neuronal cells. Neurons were used for experiments after seven days in culture. Primary glia were prepared from the cerebral cortex of 1 day old C57Bl/6 mice as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.3% glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 U/mL penicillin and 10 &#x003bc;g/mL streptomycin. For separation of astrocytes and microglia, after 10 days of culture the cells were shaken (30 hr; 250 rpm), resulting in &#x0003e;99% pure astrocytes as determined by immunostaining with the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). After the first hour of shaking, the medium containing microglia cells was collected and microglia were cultured in the same medium as astrocytes. For expression experiments, cells were rinsed twice with DMEM/F12 medium without supplements, infected with 50 moi of the designated adenovirus for 30 min, supplemented medium was added for incubation for 36&#x02013;48 h, and infected cultures were examined for adequate infection efficiency (80%) as assessed by GFP fluorescence after infection with GFP adenovirus. For knockdown experiments, cells were transfected using liposome-mediated transfection reagent LipofectAMINE RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) with 50 nM siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions with STAT3 prevalidated siRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], silencer negative control (Ambion), or GSK3&#x003b1; and GSK3&#x003b2; siRNA (Smart pool; Dharmacon). For experimental treatments, cells were pretreated with the indicated inhibitors for 30 min followed by treatment with 100 ng/mL LPS, 1 ng/mL IFN&#x003b3;, or both, for the indicated times.

The lysates were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined in duplicate using the Bradford protein assay.

Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse, or goat anti-rabbit IgG, followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence, and the protein bands were quantitated with a densitometer. Cell viability was assessed by a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. A multi-well scanner was used to measure the absorbance at 570&#x02013;630 nm dual wavelengths.

IL-6 present in brain regions was likely partly produced in the brain because after icv administration of LPS, IL-6 accumulated both in the ventricular infusion zone and in the distant occipital cortex, indicating centrally-induced spreading inflammation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Central LPS infusion also moderately increased brain levels of TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3; in both brain regions but with a persistence in the ventricular infusion zone, while IL-1&#x003b2; and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels slightly increased at late time points in the ventricular infusion zone only (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;E</xref>). Administration of saline vehicle had more modest effects than LPS on the levels of cytokines in the brain. Thus, in response to sepsis, IL-6 robustly accumulates in the brain and is at least partly produced by the central inflammatory system, although some contribution from the periphery cannot be ruled out.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Levels of cytokines in plasma and the brain parenchyma in response to sepsis</bold>.

Among the 12 molecules detected to be induced by treatment with LPS plus IFN&#x003b3; in glia, the production of TIMP-1 and VCAM-1 were independent of GSK3, whereas active GSK3 decreased the expression of CXCL2/MIP-2 and increased the expression of CXCL1/KC, IL-12p40, CCL9/MIP-1&#x003b3;, CCL2/MCP-1, P-Selectin and CCL5/RANTES (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). However, most prominently, active GSK3 promoted IL-6 production by 16-fold, showing that IL-6 production by glia is strongly dependent on GSK3.

These included STAT3C, in which covalent bonds between cysteines establishes the active dimer conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and constitutively active S9A-GSK3&#x003b2; and S21A-GSK3&#x003b1;, where serines subject to inhibitory phosphorylation were mutated to alanines to prohibit inhibitory serine phosphorylation. Expression of active S21A-GSK3&#x003b1; and S9A-GSK3&#x003b2; together increased IL-6 production and this was increased a further 4.5-fold with co-expression of STAT3C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>). This demonstrates that GSK3 and STAT3 were both necessary, and together sufficient, to stimulate IL-6 production in glia cells.</p></sec><sec><title>GSK3 inhibition reduces IL-6 signaling in the brain</title><p>The capacity of GSK3 inhibitors to dampen IL-6 production in glia raised the possibility that GSK3 inhibitors may be beneficial for reducing neuroinflammation. To test this hypothesis, mice were treated with lithium because it is the only GSK3 inhibitor that is well-established to be effective in the CNS after peripheral administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In mice treated with lithium, the serum IL-6 level 18 hr after LPS administration was 67% lower than in mice not given lithium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This matches a previous report that the GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 greatly reduced serum IL-6 after LPS challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. IL-6 levels were elevated in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), but not hippocampus (not shown) 18 hr after LPS administration, and lithium pretreatment reduced these increases in IL-6. In mice pretreated with lithium, there was also a significant reduction in the activating tyrosine-phosphorylation of STAT3 following LPS administration in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of GSK3 with lithium also reduced the activation of astrocytes, as measured by the astrocyte marker GFAP immunoreactivity, following LPS treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Since STAT3 promotes GFAP expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], this indicates that lithium's inhibition of IL-6 production and STAT3 activation reduces expression of STAT3-dependent astrocyte-specific genes such as GFAP, resulting in reduction of astrogliosis induced by LPS.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>GSK3 inhibition attenuates IL-6 production and astrogliosis</bold>.

However, neuroinflammation that is severe or chronic can itself damage neurons due to excessive production of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules by astrocytes and microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, identification of mechanisms capable of controlling neuroinflammation provide avenues to interrupt the inflammatory process to prevent its deleterious consequences. Here, we identify novel cooperative actions of STAT3 and GSK3 that control IL-6 production by glia during sepsis-induced neuroinflammation. The production of IL-6 by glia was largely blocked by interventions inhibiting the activity of STAT3 or GSK3&#x003b2;, revealing the strong dependence of IL-6 production in glia on these signaling molecules.</p><p>Sepsis caused a large increase in IL-6 in the serum, some of which likely accounted for the increased brain levels of IL-6. However, IL-6 also is produced locally in the brain since its level increased after centrally administered LPS and it was produced by LPS-stimulated primary astrocytes and microglia in culture. IL-6 in the brain is apparently a dual-edged sword, having both beneficial effects but also deleterious effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], likely depending on the magnitude and duration of its stimulated production. IL-6 may have acute neuroprotective and regenerative effects on neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], which have been reported to depend on its ability to inhibit the synthesis of TNF, induce nerve growth factor, and promote neuronal differentiation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, chronic or high increases in IL-6 levels in the brain lead to neuronal and cognitive impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The actions of IL-6 are partly mediated by its effects on glia, but it also is not clear if the effects of IL-6 on astrocytes and microglia are beneficial or detrimental. IL-6 is considered an important inducer of astrogliosis, promoting reactive responses regulating the activation state of astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but chronic or excessive activation of glia is often associated with neuronal loss and may contribute to many widespread neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Our findings indicate that inhibition of STAT3 and GSK3 provide mechanisms to intervene to reduce IL-6 production. In glia, IL-6 production was highly dependent on the transcription factor STAT3, suggesting that by activating STAT3 IL-6 promoted its own production, as well as activating astrocytes as indicated by increases in the astrocyte reactive marker GFAP. This amplification loop was recently identified in B cells, as B cell-lymphoma with high expression of STAT3 exhibited elevated production of IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Our study expands this observation by showing this mechanism of a feed-forward loop is activated in the brain after sepsis. Thus, this may provide a target to specifically dampen the effects of IL-6 on glia after sepsis. GSK3 also was required for IL-6 production, as inhibitors of GSK3 greatly attenuated IL-6 production. Although other cytokines and chemokines also were regulated by GSK3 inhibitors, IL-6 displayed the greatest dependence on GSK3. These findings likely signify cooperative actions of STAT3 and GSK3 in promoting IL-6 production since STAT3 activation is dependent on GSK3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, GSK3 is capable of promoting IL-6 production by contributing to the activation of both STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The identification of GSK3 as a regulator of IL-6 production in the brain expands the already well-known role of GSK3 as an integrator of many signaling pathways involved in inflammatory signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and indicates that inhibition of GSK3 may provide a new therapeutic strategy to counteract the detrimental consequences of sepsis in the brain. Furthermore, in contrast to interventions targeting individual transcription factors, inhibiting GSK3 enables simultaneous regulation of multiple transcription factors involved in inflammatory signaling, a therapeutic potential strengthened by the rapidly growing armament of GSK3 inhibitors that includes lithium, a drug already used therapeutically in human patients. These agents may contribute to the regulation of inflammation, which continues to be a pressing problem because of the widespread association of excessive inflammation with many diseases, and particularly neuroinflammation, which contributes to a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EB carried out the experimental work and both authors contributed to the design, analysis of the data, and manuscript preparation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional File 1</title><p><bold>Table 1: Proteins measured with the cytokine antibody array</bold>.
