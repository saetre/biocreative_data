ABCA1 expression is tightly regulated and deficiency of this cholesterol transporter results in cholesterol accumulation within cells.

Absence of LRP1 expression results in increased PDGFR&#x003b2; signaling and sequential activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, which increases phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (cPLA<sub>2</sub>). Phosphorylated and activated cPLA<sub>2</sub> releases arachidonic acid from the phospholipid pool. Overproduction of arachidonic acid suppresses the activation of LXR/RXR heterodimers bound to the promoter of LXR regulated genes such as ABCA1, resulting in greatly reduced ABCA1 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and Significance</title><p>LRP1 regulates LXR-mediated gene transcription and participates in reverse cholesterol transport by controlling cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation and ABCA1 expression.

However, this cannot be explained entirely by increased lipid uptake from the circulation. First, LRP1 is a powerful lipoprotein uptake receptor, and loss of LRP1 expression thus should result in reduced, not increased cholesterol accumulation. On the other hand, we detected a minor compensatory increase in the level of LDLR expression (&#x0223c;1.7 fold), consistent with earlier observations in the LRP1-deficient liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006853-Rohlmann1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, which may contribute to the cholesterol elevation in LRP1 deficient aortas of LDLR-expressing mice.

These results suggested that in the absence of LRP1, although cells express normal amounts of LXRs and RXRs, the LXR/RXR heterodimers are bound to their co-repressors and are thus functionally repressed. This explains the greatly diminished basal expression of ABCA1 in the LRP1&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells. In the presence of the synthetic ligand, the LXR/RXR heterodimers are activated and readily induce ABCA1 transcription. The much lower baseline expression of ABCA1 in the LRP1-deficient SMCs further suggested, that an endogenous LXR antagonist may be responsible for this nearly complete transcriptional repression.</p><p>TLC analysis of total cellular lipid extracts from wild type and LRP1&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells showed that LRP1-deficient SMCs accumulate more free fatty acids compared to wild type cells.

The importance of arachidonic acid thus ensures that its levels are tightly controlled.
