Inhibitor titrations of <sc>L</sc>-lactate transport by MCT1 in rat erythrocytes were used to determine the <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> value and number of AR-C155858-binding sites (Et) on MCT1 and the turnover number of the transporter (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>). Derived values were 2.3&#x000b1;1.4&#x000a0;nM, 1.29&#x000b1;0.09 nmol per ml of packed cells and 12.2&#x000b1;1.1&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> respectively. When expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, MCT1 and MCT2 were potently inhibited by AR-C155858, whereas MCT4 was not. Inhibition of MCT1 was shown to be time-dependent, and the compound was also active when microinjected, suggesting that AR-C155858 probably enters the cell before binding to an intracellular site on MCT1. Measurement of the inhibitor sensitivity of several chimaeric transporters combining different domains of MCT1 and MCT4 revealed that the binding site for AR-C155858 is contained within the C-terminal half of MCT1, and involves TM (transmembrane) domains 7&#x02013;10. This is consistent with previous data identifying Phe<sup>360</sup> (in TM10) and Asp<sup>302</sup> plus Arg<sup>306</sup> (TM8) as key residues in substrate binding and translocation by MCT1. Measurement of the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values of the chimaeras for <sc>L</sc>-lactate and pyruvate demonstrate that both the C- and N-terminal halves of the molecule influence transport kinetics consistent with our proposed molecular model of MCT1 and its translocation mechanism that requires Lys<sup>38</sup> in TM1 in addition to Asp<sup>302</sup> and Arg<sup>306</sup> in TM8 [Wilson, Meredith, Bunnun, Sessions and Halestrap (2009) J.

Of these only MCT1, MCT2, MCT3 and MCT4 have been demonstrated to catalyse the bidirectional proton-linked transport of short-chain monocarboxylates such as <sc>L</sc>-lactate and pyruvate across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. MCT1 is expressed in most tissues and facilitates lactic acid uptake for oxidation in heart and red skeletal muscle, and for gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney of some species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. MCT1 is also used for lactic acid efflux by some cells that are exclusively glycolytic, such as erythrocytes, and by all cells under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. MCT2 is a higher-affinity transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] whose expression is more restricted and highly species-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In some species it is the dominant MCT isoform in the kidney and liver where it facilitates lactic acid uptake for gluconeogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is also expressed in neurons, especially at the post-synaptic density, and has been proposed to provide the uptake pathway for the oxidation of lactate produced by the more glycolytic astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. MCT3 expression is confined to the basal membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid plexus epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], but detailed information on its substrate and inhibitor specificity is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. MCT4 is a lower-affinity transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and is primarily expressed in highly glycolytic cells, such as white muscle fibres, where it is used to facilitate lactic acid efflux from the tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Most cells can up-regulate MCT4 expression under hypoxic conditions when glycolytic flux is enhanced and this is mediated through transcriptional control by HIF-1&#x003b1; (hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In view of the importance of plasma membrane lactic acid transport in metabolism, it would be desirable to have a specific inhibitor of each isoform that could probe their individual metabolic roles. A range of inhibitors of MCTs have been described, including the &#x003b1;-cyanocinnamate derivatives, stilbene disulfonates such as DIDS (di-isothiocyanostilbene disulfonate), phloretin, bioflavenoids such as quercetin and organomercurial reagents such as p-chlomercuribenzene sulfonate (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). However, none of these is specific for inhibition of MCTs and thus they cannot be used with confidence in metabolic studies. This reservation applies particularly to &#x003b1;-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate that some workers have used on the assumption that it is a specific MCT inhibitor (for example see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). However, this agent is at least two orders of magnitude more potent at inhibiting the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier than MCT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Previously, a new class of specific and extremely high-affinity inhibitors of MCT1 have been discovered by AstraZeneca [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These compounds were originally identified as potent inhibitors of T-lymphocyte proliferation that act as immunosuppressants and were subsequently shown to bind to MCT1 and MCT2, but not MCT4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Since T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation is accompanied by a large (up to 14-fold) stimulation of glycolysis, it would appear that inhibiting MCT1 and so preventing the efflux of the resulting lactic acid is responsible for the compounds' immunosuppressive activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we seek to characterize the mode of action of one of these potent MCT1 inhibitors, AR-C155858. We have studied the concentration dependency of AR-C155858 inhibition of lactate transport into rat erythrocytes mediated by endogenous MCT1, as well as its effects on the activity of MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4 expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes. We show that AR-C155858 inhibits MCT1 and MCT2 with similar potency, but is inactive against MCT4, and that inhibition is exerted by the drug binding to a site on MCT1 accessible from the cytosol. The use of MCT1/MCT4 chimaeric transporters reveals that this binding site is contained within TM (transmembrane) helices 7&#x02013;10 of MCT1. In rat erythrocytes a detailed analysis of the inhibition of lactate transport by AR-C155858 has enabled us to determine the turnover number (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) of MCT1 (12.2&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 6&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and the <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> value for AR-C155858 (2.3&#x000a0;nM).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p><italic>X. laevis</italic> toads were obtained from Xenopus Express and oocytes were harvested as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

Polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal 16 amino acids of rat MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4, and against a 17 amino acid sequence between TM7 and TM8 of MCT1 were raised in rabbits as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

Cells were pre-incubated for 1&#x000a0;h at room temperature in the presence or absence of the specified concentration of AR-C155858 (structure shown). Transport was measured by continuous monitoring of the extracellular pH, and calibration of pH changes in terms of proton uptake was achieved by addition of standardized NaOH (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M final) just before addition of 10&#x000a0;mM <sc>L</sc>-lactate to initiate transport. Initial rates of transport were calculated by first-order regression analysis of the time course of pH change. The data were then fitted by non-linear least squares inhibition to the equation for a tight-binding non-competitive inhibitor using inhibitor concentration and haematocrit as the two <italic>x</italic>-variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].

The two appropriate segments of MCT1 and MCT4 were produced with a region of overlapping sequence that was used to splice the two together to produce the desired chimaera. For the MCT1/4 and MCT4/1 chimaeras the switch occurs at the end of the loop between TMs 6 and 7 which contains the conserved sequence LDLS. For the MCT1/4TM11 and MCT4/1TM11 chimaera the switch occurs at the beginning of TM11 containing the conserved sequence FSSA. However, for the C-terminal chimaeras MCT1/4c and MCT4/1c, where the switch occurs at the beginning of the C-terminus, there is no conserved sequence and thus a region of complimentarity was manufactured using modified primers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A C-terminal truncation of MCT1 was produced using PCR to amplify the MCT1 sequence minus the C-terminus, and this was subsequently inserted into the oocyte expression vector pGHJ with the addition of a stop codon in the vector downstream of the MCT sequence. Sequences for all primers used are given in Supplementary Table S1 (at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/425/bj4250523add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/425/bj4250523add.htm</ext-link>) and were designed to be between 15 and 30 bases in length. Typically, for an MCT fragment, thermocycling was performed using the following parameters: 30&#x000a0;s at 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 30&#x000a0;s at 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and a 1.5&#x000a0;min extension at 72&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30 cycles. Subsequently, appropriate fragments of MCT1 and MCT4 with complimentary sequence in the cross-over region were combined using PCR with primers to the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTR (untranslated region) of MCT1 and MCT4. Here, thermocycling was performed using the following parameters: 30&#x000a0;s at 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 30&#x000a0;s at 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and a 1&#x000a0;min extension at 72&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10 cycles followed by 30&#x000a0;s at 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 30&#x000a0;s at 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and a 1&#x000a0;min extension at 72&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 25 cycles. The MCT chimaeras were subsequently ligated into the pGHJ oocyte expression vector. For the MCT1/4 and MCT4/1 C-terminal chimaeras, the C-terminal regions were brought into the correct reading frame by a single base deletion and addition respectively using site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange&#x000ae; kit (Stratagene) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

For most assays 20&#x000a0;ng of cRNA was injected, but for [<sup>14</sup>C] kinetic assays, injection quantity was adjusted to ensure that uptake was linear with time. Further details can be found in Supplementary Table S2 (at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/425/bj4250523add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/425/bj4250523add.htm</ext-link>). Controls received the equivalent volume (9.2 nl) of water. Oocytes were then cultured in OR3 medium for 72&#x000a0;h with fresh medium each day. Rates of <sc>L</sc>-lactate transport by wild-type or chimaeric MCTs were determined as described previously, either by following the change in intracellular pH using the ratiometric pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF [2&#x02032;-7&#x02032;-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] or by measuring uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C] substrate (<sc>L</sc>-lactate or pyruvate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. For measurement of AR-C155858 sensitivity, ten oocytes were placed in a six-well plate containing 5&#x000a0;ml of uptake buffer [75&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 2&#x000a0;mM KCl, 0.82&#x000a0;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 20&#x000a0;mM Mes (pH&#x000a0;6.0)] and allowed to pre-incubate for the required time (usually 45&#x000a0;min) with or without AR-C155858 as required. Five oocytes were removed and placed into 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of uptake buffer containing <sc>L</sc>-[<sup>14</sup>C]lactate (0.5&#x000a0;mM, 7.4 MBq/ml) with or without AR-C155858 at the required concentration. Incubation at room temperature was continued for the period over which uptake was linear with time; this varied with the construct employed, as detailed in Supplementary Table S2. The oocytes were then rapidly washed five times with ice-cold uptake buffer and, after the final wash, each egg was transferred into a scintillation vial and homogenized in 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 2% (w/v) SDS by vigorous vortex-mixing.

Using a pH electrode to determine the extracellular increase in pH that accompanies the proton-linked transport of 10&#x000a0;mM <sc>L</sc>-lactate into erythrocytes at 6&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C we have investigated the inhibition of MCT1 by AR-C155858. It was first established that inhibition by low (nanomolar) concentrations of AR-C155858 reached equilibrium within 30&#x02013;45&#x000a0;min incubation at room temperature (results not shown). Thus for detailed inhibitor titrations with increasing concentrations of AR-C155858 we used 60&#x000a0;min incubation of erythrocytes at both 3.5 and 7% haematocrit. After incubation with inhibitor at room temperature, cell suspensions were cooled to 6&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C before measurement of <sc>L</sc>-lactate transport and determination of initial rates. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> we show that the concentration-dependence of inhibition is almost linear up to 80% inhibition, as predicted for a very tight-binding inhibitor whose concentration is less than the concentration of the target protein (MCT1).

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> the rate of [<sup>14</sup>C]lactate uptake into MCT1-expressing oocytes was determined after incubation with 0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M AR-C155858 for 15, 30, 45 and 60&#x000a0;min. For each time point, mean data (&#x000b1;S.E.M) for ten separate oocytes are presented. The data show that, as with the erythrocytes, 45&#x000a0;min incubation with inhibitor was sufficient to give maximal inhibition. As might be predicted, with 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M AR-C155858 inhibition occurred much more quickly and was almost maximal at 5&#x000a0;min. This was confirmed by BCECF assay of transport as shown in the inset to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. From these data we chose to use a 45&#x000a0;min incubation time for comparing the relative potency of AR-C155858 as an inhibitor of MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> we show that the concentration-dependence of MCT1 follows a linear trend up to 30&#x000a0;nM (70% inhibition) and then curves off towards 100% inhibition at 100&#x000a0;nM. Again, this behaviour is that predicted for a very high-affinity inhibitor and thus consistent with the <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> for AR-C155858 of 2.3&#x000a0;nM determined using rat erythrocytes. By contrast, oocytes expressing MCT4 at levels supporting similar rates of lactate transport revealed no significant inhibition by 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M AR-C155858, and even at 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M AR-C155858 inhibition was only approx. 20%.

We first created chimaeras in which the N-terminal half and large intracellular loop were of MCT1 and the C-terminal half was from MCT4. This chimaera (MCT1/4) was expressed at the plasma membrane of oocytes and transported <sc>L</sc>-lactate, albeit at a greatly reduced rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). However, like MCT4, it was insensitive to inhibition by AR-C155858 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). We also made the reverse chimaera MCT4/1.

We first made chimaeras in which either the C-terminal tail of MCT1 was removed or swapped for that of MCT4 as shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>(A). Both the MCT1trnc and MCT1/4c were expressed at the plasma membrane of oocytes, although a significant amount of MCT1trnc remained intracellular. Nevertheless, this chimaera still transported lactate with rates similar to that seen with normal MCT1 and MCT4. Although we did not perform detailed inhibitor titrations we showed that both the MCT1/4c chimaera and MCT1trnc were strongly inhibited by 0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M AR-C155858, like MCT1 itself. These results imply that the binding site for AR-C155858 does not require the C-terminal tail of MCT1. In order to establish which of the C-terminal TM helices might be important for inhibitor binding we compared the C-terminal TM sequences of MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4 and found that it was within TM11 that MCT4 (inhibitor-insensitive) exhibited the greatest difference to MCT1 and MCT2 (inhibitor-sensitive). Thus we made chimaeras in which the switch between MCT1 and MCT4 was performed at the start of TM11. Unfortunately, as shown in the inset to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>(B), the MCT1/4TM11 chimaera was not expressed properly at the plasma membrane and no enhancement of <sc>L</sc>-lactate transport over water-injected eggs was detected. However, the MCT4/1TM11 chimaera was expressed at the plasma membrane and did transport <sc>L</sc>-lactate, albeit very slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Subtraction of the very low background rate of lactate transport by uninjected oocytes, which was inhibited by AR-C155858, revealed that the residual lactate transport activity mediated by MCT4/1TM11 was insensitive to inhibition by AR-C155858. This suggests that the binding site for AR-C155858 does not involve TMs 11 and 12 as we had initially reasoned and must therefore involve TMs 7&#x02013;10.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>The C-terminus of MCT1 is not involved in AR-C155858 sensitivity</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Shows a schematic of the MCT1/4 and MCT4/1 chimaeras used, with MCT1 sequence being shown in black and MCT4 sequence in grey.

This would bring the predicted turnover number for MCT1 in rat erythrocytes to approx. 85&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> which is similar to the value of 35&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> determined for the glucose transporter GLUT1 in rat erythrocytes at 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], but approx. 5-fold less than the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> determined for endogenous human GLUT1 in erythrocytes or when overexpressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>When expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, MCT1 also showed time-dependent inhibition by AR-C155858 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) with the extent of inhibition being linear with respect to AR-C155858 concentrations up to approx. 70% inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This is consistent with a very low (nanomolar) <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> value determined in erythrocytes. By extrapolation of the linear portion of the inhibitor titration we were able to estimate that the amount of MCT1 expressed at the plasma membrane was approx. 0.4&#x000a0;pmol per oocyte. From this value and the rate of lactate transport, the turnover number of MCT1 in oocytes at 22&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C was calculated to be 4&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. However, this value was determined at 0.5&#x000a0;mM <sc>L</sc>-lactate and thus cannot be compared directly with the value of 85&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> calculated for rat erythrocytes at 22&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with 10&#x000a0;mM <sc>L</sc>-lactate. The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for MCT1 in erythrocytes and oocytes is approx. 3.5&#x000a0;mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and thus from Michaelis&#x02013;Menten kinetics the rate of transport at 10&#x000a0;mM <sc>L</sc>-lactate would be predicted to be 6-fold higher than at 0.5&#x000a0;mM. This would increase the turnover number of MCT1 in oocytes to 24&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is approx. 30% of the value determined for MCT1 in erythrocytes. However, we have shown previously that the rate of <sc>L</sc>-lactate uptake by oocytes determined radioactively underestimates the true transport rate determined with BCECF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This is because of an unstirred layer effect that slows diffusion of <sc>L</sc>-[<sup>14</sup>C]lactate taken up into the body of the oocyte. Thus overall there is reasonable agreement between the values measured in erythrocytes and oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>AR-C155858 is a potent inhibitor of MCT1 and MCT2, but not MCT4</title><p>In agreement with competition-binding studies of MCTs expressed in yeast for related compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], we have shown that AR-C155858 inhibits both MCT1 and MCT2, but not MCT4 when expressed in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Although we were unable to determine an accurate <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> value for inhibition of MCT2 by AR-C155858, we can conclude from the shape of the inhibitor titration that the value must be significantly less than 10&#x000a0;nM. In previous studies of inhibitor binding to MCT1 and MCT2 expressed in yeast, <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of 4.9 and 100&#x000a0;nM respectively were determined (P. A. Rugman, A. P. Jackson and C. M. Murray, unpublished work). For MCT1 this represents a reasonable agreement with the <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> values for endogenous MCT1 in rat and human cells derived in the present study and previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, this is not the case for MCT2 where the yeast binding data suggest that the affinity of MCT2 for AR-C155858 is more than an order of magnitude less than for MCT1. One explanation for this difference may be the absence of either basigin or embigin when MCTs are expressed in yeast, and this might affect inhibitor binding. In this context it may be noted that inhibition of MCT1 and MCT2 by the organomercurial reagent p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate also depends on the associated ancillary protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our results would also imply that interpretation of metabolic studies in which AR-C122982 has been used to discriminate between MCT1- and MCT2-mediated lactate transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] may not be straightforward.</p></sec><sec><title>The binding site for AR-C155858 involves TMs 7&#x02013;10 of MCT1, and probably faces the cytosol</title><p>The use of MCT1/MCT4 chimaeric transporters reveals that the binding site for AR-C155858 is contained within the C-terminal half of the transporter. Thus MCT1/4, like MCT4, was insensitive to inhibition by AR-C155858, whereas MCT4/1 was inhibitor-sensitive, like MCT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The C-terminal tail of MCT1 appears to have no major effect on the sensitivity to inhibition by AR-C155858 since potent inhibition by AR-C155858 was still observed when it was either removed or replaced with the tail of MCT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). However, the chimaera containing TMs 1&#x02013;10 of MCT4 and TMs 11 and 12 plus the C-terminal tail of MCT1 was insensitive to AR-C155858 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). These results demonstrate that the binding site for AR-C155858 is contained, at least in part, within TMs 7&#x02013;10 of MCT1. The slow time-dependence of inhibition by AR-C155858 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) could be explained either by the inhibitor having to enter the cell before binding to an intracellular site on MCT1 or by internalization of MCT1 upon inhibitor binding. However, we showed that no MCT1 internalization occurred, even at full inhibition, and that the inhibitor worked well if microinjected into oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These results imply that the binding site for AR-C15585 probably faces the cytosol, where our molecular model of MCT1 predicts TMs 7 and 10 to form part of the inward facing substrate-binding pocket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This is also consistent with earlier observations that Phe<sup>360</sup> in TM10 is involved in substrate binding since its mutation to cysteine allows MCT1 to accommodate the larger monocarboxylate mevalonate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, we have previously shown that Asp<sup>302</sup> and Arg<sup>306</sup> in TM8 are critical residues in the translocation cycle. However, analysis of the kinetics of MCT1/4 and MCT4/1 chimaeras suggest that substrate binding may not be exclusively located within the C-terminal half of MCT1. Thus both the C- and N-terminal halves of the MCT influence the kinetics of transport (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This is entirely consistent with our recent molecular model of MCT1 which predicts that the substrate-binding pocket and translocation channel involve helices from both the C- and N-terminal domains with critical roles for Lys<sup>38</sup> in TM1, and Asp<sup>302</sup> plus Arg<sup>306</sup> in TM8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Online data</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" content-type="local-data" position="float" xlink:type="simple"><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bj4250523add.pdf" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>Matthew Ovens performed the oocyte studies, Andrew Davies the erythrocyte work and Marieangela Wilson provided molecular biological expertise especially for the creation of chimaeric transporters.
