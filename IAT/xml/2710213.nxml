During the onset of meiosis, homologues must recognize each other and then intimately align (pairing and synapsis). In most eukaryotes this is a prerequisite for genetic recombination and balanced segregation of half-bivalents at anaphase I. Many components of the meiotic recombination machinery are known, especially in yeast, as well as some of the structural components of the synaptonemal complex. However, little is known about how homologous chromosomes recognize each other and become competent to pair. Hexaploid wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>; 2<italic>n</italic> = 6<italic>x</italic> = 42; genome AABBDD) possesses three ancestral genomes or seven sets of six related chromosomes. For hexaploid wheat to be highly fertile, only true homologues may pair within each set of the six related chromosomes during meiosis. The major locus controlling this pairing behaviour is <italic>Ph1</italic>, which is a single dominant locus located on chromosome 5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C21">Riley and Chapman, 1958</xref>). Mutants carrying a deletion of the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus exhibit a degree of pairing of related (homoeologous) chromosomes and hence multivalent formation at metaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C26">Sears, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C24">Roberts <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). So what is the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus? Absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> activity in diploid relatives of wheat suggests that the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus arose on polyploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C7">Chapman and Riley, 1970</xref>). Studies have shown a lack of phenotypic variation, apart from dosage effects and the failure of ethylmethane sulfonate treatment to yield mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C27">Wall <italic>et al.</italic>, 1971</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Ph1</italic> is complex in structure. Recently a two-part strategy for the molecular characterization of <italic>Ph1</italic> was used to dissect the complex structure. The first part revealed the gene content of the wheat <italic>Ph1</italic> region using conservation of gene order between the highly repetitive, 16 000 Mb hexaploid wheat genome and the smaller genomes of rice and <italic>Brachypodium sylvaticum</italic>, thus providing markers with which to saturate the wheat region. The second part of the strategy used deletion lines to dissect the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus physically. By these approaches, the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus was localized to a 2&#x000b7;5 Mb region of wheat chromosome 5B containing a structure consisting of a segment of sub-telomeric heterochromatin that inserted into a cluster of <italic>cdc2</italic> (<italic>cdk</italic>)-related genes following polyploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C13">Griffiths <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Here, further characterization of the <italic>Ph1</italic> region is presented exploiting new deletions and expression analysis studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>The following hexaploid wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>; 2<italic>n</italic> = 6<italic>x</italic> = 42; genome AABBDD) lines were used: euploid Chinese Spring (CS), euploid Paragon, CS <italic>Ph1</italic> mutant line (<italic>ph1b</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C26">Sears, 1977</xref>) and CS nullisomic/tetrasomic lines N5AT5B, N5BT5D and N5DT5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C25">Sears, 1966</xref>).

This region had been characterized at the molecular level and found to contain approx. 36 genes including a <italic>cdk-like</italic> gene cluster containing a segment of sub-telomeric heterochromatin as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>. By exploiting the genomic information gained from the analysis of this region, a systematic screen of mutagenized wheat populations was undertaken to assess the efficiency of generating deletions localized within the 2&#x000b7;5 Mb region. Wheat seeds were treated with either 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 or 100 Gy of X-ray or 150, 200 or 250 Gy of &#x003b3;-irradiation. The mutagenized populations derived from the seed were then screened using a multiplex PCR-based assay with markers derived from the <italic>Ph1</italic> region. The multiplex PCR assay had been previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C13">Griffiths <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref>. No deletion mutants were identified from screening 500 individuals of <italic>M</italic><sub>2</sub> populations irradiated with 5&#x02013;150 Gy. However, two and three plants carrying a deletion in the <italic>Ph1</italic> region were identified after screening 500 and 900 individuals from the 200 and 250 Gy treatments, respectively. One of the five plants (&#x003b3;250-19) revealed a wild-type chromosome pairing phenotype and carried the smallest deletion of approx. 500 kb in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). It eliminated eight genes as being responsible for the <italic>Ph1</italic> phenotype (<italic>hyp5</italic>, <italic>ugg1</italic>, <italic>cmt1</italic>, <italic>hsp20-1</italic>, <italic>at1</italic>, <italic>plp1</italic>, <italic>wdb1</italic> and <italic>hyp6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Another mutant plant (&#x003b3;250-214) carried a deletion of approx. 1 Mb in size which overlapped with the &#x003b3;250-19 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). This deletion encompassed a further 11 genes in this region which flanked the sub-telomeric insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). However, it was not possible to score the pairing phenotype of this plant accurately because it did not survive. The other three remaining mutants carried larger deletions than those described above, ranging from 1 to &#x0003e;10 Mb. This work clearly demonstrated that wheat seeds treated with 200&#x02013;250 Gy of &#x003b3;-irradiation can yield a range of deletion sizes with relatively high frequency. The deletion analysis still defined the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus to the region containing the <italic>cdk-like</italic> (locus) cluster and the segment of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><fig id="MCM252F1" position="float"><label>F<sc>ig</sc>. 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the deletion mutants and annotated genes in the region containing the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus on chromosome 5B compared with the equivalent regions on chromosomes 5A and 5D.

Recently, more genomic sequences were obtained in this region. A more detailed analysis was therefore undertaken to assess the levels of transcription of the genes on 5B, 5D and 5A (three homoeologues) in the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, and any changes in the level of transcription of the genes located on the 5A and 5D genomes when the 5B chromosome region was deleted. The sequence analysis of the coding regions of the homoeologues enabled the design of conserved primers which could be used for all three homoeologues but which would yield PCR products carrying distinct SNPs for each homoeologue (see Materials and Methods). RT&#x02013;PCR was carried out on the cDNA using these conserved primers. PCR products were cloned and 24 clones were sequenced for each gene. The transcript products were then assigned to the correct homoeologue based on the SNPs within the sequence. The relative contributions made by the homoeologues were calculated as a percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). No expression was detected for genes <italic>clk1</italic>, <italic>pep1</italic>, <italic>storage protein-like G1</italic> (<italic>spG1</italic>), <italic>rlp1</italic>, <italic>rdr1</italic> and <italic>raf1</italic> from either wild-type wheat (CS) or the <italic>Ph1</italic> mutant (<italic>ph1b</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Analysis of the 2&#x000b7;5 Mb region revealed that the genes accounting for most of the transcription were located in the 5A chromosomal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). This explains why there was apparently no major effect on the total level of transcription when the 5B region was deleted. However, there was a region where the expression was derived mainly from the 5B genes, namely the region containing the <italic>cdk-like</italic> and the <italic>spG1</italic> clusters and <italic>hyp3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The <italic>Ph1</italic> phenotype is specific to 5B and the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus was therefore defined to this region containing specific expression from the 5B genes. In fact there was very little transcription from the genes on 5B flanking the <italic>Ph1</italic> region, with <italic>mic1</italic> being the only other gene which was transcribed to a significant level in the 2&#x000b7;5 Mb chromosomal region. Of the genes transcribed from 5B within the <italic>Ph1</italic> region, <italic>hyp3</italic> was not found in the equivalent region of the related grass <italic>Triticum timopheevi</italic> which has <italic>Ph1</italic> activity, and <italic>hyp1</italic> and <italic>hyp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C13">Griffiths <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) are now known to encode storage-like proteins in wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C16">Kawaura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Interestingly, when the 5B region was deleted, the loss of transcription of these genes was compensated by the homoeologues on the remaining genomes (5A and 5D) so that there was no apparent difference in the overall level of transcription in the presence or absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F3">3</xref>). In some cases, the compensation was provided by homoeologous genes lying on other chromosomes such as observed for transcription in both spike and seeds for <italic>hyp3</italic> and in leaf for <italic>Slp1</italic> genes. Thus, only the <italic>cdk-like</italic> gene cluster remained for more detailed analysis with respect to the <italic>Ph1</italic> function.</p><fig id="MCM252F2" position="float"><label>F<sc>ig</sc>. 2.</label><caption><p>Expression pattern of genes within the 2&#x000b7;5 Mb region covering the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus on 5B and equivalent regions on 5A and 5D.

DNA was prepared from &#x0003e;60 BACs identified. Southern blot analyses were carried out, with blots being probed with the conserved regions of the <italic>cdk-like</italic> and the <italic>storage protein-like</italic> genes. Primers were designed in the most conserved domains of all known <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes already identified in the <italic>Ph1</italic> region and corresponding regions in 5A and 5D. These primers were used to amplify DNA from euploid wheat, <italic>ph1b</italic>, CS nullisomic/tetrasomic lines N5AT5B, N5BT5D and N5DT5A, and all the BACs identified as containing <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes. The PCR products were then cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that the <italic>cdk</italic> loci on 5B and 5A were more complex than initially thought. There were higher numbers of both <italic>cdk-like</italic> and <italic>storage protein-like</italic> genes within this region. BAC and genomic analyses showed that seven, five and two <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes were present in the corresponding regions of 5B, 5A and 5D chromosomes, respectively (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F4">4</xref>). The number of <italic>storage protein-like</italic> genes was also more than initially predicted, and at least four genes on each chromosome were identified (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F4">4</xref>). The main finding was that there had been gene duplication of both <italic>cdk-like</italic> and <italic>storage protein-like</italic> genes (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F4">4</xref>). This made BAC analysis more complex because of similar size fragments containing <italic>cdk-like</italic> or <italic>storage protein-like</italic> genes, requiring them to be distinguished by sequencing.

Within the 5B and 5A <italic>cdk-like</italic> loci, there were also fragments of <italic>storage-like protein</italic> genes present. The sequence analysis of the three <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes (<italic>A3</italic>, <italic>A4</italic> and <italic>A5</italic>) within 5A BAC 1898B19 revealed that in contrast to the flanking regions, the sequence of the three <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes differed every time these <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes were sequenced either from sub-clones, PCR products or the BAC itself (data not shown). Therefore, although these 5A <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes apparently carry frameshifts and stop codons, these may reflect sequencing errors. Moreover, the translation of the sequence of the <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes on 5A suggests that they differ at the protein level in comparison with other <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes in 5B and 5D loci.

The use of conserved primers provided the opportunity to semi-quantitate the contribution each gene in the cluster made to the total level of transcription, by sequencing RT&#x02013;PCR products and then assigning the product to a particular gene based on SNP detection. Different sets of conserved primers were designed and tested on cDNA derived from spike RNA of euploid and <italic>Ph1</italic> mutants as well as from genomic DNA of these plants. The PCR products (200 bp) were then cloned and a minimum of 300 clones sequenced. Results were inconclusive in terms of quantification because, in addition to the known <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes on 5B and 5D chromosomes, there were other unknown variants being generated in both euploid and <italic>Ph1</italic> mutant samples. Within the euploid sample, 56 % of the clones were derived from 5B <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes, 24 % from 5D <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes and 20 % were unknown <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes, while within the <italic>Ph1</italic> mutant sample, 68 % were unknown <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes and 36 % derived from 5D <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes. These unknown <italic>cdk-like</italic> variants were mostly absent in the PCR products generated by the conserved primers of DNA derived from the nullisomic/tetrasomic line N5AT5B. This suggests that the <italic>cdk-like</italic> unknown variants are being derived from the 5A <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes (unpublished). As described previously, the BAC sequence analysis indicated that variants were being generated from products derived from three <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes (<italic>A3</italic>, <italic>A4</italic> and <italic>A5</italic>). Despite this issue, the expression analysis did indicate that <italic>cdk-like B2</italic>, <italic>B3</italic> and <italic>B7</italic> were being transcribed from the 5B region. To overcome these problems, specific primers were designed from the sequence of the <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes on chromosomes 5B (<italic>cdk-like B4</italic>, <italic>B6</italic> and <italic>B7</italic>), 5A (<italic>cdk-like A2</italic> and <italic>A4</italic>) and 5D (<italic>cdk-like D1</italic> and <italic>D2</italic>). The expected PCR products were between 250 and 500 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F8">Fig.&#x000a0;8</xref>). The specific primers were first tested on genomic DNA extracted from the nullisomic/tetrasomic lines N5AT5B, N5BT5D and N5DT5A. All primers were found to be specific at the chromosome level. Primers were then used to study the expression of these genes using RT&#x02013;PCR on spike tissues from both the CS and <italic>Ph1</italic> mutant plants. The PCR products were cloned and 24 clones were sequenced to confirm that the products were in fact derived from the <italic>cdk-like</italic> gene for which the specific primers were designed. The <italic>cdk-like A5</italic> was found to be expressed in both CS and the <italic>Ph1</italic> mutant, whereas <italic>cdk-like D2</italic> was only expressed in the <italic>Ph1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F8">Fig.&#x000a0;8</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>cdk-like B6</italic> and <italic>cdk-like B7</italic> (the CACTA insertion and pseudo-gene, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F6">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>) were expressed in CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F8">Fig.&#x000a0;8</xref>). Thus, five <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes were expressed from the 5B locus, namely <italic>cdk-like B2</italic>, <italic>B3</italic>, <italic>B4</italic>, <italic>B6</italic> and <italic>B7</italic>, and one gene from the 5A locus, namely <italic>A5</italic>, while <italic>cdk-like D2</italic> and <italic>cdk-like A</italic> variants were mainly expressed in the absence of the 5B region. Thus, as in the case of the <italic>storage protein-like</italic> gene (<italic>spG1</italic>) and <italic>mic1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MCM252F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>), the transcription from the homoeologues on the other genomes is being suppressed by the presence of the 5B copies.

Here the identification of mutants carrying further deletions encompassing the 2&#x000b7;5 Mb <italic>Ph1</italic> region has been described. In particular, it has been shown that it is possible to generate deletions of 500 kb upwards in hexaploid wheat with reasonable frequency after &#x003b3;-irradiation. The ability to generate deletions with such a high frequency enables a complex locus such as <italic>Ph1</italic> to be defined. This approach could make it easier to fine map physically those genes controlling agronomic traits lying in regions of reduced recombination. The characterization of the new deletions covering the 2&#x000b7;5 Mb region presented here is consistent with the original proposal that defined the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus to a region containing a <italic>cdk-like</italic> gene cluster. The original analysis indicated that this region of 5B contained a segment of sub-telomeric heterochromatin inserted within this <italic>cdk-like</italic> cluster, making it distinct from the corresponding <italic>cdk-like</italic> gene clusters on 5A and 5D. The more detailed BAC library analysis in the present study, covering the <italic>cdk</italic> loci on 5B, 5A and 5D, reveals not only that the region is distinct in possessing a segment of heterochromatin, but also that the <italic>cdk-like</italic> cluster on 5B is itself unique compared with the equivalent clusters on 5A and 5D. There are in fact seven <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes on 5B compared with at least five on 5A and two on 5D. The sequence analysis data suggest that these structures arose through tandem duplication events. The <italic>Ph1</italic> phenotype is specific to chromosome 5B. The expression profiling reveals that the region defined as containing the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus also contains the only cluster of genes expressed specifically from 5B in the whole region analysed. The genes in the flanking regions are mostly transcribed from genes located on 5A. Five of the <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes are transcribed, including unusually the two pseudogenes <italic>cdk-like B6</italic> and <italic>cdk-like B7.</italic> None of the other pseudogenes identified are expressed. It is possible that the transcription of these two pseudogenes may therefore be connected to the presence of the sub-telomeric heterochromatin segment which inserted between them. The transcripts generated from these two pseudogenes could be non-coding and may be involved with the functional <italic>cdk-like</italic> transcripts in a small RNA-based interference mechanism. Hexaploid wheat may possess a mechanism for regulating and sensing the total level of transcripts in the cell which can be derived from the homoeologues. In cases where most of the transcription is derived from the genes located on 5B (<italic>cdk-like</italic> genes, <italic>storage protein-like</italic> gene clusters and <italic>mic1</italic>), the deletion of these genes does not necessarily affect the total level of transcription as the genes located on 5A or 5D can compensate for the loss of transcription from the 5B copies. However, the expression studies do indicate that the <italic>cdk</italic> locus on 5B is dominant in terms of transcription control over corresponding <italic>cdk</italic> loci on 5A and 5D. The increase in expression from the 5A or 5D <italic>cdk-like</italic> loci may explain the <italic>Ph1</italic> effects observed on chromosome synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C14">Holm, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C15">1988</xref>). During early meiosis, chromosomes can engage in multiple associations during synapsis. Later in meiosis, these associations are resolved in the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, while many associations are still maintained in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>. Disruption of chromosome pairing usually causes a lengthening in the time taken to complete meiotic prophase I. Yet despite the disruption to chromosome pairing, meiotic prophase I is not longer in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> than in its presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C6">Bennett <italic>et al.</italic>, 1974</xref>). This implies that in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, something is induced which over-rides the checkpoint mechanism and speeds up the completion of meiotic prophase I. The induction of expression of the 5A <italic>cdk-like</italic> genes may be responsible for this phenotype and the consequential inability to resolve incorrect associations within the timeframe available. Equally, it has been observed that increasing the dosage of the 5B <italic>Ph1</italic> locus results in disruption of chromosome pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C12">Feldman, 1966</xref>). Increasing the dosage of the 5B <italic>cdk-like</italic> locus may result in oversuppression of the <italic>cdk-like</italic> loci on 5A and 5D, resulting in aberrant chromosome pairing.</p><p>Finally, detailed bioinformatics has revealed that the kinase <italic>Cdk2</italic> from humans shows the closest homology to the genes within the wheat <italic>cdk</italic> locus. Interestingly, this kinase is required for meiosis and has a number of phosphorylation targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C18">Marston and Amon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C8">Cohen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). It co-localizes with mismatch repair proteins to recombination nodules and to the telomere regions during early meiosis (Ashley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000). Disruption of <italic>Cdk2</italic> expression in mouse has also been shown to result in increased &#x02018;non-homologous&#x02019; synapsis of chromosomes at meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C8">Cohen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). An increased presence of multiple associations of chromosomes is also observed at synapsis in the <italic>Ph1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C15">Holm, 1988</xref>). <italic>Cdk2</italic> has been proposed to be involved in licensing origins of replication through histone phosphorylation and chromatin remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C1">Alexandrow and Hamlin, 2005</xref>). The control of such biological processes during pre-meiotic replication and at the start of meiosis would also be entirely consistent with some of the cell biology and cytogenetic observations associated with <italic>Ph1</italic>, namely the initiation and co-ordination of chromatin remodelling during the onset of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C4">Aragon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C5">Maestra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C22">Prieto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C23">2005</xref>). In hexaploid wheat, prior to meiosis, the centromeres pair and then form seven clusters corresponding to the seven sets of related chromosomes. At the onset of meiosis, the telomeres cluster to form a telomere bouquet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C19">Martinez-Perez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Within this telomere bouquet, the telomere regions recognize each other and initiate intimate alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C22">Prieto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). This alignment then propagates along the homologous chromosomes from the telomere regions. At the onset of meiosis, the chromatin of chromosomes is remodelled to enable the homologues to pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C22">Prieto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). <italic>Ph1</italic> is involved in the initiation of this remodelling, and in co-ordinating the remodelling of chromatin on both homologues so that they are in the same conformation at the onset of pairing. In the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, the chromatin remodelling can be initiated asynchronously and prematurely so that homologues are in different conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C22">Prieto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Thus, a homologue would be just as likely to align intimately with a related chromosome as with its true homologue. The <italic>Ph1</italic> locus in wheat is also able to block recombination from occurring between similar but distinct chromosome segments located within otherwise identical chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C10">Dubcovsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MCM252C17">Luo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). If chromatin remodelling is required for chromosome pairing and recombination, then the lack of recombination between these regions in the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic> may simply reflect a failure to remodel the regions at the onset of meiosis. Thus, a <italic>cdk-like</italic> gene complex related to <italic>Cdk2</italic> which partially suppresses the activity of corresponding loci on 5A and 5D could explain the multitude of different effects attributed to <italic>Ph1</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) of the UK.
