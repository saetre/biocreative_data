Using fine-scale genetic mapping of the region, it has been possible to narrow the causative locus to a haplotype of eight strongly linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning a region of 7.5 kilobases (kb) in the second intron of the <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene. Here we describe a functional analysis to define the causative SNP, and we propose a model for a disease mechanism. Using gene expression microarray data, we observed a trend of increased <italic>FGFR2</italic> expression in the rare homozygotes. This trend was confirmed using real-time (RT) PCR, with the difference between the rare and the common homozygotes yielding a Wilcox <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.028. To elucidate which SNPs might be responsible for this difference, we examined protein&#x02013;DNA interactions for the eight most strongly disease-associated SNPs in different breast cell lines. We identify two <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory SNPs that alter binding affinity for transcription factors Oct-1/Runx2 and C/EBP&#x003b2;, and we demonstrate that both sites are occupied in vivo. In transient transfection experiments, the two SNPs can synergize giving rise to increased <italic>FGFR2</italic> expression. We propose a model in which the Oct-1/Runx2 and C/EBP&#x003b2; binding sites in the disease-associated allele are able to lead to an increase in <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene expression, thereby increasing the propensity for tumour formation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Recently, a number of whole-genome association studies have identified genes that predispose individuals to common diseases such as cancer. The challenge now is to understand how the identified risk loci contribute to disease, since the majority of these loci are located within introns (which are discarded after transcription) and intergenic regions, and therefore do not change the coding region of nearby genes. This manuscript describes how two single&#x02013;base pair changes in intron 2 of the <italic>FGFR2</italic> (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) gene, &#x0201c;the top hit&#x0201d; of the breast cancer susceptibility study, exert their function. We find that the changes alter the binding of two transcription factors and cause an increase in <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene expression, thus providing a molecular explanation for the risk phenotype. This is the first functional study, to our knowledge, of the risk loci identified for breast cancer in a whole-genome scan and demonstrates that these studies can be used as valid starting points for studying the underlying biology of cancer.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Recent whole-genome scans have identified novel risk genes for many common diseases, challenging researchers to determine how these genes contribute to disease.

Analysed tumours were all diploid for this region based on array-comparative genome hybridization data &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060108-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. This correlation was independent of either ER expression or p53 mutation status of the cells. Quantitative TaqMan PCR analysis confirmed a significant increase in <italic>FGFR2</italic> expression in rare homozygotes, as compared to common homozygotes (Wilcox <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.028) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We also examined expression of the FGFR2 ligands FGF-7, FGF-10, and FGF-22, which are usually produced by the surrounding stroma, in 45 normal breast samples as well as the microarray data on tumours, but we found no correlation with genotype. Furthermore, <italic>FGFR2</italic> displays a very complex splicing pattern with the most commonly expressed variants of the N terminus of the gene either including exons 1, 2, and 3 or including exons 1 and 2, but lacking exon 3. Again, no correlation was observed between genotype and the presence or absence of exon 3. Thus, the risk genotype correlates with <italic>FGFR2</italic> expression itself, rather than affecting its function through receptor-ligand interactions.</p><fig id="pbio-0060108-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Diagram of the <italic>FGFR2</italic> Gene</title><p>Genetic linkage is taken from HapMap, and the positions of the eight candidate SNPs (red lines) within intron 2 are indicated.

Interactions between proteins from nuclear extracts and DNA were examined for the eight most strongly disease-associated alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Two of these candidate functional SNPs showed distinct binding patterns in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). The common allele of rs7895676 (FGFR2&#x02013;33) formed strong protein&#x02013;DNA complexes with nuclear extracts from the breast carcinoma cell lines HCC1954 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) and PMC42 and from HeLa cells (unpublished data), whereas no binding was detected on the minor allele. Competition studies and supershift experiments identify the bound protein as C/EBP&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). We note that the FGFR2&#x02013;33 sequence has considerable homology to the C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site from the interleukin 6 (IL-6) promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060108-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). The heterogeneity of the observed protein&#x02013;DNA complexes is most likely due to the presence of multiple C/EBP&#x003b2; isoforms. For rs2981578 (FGFR2&#x02013;13), both alleles give rise to a strong protein&#x02013;DNA complex in HCC1954 cell extracts. However, a second more slowly migrating complex was only seen on the rarer genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Interestingly, both alleles are able to compete for both bands, suggesting that the formation of the upper complex depends on the presence of the lower complex. Inspection of the <italic>FGFR2</italic> DNA indicated the presence of a perfect octamer binding site immediately adjacent to the SNP, while the SNP itself lay within a sequence with homology to Runx binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Competition studies and incubation with specific antisera shows that both alleles bind Oct-1, while only the minor allele binds Oct-1 and Runx2 in HCC1954 nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), as well as in PMC42 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060108-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-0060108-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Protein&#x02013;DNA Interactions at FGFR2&#x02013;33 and FGFR2&#x02013;13 In Vitro and In Vivo</title><p>EMSAs on (A) FGFR2&#x02013;33 and (B) FGFR-13 minor (m) and common (c) alleles, using 5 &#x003bc;g (FGFR2&#x02013;33) and 2 &#x003bc;g (FGFR2&#x02013;13) of HCC1954 nuclear extracts.

In addition, we confirmed that these cell lines were diploid for the <italic>FGFR2</italic> locus and only expressed the epithelial-specific isoform FGFR2IIIb &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060108-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. The ChIP analysis was carried out on homozygous cell lines, because the SNP overlapping the C/EBP&#x003b2; site lies in a repetitive region for which the different alleles could not be distinguished reliably by TaqMan PCR. A representative experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g003">Figure 3</xref>D. After Runx2-precipitation, the FGFR2&#x02013;13 site is enriched 2-fold for the minor versus the common allele, confirming the EMSA results. Western blotting indicated that Runx2 is more abundant in T47D cells, thus confirming that differential ChIP in the two cell lines is due to the presence of the SNP. Oct-1 precipitation did not yield enrichment of FGFR2&#x02013;13 for either allele. The Oct-1 epitope may either be sequestered within a higher-order complex or the antisera used do not work efficiently in a ChIP assay. On the FGFR2&#x02013;33 site, we observed a 1.7-fold enrichment of C/EBP&#x003b2; binding on the common allele. In addition, we observe that C/EBP&#x003b2; can also bind to the minor allele, although less efficiently. Both cell lines contain comparable amounts of C/EBP&#x003b2; as judged by Western blotting (unpublished data). In conclusion, both the C/EBP&#x003b2; and the Runx2 binding sites are occupied in vivo.</p><p>To test whether differential protein binding could alter the ability of the susceptibility alleles to activate transcription, we multimerised oligonucleotides overlapping both the Oct-1/Runx2 and the C/EBP&#x003b2; binding sites, cloned these in both orientations upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL3Enh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), and assayed them in three breast cancer cell lines (PMC42, HCC70, and T47D). Transfections were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least twice for each cell line. A representative transfection into HCC70 cells is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g004">Figure 4</xref>B (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060108-sg002">Figure S2</xref> for PMC42 and T47D). In all three cell lines tested, the minor allele at the Oct-1/Runx2 site stimulated transcription 2- to 5-fold over the common allele, independent of orientation, with the average being just above a 3-fold increase (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). In contrast, the minor and common alleles of the multimerised C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site did not show a consistent pattern of activation relative to each other. It varied with the cell lines and the orientation in which constructs were tested. Nevertheless, relative to the parental vector, the common allele always showed transcriptional activation. Compared to the common allele, the minor allele was either not significantly different or gave rise to a smaller degree of activation. However, in the latter case, the rare allele still activated transcription significantly above the enhancer-only construct (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Presumably this reflects the fact that the minor allele of FGFR2&#x02013;33 still binds C/EBP&#x003b2; above background levels in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). By comparing the two different sites, we found that for Oct-1/Runx2 the minor allele was more active, while for C/EBP&#x003b2;, the common site yielded higher levels of transcription in the majority of experiments. Hence their effects were opposing. We therefore assayed a synthetic construct consisting of single sites for C/EBP&#x003b2;, Oct-1, and Runx2. In this arrangement, the effect of Oct-1/Runx2 clearly predominates, with the minor allele expressed at higher levels, reflecting the situation at the endogenous locus.</p><fig id="pbio-0060108-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Transcriptional Activation by the Minor and Common Alleles of Oct-1/Runx2 and C/EBP&#x003b2; Binding Sites of FGFR2</title><p>(A) Diagram of the concatemerised binding sites cloned into pGL3Enh.</p><p>(B) Luciferase assays in HCC70 cells.

Although Runx2 is a master regulator of osteoclast-specific transcription, Runx2 also plays an important role in mouse mammary gland&#x02013;specific gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060108-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, where Runx2 activity is dependent on Oct-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060108-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. It is intriguing to note that in bone cells, overexpression of constitutively active <italic>FGFR2</italic> leads to increased levels of Runx2 mRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060108-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>FGFR2</italic> in turn is responsive to Runx2 in osteoclasts via the OSE2 (osteoclast specific element 2) in its promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060108-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. The description here of a Runx2 site in the <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene that is occupied in breast cancer cells, suggests that in the presence of the minor genotype, a similar positive feedback loop could also be established in breast cells. The role of the C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site on <italic>FGFR2</italic> expression has been harder to define. The common allele binds C/EBP&#x003b2; more tightly and activates transcription more strongly in most cases. Yet in a composite construct the activity of the Oct-1/Runx2 site dominates. This may be because C/EBP&#x003b2; can directly bind to and synergize with Runx2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060108-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, on the minor genotype, Oct-1 and Runx2 are present and able to synergize with the C/EBP&#x003b2; bound (as suggested from the ChIP experiments), giving rise to higher levels of transcriptional activation. This is supported by the finding that a single copy of the C/EBP&#x003b2;/Oct-1/Runx2 site gives rise to higher levels of activation than a concatemerized Oct-1/Runx2 site with six potential interaction sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060108-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). A potential role for C/EBP&#x003b2; in tumour etiology is supported by the observation that C/EBP&#x003b2; is highly overexpressed in malignant human breast cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060108-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. In conclusion, our evidence supports Oct-1/Runx2 as the probable primary determinant of activity, with C/EBP&#x003b2; contributing to the risk haplotype.</p><p>The increased risk in breast cancer conferred by the <italic>FGFR2</italic> allele is predominant for ER<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> breast tumours, while there is no significant increase in risk for ER<sup>&#x02013;</sup> tumours.

The risk conferred by the disease-associated genotype may also depend on the signalling potential of <italic>FGFR2</italic> in ER<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. FGF-7 is over-expressed only in breast tumours that are ER<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060108-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Elevated levels of FGFR2 may then contribute to the establishment of an autocrine signalling loop, reducing the cell's propensity to undergo apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060108-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, paracrine signalling by mesenchymally or luminally derived FGF-7 or -10 on cells overexpressing FGFR2 may also drive cell proliferation.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first functional study on the risk loci recently identified for breast cancer. Our study demonstrates that SNPs identified by whole-genome scans can be used a valid starting points for studying the underlying biology of cancer. SNPs identified in other whole-genome scans for the genetic basis of complex diseases also primarily map in intronic or intergenic regions. Our observation that an identified SNP regulates the expression of the risk allele is therefore likely to be a common theme. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the developed world. The <italic>FGFR2</italic> minor allele carries only a small increase in risk and acts as part of a spectrum of risk factors. However, it has a high minor allele frequency (0.4), and <italic>FGFR2</italic> is therefore likely to contribute to the incidence of breast cancer in many individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genotyping.</title><p>DNA from the 170 tumour samples was genotyped using a fluorescent 5&#x02032; exonuclease assay (TaqMan) and the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection Sequence (PE Biosystems) in 384-well format.
