Later, it was recognized that Dr1 dimerizes with the cofactor DRAP1 (Dr1-associated protein 1, also known as NC2&#x003b1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Human Dr1/DRAP1 can repress pol II transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> from a range of promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). Dr1 and DRAP1 are also found in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, where they are required for viability and seem to function in a similar manner to the mammalian proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>). Indeed, the human Dr1 and DRAP1 genes can substitute for their yeast equivalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Dr1 can exclude TFIIA and TFIIB from DNA-bound TBP, suggesting a model in which it binds TBP at the promoter and disrupts formation of a functional pre-initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In support of this, a crystal structure revealed the Dr1/DRAP1 heterodimer as a molecular clamp gripping the upper and lower surfaces of the TBP/DNA complex and thereby blocking binding by TFIIB and TFIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The heterodimer can also mobilize TBP along DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and interact with the largest subunit of elongating pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Despite targeting the general transcription machinery, only a subset of mRNAs responds to Dr1/DRAP1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, only 17% of pol II-transcribed genes show changes in expression when DRAP1 is inactivated in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Furthermore, many mRNAs are induced by Dr1/DRAP1, in contrast to original expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">15&#x02013;20</xref>).</p><p>The fact that TBP is required for transcription by pols I and III raised the possibility that these systems might respond to Dr1/DRAP1. Indeed, purified or recombinant human Dr1 was found to repress transcription of VA and tRNA genes <italic>in vitro</italic> by pol III, although transcription by pol I from an rRNA gene promoter did not respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The same pattern was observed when Dr1 was overproduced in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, with tRNA expression by pol III repressed, but rRNA expression by pol I unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). A mechanistic explanation for pol III control was suggested by binding assays with recombinant proteins, which showed that excess Dr1 can disrupt the interaction of TBP with Brf1, a polypeptide that recruits pol III to its templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). This is consistent with Brf1 bearing strong homology to TFIIB in its TBP-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, the evidence for Dr1 as a regulator of pol III transcription was obtained when it was present at elevated levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In contrast, ChIP experiments revealed minimal crosslinking of endogenous Dr1 or DRAP1 to tRNA genes in growing wild-type yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), raising doubts concerning the physiological relevance of the overexpression data. Here, we have addressed this issue by RNAi and ChIP approaches in human cells. We show that endogenous Dr1 and DRAP1 associate with pol III-transcribed genes when present at natural levels in growing HeLa cells and that tRNA synthesis is suppressed by Dr1 in this situation. Our data provide clear evidence that the physiological functions of human Dr1 include tRNA gene regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>HeLa and HEK293T cells were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 U/ml).

We adopted an RNAi approach to test if endogenous human Dr1 influences expression of pol III transcripts <italic>in vivo</italic>. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA targeting the first exon of Dr1 or a non-targeting control siRNA and harvested 48 h later. Western immunoblotting revealed that Dr1 protein levels were reduced by about 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B), while the corresponding mRNA, as revealed by RT&#x02013;PCR, was reduced by about 60% compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D). Such treatment resulted in significant upregulation of each tRNA examined. This was the case for mature <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkp1102i2.jpg"/></inline-formula>, as well as short-lived primary transcripts that reflect ongoing transcription (pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and pre-tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>). Alu RNA expression also increased, but 5S rRNA, U6 snRNA and 7SL RNA levels showed no significant response to the Dr1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D). Control experiments confirmed that assay conditions were not saturated and that changes in transcript levels gave a clear change in signal intensity for each primer set (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1102/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Dr1 knock-down by RNAi results in upregulation of tRNA expression.

It is therefore unlikely that the observed responses reflect off-target effects, as they were obtained by targeting three independent regions of the Dr1 sequence. It is worth noting that the outcome was unchanged whether we normalized against ARPP P0, GAPDH or TFIIB mRNAs. Our data suggest that endogenous Dr1 is an inhibitor of tRNA expression, but does not show the more general pol III regulatory properties that we had expected. Thus, as found for pol II transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), the effects of Dr1 on pol III output may be gene-selective <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Dr1 is found at pol III-transcribed genes in human cells</title><p>Although Dr1 and DRAP1 have been shown to be present at pol II-transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), they were not found at pol III templates in wild-type yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Nevertheless, ChIP experiments revealed the presence of endogenous human Dr1 at pol III-transcribed genes in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Not only was Dr1 detected at tRNA genes, but it was also detected at 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA genes, expression of which was unperturbed by siRNAs and shRNA against Dr1. Binding is specific, as it is not observed further upstream of the U6 gene or at a site within the coding region of the ARPP P0 gene. It was confirmed with an alternative Dr1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) and in a different human cell type, the osteosarcoma line U2OS (data not shown). Furthermore, occupancy seems comparable to that detected at two pol II promoters that were used as positive controls, as judged by comparison with the TBP signal. Thus, the Dr1 ChIP signals were &#x0223c;50% and &#x0223c;70%, respectively, as strong as the TBP ChIP signals at the Hsp70 and U1 snRNA promoters, and the Dr1 signals at 5S, tRNA and U6 genes were &#x0223c;50% of the TBP signals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1102/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). Because the efficiencies of the antibodies may differ, such a comparison of ChIP signals does not reveal what proportion of TBP molecules are bound by Dr1 at these sites, but it does suggest that the pol III-transcribed genes examined are targeted as strongly by Dr1 as the Hsp70 promoter. We conclude that, in contrast to the situation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), endogenous Dr1 can be readily detected at pol III-transcribed genes in human cells. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Dr1 is found at pol III-transcribed genes.

A model was proposed by White et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) in which Dr1 binding to TBP prevents its interaction with Brf1 and thereby blocks TBP recruitment to TATA-less pol III templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). This model is contradicted by the clear ChIP signal that we detect for Dr1 at tRNA and 5S rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We therefore examined a second prediction of the model, which was that Dr1 and Brf1 would not be present in the same complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). However, when mixed with a HeLa cell extract, <sup>35</sup>S-radiolabelled Brf1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with Dr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Furthermore, a stable association of endogenous Dr1 and Brf1 from HeLa cells can also be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). To investigate the significance of this interaction, we used stably-transfected cells in which expression of Brf1 is controlled by a doxycycline-sensitive promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Induction of Brf1 by doxycycline withdrawal was found to increase crosslinking of TBP and Dr1, as well as Brf1 itself, to tRNA and 5S rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Specificity was established using preimmune serum and control IgG. Western blotting confirmed that the increased Dr1 ChIP signal following Brf1 induction is not due to an increase in its abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). These data suggest that Brf1 can mediate recruitment of Dr1 to tRNA and 5S rRNA genes <italic>in vivo</italic>, although they do not establish if this reflects a direct interaction. In support of Brf1-mediated recruitment, sequential ChIP (re-ChIP) experiments demonstrated simultaneous promoter association by Brf1 and Dr1, as well as by Dr1 and TBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F).

This was found to be the case, with endogenous DRAP1 crosslinking to 5S rRNA, tRNA and U6 snRNA genes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The interaction appears specific, as it was not detected upstream of a U6 snRNA gene or within the coding region of the ARPP P0 gene. Moreover, it was confirmed using an alternative antibody against DRAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). We conclude that endogenous DRAP1 is also present at pol III-transcribed genes in HeLa cells. A ChIP-on-chip study carried out previously with human B cells did not report DRAP1 at pol III-transcribed genes, but this can be readily explained by the fact that the study focused specifically on pol II promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>DRAP1 occupancy at pol III-transcribed genes.

However, DRAP1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B) had minimal effects on expression of pol III products, including the pre-tRNAs that responded clearly to knockdown of Dr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D). The lack of response was not because assay conditions were saturated, since control experiments confirmed that changes in transcript levels gave a clear change in signal intensity for each primer set (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1102/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>). As a positive control, we examined expression of Bcl2 mRNA and confirmed that this responded to DRAP1 depletion in our assays, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Three different siRNAs targeting three different exons of DRAP1 were analysed, but although DRAP1 protein levels were reduced by about 75%, only marginal changes in pre-tRNA and other pol III transcript levels were obtained, that were not consistent and did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1102/DC1">Supplementary Figures S6 and S7</ext-link>). Furthermore, a pool of three additional siRNAs and a shRNA targeting different regions of DRAP1 were also tested, resulting in similar outcomes (data not shown). After utilising seven different siRNA and shRNA in both HeLa and HEK293T cells, we conclude that, at least under the conditions used, DRAP1 depletion has minimal effect on the expression of pol III transcripts. This is reminiscent of the pol II-dependent Egr1 promoter, which responds to depletion of Dr1, but not of DRAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>DRAP1 knock-down by RNAi does not affect expression of pol III transcripts.

We found that heat shock provokes a &#x0223c;5-fold increase in DRAP1 protein with minimal change in Dr1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). This response appears to be post-transcriptional, as DRAP1 mRNA expression is almost unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and D). Heat shock therefore provides an opportunity to examine whether a robust, physiological increase in DRAP1 levels is accompanied by inhibition of pol III activity. This was not the case. No decrease was detected in any of the pol III transcripts examined; indeed, expression of pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> increased &#x0223c;2-fold after heat shock, whilst 5S rRNA and pre-tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> showed slight and transient induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and E). Our data therefore provide no evidence that DRAP1 is a repressor of pol III transcription under the conditions we have studied. Such a role under other circumstances can clearly not be excluded. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>DRAP1 protein levels are upregulated after heat shock but do not repress the expression of pol III transcripts.

The assays, however, required a large excess of Dr1 protein and therefore left open the question of physiological relevance. Indeed, Dr1 was found to suppress tRNA expression when produced at elevated levels in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), even though endogenous Dr1 is not detected at tRNA genes when wild-type yeast are grown under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Nevertheless, our ChIP assays reveal that human tRNA genes are occupied by endogenous Dr1 in HeLa cells, without the need for overexpression. Association is specific and was confirmed using alternative antibodies and in a different human cell type. Quantitation of binding by qPCR confirms that it is highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1102/DC1">Supplementary Figure S8</ext-link>). Furthermore, RNAi reveals that transcription of these tRNA genes is suppressed &#x0223c;2-fold by physiological levels of Dr1. This response is unlikely to reflect off-target effects, as it was reproduced using shRNA and siRNAs directed against three different regions of the Dr1 sequence. We conclude that the functions of human Dr1 include the suppression of tRNA expression.</p><p>As all pol III-transcribed genes are thought to utilize TBP, we had expected them all to respond to Dr1. We were therefore surprised that expression of 5S rRNA, U6 snRNA and 7SL RNA was unchanged by Dr1 RNAi. The corresponding genes clearly associate with Dr1, as revealed by ChIP. It may be relevant that 5S, U6 and 7SL genes all have distinct promoter organization and more complex transcription factor requirements than the simpler tRNA and Alu genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), which might influence their responsiveness in some way. Promoter sequence has been shown to influence responsiveness of pol II promoters to Dr1/DRAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Perhaps 5S, U6 and 7SL genes would respond to more complete depletion of Dr1 than we have been able to achieve. However, more extreme depletion is likely to increase secondary effects that would be difficult to interpret with confidence. It is also possible that transcriptional changes in fact occur, but are not reflected in the steady-state transcript levels. Because 5S, U6 and 7SL RNAs are relatively abundant and stable, their abundance is probably much less responsive to altered rates of transcription than short-lived transcripts, such as pre-tRNAs.</p><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that the effect of Dr1 on tRNA levels <italic>in vivo</italic> is mediated indirectly through its ability to regulate pol II transcription. Clearly, pol III transcription factors depend on pol II for their expression. However, the partial depletion of Dr1 in our experiments is not causing global changes to mRNA expression. We found no significant alteration to the levels of mRNAs encoding TFIIIB and TFIIIC subunits under RNAi conditions that are sufficient to induce tRNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1102/DC1">Supplementary Figure S9</ext-link>). This is consistent with the selectivity of the response, as altered expression of pol III or its factors might be expected to affect a broad range of pol III products (all the transcription machinery known to be required by tRNA genes is also required by 5S rRNA genes, for example). Although indirect effects may also occur, our data provide clear evidence that human Dr1 interacts with TFIIIB and pol III-transcribed genes <italic>in vivo</italic> and therefore support its function as a direct regulator of these targets, consistent with its pol III inhibitory effects <italic>in vitro</italic> with a partially-purified and reconstituted system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Structural considerations predict strongly that Dr1 will obstruct binding of Brf1 to TBP. Two separate domains of Brf1 interact with TBP, one composed of cyclin folds and the other referred to as &#x02018;homology II&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Mutagenesis, crosslinking and modelling suggest that the cyclin fold domain of Brf1 grasps the C-terminal stirrup of TBP in a manner similar to the cyclin folds of TFIIB, with which it bears homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Crystallography shows that this interaction between TFIIB and TBP is blocked by the penultimate helix of Dr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The adjacent helix of Dr1 traverses the convex surface of TBP and is likely to cross the region occupied by Brf1 homology domain II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). This is supported by the ability of recombinant Dr1 to displace TBP from a Brf1 fragment containing homology domain II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). These observations predict that Dr1-bound TBP should dissociate from Brf1 and be released from TATA-less promoters, where TBP is anchored by Brf1. Our current data, however, show otherwise. Perhaps interactions with the third TFIIIB subunit, Bdp1, allow Dr1-bound TBP to be retained at the promoter despite a disrupted interaction with Brf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Binding to Brf1 itself might also explain the presence of Dr1 at pol III-transcribed genes. A putative interaction with Brf1 could occur that does not disrupt the interface with TBP or inhibit expression. Repression might follow the transfer of Dr1 to TBP, perhaps triggered by phosphorylation changes to Brf1, TBP and/or Dr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Ample precedent exists for the presence of Dr1 at active pol II promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), even though its documented interaction with TBP is incompatible with current models of pol II transcription. Further structural studies will be required to elucidate the disposition of Dr1 in active transcription complexes. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Models to explain the presence of Dr1 at TATA-less pol III templates.

Transfer of Dr1 to TBP might disrupt the TBP/Brf1 interface and repress transcription. Such transfer might be triggered by changes in post-translational modification; a hypothetical dephosphosphorylation of Dr1 is illustrated as an example. P denotes protein phosphorylation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp1102f7"/></fig></p><p>The Dr1/DRAP1 complex (NC2) can mobilize TBP on DNA, an effect that may have positive or negative transcriptional effects, depending on context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). This activity is not displayed by Dr1 or DRAP1 individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Endogenous DRAP1 is clearly detected at pol III templates (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1102/DC1">Supplementary Figure S8</ext-link>), presumably due to its dimerization with Dr1. However, DRAP1 depletion by RNAi did not reproducibly affect expression of pol III products. Furthermore, these transcripts were not repressed when heat shock triggered a &#x0223c;5-fold increase in DRAP1 protein levels. DRAP1 may therefore be a passive partner of Dr1 at pol III-transcribed genes, with no influence on their expression. This would imply that TBP mobilization is not required for Dr1 to regulate pol III transcription. Dr1 is known to be able to function independently of DRAP1 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Nevertheless, a role for DRAP1 in pol III control has not been excluded and might become apparent under different experimental or physiological conditions. Precedent is provided in yeast, where Dr1/DRAP1 represses certain pol II promoters after diauxic shift, but not during exponential growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to our findings in HeLa cells, little or no crosslinking of endogenous Dr1 or DRAP1 to tRNA genes has been detected in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, Dr1 is capable of repressing tRNA expression when overexpressed in this yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). A potential explanation is provided by the observations that Mot1 is found at yeast pol III-transcribed genes and has been shown to inhibit promoter association by Dr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Natural levels of Dr1 might therefore be excluded from these sites by Mot1, whereas overexpressed Dr1 may compete more effectively. Indeed, although the ChIP signal for Dr1 and DRAP1 is close to background at a tRNA gene in wild-type yeast, it increases significantly in a <italic>mot1</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>).</p><p>Pol III output is strongly linked with the growth state of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Indeed, elevated expression of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkp1102i4.jpg"/></inline-formula> in immortalized murine fibroblasts is sufficient to stimulate proliferation and induce oncogenic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Our data show that levels of this tRNA increase in response to Dr1 depletion. It is therefore conceivable that pol III control may provide a link between Dr1 and the proliferative and oncogenic status of mammalian cells. Dr1 expression was found to be significantly compromised in 74% of the 58 cases examined of neuroblastoma, usually due to genomic deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Little or no change in DRAP1 was detected in any of the samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Our data suggest that the reduced Dr1 levels in these early childhood tumours may result in elevated tRNA expression.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1102/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Wellcome Trust (081977/Z/07/Z); Wellcome Trust PhD program Molecular Functions in Disease (to T.K.); Cancer Research UK (to R.J.W.).
