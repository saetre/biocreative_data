Based on the present results and the existence of a human brain-specifically expressed C&#x003b2; splice variant designated C&#x003b2;4 that is identical to the former mouse C&#x003b2;2 splice variant, the mouse splice variant has now been renamed mouse C&#x003b2;4.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Murine lymphoid tissues express a protein that is a homologue of human and bovine C&#x003b2;2.

The enzyme is activated when two cAMP molecules bind each R subunit, causing a conformational change that releases the C subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Different isoforms of both R and C subunits exist. Four separate R subunit genes designated RI&#x003b1;, RI&#x003b2;, RII&#x003b1; and RII&#x003b2; have been identified and characterized in all primates investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In most species investigated three genes encoding the C isoforms have been identified and designated C&#x003b1;, C&#x003b2; and PrKX. PrKX is an X chromosome encoded protein kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] that has, despite low homology to C&#x003b1; and C&#x003b2;, been identified as a PKA C subunit with the ability to release the R subunit in a cAMP-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A murine homologue of PrKX termed PKARE has also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, in human, an intron-less gene transcribing the mRNA for C&#x003b3; has been identified. C&#x003b3; represents a testis-specific retroposon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the mouse a C subunit pseudogene has been identified and designated Cx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Several splice variants of C&#x003b1; and C&#x003b2;, arising from alternative splicing of the first exon in the C&#x003b1; and C&#x003b2; genes, are responsible for further diversity. The C&#x003b1; gene encodes two splice variants (C&#x003b1;1 and C&#x003b1;s/C&#x003b1;2) in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). In human 10 different splice variants encoded by the C&#x003b2; gene have been identified and called C&#x003b2;1, C&#x003b2;2, C&#x003b2;3, C&#x003b2;4, C&#x003b2;4ab, C&#x003b2;4abc, C&#x003b2;3ab, C&#x003b2;3abc, C&#x003b2;3b and C&#x003b2;4b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the mouse and bovine three and two C&#x003b2; splice variants have been identified, respectively. In bovine they are designated C&#x003b2;1 and C&#x003b2;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and in mouse they are designated C&#x003b2;1, C&#x003b2;2 and C&#x003b2;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. C&#x003b1;1 and C&#x003b2;1 are ubiquitously expressed, while the other splice variants show a more tissue restricted expression pattern. C&#x003b1;S/C&#x003b1;2 is solely expressed in sperm cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Whereas expression of the human C&#x003b2;2 splice variant is enriched in lymphoid tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], it shows a more widespread pattern of expression in the bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and is restricted to the brain in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The majority of the other C&#x003b2; splice variants identified, which include human and murine C&#x003b2;3 and human C&#x003b2;4 as well as the human C&#x003b2;3 and C&#x003b2;4 abc variants, are only detected in nerve cells and the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>A number of reports have demonstrated that both the C&#x003b1;1 and C&#x003b2;1 isoforms have a relative molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa when analysed by SDS-PAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In contrast, human and bovine C&#x003b2;2 have a relative molecular mass of 47 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] whereas in the mouse it is 38 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Both human and murine C&#x003b2;3 are 38 kDa, as is also the case with human C&#x003b2;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For the human C&#x003b2;3 and C&#x003b2;4 abc variants, the relative molecular masses have not been determined.</p><p>We investigated the expression of C subunits in various murine tissues and identified two immunoreactive proteins of approximately 40 and 47 kDa. Whereas the 40 kDa band was ubiquitously expressed, the 47 kDa band was restricted to lymphoid tissues such as thymus, spleen and lymph node. Based on this we examined the activity, level and apparent molecular sizes of C&#x003b2; splice variants in immune cells. Using spleen cells from wild type and mice mutant for the C&#x003b2; gene we demonstrated that the 40 kDa band was C&#x003b2;1 whereas the 47 kDa protein was the murine homologue of human and bovine C&#x003b2;2. The novel murine C&#x003b2;2 was shown to be an active protein kinase that was immunodetected by an antiserum made against the human C&#x003b2;2 specific sequence. Based on this, together with sequence homology searches and sequence comparisons, we conclude that the previously reported murine C&#x003b2;2 is a homologue of human C&#x003b2;4. Thus, the murine C&#x003b2; gene encodes the splice variants C&#x003b2;1, C&#x003b2;2, C&#x003b2;3 and C&#x003b2;4, as is the case with the human C&#x003b2; gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Murine spleen cells express C&#x003b1;1, C&#x003b2;1 and a novel 47 kDa C&#x003b2; splice variant enriched in lymphoid tissues</title><p>When lysates made from various murine tissues were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with a commercially available pan C antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), a 40 kDa band was detected in all tissues.

In the human T cell lysate two immunoreactive bands of 40 and 47 kDa were identified. These protein bands have previously been shown to be C&#x003b1;1 (40 kDa) and C&#x003b2;2 (47 kDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The 47 kDa immunoreactive protein band was detected in the spleen cell lysate from WT and C&#x003b2;+/- mice, but was absent in the C&#x003b2;-/- lysate, implying that it represents a C&#x003b2; splice variant. Furthermore, in the C&#x003b2;-/- lysate, the 40 kDa protein band appeared weaker in intensity. This was confirmed by densitometric scanning of the 40 kDa bands in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> (results not shown) which revealed a 40 % reduction in intensity of the 40 kDa band in the C&#x003b2;-/- lysate. Together this implies that C&#x003b2;1 (40 kDa) may be expressed in mouse spleen cells.</p><p>Spleen cell lysates from WT and C&#x003b2; mutant mice were also tested for PKA-specific phosphotransferase activity by incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P from [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP into the PKA-specific substrate Kemptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Phosphotransferase activity was also measured in the presence of PKI to demonstrate that kinase activity was PKA-specific (black bars, cAMP/PKI). PKA-specific activity was reduced by 35 and 66 % in C&#x003b2;+/- and C&#x003b2;-/- mice, respectively, compared to WT (C&#x003b2;+/+) mice. This indicates that C&#x003b2; contributes significantly to PKA activity in mouse spleen cells.</p><p>To further investigate the identity of the 40 and 47 kDa protein bands, we analysed C subunit expression and PKA kinase activity in mice lacking the C&#x003b2;1 splice variant (C&#x003b2;1-/-) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> demonstrates that the 47 kDa C subunit immunoreactive band is present in cell lysates from both WT and C&#x003b2;1-/- mice. It should however be noted that the 40 kDa protein band was clearly weaker in intensity in lysate from C&#x003b2;1-/- mice. Densitometric scanning indicated that this reduction was of similar magnitude (approximately 30 %, results not shown) as that monitored in the C&#x003b2;-/- mice. Together with the fact that we also measured a 27 % reduction in PKA kinase activity in the C&#x003b2;1-/- mice lysates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) this demonstrated that C&#x003b2;1 is expressed in mouse spleen cells. Finally, the fact that reduction in PKA kinase activity in the C&#x003b2;-/- was approximately twice as much at that observed in the C&#x003b2;1-/- (66 % as opposed to 27 %) strongly implies that the lymphoid tissue specific 47 kDa protein is a C&#x003b2; splice variant and that it contributes significantly to PKA kinase activity in mouse spleen cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning and expression of a novel catalytically active murine C&#x003b2; splice variant homologous to human C&#x003b2;2</title><p>Our observations that murine spleen cells express a 47 kDa anti-C immunoreactive protein that is absent in the C&#x003b2;-/- animals, and co-migrates with human C&#x003b2;2, suggest that the mouse expresses a C&#x003b2;2 subunit homologous to the human C&#x003b2;2 subunit. In order to investigate this, we initially performed a homology search in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST (tblastn) search tool using the human C&#x003b2;2 specific peptide sequence. We identified a region with high sequence similarity to the human exon 1&#x02013;2 sequence in the published mouse genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This sequence was located in the mouse C&#x003b2; gene upstream of exon 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Based on this information and the fact that all C subunits identified so far only differ in the domain encoded by alternative use of exon 1, we postulated a hypothetical cDNA sequence using this mouse exon 1&#x02013;2 sequence and the known murine C&#x003b2; cDNA sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, bottom). To confirm mRNA expression of this sequence, oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5'-untranslated and 3'-untranslated regions of the cDNA were synthesised and used for reverse transcriptase PCR of total RNA from mouse thymus since C&#x003b2;2 expression has earlier been reported to be enriched in human thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. PCR products were subcloned into pCR-Blunt-II-TOPO vector. Nucleotide sequencing (Medigenomix, Germany) and amino acid sequence deduction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), followed by comparison of the unique N-terminal end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] with corresponding sequences in human, bovine, mouse and zebra fish (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), confirmed the novel sequence as the murine C&#x003b2;2 homologue.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of a novel mouse cDNA sequence encoding a C&#x003b2; splice variant homologous to human C&#x003b2;2</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Schematic representation of the human (upper) and murine (lower) C&#x003b2; gene.

To determine if the mouse C&#x003b2;2 cDNA encodes an active protein kinase, the cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA-DEST40 (Gateway Technology System, Invitrogen). To optimize for efficient protein expression, a Kozak sequence was introduced in the 5'-end. Moreover, two different 3'-ends were made, one including and one excluding a stop codon to facilitate native and tagged expression, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The new plasmid was designated pcDNA-DEST40mC&#x003b2;2 and transfected into HEK 293T cells. As a positive control pEF-DEST51C&#x003b1;1, which expresses human C&#x003b1;1 (hC&#x003b1;1), was used. Mock transfected cells served as a negative control. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting using a pan C antibody. This revealed expression of an immunoreactive protein of 47 kDa in cells transfected with mC&#x003b2;2, and a 40 kDa protein in cells transfected with hC&#x003b1;1. A weak 40 kDa band could also be seen in mC&#x003b2;2 and mock transfected cell lysates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), representing endogenous C&#x003b1;1. In order to test for enzyme activity of the expressed C&#x003b2;2, the same cell lysates were analysed for PKA-specific phosphotransferase activity against Kemptide. This demonstrated a more than 10-fold increased enzyme activity in the cells transfected with mC&#x003b2;2 and hC&#x003b1;1 compared to the mock-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The PKA specific inhibitor PKI abolished this activity, implying that the activity observed is PKA-specific and that mouse C&#x003b2;2 is an active PKA enzyme. It should be noted that the C-terminally tagged C&#x003b2;2 was kinase inactive and was not used for further experiments (results not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Murine C&#x003b2;2 cDNA encodes an active protein kinase of 47 kDa recognized by a C&#x003b2;2-specific antiserum</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Primers used to amplify mouse C&#x003b2;2 cDNA for insertion into pENTR/D-TOPO (Gateway system, Invitrogen). The upper 5'-end primer (upper sequence left) was designed to produce an insert with a Kozak sequence associated with the start codon (ATG). Two different 3'-end primers (lower right two sequences) were designed in order to include or exclude the stop codon (TAG). In the absence of the stop codon, the mouse C&#x003b2;2 would be expressed with a C-terminal tag, which is contained in the vector (Gateway, Invitrogen). Mouse C&#x003b2;2 cDNA was PCR amplified and subcloned into the pcDNA-DEST40 expression vector to yield pcDNA-DEST40 mC&#x003b2;2. <bold>(B) </bold>HEK 293T cells (3.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml) were transfected with 2&#x003bc;g DNA/ml of pcDNA-DEST40mC&#x003b2;2 (mC&#x003b2;2), mock-transfected (mock), or transfected with pEF-DEST51hC&#x003b1;1 (hC&#x003b1;1) for 24 h. Cells were lysed and analysed by SDS-PAGE and anti-pan C immunoblotting. Note that mC&#x003b2;2, but not mock or hC&#x003b1;1 transfected cell extracts, contained an anti-C immunoreactive protein of 47 kDa.

Immunoreactivity of the resulting antiserum (Anti-mC&#x003b2;2) was tested by immunoblotting using lysates from HEK 293T cells transfected with either mC&#x003b2;2 or human C&#x003b1;1 (hC&#x003b1;1) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). This revealed that the size of the protein recognized by the anti-mC&#x003b2;2 serum was determined to be 47 kDa by comparison with an identical blot probed with the pan C antibody. It should be noted that the anti-mC&#x003b2;2 serum did not appear to cross-react with expressed hC&#x003b1;1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The present report demonstrates a lymphoid tissue specific 47 kDa C&#x003b2; subunit which together with C&#x003b2;1 (40 kDa) is responsible for 66 % of PKA specific enzyme activity in spleen cells. The 47 kDa C&#x003b2; subunit was cloned and shown to be an active murine PKA C&#x003b2; splice variant. Based on a sequence homology search, and production of a specific antiserum, we conclude that the 47 kDa protein is the murine homologue of human and bovine C&#x003b2;2. Furthermore, sequence comparison also led us to conclude that the previously published murine C&#x003b2;2 is the murine homologue of human C&#x003b2;4. Taken together with previous reports our results demonstrate that the murine C&#x003b2; gene encodes C&#x003b2;1, C&#x003b2;2, C&#x003b2;3 and C&#x003b2;4.</p><p>Expression of C&#x003b2;1 in murine spleen was indirectly demonstrated by reduced immunoreactivity of the 40 kDa band and a 27 % reduction in PKA-specific kinase activity in the C&#x003b2;1-/- mouse. C&#x003b2;1 expression in murine lymphocytes is in conflict with our previous observations in human T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], which apparently do not express this splice variant. If this is also the case for murine T cells, it implies that other cell types may account for the presence of C&#x003b2;1 in our cell extracts, since spleen cells are a mixture of various immune cells, including B and T cells as well as macrophages and monocytes.</p><p>Our results demonstrate the existence of a sequence in the murine genome homologous to the human and bovine C&#x003b2;2-specific sequence. In addition, we observed a 47 kDa anti-C immunoreactive protein that was absent in C&#x003b2;-/- but not in C&#x003b2;1-/- mice. Because the cloned and expressed C&#x003b2; variant was 47 kDa as demonstrated by immunoreactivity to a pan C antibody and a serum made against the N-terminus of the novel protein, and because the only known 47 kDa PKA C subunit is the human and bovine C&#x003b2;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], we conclude that the novel C subunit is the murine C&#x003b2;2 homologue. The existence of the 47 kDa C&#x003b2;2 homologue is in conflict with our previous report, which showed the presence of C&#x003b2;2 in several mammalian species, including monkey, dog, man and bovine, but failed to demonstrate the splice variant in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This was concluded based on a Zoo-blot (Southern blot with genomic DNA from various species) analysis using a probe spanning the human C&#x003b2;2-specific sequence. Failure to identify a murine C&#x003b2;2 may have been due to low homology between C&#x003b2;2 of various species, which we also discovered in our data-base searches comparing the C&#x003b2;2 specific sequence of human, bovine, mouse and zebra fish (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Interestingly, the C&#x003b2;2 specific sequence was fairly well conserved even in the fish genome, indicating the presence of C&#x003b2;2 in all vertebrates. A lower of degree of conservation is a feature generally associated with sequences not directly involved in catalysis, which again may suggest a more structural role for the N-terminal part of the protein.</p><p>Expression of C&#x003b2;2 protein seemed to be mostly restricted to lymphoid tissues, as the 47 kDa band was present in lymph nodes, spleen and thymus, but not detectable in brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle. In an earlier report C&#x003b2;2 mRNA was detected in bovine brain, heart, skeletal muscle, spleen and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, in human C&#x003b2;2 has been detected by Northern blotting in human kidney in addition to the same immune tissues as demonstrated for mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The fact that we were unable to detect C&#x003b2;2 protein in all tissues described in bovine and in kidney of human may imply that the protein is not present in these tissues or that the level of expression is below the level of detection for the antibodies used here.</p><p>Using peptides corresponding to the C&#x003b2;2 specific sequence, we made a polyclonal antibody. This antiserum was shown to be C&#x003b2;2 specific in immunoblot assays.</p><p>Guthrie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] identified three C&#x003b2; splice variants in mouse, with C&#x003b2;2 expressed exclusively in the brain, encoding an additional 2 amino acids at the N-terminus by alternative use of exons. It is therefore smaller than human and bovine C&#x003b2;2 and is not expressed in the same tissues. In fact, the previously described mouse C&#x003b2;2 is identical to the human splice variant designated C&#x003b2;4, which is expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Based on this evidence, the previously described murine C&#x003b2;2 has now been renamed murine C&#x003b2;4. Moreover, based on this and previous reports, we conclude that all mammals contain the isoforms C&#x003b2;1, C&#x003b2;2, C&#x003b2;3 and C&#x003b2;4.

A region similar to the human exon 1&#x02013;2 sequence was identified and a sequence in the mouse genome was postulated as mouse exon 1&#x02013;2. Based on this a hypothetical murine C&#x003b2;2 cDNA was deduced which contained this sequence and the rest of the known murine C&#x003b2; cDNA sequence thatspans the sequence encoded by exon 2 through exon 10. To verify the existence of murine C&#x003b2;2 mRNA, total RNA was isolated from a mouse thymus using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and total cDNA was synthesized using the Promega Reverse Transcription System (Promega). Potential full-length mC&#x003b2;2 cDNAs were amplified with PCR (Pfu Ultra amplification system, Stratagene) using several different oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5'-untranslated and 3'-untranslated regions of the predicted cDNA. Three different forward primers (F1: 5'-gctcttagcgtcttggtagg-3', F2: 5'-aaacacttgcagttacttta-3' and F3: 5'-ttctgaaaacacttgcagtt-3') and three different reverse primers (R1: 5'-cccacagaggtcggt-3', R2: 5'-gacctcacgcagttg-3' and R3: 5'-acactgatgacgcagga-3') were combined into nine different primer sets (set 1: F1+R1, set 2: F1+R2, set 3: F1+R3, set 4: F2+R1, set 5: F2+R2, set 6: F2+R3, set 7: F3+R1, set 8: F3+R2 and set 9: F3+R3). Of the primer sets (Sets 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9) that resulted in amplification of a single DNA band of the right size (based on the theoretical lengths of the various PCR products-between 1300 and 2000 bp), Set 1 and 3 were used to amplify mC&#x003b2;2 cDNA in two parallel PCR reactions.
