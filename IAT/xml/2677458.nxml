A failure of the CNS control of food intake will result in an increase of the mass of WAT of an organism by a combination of increasing adipocyte cell size and number. The increase in WAT mass is not only caused by expansion of adipocytes but also by differentiation of fibroblast-like preadipocytes that are already determined for an adipocyte fate. Preadipose cell lines and primary cultures of preadipocytes are committed solely to the adipocyte lineage and differentiate either spontaneously or under the influence of adipogenic hormones such as IGF-I and glucocorticoids into mature adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Green1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Torii1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Adipose tissue is not only the main energy reservoir of the body but a complex organ in which adipocytes, connective tissue matrix, nerve tissue, stromal vascular cells and immune cells function as an integrated unit. Molecules secreted by adipocytes include adipocytokines, e.g. leptin, adiponectin, resistin, interleukin 6 (IL-6) but also IGF-1, adenosine, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and TNF-&#x003b1;. These factors are essential components of the peripheral signals that control regulatory processes in the hypothalamus affecting energy homeostasis and reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Caprio1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Muse1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The majority of pathways that control feeding behavior converge on the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Jobst1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> although several &#x0201c;peripheral&#x0201d; anabolic and catabolic hormones act at various sites within the central nervous system. The integration and interpretation of incoming signals involves several hypothalamic transcription factors including the basic helix-loop-helix protein Nscl-2 (Neurological stem cell leukemia). Nscl-2 is also known as Nhlh2 (nescient helix-loop-helix 2) according to the HUGO and NCBI nomenclature. Nscl-2 and the closely related NSCL-1 are expressed in large areas of the developing central and peripheral nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Kruger1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Kruger2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> with Nscl-2 being expressed within the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), arcuate nucleus (ARC), and in neurons of lateral, ventromedial and dorsal medial hypothalamus of adult mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Jing1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similarly, no clear correlation between peripheral innervation and adipocyte differentiation or metabolic activity has been established and genetic systems to study such effects were missing.

For our analysis we concentrated on WAT since morphological analysis of different tissues revealed pathological changes in WAT, which were apparent <bold><italic>before</italic></bold> the animals became obese (see below). We detected a strong reduction of the expression of neurofilament, a marker for sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Fornaro1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, in epididymal and subcutaneous adipose tissue of Nscl-2 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005516-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Small nerve fibers that are normally easily detected within the adipose tissue were absent together with a strong reduction of neurofilament staining within funiculi and larger nerve fascicles. In the subcutaneous adipose tissue the funiculi of Nscl-2 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice were almost devoid of neurofilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005516-g001">Fig. 1Aa&#x02013;d</xref>). We also investigated the presence of unmyelinated fibers in adipose tissues, which include postganglionic fibers of the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic). Unmyelinated fibers are marked by expression of peripherin while neurofilament is specifically expressed in myelinated fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Fornaro1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. We found a massive decrease of the number of peripherin-positive fibers in epididymal and subcutaneous adipose tissue of Nscl-2 mutants at 8, 16 and 24 weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005516-g001">Fig. 1Ae, f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005516-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

Hence, we also wanted to know whether the reduction of nerve fibers might affect formation of the microvasculature in adipose tissue of Nscl-2 mutant mice.

To address this question we first monitored the increase of body weight in our strain of Nscl-2 mutant mice. We found that Nscl-2 mutant mice show a normal birth weight and did not gain excessive weight until after puberty. After puberty, which has been reported for C57 mice to occur between 4 weeks (vaginal opening) and 8.5 weeks (cyclicity) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Nelson1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, body fat increased noticeably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005516-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) eventually resulting in a body weight of Nscl-2 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice that was 34&#x00025; higher compared to WT mice (32.64&#x000b1;0.63 g versus 24.42 g&#x000b1;0.53 g) at the age of 25 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005516-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). This observation corroborated previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Coyle1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Good1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, which were generated using a different strain of Nscl-2 mutant mice. Interestingly, serum concentrations of leptin and adiponectin in Nscl-2 mutant mice were already significantly elevated at 8 weeks, at a time when the body weight was not significantly different between mutant and wildtype animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005516-g003">Fig 3C, D</xref>). After puberty the leptin level increased further and reached a peak at 24 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005516-g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We also detected a marked elevation in the serum concentrations of adiponectin and resistin in 6&#x02013;8 month old NSLC-2 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005516-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The high levels of leptin in Nscl-2 knockout mice suggested that these mice are resistant to leptin signaling. Indeed, peripherally administration of leptin with osmotic mini pumps over a time period of 14 days did not result in a significant reduction of the body weight of Nscl-2 mutants compared to C57Bl/6 controls (data not shown). We concluded that the increase of serum leptin and adiponectin levels was caused by changes in the WAT such as decreased innervation and vascularization that occurred before onset of obesity.</p><fig id="pone-0005516-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005516.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Increased expression of leptin precedes abnormal gain of weight in Nscl-2 mutant mice.</title><p>(A) Significant differences in the body weight of WT and Nscl-2 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice occur only post-puberty after 12&#x02013;15 weeks of age (lower two graphs).

Nscl-2 mutant mice show a striking reduction of the innervation and vascularization of WAT, which might lead to the increase of preadipocyte/macrophage-like cells, the bimodal distribution of the size of adipocytes in WAT and to the altered metabolic activity of adipocytes. We do not believe that the elevated food intake and reduced physical activity of Nscl-2 mutant mice is responsible for the WAT phenotype since comparable changes have not been found in other models of obesity, excessive food intake, and physical inactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Bluher1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition the changes in the architecture of WAT in Nscl-2 developed before the mutant became obese. Similarly, we observed an increase of the serum concentrations of leptin and adiponectin before Nscl-2 mutant mice gained excessive weight clearly indicating that the changes in the architecture and/or metabolic activity of adipose tissue were not directly caused by the obesity, which develop later during life in Nscl-2 mutants.</p><p>Interestingly, the accumulation of preadipocytes is a rather dominant phenotype, which prevailed even in Nscl-2/leptin compound mutant mice indicating that leptin most probably is not involved in this process. Currently, we favor the hypothesis that the massive reduction of peripheral innervation and vascularization in Nscl-2 mutant WAT is the primary cause for metabolic changes in adipocytes and the morphological alterations of the WAT. This statement is primarily supported by the exclusive expression of Nscl-2 in the nervous system as well as by the reduced innervation of WAT and increased release of adipokines before puberty, preceding the onset of obesity. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that other host-derived signals contribute to the WAT phenotype. In fact, we detected a marked elevation in the serum concentrations of numerous adipokines such as leptin as well as resistin and adiponectin, which might have an effect on the differentiation of preadipocytes. The high leptin serum level result in an early leptin resistance of Nscl-2 knockout mice. In particular resistin has been described to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Blagoev1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> while adiponectin promotes cell proliferation and differentiation from preadipocytes into adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Fu1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The massive increase of the concentration of various adipokines might enhance the heterogeneity of adipocytes and contribute to the accumulation of high numbers of preadipocytes.</p><p>Currently, we do not know whether the massive reduction of microvasculature in the WAT of Nscl-2 mutants contributes to the phenotype. Although it is well known that the neuronal and the vascular system share similar signaling cues, the concept of a neurovascular link that recognizes the crosstalk between the vascular and the nervous system is relatively new <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Zacchigna1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Nscl-2 mutant mice represent the first model, which displays a clear correlation between reduced innervation and reduction of vascularization in the WAT.</p><p>The primary defect in Nscl-2 mutant mice lays in the nervous system but not in adipose tissue. Yet, adipocytes isolated from Nscl-2 mutant mice are insulin-resistant indicating that the metabolic changes that develop in mutant mice led to a relatively stable phenotype of adipocytes, which maintain these features in vitro for some time. Although the serum concentration of insulin was relatively low in Nscl-2 mutant mice, which argues against a massive insulin resistance of insulin responsive cells, it is evident that Nscl-2 mutant adipocytes have acquired properties in vivo that led to an impaired glucose transport in vitro. The deficiency of adipocytes was restricted to insulin stimulated glucose uptake but did not affect the basal glucose uptake rate demonstrating that the basic glucose uptake machinery was intact. It was surprising to learn that Nscl-2 mutant mice show a normal glucose tolerance and only a moderate decrease of insulin sensitivity despite the insulin resistance of isolated adipocytes. This apparent paradox questions the role of white adipose tissue in overall glucose homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Jansson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, mice with an adipose tissue specific insulin receptor knockout (FIRKO mice) show a normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and are protected against obesity-related glucose intolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Bluher2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, which resemble the Nscl-2 phenotype to certain degree. On the other hand, various syndromes of lipodystrophy, insulin resistance associated with obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Kopelman1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, and insulin resistance of mice with a fat-specific knockout of GLUT4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Abel1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrate an important role of fat tissue in overall glucose homeostasis. Despite the important role of adipocytes and WAT, the capacity of other tissues such as the skeletal muscle to clear glucose seemed to compensate for the impaired insulin response of adipocytes in Nscl-2 mutant mice. The relative increase of adiponectin that we detected in Nscl-2 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice might also contribute to improved insulin signalling in non-adipose tissue and to normal serum glucose levels in vivo. Such effects would be masked in tissue culture experiments where isolated adiopocytes are analyzed. The increase in adiponectin levels in Nscl-2 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice was rather unexpected since adiponectin levels are usually inversely correlated to percent body fat resulting in the reduction of adiponectin concentrations in obese animals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005516-Whitehead1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> for a review). It is tempting to speculate that the unusual morphology of WAT in Nscl-2 mutant mice, which resulted from the accumulation of preadipocyte/macrophage-like cells and the bimodal distribution of the size of adipocytes in WAT, was responsible for this surprising finding.</p><p>Taken together, we have uncovered a hitherto unknown regulatory circuit that originates from the deficiency of the neuron specific transcription factor Nscl-2 with consequences for innervation of adipose tissue, which leads to accumulation of preadipocytes in vivo. So far the effects of Nscl-2 on fat cell metabolism had been solely explained by alterations in the CNS. Although it is undisputable that the increased food intake and reduced physical activity of Nscl-2 mutant mice are the primary causes of adiposity in Nscl-2 mutant mice it now becomes clear that Nscl-2 governs additional pathways that affect the WAT. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005516-g009">Fig. 9</xref> summarizes our findings and presents a putative model for the impact of Nscl-2 controlled mechanisms on WAT.</p><fig id="pone-0005516-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005516.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Putative model of the impact of Nscl-2 controlled mechanisms on WAT.</title><p>The lack of Nscl-2 results in reduced innervation and vascularization of WAT, which most likely leads to accumulation of preadipocyte/macrophage-like cells and the bimodal distribution of the size of adipocytes in WAT.
