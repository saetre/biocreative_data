VEGF<sub>165</sub>b, formed by alternative splicing of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pre-mRNA inhibits VEGF<sub>165</sub> mediated vasodilatation and angiogenesis, but has not been quantified in pregnancy. Enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) were used to measure mean&#x000b1;SEM plasma VEGF<sub>165</sub>b, soluble endoglin (sEng) and soluble Flt1 (sFlt-1). At 12 weeks gestation the plasma VEGF<sub>165</sub>b concentration was significantly upregulated in plasma from women who maintained normal blood pressure throughout their pregnancy (normotensive group 4.90 &#x000b1;1.6 ng/ml, p&#x0003c;0.01 Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test) compared with non-pregnant women (0.40&#x000b1;0.22ng/ml).

Aside from maternal and fetal death, the condition may also result in intra-uterine growth restriction, seizures (eclampsia), renal or liver failure, and placental abruption. Despite much investigation, the pathological processes underlying this disease are still largely undiscovered. Recent investigation had focussed on defective placental implantation as an important aetiological factor, with the resulting release of placentally derived circulating factors, which cause endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. At the microvascular level, there is a state of vasoconstriction from smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability and anti-angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], which correspond to the clinical findings of high blood pressure, oedema and a characteristically small placenta at delivery of the baby.</p><p id="P3">The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family is thought to be one of the important molecular systems involved in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Conventional VEGF; also known as VEGF-A, is made up of 6 different isoforms formed from alternative exon splicing resulting in proteins of varying amino acid length, termed VEGF<sub>xxx</sub>. VEGF<sub>165</sub> is the most common isoform of VEGF<sub>xxx</sub>, and consists of 165 amino acids. VEGF<sub>165</sub> acts via its receptor VEGFR-2 to increase vascular permeability, vasodilatation and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Endogenous alternative splicing of the VEGF receptor results in soluble VEGFR-1 (also known as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 or sFlt-1), which binds to VEGF and inhibits its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. High levels of sFlt-1 have been documented in pre-eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P4">VEGF levels in pre-eclampsia have been measured by a number of techniques, with conflicting results according to the technique used. When measured by commercial sandwich Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays (ELISAs) which has been proposed to measure only the free, unbound forms of VEGF, levels appear to be reduced in pre-eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. When measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) or competitive enzyme immuno assay (cEIA), VEGF levels are shown to substantially increase. This discrepancy has been proposed to be due to these latter 2 methods not being affected by circulating binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In 2002, an alternative family of VEGF-A isoforms were identified, termed VEGF<sub>xxx</sub>b. These are the same size as conventional VEGF-A but are alternatively spliced in exon 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], This alternative splice site selection results in an alternate 6 amino acid C terminus, which affects the property of the isoforms. VEGF<sub>165</sub>b is the most widely studied of these isoforms. VEGF<sub>165</sub>b has been shown to inhibit the effects of VEGF<sub>165</sub> by binding to its principal receptor VEGFR-2 and preventing it from exerting its physiological effects such as endothelial cell proliferation and migration. VEGF<sub>165</sub>b also binds to and activates Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) resulting in a transient increase in capillary hydraulic conductivity, but no sustained increase in permeability, in contrast with VEGF<sub>165</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. A previous study of VEGF<sub>165</sub>b in term placenta detected a decrease in VEGF<sub>xxx</sub>b expression in pre-eclamptic placenta compared with control placenta, and an uncoupling of the splicing link between VEGF<sub>165</sub>b and VEGF<sub>165</sub>. To determine whether VEGF<sub>165</sub>b may play a role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia, we have investigated the expression of VEGF<sub>165</sub>b in maternal plasma from normotensive and pre-eclamptic pregnancies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P6">Pregnant subjects were recruited from St Michael's Maternity Hospital, Bristol between June 2006 and December 2007. 18 non-pregnant females aged between 20 and 39 years were recruited from the University of Bristol. The protocol for this study was granted ethical approval by Central and South Bristol Research Ethics Committee. 50 subjects were recruited from routine antenatal clinics in the first trimester of pregnancy. Subjects were aged between 17 and 42 years. Blood was taken from subjects for VEGF<sub>165</sub>b quantification at recruitment, and at a further 3 times at 28, 34 and 37 weeks gestation. Pre-eclampsia was defined as BP &#x02265;140/90mmHg on &#x02264; 2 occasions measured 6 hours apart and &#x02265;300mg of proteinuria/24 hours, in the absence of a urinary tract infection, occurring after 20 weeks gestation. 5 patients who later developed pre-eclampsia had further blood taken at disease diagnosis. Following venepuncture, blood was immediately centrifuged at 4000rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant removed and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until protein quantification. Subjects also received fetal growth ultrasound scans at 28, 34 and 37 weeks gestation to screen for intra-uterine growth restriction secondary to pre-eclampsia. During the study period, a further 20 patients who developed pre-eclampsia in the third trimester were recruited into the study at disease diagnosis, and received fetal growth scans at the point of recruitment into the study. In these cases plasma from their first trimesters was obtained from aliquots of frozen plasma stored under the same standard blood storage conditions by the hospital's virology department. Sample size was calculated to see an 80% change in mean VEGF<sub>165</sub>b levels at p&#x0003c;0.05 with a power of &#x0003e;90% given a standard deviation equivalent to the mean (calculated using G Power).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>VEGF<sub>165</sub>b ELISA</title><p id="P7">Anti-VEGF<sub>xxx</sub>b antibody (MAB3045, clone 56/1, R&#x00026;D systems) was coated onto the surface of a sterile Immulon-2HB 96 well plate at a concentration of 200&#x003bc;g/ml overnight. This antibody recognises an epitope within a 9 amino acid sequence at the C terminus of human VEGF<sub>165</sub>b. The plate was washed 3 times with PBS-Tween 0.05%, 100&#x003bc;l/well. The plate was blocked for 12 hours with Superblock (250&#x003bc;l/well, Pierce 37515). Serial dilutions of recombinant VEGF<sub>165</sub>b standards (R&#x00026;D systems) diluted in PBS/BSA up to a concentration of 16ng/ml were then added to the wells in triplicate (200&#x003bc;l/well). Plasma samples were also added in triplicate (200&#x003bc;l/well). Plates were then incubated at room temperature with shaking for 2 hours and then washed as above. 50ng/ml of anti-human VEGF biotinylated affinity purified polyclonal antibody (BAF293, R&#x00026;D systems) was added (200&#x003bc;l/well) and incubated at room temperature with shaking in foil for 2 hours as a detection reagent. Following a further wash, 100&#x003bc;l HRP-streptavidin diluted 1 in 200 in PBS was added for 20 minutes protected from light, and then substrates A and B (100&#x003bc;l/well) were added following washing. After 25 minutes the colour change was stopped on addition of 1M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (50&#x003bc;l/well) and plates were read immediately at a wavelength of 450nm using a plate photospectrometer (Dynex Technologies). Revelation Quicklink 4.25 software was used to construct a standard curve from mean absorbance values of VEGF<sub>165</sub>b standards, which enabled estimation of VEGF<sub>165</sub>b concentration in plasma samples. VEGF<sub>165</sub>b sample concentrations were quantified at multiple different concentrations to ensure values were in the range of the ELISA, in triplicate. This sandwich ELISA measures total circulating VEGF<sub>165</sub>b. It has been shown not to detect VEGF<sub>165</sub> and sFlt-1 is known not to interfere due to the use of antibodies against the VEGF<sub>165</sub>b molecule with epitopes at different parts of the molecule<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>. The coefficients of variation (CV) of this assay in quantifying VEGF<sub>xxx</sub>b was 17% for within subject variation (samples taken at least a week apart), and 7% for within sample variation, whereas between sample CV was &#x0003e;200%, indicating consistency of assay, and significant variation amongst the population. VEGF<sub>165</sub>b concentration in maternal plasma was quantified at 8-12 weeks, 28, 34 and 37 weeks gestation in 45 normotensive subjects and 4 subjects recruited in the first trimester who later developed pre-eclampsia in the third trimester. VEGF<sub>165</sub>b concentration was also quantified in 21 pre-eclamptic patients at 12 weeks gestation, and again in the third trimester at disease diagnosis.

The total VEGF levels measured by EIA are consistent with those previously measured using this assay methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], and by those using an independent method, the radioimmunoassay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. In contrast the ELISA results from the same samples gave much lower readings, consistent with previous ELISA reports of plasma VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. These experiments therefore highlight the previously reported discrepancy between measurements of total circulating VEGF in plasma by commercial ELISAs compared with cEIA, or RIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. The antibodies used in the ELISA are two monoclonals raised against the VEGF peptide sequence and thus may be raised against a similar or identical epitope. The ELISA appears to yield artificially low results, presumably as VEGF is bound by agents in plasma which prevent its detection by both antibodies simultaneously. sFlt-1 does not affect this ELISA when given as recombinant protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], but the effect of endoglin or other plasma constituents have not been tested. The discrepancy was particularly striking after measurement of VEGF<sub>165</sub>b levels, using an ELISA that detects plasma VEGF<sub>165</sub>b using two antibodies that have epitopes on completely separate parts of the antigen (VEGF) molecule. It is therefore rather disturbing that the cEIA is no longer commercially available and was withdrawn from sale by all known suppliers between 2006 and 2007.</p><p id="P20">Of the VEGF family, VEGF<sub>165</sub> the most widely studied form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] is known to increase vascular leakage, induce vasodilatation and promote angiogenesis. Although this isoform is up-regulated in pre-eclampsia, its metabolic activities may be blocked by other proteins, which bind to VEGF and inhibit its function. sFlt-1 and sEng both bind to VEGF and prevent it from exerting its physiological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] . sFlt-1 is an antiangiogenic molecule that is able to induce a pre-eclamptic-like syndrome of hypertension and proteinuria when administered to pregnant rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. sEng is an anti-angiogenic protein that inhibits transforming growth factor &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> signalling and increases the severity of pre-eclampsia occurring in pregnant rats treated with sFlt-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. However, neither molecule can be used clinically as a first trimester marker of pre-eclampsia as sFlt-1 levels are seen to rise only 5 weeks before the onset of the clinical disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], and sEng concentrations become elevated at 17 weeks gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P21">In 2002 VEGF<sub>165</sub>b was identified in normal renal cortex, and subsequently shown to be present in many different tissues, and forms the majority of VEGF in tissues such as human colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], and vitreous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].

The mechanisms underlying these changes in expression are still under investigation, but the reduction is associated with excess angiogenesis. VEGF<sub>165</sub>b has been shown to be anti-angiogenic in animal models of VEGF<sub>165</sub> induced blood vessel growth in the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], mouse subcutaneous tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] and rat mesentery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] and inhibits physiological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], and pathological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] angiogenesis.

It can be concluded that VEGF<sub>165</sub>b may be a clinically useful first trimester marker for increased pre-eclampsia risk, providing for instance a guide to commencement of first trimester oral aspirin therapy, as this decreases the incidence of pre-eclampsia by 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P23">It is not clear what mediates the upregulation of VEGF<sub>165</sub>b in early pregnancy, nor what prevents it in women who will develop pre-eclampsia, and further work must be done to investigate this finding. The failure of upregulation may be reflective of the aetiology, or could be contributory to the subsequent pre-eclampsia. For instance, in the first trimester the reduced anti-angiogenic VEGF<sub>165</sub>b compared with normal pregnancy may reflect a maternal vasculature response to try and correct the defective implantation processes underlying the disease, or the failure to upregulate VEGF<sub>165</sub>b may contribute to defective implantation.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the women who donated their time and their plasma to this study.
