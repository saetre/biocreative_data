The N protein possesses an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (aa 401&#x02013;525, N<sub>TAIL</sub>) that is exposed at the surface of the viral nucleopcapsid. Thanks to its flexible nature, N<sub>TAIL </sub>interacts with several viral and cellular partners. Among these latter, the Interferon Regulator Factor 3 (IRF-3) has been reported to interact with N, with the interaction having been mapped to the regulatory domain of IRF-3 and to N<sub>TAIL</sub>. This interaction was described to lead to the phosphorylation-dependent activation of IRF-3, and to the ensuing activation of the pro-immune cytokine RANTES gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After confirming the reciprocal ability of IRF-3 and N to be co-immunoprecipitated in 293T cells, we thoroughly investigated the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-IRF-3 interaction using a recombinant, monomeric form of the regulatory domain of IRF-3. Using a large panel of spectroscopic approaches, including circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we failed to detect any direct interaction between IRF-3 and either full-length N or N<sub>TAIL </sub>under conditions where these latter interact with the C-terminal X domain of the viral phosphoprotein. Furthermore, such interaction was neither detected in <italic>E. coli </italic>nor in a yeast two hybrid assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Altogether, these data support the requirement for a specific cellular environment, such as that provided by 293T human cells, for the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-IRF-3 interaction to occur. This dependence from a specific cellular context likely reflects the requirement for a human or mammalian cellular co-factor.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Measles virus (MeV) is an enveloped RNA virus within the <italic>Morbillivirus </italic>genus of the <italic>Paramyxoviridae </italic>family. Its non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome is encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid. Transcription and replication are carried out onto this N:RNA complex by the viral polymerase complex which consists of two components, the large protein (L) and the phosphoprotein (P) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]).</p><p>MeV N consists of two regions: a structured N-terminal moiety, N<sub>CORE </sub>(aa 1&#x02013;400), which contains all the regions necessary for self-assembly and RNA-binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and a C-terminal domain, N<sub>TAIL</sub>(aa 401&#x02013;525) that is intrinsically unstructured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and is exposed at the surface of the viral nucleocapsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or protein domains lack highly populated and uniform secondary and tertiary structure under physiological conditions but fulfill essential biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Since N<sub>TAIL </sub>is intrinsically flexible and is exposed at the surface of the viral nucleocapsid, it interacts with various partners, including the viral P protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and host cell proteins such as the major inducible heat shock protein (Hsp72) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and the yet uncharacterized Nucleoprotein Receptor (NR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, it has also been reported to interact with the Interferon Regulator Factor 3 (IRF-3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>IRF-3 is ubiquitously expressed as a stable latent transactivator of the cellular innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It belongs to the family of interferon regulatory factors (IRF) and acts as a transactivator for the interferon-&#x003b2; (IFN-&#x003b2;) and various pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. All mammalian IRFs share a conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal interferon association domain (IAD). IRF-3 consists of a DBD (aa 1&#x02013;110), of a proline-rich region (PRR, aa 112&#x02013;174), followed by the IAD (aa 175&#x02013;384) and by a serine-rich region (SRR, aa 385&#x02013;427) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A) Schematic representation of the modular organization of IRF-3</bold>. <bold>(B) </bold>Ribbon representation of the crystal structure of IRF-3 RD (pdb code 1QWT) in which the side chains of trp residues are shown in sticks and in dark grey. <bold>(C) </bold>Superimposition between the crystal structure of IRF-3 RD (light grey) and XD (dark grey, pdb code 1OKS).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-6-59-1"/></fig><p>The seminal and unique observation that MeV N activates IRF-3 to induce CCL5 (also called RANTES), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, but not IFN-&#x003b2;, was done by the Hiscott's group ?[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. After MeV infection, IRF-3 was phosphorylated at the key Ser<sup>385 </sup>and Ser<sup>386 </sup>residues, and this form was able to bind to the interferon sensitive response element of ISG15 in complex with CREB binding protein <italic>in vitro</italic>. Activation of IRF-3, which required active MeV transcription, was also mimicked by the transient expression of the N protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Moreover, IRF-3 and a cellular kinase could be co-immunoprecipitated with N [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. From these data it was assumed that MeV N physically interacts with IRF-3 and induces the phosphorylation of the latter by recruiting the kinase. Phosphorylation of IRF-3 would then lead to IRF-3 homo-dimerisation, followed by IRF-3 nuclear import and transactivation of a selective set of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Using deletion constructs and co-immunoprecipitation studies, the IRF-3 binding region was grossly mapped to N<sub>TAIL </sub>(residues 415&#x02013;523), while the N binding region within IRF-3 was mapped to residues 198&#x02013;394 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>We have previously reported that N<sub>TAIL </sub>undergoes &#x003b1;-helical induced folding upon binding to P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and solved the crystal structure of the P domain (XD, aa 459&#x02013;507) responsible for the N<sub>TAIL </sub>induced folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Within a conserved region of N<sub>TAIL </sub>(aa 489&#x02013;506, Box2), we have identified an &#x003b1;-helical molecular recognition element (&#x003b1;-MoRE, aa 489&#x02013;499) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], involved in the binding to XD and in induced folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. XD-induced &#x003b1;-helical folding of the N<sub>TAIL </sub>region encompassing residues 486&#x02013;503 was confirmed by Kingston and co-workers, who solved the crystal structure of a chimeric construct consisting of XD and the 486&#x02013;504 region of N<sub>TAIL </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Analysis of this structure revealed that the &#x003b1;-helix of N<sub>TAIL </sub>is embedded in the hydrophobic cleft of XD delimited by helices &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3, to form a pseudo-four helix arrangement that is very frequently found in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of the crystal structure of the regulatory domain (RD, aa 175&#x02013;427) of IRF-3 (IRF-3 RD, pdb code 1QWT, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) points out the presence of a triple &#x003b1;-helical bundle well superimposable to the structure of XD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Furthermore, the triple &#x003b1;-helical bundle of IRF-3 also accommodates the nuclear co-activator binding domain (or IbiD domain) of CREB (pdb code 1ZOQ, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], data not shown), which forms a disordered molten globule in the absence of a binding partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and that folds into an &#x003b1;-helical structure upon binding to IRF-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that the &#x003b1;-helical bundle of IRF-3 may support the ability of IRF-3 to interact with the disordered N<sub>TAIL </sub>domain in a way reminiscent of that of XD.</p><p>After confirming the reciprocal ability of IRF-3 and N to be co-immunoprecipitated in human cells, we undertook the cloning and the bacterial expression of IRF-3 RD in view of obtaining conspicuous protein amounts suitable for further biochemical and biophysical studies aimed at investigating the molecular mechanisms of the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-IRF-3 interaction. A monomeric form of IRF-3 RD was then purified from the soluble fraction of <italic>E. coli</italic>, and further used in experiments aimed at ascertaining whether N<sub>TAIL </sub>underwent induced folding upon binding to IRF-3. Using a panel of spectroscopic approaches, including circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we failed to document a direct binding of N<sub>TAIL </sub>with IRF-3 RD, under conditions where the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-XD interaction was detected. Moreover, the lack of direct interaction of IRF-3 with the full-length N protein ruled out a possible contribution of the folded N<sub>CORE </sub>domain of N (aa 1&#x02013;400) in the interaction with IRF-3. Strikingly, the interaction could not be detected in the bacterial lysate either, nor was it observed using a yeast two hybrid assay. Altogether these results support the requirement of a specific cellular environment for the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-IRF-3 interaction to occur.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, primers, restriction enzymes and antibodies</title><p>The <italic>E. coli </italic>strains DH5&#x003b1; (Stratagene) or Rosetta [DE3] pLysS (Novagen) were used for selection and amplification of DNA constructs, or for the expression of recombinant proteins, respectively.</p><p>Primers were from Invitrogen and Operon.

This is usually accomplished by cysteine-substitution mutagenesis, followed by covalent modification of the unique sulfydryl group with a selective nitroxide reagent, such as the methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) derivative (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]). Then, EPR spectroscopy is used to monitor variations in the mobility of the spin label in the presence of ligands or protein partners.</p><p>We thus used three spin-labeled N<sub>TAIL </sub>variants, namely S407C, L496C and V517C, which possess a nitroxide spin label covalently grafted at positions 407, 496 and 517, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We then recorded the EPR spectra of these spin-labeled N<sub>TAIL </sub>proteins either alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, solid line) or in the presence of either a four-fold molar excess of IRF-3 RD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, left panel, dotted line) or of a two-fold molar excess of XD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, right panel, dotted line). Experiments were carried out in buffer D, a condition where IRF-3 RD is monomeric. The addition of a two-fold molar excess of XD significantly affects the spectral shape of the spin-labeled L496C and V517C N<sub>TAIL </sub>variants, with strong and moderate effects, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, right panel) (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). Conversely, no significant impact of XD on the mobility of the spin label grafted at position 407 was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, right panel) (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]), in agreement with the well-established lack of involvement of this site in binding to XD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Notably, addition of IRF-3 RD does not trigger any significant variation in the spectral shape in any of the spin-labeled N<sub>TAIL </sub>variants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, left panel), thus supporting lack of involvement of the N<sub>TAIL </sub>regions close to the spin-label in the interaction with IRF-3 RD.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of N<sub>TAIL </sub>structural transitions in the presence of IRF-3 RD by EPR spectroscopy</bold>.

Titration experiments were performed in buffer D, a condition where IRF-3 RD is monomeric. Addition of gradually increasing N<sub>TAIL </sub>concentrations (from 1 nM up to 1 &#x003bc;M) did not trigger any significant variation in the wavelength of emission or in the fluorescence intensity of IRF-3 RD (data not shown), indicating that the chemical environment of the trp residues of IRF-3 RD is not modified in the presence of N<sub>TAIL</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-IRF-3 RD interaction in bacterial lysates</title><p>In order to assess whether the interaction between N<sub>TAIL </sub>and IRF-3 RD required a cellular co-factor possibly occurring in prokaryotic cells, we tested the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-IRF-3 RD interaction in bacterial lysates by using co-immunoprecipitation.

Note that the occurrence of unflagged N<sub>TAIL </sub>in the retained fraction was not due to the ability of IRF-3 RD to co-precipitate the former on the resin, but rather to the lack of a washing step, thus leading to an equal repartition of N<sub>TAIL </sub>in the unretained and retained fractions. These results showed that while the monoclonal anti-flag antibodies co-immunoprecipitated N<sub>TAIL </sub>and purified XD, they failed to co-immunoprecipitate IRF-3 RD and N<sub>TAIL </sub>from bacterial lysates.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Co-immunoprecipitation by an anti-flag mAb</bold>.

Indeed, the protein was shown to exist in either a dimeric or monomeric state depending on the buffer and the ionic strength. Since MeV N was reported to trigger the phosphorylation-dependent dimerization of IRF-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], we reasoned that the dimeric form of this latter might in principle be expected to exhibit a reduced or null ability to interact with N<sub>TAIL</sub>. This hypothesis was indeed experimentally confirmed, where various spectroscopic approaches failed to detect an interaction between N<sub>TAIL </sub>and the dimeric form of IRF-3 RD (data not shown). We therefore searched for conditions where IRF-3 RD was found to be a stable monomer up to protein concentrations as high as 1 mM. We then used the monomeric form of IRF-3 RD for a thorough analysis of its ability to interact with N<sub>TAIL</sub>. Using various spectroscopic approaches, we failed to point out any detectable interaction between IRF-3 RD and N<sub>TAIL </sub>under conditions where this latter interacts with the X domain of the phosphoprotein</p><p>Lack of deviations of the experimentally observed CD spectrum of an N<sub>TAIL</sub>/IRF-3 RD mixture from the average CD spectrum can be accounted for by assuming that either N<sub>TAIL </sub>does not interact with IRF-3 RD under these experimental conditions, or that their interaction does not imply any significant, concomitant structural rearrangement. It should be pointed out that this spectroscopic approach has been already shown to be sensitive enough to unveil &#x003b1;-helical transitions involving as few as 17 N<sub>TAIL </sub>residues out of 125 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] (see also Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). That CD was sensitive enough to detect a possible N<sub>TAIL </sub>folding of the same extent as that observed in the presence of XD, was checked and confirmed by the fact that the experimentally observed CD spectrum of a 1:2 mixture of N<sub>TAIL </sub>and IRF-3 RD significantly deviates from a simulated CD spectrum corresponding to a 1:2 mixture of "folded" N<sub>TAIL </sub>and IRF-3 RD. The CD spectrum of "folded" N<sub>TAIL </sub>was calculated from the CD spectrum of a mixture containing N<sub>TAIL </sub>and XD in the 1:2 molar ratio upon subtraction of the XD contribution (data not shown).</p><p>On the other hand, in CD experiments, inability of IRF-3 RD to interact with N<sub>TAIL </sub>could arise either from possible dimerization of IRF-3 RD in sodium phosphate buffer, with subsequent loss of binding ability, or from the use of protein concentrations below the actual K<sub>D</sub>. Indeed, while the N<sub>TAIL </sub>and XD concentrations (3.5 and 7 &#x003bc;M, respectively) are well above the reported K<sub>D </sub>(100 nM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], the K<sub>D </sub>between N<sub>TAIL </sub>and IRF-3 RD is not known. Hence, the experimentally used N<sub>TAIL </sub>and IRF-3 RD concentrations (1.4 and 2.8 &#x003bc;M, respectively) might be not high enough to allow a productive interaction.</p><p>In order to circumvent these problems, we carried out NMR experiments, which allowed both use of buffer D, a condition where IRF-3 RD was shown to be monomeric, and of protein concentrations as high as 100 &#x003bc;M. Under these conditions, no interaction was detected between IRF-3 RD and either N<sub>TAIL </sub>or the full-length nucleoprotein. Lack of interaction with N ruled out the possibility that IRF-3 RD might interact with N<sub>TAIL </sub>only in the context of a self-assembled nucleocapsid-like structure. Noteworthy, using comparable protein concentrations, heteronuclear NMR has already been proven to be sensitive enough to document the XD-induced folding of N<sub>TAIL</sub>, where from a total of 125 residues, 11 were shown to undergo an &#x003b1;-helical transition and seven a less dramatic conformational change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The N<sub>TAIL</sub>-XD interaction is however characterized by a high affinity, with an estimated K<sub>D </sub>of 100 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We could speculate that if the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-IRF-3 RD binding affinity is much weaker, then this would result in little complex formation, thus escaping detection. However, it should be pointed out that heteronuclear NMR has been already proven to be sensitive enough to document protein-protein interactions characterized by K<sub>D </sub>values up to the mM range (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]). Notably, using protein concentrations similar to those used in this study, heteronuclear NMR successfully unveiled the weak-affinity interaction (K<sub>D </sub>10 &#x003bc;M) between the intrinsically disorder cyclin-dependent inhibitor p21 and Cdk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, if we assume that in HSQC experiments the percentage of the N<sub>TAIL</sub>/IRF-3 RD complex is as low as 10%, which could indeed escape detection, then the corresponding calculated K<sub>D </sub>would be approximately 0.9 mM, based on the following equation</p><p><disp-formula id="bmcM1"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-6-59-i1.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>A K<sub>D </sub>in the mM range would support a fortuitous interaction at best, assuming an IRF-3 intracellular concentration of approximately 1 &#x003bc;M, as calculated assuming an overall intracellular protein concentration of 200 mg/ml and that IRF-3 represents approximately 1/4000 of total cellular proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Using SDSL EPR spectroscopy and a monomeric form of IRF-3 RD, we failed to point out an impact of this latter on the mobility of three spin labels grafted within N<sub>TAIL</sub>. These results support a lack of involvement of the three spin-labeled sites in the interaction and/or a lack of interaction between N<sub>TAIL </sub>and IRF-3 RD. Although this former hypothesis could not be formally ruled out, the spin labels are located within three N<sub>TAIL </sub>regions that can be expected to be involved in the possible interaction with IRF-3 RD, since they are conserved within <italic>Morbillivirus </italic>members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and have been shown to play a functional role in the molecular partnership of N<sub>TAIL</sub>: indeed, Box1 is involved in the interaction with a yet unidentified nucleoprotein cellular receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], while Box2 and Box3 participate to binding to both Hsp72 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and XD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Besides, it is worthy to mention that spin-label EPR spectroscopy has already been proven to be well suited to monitor low-affinity interactions, such as binding of spin-labeled ATP to the multi-drug resistance P-glycoprotein that is characterized by a K<sub>D </sub>of approximately 700 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>Lack of N<sub>TAIL </sub>impact on the intrinsic trp fluorescence of IRF-3 RD could reflect either a lack of interaction between the proteins, or a location of the IRF-3 RD trp residues outside the region of interaction. This latter hypothesis is however unlikely, since the 9 trp residues are scattered on the whole IRF-3 RD surface (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), with two of them being located in the proximity of the triple &#x003b1;-helical bundle that is supposed to correspond to the putative binding site, based on its similarity to the XD structure (see pdb file 1QWT) and on its involvement in the binding of the (otherwise disordered) IBiD domain of CREB (see pdb file 1ZOQ). Taking into account the fact that fluorescence spectroscopy has been already successfully used to monitor the interaction between XD and a single-site tryptophan-substituted N<sub>TAIL </sub>variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and has also been reported to be able to unveil weak affinity interactions with a K<sub>D </sub>in the 20&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;M range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], these data argue for a lack of direct interaction between IRF-3 RD and N<sub>TAIL</sub>.</p><p>Since co-immunoprecipitation experiments carried out by both tenOever <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and ourselves, suggest that N and IRF-3 interact somehow, the hypothesis can be drawn that a specific cellular context is required for the interaction to occur. We therefore questioned whether a bacterial lysate could provide such a context. The interaction was thus tested in crude <italic>E. coli </italic>lysates using a co-immunoprecipitation protocol in which no washing step was carried out, a method derived from the "hold-up" technique that is well adapted for the detection of low-affinity interactions with K<sub>D </sub>values as high as 50 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Notably, and in spite of the fact that the experimental design was in principle expected to allow documentation of low-affinity and kinetically transient complexes, no interaction could be detected. Likewise, using the yeast two-hybrid assay, an approach that has been already successfully used to document MeV protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], no interaction was detected in the yeast cellular context either.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Altogether, the results herein presented indicate that the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-IRF-3 interaction requires a specific eukaryotic cellular environment, such as that provided by 293T cells. That a specific cellular context is required for efficient MeV RNA synthesis has been already reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and argue for the requirement of unknown cellular co-factor(s) in conferring competence for both transcription and replication to viral nucleocapsids. In the case of the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-IRF-3 interaction, the strict dependence from a particular cellular context may reflect the requirement of either a human- or mammalian-specific post-translational modification of one or both interactors, or of a human or mammalian cellular co-factor, which would act as a bridge thereby promoting the N-IRF-3 association. In support of this last hypothesis, intrinsically disordered proteins are known to often display weak affinities towards their partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], thus leading to complexes that are not stable by themselves and must be strengthened by the combination of other interactions or by multimerization (for examples within the replicative complex of MeV see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]). In further support of the requirement for a cellular co-factor, tenOever et al. found that the N protein associated with both IRF-3 and the IRF-3 virus-activated kinase suggesting that both proteins are part of a large complex that favors the colocalization of the kinase and of its substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, as MeV infection (or MeV N transfection) triggers binding of IRF-3 to the CREB binding protein to form a complex that activates target genes in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], it is also possible that recognition of N by IRF-3 could be promoted by the CREB binding protein.</p><p>Preparative co-immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to mass spectrometry are in progress in view of either ascertaining a role for the virus-activated kinase or the CREB binding protein, or identifying a possible cellular co-factor distinct from these two latter cellular proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MCol expressed and purified both unlabeled and <sup>15</sup>N-labeled IRF-3 RD and searched for buffer conditions leading to a monomeric form.
