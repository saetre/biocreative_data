Chromatin insulator or barrier elements are key components of these processes as they can establish boundaries between chromatin states. The ability of elements such as the paradigm <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> HS4 insulator to block the range of enhancers or the spread of repressive histone modifications is well established. Here we have addressed the hypothesis that a barrier element in vertebrates should be capable of defending a gene from silencing by DNA methylation. Using an established stable reporter gene system, we find that HS4 acts specifically to protect a gene promoter from <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. Notably, protection from methylation can occur in the absence of histone acetylation or transcription. There is a division of labor at HS4; the sequences that mediate protection from methylation are separable from those that mediate CTCF-dependent enhancer blocking and USF-dependent histone modification recruitment. The zinc finger protein VEZF1 was purified as the factor that specifically interacts with the methylation protection elements. VEZF1 is a candidate CpG island protection factor as the G-rich sequences bound by VEZF1 are frequently found at CpG island promoters. Indeed, we show that VEZF1 elements are sufficient to mediate demethylation and protection of the <italic>APRT</italic> CpG island promoter from DNA methylation. We propose that many barrier elements in vertebrates will prevent DNA methylation in addition to blocking the propagation of repressive histone modifications, as either process is sufficient to direct the establishment of an epigenetically stable silent chromatin state.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>DNA sequences known as chromatin insulator or barrier elements are considered key components of genome organization as they can establish boundaries between transcriptionally permissive and repressive chromatin domains.

The dogma established from previous studies posits that a barrier element like HS4 acts as a passive barrier to the propagation, or spreading, of chromosomal silencing. We therefore expect that when HS4 mutations compromise barrier activity, the mutant insualtors would become methylated either prior to, or coincident with, the transgene promoters they are shielding.

Analyses were made following 30 days of culture, typically the period at which epigenetic silencing of the transgene is being established in non-insulated lines, and after 90 days, at which point any silencing will be complete. We find that wild type HS4 elements remain unmethylated during long term culture, concordant with the lack of transgene methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, WT).

This is in line with the effects of these mutations on promoter methylation. The timing of methylation does not fit the spreading models however, as the transgene promoter becomes methylated prior to the flanking insulator (compare &#x00394;I at day 30 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g002">Figure 2B</xref> with that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

However, we observe that promoters become methylated prior to the insulators, which remain unmethylated or become partially methylated. The observed independence of methylation states between insulator and promoter argue against spreading and clearly show that there can be no single mechanism that controls the methylation state of both the insulator and promoter. It remains possible that VEZF1 elements at HS4 are acting as a barrier to the spreading of a DNA methylation mechanism, but that additional processes prevent the accumulation of methylation at HS4 itself. An alternative possibility is that DNA methylation does not result from spreading, and that the insulator directly interacts with the promoter to deliver VEZF1 co-factors that prevent promoter methylation. In this model, the promoter itself would have its own program to recruit <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, and VEZF1 would act as a factor that mediates inhibition of methylation. This would distinguish the activity of VEZF1 from those of USF1/USF2, which bind elsewhere in the insulator element and recruit a number of enzymes that deliver active histone modifications to the reporter gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-West3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Huang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000804-Huang2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consistent with this, we found that wild type transgenic HS4 elements remain unmethylated during long term culture. The processes that maintain the unmethylated state of the insulator appear to be complex, as we find that the mutation of all insulator protein binding sites results in some degree of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation of HS4.

These findings argue against a simple steric protection of HS4 DNA from DNMTs by transcription factor binding. The degree of methylation at mutant HS4 elements was typically moderate (20&#x02013;50&#x00025;) and did not increase to the near total methylation seen at the transgene promoter (90&#x02013;100&#x00025;) following long term culture.

CpG methylation of wild type (WT) or mutant (&#x00394;I - &#x00394;V) HS4 insulators after 30 or 90 days of culture. Both copies of HS4 were sequenced, except for &#x00394;II and &#x00394;V, where only the outermost copy was sequenced (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The scoring of individual CpG bases from each clone subject to bisulfite sequencing is shown. Methylated bases are marked as &#x02018;1&#x02019; and shaded blue. Average CpG methylation values are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000804-g003">Figure 3</xref>.
