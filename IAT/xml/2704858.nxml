Average sequence identity is around 60&#x02013;70&#x00025; in each sub-family and 20&#x00025; between the two. The sequence alignments of AcrB and CusA illustrate the divergence between the two sub-families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g001">fig. 1A</xref>). Moreover, the differences and similarities between CusA and AcrB are highlighted on the structure of AcrB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g001">fig. 1B&#x02013;C</xref>). These two panels reveal that the inner core of the transporters is the most conserved part and this is particularly true for the transmembrane domain. The RND signature, located in the fourth transmembrane helix and comprising several acidic aminocids around residue 400, is almost conserved between the HME and HAE sub-families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g001">Figure 1A and 1C</xref>).

In contrast with the RND signature, the residues implicated in ligand binding for AcrB and copper resistance for CusA are located in different sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g001">fig. 1</xref>).

The authors compared CusA and AcrB by analytical ultracentrifugation and infra-red spectroscopy. The oligomeric state of CusA and AcrB in dodecyl-&#x003b2;-D-maltopyranoside (C<sub>12</sub>M) appeared pretty similar. Stroebel <italic>et al.</italic> also observed that CusA, contrary to AcrB, retains some lipids after purification in C<sub>12</sub>M. In the present study, crystallogenesis and flexibility of these proteins were compared. Preparation of a rigid form, <italic>i.e.</italic> a specifically locked conformation, is a prerequisite for protein crystallisation. Indeed, compact proteins are well-defined three-dimensional objects, and therefore favour protein-protein contacts necessary for crystallisation. Limited proteolysis is a common tool to identify flexible loops in proteins that could prevent appropriate crystal packing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Lemieux1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-NievesAlicea1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, or to determine conditions to obtain a rigid form of the protein. A completely opposite behaviour between AcrB and CusA in terms of conformational states explored was clearly observed. Thus, AcrB has a very rigid core while CusA seems highly flexible. We describe a strategy to prepare the HME-RND protein, CusA, with a flexibility reduced by the addition of heavy metal cations. We propose that this might open the way towards CusA crystallisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>AcrB, CusA crystallisation</title><p>AcrB in C<sub>12</sub>M crystallised in 5&#x00025; of the initial 1200 conditions of commercial and membrane protein optimised home-made screens tested (a few examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g002">fig. 2A</xref>), while no crystals could be detected for CusA in the same detergent.

Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> prevented the chymotrypsinolysis of the full-length protein for at least 2 h to 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g004">fig. 4B</xref>). Moreover, Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was the only cation able to prevent trypsinolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g004">fig. 4B</xref>). The Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> effect was also demonstrated for CusA solubilized in C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> and C<sub>12</sub>DAO (not shown).

These numbers reflect the difficulty to crystallise and solve the structure of a membrane protein. In fact, one major point arises from the low stability of membrane proteins in solution, <italic>i.e.</italic> extracted from their natural lipid bilayer.</p><p>Limited proteolysis has been widely used to assess the presence of flexible loops in soluble proteins, and therefore to identify specific domains suitable for crystallisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-NievesAlicea1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, several membrane protein structures have been obtained thanks to sequence optimisation using this method. For instance, deletion of only 4 residues of Glycerol-3-phosphate transporter resulted in better ordered-crystals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Lemieux1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and insertion of lysozyme sequence to a flexible loop of &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptor allowed stabilisation and crystallisation of this G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Rosenbaum1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Limited proteolysis was described in the present work as a useful and simple method to assess the presence of flexible elements in a membrane protein in solution, in order to either directly crystallise it, identify a crystallisable-core region or screen for stabilising conditions.</p><p>Regarding the strong efforts made by many laboratories to solve the structure of other proteins of the RND family, we carried on the comparison between AcrB and CusA behaviours. Some differences have been previously pointed out by Stroebel et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Stroebel1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The present study extensively used limited proteolysis to go further in the comparison and find out new clues to favour crystallisation of RND proteins.</p><p>Over 25 AcrB structures have been deposited in the PDB, demonstrating the ability of this protein to crystallise. In the present study, AcrB crystallised in 5&#x00025; of the tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g002">fig. 2A</xref>) and AcrB crystallogenesis seems very robust. For instance, AcrB still crystallised at concentrations of C<sub>12</sub>M a hundred times higher than in the classical condition. Limited proteolysis assays demonstrated that AcrB has a very rigid core. This probably explains its capacity to crystallise. Indeed, rigidity is often required to obtain well-diffracting crystals. On the other hand, CusA did not crystallise in C<sub>12</sub>M, the most frequently used detergent in crystallisation. CusA in C<sub>12</sub>M is also highly dynamic, explaining why AcrB and CusA have opposite crystallisation behaviours and diverging proteolytic profiles that cannot be explained by a higher cleavage site number in CusA sequence.</p><p>If well-defined detergents are routinely used for crystallisation, novel surfactants have been developed to circumvent this stability problem. Amongst these compounds, amphipols or fluorinated surfactants have proved their efficiency on different membrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin, cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> or GPCRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Breyton1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Lebaupain1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Pocanschi1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, so far these compounds have only led to crystals unsuitable for structure resolution. Several recent membrane protein crystallisation successes have been obtained by detergent screening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Lemieux1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Screpanti1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, fourteen different detergents were tested on CusA but crystals were only obtained with C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g002">fig. 2C</xref>). However, their diffraction corresponded most likely to detergent crystals.</p><p>Although limited proteolysis experiments showed that CusA presents an important number of flexible elements and that the identification of a rigid domain is difficult, trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion in the presence of C<sub>12</sub>M led to 30 to 40 kDa CusA fragments starting around residues 280 and 610 as identified by N-terminal sequencing. However, the complexity of the proteolysis mixture in C<sub>12</sub>M greatly complicates the precise identification of each fragment, and the only clear accessible region in different surfactants is located around residue 610. Among all the surfactants that were screened, the best results have been obtained in C<sub>8</sub>FTac<sub>5</sub> (and amphipol in a lower extent). This surfactant significantly stabilised the 65 kDa CusA fragments released by proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g004">fig. 4A</xref>), which correspond to two major products, CusA 1&#x02013;606 and CusA 1&#x02013;610 (fragments released represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g005">fig. 5</xref>). Although the 600&#x02013;610 CusA region seems particularly flexible, the localisation of these residues on the AcrB structure based on sequence alignment did not highlight a long flexible loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g001">fig. 1</xref>). However, the accessibility of this site by the protease is possible from the periplasmic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g001">fig. 1C</xref>), which is facilitated by CusA low compacity compared to AcrB. Moreover, it is interesting to notice that, by homology with the AcrB structure, the 65 kDa CusA fragments form the inner compact core of the structure (excepting two helices), which corresponds to the whole trimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g005">fig. 5</xref>). However it is difficult to speculate about the biological relevance of the structure of this CusA-truncated form and solving its structure would be questionable.</p><p>The present study completes the work performed by Stroebel <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Stroebel1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and therefore allows a more detailed understanding of the behaviour differences between AcrB and CusA. Stroebel <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Stroebel1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> proposed that high C<sub>12</sub>M and lipids present in CusA preparation prevented its crystallisation. In the light of the present study, this last point seems negligible to explain CusA non-crystallisation. Our results clearly show that CusA high flexibility appears as a crucial drawback for crystallisation. Thus, defining a locked-form or -construct of CusA could constitute a first step towards its crystallisation.</p><p>Addition of substrates or inhibitors that locked the protein conformation has been successful in some cases. For instance, the crystallisation of the bacterial Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-transporter Yiip was tested in the presence of several heavy metal cations and sufficiently ordered crystals were obtained only in the presence of 5 mM Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Lu1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, the best way to favour CusA crystallisation was the addition of its transported substrates or analogs. Indeed, the number of CusA flexible elements was strongly decreased in the presence of different cations: Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g004">fig. 4B</xref>), that probably act by stabilizing the three-dimensional structure of the protein. This effect was due to specific binding of these divalent cations to CusA, as confirmed by SPR measurements and by IMAC retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006214-g004">fig. 4D</xref>). pH drop had no effect on CusA binding to Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, confirming that the interaction is not mediated by histidine but rather by methionine as it has been previously proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Franke1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These experiments were also the first demonstration of <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of heavy metal cations to CusA. Moreover, it is interesting to notice that similar observations have been made with CzcA, another HME-RND <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Goldberg1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. CzcA appears reluctant to crystallization and highly dynamic in C<sub>12</sub>M, but Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, its preferred substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006214-Goldberg1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, stabilises the structure of the protein.</p><p>As Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> had the strongest protective effect on CusA proteolysis, crystallisation assays were run in the presence of zinc. This ion had an effect on CusA in C<sub>12</sub>M, C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> and C<sub>12</sub>DAO. Crystallisation assays with increasing Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>concentration were tested to corroborate the decrease of proteolysis with the capacity to crystallise. CusA crystallisation trials in C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> gave the most interesting hits. Granules were observed, comparable to those obtained with AcrB near crystallisation conditions. The presence of these crystalline objects was correlated with the increase of Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and showed that the higher the concentration of zinc, the better and more angular these CusA objects. The more angular objects, obtained in the presence of 1 to 5 mM Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, diffracted with spots on rings at low resolution. This can be considered as the first step towards highly ordered three-dimensional crystals of CusA.</p><p>In summary, comparison between AcrB and CusA strongly supports the fact that the high flexibility of CusA in C<sub>12</sub>M hampers its crystallisation. The most interesting clue to obtain a crystallisable-form of CusA is certainly the addition of heavy metal cations, especially Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, which allowed the appearance of the first CusA crystalline objects. The limited proteolysis method described here could certainly be considered for many other membrane proteins, in order to engineer the protein, by removing flexible loops, or to assess the stabilising effect of additives, amphiphile or ligand, to favour the protein crystallisation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Protein purification</title><p>AcrB overexpression vector was kindly provided by KM Pos.
