In addition, nitric oxide assays and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunoblot analyses revealed a strong correlation between iNOS activity and clearance of <italic>B. mallei</italic> from RAW 264.7 cells.

This zoonotic pathogen is an obligate animal parasite that is primarily responsible for disease in solipeds and occasionally other mammals, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Howe and Miller, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Redfearn <italic>et al</italic>., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Yabuuchi <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Srinivasan <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). In regions where glanders remains endemic, chronically infected horses are the only known reservoir of this bacterial pathogen. Human infections, although rare, are thought to be acquired via the inoculation of mucocutaneous tissues with aerosols or secretions from diseased animals. The clinical progression of human glanders is similar to that observed in solipeds and may manifest as chronic or acute localized infections, acute pulmonary infections or fulminating septicemias. In the absence of chemotherapeutic intervention, glanders is invariably fatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Wilkinson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dance, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bartlett, 2005</xref>). Because of this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently list <italic>B. mallei</italic> as a category B biothreat agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Rotz <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that <italic>B. mallei</italic> expresses a number of important virulence determinants that are required for survival in various animal models of infection. Included among these are a capsular polysaccharide, the Bsa type III secretion system (T3SS), a type VI secretion system and the VirAG two-component gene regulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">DeShazer <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Nierman <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Ulrich and DeShazer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Schell <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Recently, studies have demonstrated that the T3SS expressed by this organism is important for survival within J774.2 murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Ribot and Ulrich, 2006</xref>). Consistent with these findings, it has been shown that <italic>B. mallei</italic> utilizes this T3SS in order to facilitate early vacuolar escape following internalization by the macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Ribot and Ulrich, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, it also appears that the T3SS is necessary for intra- and intercellular actin-based motility, presumably by facilitating the ability of <italic>B. mallei</italic> to access intracellular pools of actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Stevens <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Ribot and Ulrich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Schell <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). At present, however, little else is known about the molecular mechanisms utilized by this organism to persist within phagocytic cells or to evade specific host defence responses.</p><p>Macrophages play an integral role in the development of innate and adaptive immune responses against bacterial pathogens. Following stimulation of macrophages by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) signalling culminates in the induction of a variety of bactericidal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barton and Medzhitov, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Miggin and O'Neill, 2006</xref>). Two of the most potent mechanisms utilized by activated macrophages to kill bacteria involve the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Coleman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Vazquez-Torres and Fang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fang, 2004</xref>). Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is responsible for generating high levels of nitric oxide (NO) in activated macrophages. In biological systems, RNOS are then formed by the rapid oxidation of NO to reactive species such as nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen trioxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">MacMicking <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Coleman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fang, 2004</xref>). Under conditions favouring the production of high concentrations of both NO and superoxide anion, the highly reactive peroxynitrite anion is also generated. In activated macrophages, RNOS play an important role in the clearance of intracellular bacteria due to their cytotoxic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">MacMicking <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Coleman, 2001</xref>). At low concentrations, RNOS are unstable and rapidly nitrosate amines and thiols, whereas at higher concentrations, they induce lipid peroxidation as well as nitrosate iron-/sulfur-containing reactive centres, nucleic acids and tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Coleman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fang, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Many intracellular bacteria have developed mechanisms to avoid killing by phagocytic cells. Some of these include the ability to prevent phagosomal maturation, phagosomal lysis, phagosomal acidification, and inhibition of the respiratory burst, as well as the production of detoxifiers that can counteract the bactericidal effects of ROS and RNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Collins and Kaufmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fang, 2004</xref>). Recently, studies have demonstrated that, following uptake by a variety of murine macrophage cell lines, <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> and <italic>B. cepacia</italic> were poor activators of iNOS expression and NO production respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Saini <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Utaisincharoen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Based upon these observations, it has been proposed that these organisms may be capable of interfering with RNOS responses in order to promote their survival within phagocytic cells. To date, few studies have examined the survival characteristics of <italic>B. mallei</italic> within phagocytic cells. In the present study, we utilized a combination of cellular, immunological and biochemical approaches to investigate the interactions of this organism with RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. In addition, we assessed the importance of iNOS activity with regard to these interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Influence of multiplicity of infection (moi) on <italic>B. mallei</italic> interactions with RAW 264.7 cells</title><p>Previous studies have shown that a number of pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species, including <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> and <italic>B. cenocepacia</italic>, are able to survive and replicate within RAW 264.7 murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Jones <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Miyagi <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Utaisincharoen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Lamothe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).

To exclude the possibility that our inability to recover <italic>B. mallei</italic> from infected RAW 264.7 cells at an moi of 10 was due to monolayer destruction, fixed cells were examined using light and confocal microscopy at 24 h post infection.

Previous reports have shown that <italic>B. mallei</italic> is able to survive and replicate within J774.2 macrophages and that these phenotypes are dependent upon the expression of the Bsa T3SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Ribot and Ulrich, 2006</xref>). In the present study, we characterized the interactions of <italic>B. mallei</italic> with RAW 264.7 murine macrophages and demonstrated that moi significantly affected the outcome of these events. Utilizing modified kanamycin-protection assays, initial studies demonstrated that <italic>B. mallei</italic> was internalized in an moi-dependent fashion. However, it appeared that the uptake levels for this organism were significantly lower (10- to 100-fold) than those typically observed in our laboratory for <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> as well as those previously described for <italic>B. cenocepacia</italic> (P.J. Brett and F.C. Gherardini, unpublished; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Lamothe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). At present, the reason for this phenomenon remains unclear. Recent findings in our laboratory, however, suggest that flagella may play an important role in the uptake of pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species by RAW 264.7 cells. In particular, <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> motility mutants have been shown to exhibit reduced uptake in comparison to parental strains (P.J. Brett and F.C. Gherardini, unpublished). Consistent with these observations, studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Inglis <italic>et al</italic>. (2003)</xref> have also demonstrated that the flagellar apparatus expressed by <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> assists entry into <italic>Acanthamoeba astronyxis</italic> trophozoites.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that several pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species are able to persist in a variety of human and murine cell types, and that significant cellular abnormalities are often observed upon infection with these organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Jones <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Miyagi <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Harley <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Saini <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kespichayawattana <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Utaisincharoen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Lamothe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> and <italic>B. mallei</italic>, for instance, have been shown to cause MNGC formation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Duval and White, 1907</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Harley <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kespichayawattana <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). This unique phenomenon is thought to be due in part to the actin-based intra- and intercellular motility phenotypes displayed by these pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Harley <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kespichayawattana <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Stevens <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Breitbach <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). <italic>B. cenocepacia</italic>, in addition, is known to persist within phagocytic vacuoles and cause a variety of morphological changes in RAW 264.7 cells, including rounding, filamentation and the development of highly dense cytoplasms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Saini <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Lamothe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In the present study, <italic>B. mallei</italic> was shown to survive and replicate in RAW 264.7 cells only when infected at moi of 0.1 and 1, but not at an moi of 10. As demonstrated by light microscopy and cytotoxicity assays, these results could not simply be explained by macrophage destruction because the monolayers infected at the moi of 10 were seemingly healthy and intact. Based upon these findings, it appears that, in comparison with other pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species, <italic>B. mallei</italic> demonstrates rather unique survival characteristics in RAW 264.7 cells. Studies are ongoing to determine whether or not this clearance phenotype is specific to RAW 264.7 cells.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that <italic>B. mallei</italic> is a relatively weak activator of RAW 264.7 cells in comparison with <italic>E. coli</italic> controls. Results indicated that on an moi basis, 10- to 100-fold more <italic>B. mallei</italic> than <italic>E. coli</italic> were required to stimulate infected monolayers to produce similar levels of cytokines and chemokines. At present the reasons for these findings are unclear. Studies in our laboratory, however, indicate that this may be an LPS-related phenomenon. Recently, we demonstrated that <italic>B. mallei</italic> expresses complex mixture of tetra- and penta-acylated lipid A species that are similar in structure to those expressed by other pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">De Soyza <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Silipo <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Brett <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In addition, we demonstrated that <italic>B. mallei</italic> LPS was a potent activator of human TLR4 complexes and stimulated THP-1 cells, U937 cells as well as human monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells to produce high levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and RANTES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Brett <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, preliminary studies in our laboratory suggest that <italic>B. mallei</italic> LPS, like <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> LPS, is a less potent activator of RAW 264.7 cells than <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS (P.J. Brett and F.C. Gherardini, unpublished; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Utaisincharoen <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). To what extent LPS influences the ability of <italic>B. mallei</italic> to stimulate RAW 264.7 cells remains to be experimentally defined. In addition, studies are ongoing to determine why RAW 264.7 cells appear to be less responsive to <italic>B. mallei</italic> LPS than human tissue cell lines and primary phagocytic cells.</p><p>Interferons are pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in both innate and acquired immune responses. One of the most important functions of these cytokines appears to be the sensitization of macrophages to PAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Takaoka and Yanai, 2006</xref>). Additionally, both type I (IFN-&#x003b2;) and type II (IFN-&#x003b3;) interferons are known to enhance iNOS expression by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Boehm <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">MacMicking <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Rottenberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Previous studies have shown that many pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species are rapidly killed by IFN-&#x003b3;-activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Miyagi <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Utaisincharoen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). The molecular mechanism(s) by which these organisms are cleared, however, appear to greatly depend upon the lineage of the macrophage. Reports by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Miyagi <italic>et al</italic>. (1997)</xref> have demonstrated that J774.1 murine macrophage-like cells can be activated with IFN-&#x003b3; to clear intracellular <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> and that optimal killing by these cells appeared to rely upon the presence of both ROS and RNOS. Similarly, studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Utaisincharoen <italic>et al</italic>. (2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">2004</xref>) have shown that <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> can be cleared by IFN-&#x003b3;-activated RAW 264.7 cells and that iNOS activity is important for bacterial killing. However, recent studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Breitbach <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref> have demonstrated that IFN-&#x003b3;-activated C57BL/6 bone marrow-derived macrophages are capable of killing <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> in an iNOS-independent manner. Based upon these findings, it appears likely that pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species may be cleared from activated macrophages via both RNOS-dependent and RNOS-independent mechanisms.</p><p>IFN-&#x003b2; is a dominant factor in the shaping of innate and adaptive immune responses. Soon after activation, IFN-&#x003b2; produced by macrophages mediates target gene expression via the activation of JAK-STAT signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Theofilopoulos <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Importantly, IFN-&#x003b2; has been shown to be a necessary component of signalling processes leading to the induction of iNOS gene expression in murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Jacobs and Ignarro, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Thomas <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated that clearance of <italic>B. mallei</italic> by activated RAW 264.7 cells strongly correlated with both IFN-&#x003b2; production and iNOS activity. In addition, time-course assays demonstrated that the kinetics of <italic>B. mallei</italic> killing by activated RAW 264.7 cells correlated directly with the kinetics of NO production. These results, in combination with those obtained from the AG inhibition assays, suggested a critical role for iNOS activity and RNOS production in clearance of <italic>B. mallei</italic> from activated RAW 264.7 cells. At present, whether or not RNOS produced by activated RAW 264.7 cells function synergistically with other macrophage effector species (i.e. ROS) to clear <italic>B. mallei</italic> remains to be defined. It also remains to be determined why infection of RAW 264.7 cells with <italic>B. mallei</italic> resulted in high levels of iNOS expression/activity compared with other pathogenic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Saini <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Utaisincharoen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">2004</xref>).</p><p>Toll-like receptors are a family of PRRs that are important in the development of both innate and adaptive immune responses. All TLRs activate a common signalling pathway that results in the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B transcription factors, mitogen-activated protein kinases, p38 and JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barton and Medzhitov, 2003</xref>). TLRs are activated in response to a variety of PAMPs expressed by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. Following recognition of PAMPs, a cascade of intracellular signalling events is activated, which results in the stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Miggin and O'Neill, 2006</xref>). Additionally, production of type I interferons may be induced via the stimulation of a number of TLRs, including TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Miggin and O'Neill, 2006</xref>). Mounting evidence suggests that TLR agonists have significant potential in the treatment of a number of disease conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Pandey and Agrawal, 2006</xref>).

In addition, it was shown that clearance of <italic>B. mallei</italic> from infected RAW 264.7 cells correlated strongly with iNOS activity, supporting the prediction that RNOS are important for killing this organism.
