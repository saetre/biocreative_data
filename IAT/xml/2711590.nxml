Interestingly, <italic>Bub1</italic> mutations are found in cancer tissues and cancer cell lines. Using an isogenic RNA interference complementation system in transformed HeLa cells and untransformed RPE1 cells, we investigate the effect of structural Bub1 mutants on chromosome segregation. We demonstrate that Bub1 regulates mitosis through the same mechanisms in both cell lines, suggesting a common regulatory network. Surprisingly, Bub1 can regulate chromosome segregation in a kinetochore-independent manner, albeit at lower efficiency. Its kinase activity is crucial for chromosome alignment but plays only a minor role in spindle checkpoint signaling. We also identify a novel conserved motif within Bub1 (amino acids 458&#x02013;476) that is essential for spindle checkpoint signaling but does not regulate chromosome alignment, and we show that several cancer-related Bub1 mutants impair chromosome segregation, suggesting a possible link to tumorigenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosome segregation is controlled by the mitotic spindle, which attaches sister chromatids via kinetochores, which are multiprotein complexes located on centromeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>). Correct chromosome segregation requires that kinetochore pairs bind to microtubules (MTs) emanating from opposite spindle poles in a bipolar manner and that they control the forces that align the chromosomes on a metaphase plate. Kinetochores also monitor bipolar MT attachment and control mitotic progression through the spindle checkpoint, which arrests cells before anaphase by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex in the presence of incorrectly attached chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The spindle checkpoint requires the conserved proteins Mad1, Mad2, Bub1, Bub3, Mad3/BubR1, and Mps1, which accumulate on unattached kinetochores during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). The protein kinase Bub1 is not only essential for the spindle checkpoint, it is also required for correct kinetochore&#x02013;MT attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). Bub1 loss delays the formation of stable end-on attachments, causing an accumulation of lateral kinetochore&#x02013;MT attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gillett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meraldi and Sorger, 2005</xref>). The two functions of Bub1 are conserved, as its inactivation causes loss of spindle checkpoint and severe chromosome segregation defects in all tested eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernard et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meraldi and Sorger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perera et al., 2007</xref>). Studies in yeast and vertebrates have identified several downstream targets that require Bub1 for kinetochore binding, including Mad1, Mad2, and BubR1, the MT&#x02013;depolymerase mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK), and the outer kinetochore protein, centromere protein F (CENP-F; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharp-Baker and Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meraldi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyarchuk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyomitsu et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, Bub1 regulates the targeting of cohesion protein Sgo1 (shugoshin) to the centromere through PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kitajima et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Bub1 deregulation is also linked to apoptosis and tumorigenesis. Reduction of Bub1 levels can lead to tumorigenesis, senescence, and p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gjoerup et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeganathan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Niikura et al., 2007</xref>), whereas a <italic>Bub1</italic> knockout causes early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perera et al., 2007</xref>). Primary <italic>Bub1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts lack a functional spindle checkpoint, show aberrant chromosome segregation, and fail to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perera et al., 2007</xref>). In humans, aberrant <italic>Bub1 g</italic>ene expression is detected in esophageal, gastric, and colon tumors, melanoma, and breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shigeishi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shichiri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doak et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, point mutations and deletions were found in leukemia, lymphoma, and thyroid cancer as well as colon and lung cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cahill et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohshima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ru et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shichiri et al., 2002</xref>). However, the functional consequence of these mutations is unknown.</p><p>Bub1 contains several domains, including an N-terminal domain, which binds to the kinetochore protein KNL1/Blinkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyomitsu et al., 2007</xref>), a Bub3-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>), and a C-terminal kinase domain. The role of these domains and interactions has been studied in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, revealing conserved features of ScBub1 and SpBub1 but also species-dependent differences: Bub3 is essential for Bub1 function in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> but dispensable for checkpoint control in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, implying that SpBub1 regulates the spindle checkpoint without SpBub3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roberts et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tange and Niwa, 2008</xref>). The role of the kinase domain is also different; in both yeasts, it regulates kinetochore&#x02013;MT attachment, but inactivation of the kinase does not perturb the checkpoint in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, although partially compromising the checkpoint in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamaguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernius and Hardwick, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Given these phenotypical variations in fungal systems, the role of the Bub1 domains and of its interaction partners remains unclear or has been studied only in a punctual manner in human cells. It has been reported that, in contrast to yeast, the kinase domain is required for the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2008</xref>) and that the KNL1-binding domain is important for chromosome congression, raising the question as to which extent the functions are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vanoosthuyse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyomitsu et al., 2007</xref>). An equally important question, which could not be studied in yeast, is whether cancer-related Bub1 mutations impair chromosome segregation. Until now, the lack of robust genetic tools prevented the analysis of multiple human Bub1 mutants. We therefore established a genetic system in human cells, i.e., expressing stable <italic>Bub1</italic> mutants in an isogenic RNAi complementation system, and combined it with a cell biological analysis. Our results indicate that Bub1 can regulate chromosome segregation in a kinetochore-independent manner; we identify a novel conserved motif, which is essential for spindle checkpoint signaling, and we demonstrate that the kinase activity is essential for chromosome alignment but not for the spindle checkpoint. Finally, we find that cancer-related Bub1 mutations deregulate chromosome segregation, suggesting a functional link to tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Construction of HeLa Flp-In cell lines</title><p>To investigate how human Bub1 regulates chromosome segregation at the molecular level, we generated a <italic>Bub1</italic> RNAi complementation system based on stable cell lines expressing different <italic>Bub1</italic> mutants. This system is built on the integration of a single Flp recombination target (FRT) site into the genome and the subsequent integration of <italic>Bub1</italic> expression constructs via Flp-mediated intermolecular DNA recombination. This guarantees that phenotypical differences observed in different <italic>Bub1</italic> mutant cell lines are not a result of the varying genetic background of the integration site. Moreover, all stable cell lines express RNAi-resistant <italic>Bub1</italic> mutants, allowing the exclusive depletion of endogenous Bub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Integration of the FRT site into the genome of HeLa cells does not affect the <italic>Bub1</italic> RNAi phenotype.</bold> (A) Schematic diagram illustrating the generation of stable Flp-In and Bub1 mutant cell lines.

Immunoblotting with Bub1 antibodies showed that <italic>Bub1</italic> RNAi depleted Bub1, and quantification by immunofluorescence indicated that Bub1 protein levels at kinetochores were reduced to 3% when compared with control-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D&#x02013;F</xref>). To test for spindle checkpoint abrogation, cells were treated for 16 h with the MT-depolymerizing drug nocodazole, which abrogates kinetochore&#x02212;MT attachment, resulting in spindle checkpoint&#x02013;dependent mitotic arrest and a strong enrichment of Mad1, Mad2, and BubR1 at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoffman et al., 2001</xref>). Depletion of Bub1 in HeLa Flp-In cells abrogated both the mitotic arrest, as visualized by phase-contrast microscopy, and the recruitment of Mad1, Mad2, and BubR1 to kinetochores, as quantified by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, G and H</xref>). We next measured whether Bub1 depletion also impaired chromosome congression. We treated our cells for 1 h with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which arrests cells in metaphase in a spindle checkpoint&#x02013;independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rock et al., 1994</xref>), fixed, and stained them for DNA, kinetochores, and the mitotic spindle. We identified cells with a metaphase plate, indicative of a metaphase arrest, and quantified the percentage of cells with unaligned chromosomes (chromosomes were counted as unaligned when located outside of the central 30% of the mitotic spindle). Consistent with previous studies, Bub1 depletion strongly increased the percentage of HeLa Flp-In cells with uncongressed chromosomes when compared with control depletion (55 vs. 16%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meraldi and Sorger, 2005</xref>) but did not affect chromosome cohesion (not depicted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perera et al., 2007</xref>).

Bub1</italic> RNAi abolished expression of the <italic>Bub1</italic> 3&#x02032; UTR in both cell lines when compared with control RNAi&#x02013;treated cells, confirming the degradation of endogenous <italic>Bub1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). <italic>Bub1</italic> RNAi also abolished expression of total <italic>Bub1</italic> in Flp-In cells but only reduced total <italic>Bub1</italic> mRNA levels in Bub1-wt cells, indicating the presence of an RNAi-resistant exogenous <italic>Bub1-wt</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

HeLa Flp-In cells treated with <italic>Bub1</italic> RNAi did not arrest in mitosis when treated with nocodazole (mitotic index of 15%), whereas control-depleted cells had a high mitotic index (48%). In contrast, both control- and <italic>Bub1</italic>-depleted Bub1-wt cells arrested in mitosis after a nocodazole treatment (39 vs. 58%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Identical results were obtained with an untagged Bub1-wt, indicating that the weaker spindle checkpoint response was not a consequence of the C-terminal Flag-EGFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). As Bub1 depletion also induces mitotic cell death, we used a TUNEL assay to quantify the extent to which a nocodazole treatment induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeganathan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Niikura et al., 2007</xref>). Although <italic>Bub1</italic> siRNA treatment increased the number of TUNEL-positive Flp-In cells (9 vs. 2% in control-depleted cells), stable expression of Bub1-wt with or without tag suppressed apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902128/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>).

This indicated that Bub1-wt complements <italic>Bub1</italic> RNAi in terms of spindle checkpoint and apoptosis.</p><p>To test whether Bub1-wt also rescued chromosome congression, we first detected the amount of uncongressed chromosomes in the MG132 assay and found that <italic>Bub1</italic> RNAi did not increase the proportion of cells with unaligned chromosomes in Bub1-wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>). Second, we monitored chromosome congression by live cell imaging using the H2B-mRED signal. The time point of nuclear breakdown was set at t = 0, and the time until all chromosomes congressed on a metaphase plate was recorded. <italic>Bub1</italic> RNAi did not affect chromosome congression in Bub1-wt cells compared with control RNAi&#x02013;treated cells, as 50% of the cells aligned all their chromosomes after 17 min in both depletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>). In contrast, in Flp-In HeLa cells, Bub1 depletion caused a severe delay of congression (after 8 h, only 36% of the cells had aligned all their chromosomes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>). This indicated that Bub1-wt also complemented <italic>Bub1</italic> RNAi in terms of chromosome congression. Overall, we conclude that we have established a system that allows the functional comparison of Bub1 mutants. We further note that exogenous Bub1 is expressed at roughly 70% of endogenous Bub1 and that it complements the spindle checkpoint only to 80%, suggesting that we are working with a sensitized system.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential effects of Bub1 mutants on spindle checkpoint and chromosome congression</title><p>Alignments of fungal and vertebrate Bub1 sequences reveal several conserved domains, including two previously uncharacterized, conserved motifs.

Thus, we conclude that Bub1-Y259C fails to rescue the spindle checkpoint as the result of a deficient recruitment of Mad2 and BubR1 to kinetochores. Expression of Bub1-Y259C also rescued the ability of kinetochores to bind Sgo1 and CENP-F but not MCAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Interestingly, Bub1-Y259C was, apart from the null mutants Bub1-&#x00394;Bub3&#x02013;binding domain and Bub1-DN, the only Bub1 mutant that did not rescue MCAK localization. This suggests that this region of Bub1 must be critical for MCAK regulation and indicates that Bub1 does not regulate chromosome alignment through MCAK. Given the proximity of the Y259C mutation to the Bub3-binding domain, we further tested the ability of Bub1-Y259C and other Bub1 mutants to bind to Bub3 in an in vitro assay. Our analysis revealed that all mutants except the &#x00394;Bub3-binding domain and Bub1-DN bind to Bub3 even though the binding of Bub1-Y259C was reduced compared with Bub1-wt (Fig. S2, D and E). However, this was also the case for catalytically inactive Bub1 mutants, which do not have strong spindle checkpoint defects and still load MCAK, indicating that the defects observed in cells expressing Bub1-Y259C cannot result just from reduced Bub3 binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Bub1 mutants in nontransformed hTERT-RPE1 cells</title><p>To investigate whether Bub1 function depends on its genetic background, we compared our Bub1 mutant HeLa cell lines with the same set of mutants expressed in nontransformed hTERT-RPE1 (human telomerase-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial) Flp-In cells.

First, we conclude that Bub1 can act in a kinetochore-independent manner. Second, our results indicate that the spindle checkpoint and chromosome alignment functions can be, as in yeast, separated in human <italic>Bub1</italic>; we identify a novel domain within Bub1 that is specifically required for spindle checkpoint signaling and demonstrate that Bub1 kinase activity regulates chromosome alignment but does not play a major role in the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). This separation of function is also reflected at the level of downstream effectors: mutants lacking spindle checkpoint control cannot load BubR1, Mad2, and to a lesser extent Mad1, but recruit Sgo1, whereas mutants defective in chromosome congression fail to recruit Sgo1 but load Mad1, Mad2, and BubR1. Finally, analysis of three cancer-related point mutants revealed partial defects in Bub1 function, in particular in their ability to activate the spindle checkpoint, suggesting that hypomorphic Bub1 mutants could contribute to cellular transformation.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic illustration of the importance of the different Bub1 domains for spindle checkpoint efficiency and chromosome congression.</bold> Continuous line, high importance; dashed line, moderate importance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200902128_RGB_Fig10"/></fig><sec><title>Regulation of the spindle checkpoint</title><p>Bub1 is required for the loading of the checkpoint proteins Mad1, Mad2, and BubR1/Mad3 to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharp-Baker and Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gillett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meraldi et al., 2004</xref>) and has been proposed to regulate the spindle checkpoint by phosphorylating the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome subunit Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tang et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). Our results show that lack of catalytic activity either compromises the spindle checkpoint only partially (HeLa cells) or not at all (hTERT-RPE1 cells). In contrast, we observe a strong correlation between the spindle checkpoint response and the ability to recruit BubR1, Mad2, and to a lesser degree Mad1, to kinetochores. This indicates that BubR1, Mad1, and Mad2 recruitment is the primary mechanism by which Bub1 contributes to spindle checkpoint signaling and that the kinase activity plays only a minor role in checkpoint signaling. Consistent with our findings, we note that phospho-specific antibodies that identify putative Bub1 phosphorylation sites on Cdc20 fail to detect such a phosphorylation event under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). Our data also indicate that the binding to Bub3 is essential for Bub1 function in human cells. This is different for fission yeast Bub1 because SpBub3 is not essential for the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tange and Niwa, 2008</xref>).</p><p>We further identify a novel conserved 19-aa motif in the central part of Bub1, which is required for the loading of BubR1, Mad1, and Mad2 to kinetochores but does not control chromosome congression. Experiments in yeast reported that the central 240-aa region, which includes the conserved 19-aa motif, can bind Mad1 in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warren et al., 2002</xref>). However, when we tested for such an interaction in in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we failed to detect a direct interaction between human Mad1 and Bub1 (with or without Bub3; unpublished data). Moreover, we find that Mad1 is still recruited when Bub1 fails to bind to kinetochores. This indicates that Bub1 does not act as a Mad1-binding platform on kinetochores but rather that it facilitates the recruitment of Mad1/Mad2. Interestingly, we note that the conserved motif I contains several invariant serines and threonines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and that serine 459 is phosphorylated in the presence of unattached kinetochores in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen, 2004</xref>).

Catalytically inactive Bub1 mutants do not rescue chromosome congression defects in cells depleted of endogenous Bub1. We therefore conclude that the enzymatic activity of Bub1 is essential for the regulation of chromosome alignment. Previous studies reported that Sgo1 is a key target of Bub1 for chromosome congression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kitajima et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with data from <italic>X. laevis</italic> or <italic>S. pombe</italic>, we find that loss of the kinase domain also impairs loading of Sgo1 onto kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kitajima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyarchuk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernius and Hardwick, 2007</xref>). However, our data also indicate that loss of Sgo1 on kinetochores does not strictly correlate with a high rate of chromosome congression defects because cells expressing Bub1-&#x00394;KNL1&#x02013;binding domain have only moderate congression defects even though they fail to recruit Sgo1 onto kinetochores. Therefore, Sgo1 cannot be the only target of Bub1 that is relevant for chromosome congression, and Bub1 must phosphorylate other substrates to ensure chromosome alignment in human cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Bub1 kinetochore localization</title><p>Photoactivation experiments indicate that Bub1 is tightly associated to unattached kinetochores and has, among the spindle checkpoint proteins, the longest residency time at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Howell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shah et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, experiments in <italic>S. pombe</italic> show that telomere-tethered Bub1 recruits Mad3 and Bub3 from the cytoplasm, leading to the proposal that Bub1 acts as a spindle checkpoint scaffold protein at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rischitor et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, loss of kinetochore binding only weakens but does not abolish human Bub1 functions. Bub1-&#x00394;KNL1&#x02013;binding domain partially rescues the spindle checkpoint, allows the recruitment of Mad1, Mad2, and MCAK, and strongly reduces the rate of chromosome congression errors when compared with a full Bub1 depletion. We therefore conclude that binding of Bub1 at the kinetochore is important but not essential for its checkpoint and chromosome congression function. Although Bub1 might act as a scaffold for certain proteins such as Mad3/BubR1 or CENP-F, we propose that it regulates chromosome segregation primarily through mechanisms independent of kinetochore binding.</p><p>Interestingly, our results also suggest a kinetochore-independent role for BubR1, which also regulates the spindle checkpoint and chromosome alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lampson and Kapoor, 2005</xref>). Indeed, HeLa cells complemented with Bub1&#x02013;&#x00394;conserved domain I do not load BubR1 onto kinetochores yet efficiently align their chromosomes on a metaphase plate. Although recent studies showed that BubR1 can regulate the spindle checkpoint in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kulukian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malureanu et al., 2009</xref>), our data would suggest that it can also control chromosome alignment when not bound to kinetochores.</p></sec><sec><title>Bub1 cancer-related mutants</title><p>The occurrence of <italic>Bub1</italic> mutations and differential <italic>Bub1</italic> gene and protein expression in cancer tissues and cell lines and the occurrence of spontaneous cancers in mice expressing low doses of Bub1 indicate a possible role of Bub1 in cancer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gemma et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shigeishi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ouyang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ru et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shichiri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hempen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeganathan et al., 2007</xref>). However, given the multiple roles of Bub1, it is unknown which might be the critical function of Bub1 in the context of tumorigenesis. Interestingly, all tested Bub1 mutants fail to fully rescue Bub1 RNAi. This indicates that Bub1 mutants can deregulate chromosome segregation and suggests that cancer formation could be linked to a weakened Bub1 function. A precise analysis of the involvement of these Bub1 mutants in tumor formation should therefore be an important feature in future works. It is interesting to note that the tested cancer-related Bub1 mutants lead to quantitatively different results in HeLa and hTERT-RPE1 cells, suggesting that the regulatory pathways controlling chromosome segregation are very similar yet also distinct between transformed and untransformed cells.</p><p>An important question is whether heterozygous Bub1 mutations are sufficient to disrupt chromosome segregation or whether both <italic>Bub1</italic> alleles have to be targeted. Although the A130S mutation was present on both alleles, Y259C and H265N were found only on one allele, which is accompanied by a wt <italic>Bub1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hempen et al., 2003</xref>). However, in our expression system, none of the Bub1 mutants, including the DN N-terminal Bub1 fragment, induced a DN effect on mitotic progression, suggesting that the DN effect observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taylor and McKeon (1997)</xref> requires overexpression of the mutant protein. Therefore, we speculate that epigenetic control mechanisms that down-regulate gene expression such as hypermethylation or hypoacetylation of the second allele are required to sensitize untransformed cells for Bub1 mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibody production</title><p>A GST-tagged Bub1 fragment (aa 336&#x02013;489) was purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> under native conditions and injected into rabbits (NeoMPS) and goats (BioGenes).
