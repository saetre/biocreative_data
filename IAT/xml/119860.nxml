Filament assembly in turn is regulated by phosphorylation in the tail region of the myosin heavy chain (MHC). Early studies have revealed one enzyme, MHCK-A, which participates in filament assembly control, and two other structurally related enzymes, MHCK-B and -C. In this report we evaluate the biochemical properties of MHCK-C, and using fluorescence microscopy in living cells we examine the localization of GFP-labeled MHCK-A, -B, and -C in relation to GFP-myosin-II localization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Biochemical analysis indicates that MHCK-C can phosphorylate MHC with concomitant disassembly of myosin II filaments. In living cells, GFP-MHCK-A displayed frequent enrichment in the anterior of polarized migrating cells, and in the polar region but not the furrow during cytokinesis. GFP-MHCK-B generally displayed a homogeneous distribution. In migrating cells GFP-MHCK-C displayed posterior enrichment similar to that of myosin II, but did not localize with myosin II to the furrow during the early stage of cytokinesis. At the late stage of cytokinesis, GFP-MHCK-C became strongly enriched in the cleavage furrow, remaining there through completion of division.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MHCK-A, -B, and -C display distinct cellular localization patterns suggesting different cellular functions and regulation for each MHCK isoform.

Using a simple protein "building block" that has the ability to self-associate to form massive structural arrays is a common theme used in creating a dynamic cytoskeleton. Temporal and spatial regulation of this self-assembly and its associated disassembly process is critical for correct function. For a model system, we have focused on the dynamics of myosin II thick filaments in <italic>D. discoideum</italic>. This protein forms a self-assembled, highly regulated bi-directional array of molecules that together with actin filaments are capable of producing force for cellular rearrangements. All evidence suggests that unless this molecule is assembled into its appropriate thick filament array it cannot function to produce force.</p><p>Eukaryotic cells during cell division construct contractile rings that are mainly composed of an actin-based cytoskeleton. Myosin II, a key component of this actin-based cytoskeleton, has been shown to be essential for cytokinesis of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells in suspension as well as for efficient chemotaxis and morphogenetic changes in shape during development) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. All of these roles require myosin II to be in the form of thick filaments. The question of how myosin II thick filament assembly is regulated within living cells, however, remains mostly unanswered. The amoeba <italic>D. discoideum</italic> has a number of advantages as a model system to study in vivo regulation of myosin II thick filament assembly. <italic>D. discoideum</italic> has only one endogenous copy of the myosin II heavy chain gene, and null strains of myosin II are available) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Cytokinesis in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> is also morphologically very similar to that of animal cells)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, myosin II molecules are constantly relocating into multiple locations for participating in various processes. Dynamic exchange occurs between a cytosolic soluble pool and assembled filaments that are enriched in the cortical cytoskeleton. The half-life of myosin between these pools has been measured to be ~ 7 sec, indicating the importance of dynamic assembly control in the localization of the protein)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. When a cell migrates, myosin II accumulates in the posterior of the cell. During cell division, myosin II accumulates in the cleavage furrow in the early stages of cytokinesis. To accomplish its cellular tasks, myosin II assembles into bipolar thick filaments and pull together oppositely oriented actin filaments to produce contractile forces. Mutant forms of myosin II that do not assemble into bipolar thick filaments in vitro fail to rescue myosin null phenotypes, nor do they localize to the furrow during cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). Although myosin II is not essential for cell division on a surface, it is critical for normal timely cell separation and for symmetric placement of the division furrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. GFP-myosin II is transported to the furrow of dividing cells growing on surfaces even though it is not essential for cytokinesis under these conditions.</p><p>The assembly of myosin II monomers into filaments is regulated by phosphorylation of its heavy chains at three threonine residues at the C-terminus of the tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Dephosphorylation of these threonines is a prerequisite of filament assembly, as confirmed by the phenotypes of a 3xAsp mutant, in which the three threonines are replaced by three aspartate residues (mimicking the phosphorylated state) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In vitro the 3xAsp myosin II is severely impaired for filament assembly, and in vivo 3xAsp myosin II fails to assemble or localize to the cortical cytoskeleton. Cells expressing this myosin thus recapitulate the defects of myosin II null cells, including failure to develop normally and failure to divide in suspension. In contrast, cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable myosin II construct (3xAla myosin cells) display severe myosin overassembly into the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and excessive myosin localization to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The 3xAla myosin cells also display severe defects in chemotactic cell migration, demonstrating the importance of proper myosin II assembly dynamics in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Myosin II heavy chain kinase (MHCK) activity in this system capable of disassembling myosin II filaments in vitro was originally reported with partially enriched kinase fractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The enzyme MHCK-A was subsequently purified to homogeneity and shown to be capable of driving myosin II filament disassembly in vitro via myosin II heavy chain phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). A MHCK-A cDNA was cloned via expression cloning and peptide sequence derived from the native enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This enzyme is now recognized as the founding member of a highly novel family of protein kinases unrelated to conventional protein kinases, with members present in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and throughout the animal kingdom. Homology-based cloning and genomic approaches led to the identification of two closely related <italic>D. discoideum</italic> enzymes, MHCK-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and MHCK-C (GenBank accession AAC31918, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). Several enzymes present in mammalian systems are now recognized as having the same conserved catalytic domain, including the eEF-2 kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and TRP-PLIK, a bifunctional protein with kinase and ion channel activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Biochemical analysis with MHCK-B has confirmed that this enzyme phosphorylates <italic>D. discoideum</italic> myosin II in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). Analysis reported here confirms that MHCK-C also readily phosphorylates <italic>D. discoideum</italic> myosin II in vitro, supporting a possible direct role for this enzyme in myosin II localization control in vivo.</p><p>Although substantial biochemical analysis has been performed with this family of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> MHCKs, there is relatively little information on the cellular distribution of the endogenous MHCKs in vivo. Previously, Steimle and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] reported that in interphase cells, during chemotaxis, random migration, and endocytic/phagocytic events, MHCK-A is recruited preferentially to anterior F-actin rich protrusions. With the discovery of two additional myosin II heavy chain kinases, MHCK-B and MHCK-C, we report here in live migrating and cytokinetic cells a systematic in vivo examination of these three MHCKs labeled with GFP.</p><p>This analysis reveals striking differences in localization between these three enzymes. During cytokinesis, MHCK-A displays weak enrichment at the cell poles, while MHCK-B displays a mostly diffuse localization. In contrast, MHCK-C displays strong localization to the cleavage furrow only during the late stages of cell division. These results suggest that <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells use a family of related MHCKs to modulate myosin II filament assembly, each with distinct roles.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>MHCK domain organization and MHCK C biochemical activity</title><p>The enzymes MHCK-A and MHCK-B have established roles in the control of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> myosin filament assembly both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and Egelhoff, T. T., (unpublished studies). These enzymes have a conserved domain organization that includes a highly novel protein kinase catalytic domain unrelated to conventional kinases, and a carboxyl-terminal WD repeat domain that targets these enzymes to myosin II filaments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Genomic sequence corresponding to the related enzyme MHCK-C was deposited in GenBank by Loomis and colleagues (accession number AAC31918). MHCK-C differs from MHCK-A and MHCK-B in that it lacks any significant amino-terminal domain upstream of the catalytic domain; conserved catalytic domain residues are present within approximately 30 residues of the methionine start codon of MHCK-C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Of this set of enzymes, MHCK-C is also unique in that it contains a large central domain of approximately 30 kDa that consists of highly repetitive stretches rich in serine, asparagine, proline, and glutamine. However, the strong similarity of MHCK-C to MHCK-A and MHCK-B in the conserved catalytic domain and the carboxyl-terminal WD repeat domain suggested that it might represent a third myosin heavy chain kinase in this organism.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Domain organization of Dictyostelium MHCKs.</bold> All three enzymes contain a strongly conserved seven-fold WD repeat domain at the carboxyl-terminus. MHCK-A has a unique amino-terminal domain of ~ 500 residues that forms a coiled-coil domain responsible for oligomerization and for localization to anterior actin-rich cell extensions. MHCK-B has an amino-terminal segment of ~ 115 residues of currently unknown function. GFP was fused at the amino-terminus of each MHCK for the studies presented here (at codon 2 in each case). "CAT" indicates position of the conserved protein kinase catalytic domain in each enzyme. "SNPQ" (black boxes) indicates position of segments of MHCK-B and MHCK-C that display low amino acid complexity and are rich in serine, asparagine, proline, and glutamine residues.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-3-19-1"/></fig><p>To test this possibility at the biochemical level, we engineered and expressed an epitope-tagged construct that contains an amino-terminal FLAG epitope fused to codon 2 of MHCK-C. FLAG-MHCK-C was purified using a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation and FLAG-peptide affinity chromatography. Purified FLAG-MHCK-C was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis with anti-MHCK-C polyclonal antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (not shown), and Coomassie staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) confirmed the purification of the expressed protein, migrating at the correct size for MHCK-C. The FLAG-MHCK-C protein consistently suffered proteolytic cleavage during purification. In initial lysates, the major immunoreactive species migrated at ~ 100 kDa, but during purification a major clipped species formed with a size of ~ 35 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This species reacted with both anti-MHCK-C antisera and with anti-FLAG epitope antibodies (not shown), indicating this fragment to be an amino-terminal domain of MHCK-C. Addition of protease inhibitors during purification reduced but did not eliminate formation of this clipped MHCK-C.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Purification and activity of epitope-tagged MHCK-C.</bold> A.

No incorporation was detected on autoradiographs at the mobility of myosin light chains, supporting the model that MHCK-C, like MHCK-A, modulates filament assembly and not myosin motor activity (data not shown). To determine whether phosphorylation by MHCK-C affected myosin II assembly properties, samples of purified <italic>D. discoideum</italic> myosin II were incubated with MHCK-C in the presence and absence of ATP. Samples were then subjected to centrifugation to sediment myosin II filaments, and the proportion of myosin II in the pellet in each sample was quantified using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining as a measure of filament assembly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Incubation of myosin II with MHCK-C in the absence of ATP resulted in assembly levels typical for purified <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> myosin, with 82% of the myosin sedimenting in the current set of assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Incubation of myosin II with MHCK-C in the presence of ATP resulted in substantial filament disassembly, with only 32% of the myosin II sedimenting following phosphorylation. These results confirm that MHCK-C can phosphorylate myosin II, and that this phosphorylation is capable of driving filament disassembly in vitro.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Phosphorylation of myosin II by FLAG-MHCK-C drives filament disassembly.</bold> Myosin II was subjected to phosphorylation by FLAG-MHCK-C as for experiments in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.

Equal fractions of pellets (P) and supernatants (S) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue stain. Disassembly is reflected as a loss of MHC in the pellet fractions.

First, FLAG-MHCK-C autophosphorylates during the course of in vitro phosphorylation reactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Second, the activity of FLAG-MHCK-C appears to be very low in the initial stages of in vitro phosphorylation reactions, but then rises after approximately 5 minutes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These attributes are reminiscent of the behavior of MHCK-A, which upon purification exists in an unphosphorylated low activity state. In vitro autophosphorylation of MHCK-A was found to increase the V<sub>max</sub> of the enzyme 50-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To test for similar autophosphorylation regulation of MHCK-C, we tested the activity of FLAG-MHCK-C with and without an initial autophosphorylation step, towards the peptide substrate MH-1 (a 16-residue peptide corresponding to one of the mapped MHC phosphorylation target sites for MHCK A in the myosin tail). If FLAG-MHCK-C was not subjected to a pre-autophosphorylation step, <sup>32</sup>P incorporation into the peptide displayed a similar lag phase as observed for myosin II phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, open symbols). If FLAG-MHCK-C was pretreated with Mg-ATP for 10 min at room temperature, the lag phase for peptide phosphorylation was eliminated (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, closed symbols). These results support the model that autophosphorylation activates MHCK-C. Another feature reported earlier for MHCK-A activation is that myosin II itself stimulates autophosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To test whether MHCK-C autophosphorylation is accelerated in the presence of myosin II, the stoichiometry of FLAG-MHCK-C autophosphorylation was evaluated in the presence and absence of myosin II filaments. Under the assay conditions here, myosin II did not significantly stimulate the rate of FLAG-MHCK-C autophosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). This result suggests that MHCK-C may be regulated in vivo by mechanisms distinct from those that regulate the activity of MHCK-A.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>FLAG-MHCK-C is activated by autophosphorylation.</bold> The peptide substrate MH-1 is a 16 residue peptide that corresponds to the mapped myosin II phosphorylation site at position 2029 of MHC.

Distribution of GFP-labelled MHCKs (GFP-MHCK-A, -B and -C) was examined in live AX2 cells (containing an endogenous mhcA gene). These GFP-MHCK expressing cells were able to sporulate and grow in suspension, indicating that at the expression level of these clonal cell lines, the expression of GFP-MHCKs in the AX2 cells does not detectably change myosin II expression or function. The fluorescence distributions of these cells were compared with cells expressing GFP-myosin II, obtained by transforming myosin null cells with a plasmid that carries GFP-mhcA-containing plasmid p102 (Materials and Methods) designated as GFP-myosin II cells hereafter.</p><p>The localization pattern of the GFP-MHCKs in the presence of myosin II was first compared to the distribution of GFP-myosin II cells in interphase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Many cells of each transformation were examined (n &#x0003e; 50) and examples of the distribution of GFP-MHCK-A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-A</xref>, top), GFP-MHCK-B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-B</xref>, top) and GFP-MHCK-C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-C</xref>, top) are shown. GFP-myosin II distributed in the cytoplasm and enriched in a cortical layer in interphase as has been described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-M</xref> (top). GFP-labelled MHCK-A and B distributed in the cytoplasm, and appeared to be excluded from the area that corresponded to nucleus. In contrast to GFP-Myosin II, GFP-labelled MHCK-A and B did not concentrate in the cell cortex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-M</xref>, top). Pixel intensities on a line drawn through the center of the cells allow a more quantitative comparison of the enrichment of GFP-MHCKs. A cortical distribution shows a distinctively increased accumulation of GFP fluorescent intensity at the cell edges, displaying two peaks flanking the cell cross-section as seen in the case of the GFP-myosin II cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-M</xref>, middle). Out of the three MHCKs, only GFP-MHCK-C appeared to be concentrated in the cell cortex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-C</xref>, top), and had the fluorescent profiles containing the two flanking peaks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-C</xref>, middle). GFP-MHCK-C also appears to be excluded from the nucleus, similar to that seen in cells expressing GFP-myosin II.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of interphase <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells.</bold> GFP-MHCK-A (A), GFP-MHCK-B (B), and GFP-MHCK-C (C) are expressed in Ax2 cells.

GFP-MHCK-B, on the other hand, is homogeneously cytosolic (B, bottom). The brighter cells expressing any of these GFP constructs sometimes display intense fluorescent spots (as in A, top and bottom, and B, bottom) that are likely non-physiological aggregates of the overexpressed protein, as discussed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Although MHCK-A has been extensively characterized at the biochemical level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], only limited biochemical analysis has been performed with bacterially-expressed subdomains of MHCK-B and MHCK-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The current biochemical results provide strong support for the hypothesis that MHCK-C acts as a MHC kinase in vivo. Further studies with second messenger compounds may help to identify upstream physiological mechanisms that regulate MHCK-C autophosphorylation/activation.</p><p>Using epi-fluorescence microscopy, we observe strikingly different patterns of dynamic localization for MHCK-A, -B, and -C during polarized migration and cytokinesis. The dynamics of MHCK-C localization are particularly intriguing, with global or posterior cortical enrichment observed during interphase, with a dramatic accumulation in the furrow during late cytokinesis. The apparent absence of MHCK-C from the furrow in early/mid cytokinesis, when myosin II is clearly accumulating, suggests that specific regulatory mechanisms may exist to recruit this enzyme to the furrow during late cytokinesis.</p><p>Co-localization of a MHCK with its apparent substrate does not imply that the kinase, in vivo, is actively phosphorylating its substrate. The dynamic localization of a kinase is only one way to regulate its activity. In fact, the MHCKs are very likely to be highly regulated enzymes; previous studies have documented the in vitro regulation of MHCK A by autophosphorylation, myosin filaments, and acidic phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and data presented here documents that MHCK C can also be regulated via autophosphorylation. Further studies are needed to confirm similar regulation in vivo, and to better define the upstream regulatory pathways. With these caveats, the distinct localization patterns for MHCK-A, -B, and -C reported here provide valuable clues as to which spatial and temporal myosin II population may be acted upon by each enzyme.</p><p>The dynamics of the three MHCKs also display striking differences in their dependence on myosin II. When the GFP fusions are imaged in myosin II null cells, both MHCK-A and MHCK-B display dynamics indistinguishable from their behaviour in cells wild type for myosin II. In contrast, loss of cortical and furrow localization is seen for GFP-MHCK-C in the absence of myosin II. This result suggests that MHCK-C localization in these settings may be achieved via direct association with myosin II filaments. Our TIRF studies further support this model, suggesting that MHCK-C may physically associate with myosin II filaments. GFP-MHCK-C under the TIRF microscope displayed short particles with a longer dimension approximately half of the length of myosin II thick filaments. The bare zone of purified wild-type myosin II thick filaments was estimated previously to be in the range of 0.13&#x02013;0.19 &#x003bc;m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Based upon these results, we suggest that GFP-MHCK-C may colocalize with myosin II thick filaments by binding at the bare zone.</p><p>Comparison of the localization pattern between GFP-myosin II and GFP-MHCKs provides us a map of where these three MHCKs localize at different stages in the vegetative cells, as well as how these MHCKs coordinated to ensure proper regulation of myosin II thick filament. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref> depicts our current working model for the dynamics of the three MHCKs during interphase (A), early cytokinesis (B) and late cytokinesis (C). Localization of MHCK-A and MHCK-B does not require myosin II. With or without myosin II, both MHCK-A and MHCK-B are excluded from the cell cortex in interphase; and neither MHCK-A nor MHCK-B colocalize with regions of highest myosin II concentration in moving cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11-A</xref>). We suggest that the enrichment of MHCK-A to polar ruffles of dividing cells may represent a mechanism by which <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells locally disassemble myosin II filaments to facilitate the polarized recruitment of filaments to the forming contractile ring/furrow zone. This model is consistent with the recent report that MHCK-A displays enrichment into anterior F-actin-rich protrusions of polarized cells during chemotaxis, and into phagocytic and macropinocytotic extensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The polar localization of MHCK-A would be consistent with the long-standing "polar relaxation" model for cytoskeletal reorganization during cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. MHCK-A may represent a factor that contributes to polar relaxation in this system via polar disassembly of myosin II filaments. The cytosolic localization of MHCK-B suggests that this enzyme may contribute to a continuous and uniform turnover of myosin II filaments throughout the cell, although it is possible that MHCK-B plays more specific roles in functions yet to be identified.</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic depiction of differential localization of MHCK-A, -B and -C (in the presence of myosin II) in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cells during free migration (A), early stage of cytokinesis (B), and at the completion of cytokinesis (C).</bold> In migrating cells, MHCK-C (red dots) colocalizes with myosin II (blue dots) at the posterior region. MHCK-A (green dots), on the other hand, colocalizes with actin at the front protrusions. MHCK-B distributes homogeneously in the cytoplasm (yellow fill). In the early stage of cytokinesis, myosin II concentrates to the furrow. However, MHCK-A (and sometimes MHCK-C) localizes to the polar protrusions (pseudopods) while MHCK-B is always cytosolic throughout the cell with some exclusion from the furrow region. At the late stages of cytokinesis, MHCK-C is recruited to the furrow region, and persists at this location after the completion of division. This persistent localization is reflected as posterior localization in the two new daughter cells, where MHCK-C presumably to help disassemble myosin II thick filaments that have completed their role in furrow contraction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-3-19-11"/></fig><p>We suggest that MHCK-C is recruited to the contractile ring during late cytokinesis to facilitate the orderly removal of excess myosin II from the ring as the furrow ingresses. It is particularly intriguing that MHCK-C colocalizes with myosin II in the furrow only at the culmination of cytokinesis where turnover and mobilization of thick filaments might be most appropriate. At this time the cell cycle contraction force requirements are predicted to fall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and the cell's geometrical changes would require myosin II thick filaments to disassemble. Although it is clear throughout the animal kingdom and in protozoa that the mass of myosin II in the division furrow decreases steadily with furrow ingression, no mechanism has been identified in any other system that can explain this regulated disassembly. Dynamic changes in MHC phosphorylation levels within the contractile ring have been reported in dividing sea urchin embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], suggesting that MHC phosphorylation as a mechanism regulating furrow myosin II disassembly may occur in other systems besides <italic>D. discoideum</italic>.

The late appearance of MHCK-C during furrowing suggests a cellular mechanism regulating its localization, and our biochemical data suggest that MHCK-C phosphorylation levels may represent a mechanism for the fine-tuning of the activity of MHCK-C in the cleavage furrow during cell division. This level of regulation could be mediated via second messenger control of autophosphorylation, or via direct MHCK-C phosphorylation by other kinases. Further studies are in progress to test these models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The GFP fusions to MHCK A, MHCK B, and MHCK C were constructed by placing GFP at the amino-terminus of each kinase coding region, with GFP fused to codon 2 of each kinase open reading frame.

The light source was replaced to a Xe arc lamp that has 60% increase over the typical input power of an epi-fluorescent lamp and therefore delivers higher output. This is beneficial when viewing low GFP-expressing cells. For imaging cells reported here, the light was typically attenuated to between 3% to 10% output. The output of the lamp is directed to the microscope by a liquid light-guide. This set up greatly reduces the effect of vibration and heat on the samples and the microscope. Images were collected and analyzed using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA).</p></sec><sec><title>Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Using an objective-typed TIRF microscopy, cells were imaged in an anodized aluminum imaging chamber filled with MES buffer (described above) through a coverslip with a refractive index of 1.78. GFP-protein molecules were excited by 488 nm photons produced from an Argon ion laser (Melles Griot) and a 100&#x000d7; (NA = 1.65) objectiv (Olympus). Fluorescent emission was detected through a PentaMax intensified CCD (Princeton Intruments). Typically, each movie collected by Winview (Roper Scientific) was 1 frame/sec for 200 sec, and was subsequently analyzed using NIH image. The apparent length of fluorescent objects was determined using NIH Image (National Institute of Health) to enlarge and identify large (&#x0003e; 10 fold) differences in pixel intensity to identity object edges using the "line-scan" function. Objects that were not clearly separate were removed from consideration."</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>W.L. performed the microscopy imaging, and participated in microscopy design and planning.
