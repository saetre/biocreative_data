It is rapidly phosphorylated following exposure of cells to double-strand break (DSB) inducing agents such as ionising radiation. Within minutes of DSB generation, H2AX molecules are phosphorylated in large chromatin domains flanking DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs); these domains can be observed by immunofluorescence microscopy and are termed &#x003b3;H2AX foci. H2AX phosphorylation is believed to have a role mounting an efficient cellular response to DNA damage. Theoretical considerations suggest an essentially random chromosomal distribution of X-ray induced DSBs, and experimental evidence does not consistently indicate otherwise. However, we observed an apparently uneven distribution of &#x003b3;H2AX foci following X-irradiation with regions of the nucleus devoid of foci.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principle Findings</title><p>Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that focal phosphorylation of histone H2AX occurs preferentially in euchromatic regions of the genome following X-irradiation. H2AX phosphorylation has also been demonstrated previously to occur at stalled replication forks induced by UV radiation or exposure to agents such as hydroxyurea. In this study, treatment of S-phase cells with hydroxyurea lead to efficient H2AX phosphorylation in both euchromatin and heterochromatin at times when these chromatin compartments were undergoing replication. This suggests a block to H2AX phosphorylation in heterochromatin that is at least partially relieved by ongoing DNA replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We discus a number of possible mechanisms that could account for the observed pattern of H2AX phosphorylation. Since &#x003b3;H2AX is regarded as forming a platform for the recruitment or retention of other DNA repair and signaling molecules, these findings imply that the processing of DSBs in heterochromatin differs from that in euchromatic regions. The differential responses of heterochromatic and euchromatic compartments of the genome to DSBs will have implications for understanding the processes of DNA repair in relation to nuclear and chromatin organization.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Up to 25&#x00025; of the histone H2A complement in mammalian cells consists of the histone variant H2AX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Rogakou1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Redon1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Compared to histone H2A1, this molecule has a unique C-terminal tail containing the phosphorylation target sequence for members of the phosphatidylinositol 3&#x02032;-kinase like kinase (PIKK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases. This family includes ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Shiloh1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Shiloh2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Histone H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated at Ser139 following treatments that induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or cause replication stress. At DSBs generated by ionizing radiation for example, H2AX becomes phosphorylated over megabase chromatin regions flanking the breaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Rogakou1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This phosphorylation is dependent largely on ATM, with some redundancy with DNA-PK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Stiff1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Wang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The resulting local concentrations of phosphorylated H2AX (&#x003b3;H2AX) can be detected at interphase by immunofluorescence microscopy, and are termed &#x003b3;H2AX foci. UV exposure or treatment with replication inhibitors such as hydroxyurea lead to ATR-dependent H2AX phosphorylation at sites of arrested replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Ward1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, replication-dependent DSBs induced by topoisomerase I inhibitors lead to ATR-dependent H2AX phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Furuta1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x003b3;H2AX is believed to form a platform for the recruitment and/or retention of DNA repair and signaling molecules at sites of DNA damage. At least one of these components, MDC1, binds directly to the phosphorylated C-terminal tail of histone H2AX. The precise physiological role of H2AX phosphorylation is not yet fully understood, but cells derived from H2AX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice display moderate radiosensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Celeste1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Bassing1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and a G2/M checkpoint defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-FernandezCapetillo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with the notion that by concentrating signaling molecules at sites of damage, &#x003b3;H2AX amplifies the DNA damage signal. It has also been suggested that phosphorylation of H2AX helps anchor chromosomal ends together, reducing the chances of DSBs leading to illegitimate recombination events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Bassing2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Phosphorylation of histone H2AX can be seen as one of a number of histone posttranslational modifications that delineate specific functions in particular segments of chromatin. Other such modifications include trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 and histone H4 lysine 20, that are characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Cowell1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Wu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Kourmouli1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This compartment of the genome is gene-poor and remains condensed during interphase. It is composed largely of repeated elements found in centromeric and pericentromeric regions in most eukaryotes and in the short arms of the human acrocentric chromosomes. DNA replication occurs towards the end of S-phase in heterochromatic regions, whereas euchromatic regions generally replicate in early to mid S-phase. In addition, it is well established that heterochromatic regions are associated with the non-histone chromatin protein, HP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Cheutin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Singh1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Wreggett1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Saunders1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-James1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Since heterochromatin and euchromatin represent different chromatin environments, it is possible that differences exist in their susceptibility to DNA damage, or in the detection or processing of DSBs. A number of previous papers have examined the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities (CAs) involving euchromatic versus heterochromatic regions following ionizing radiation, as a proxy for DNA damage and repair. No consistent pattern emerges from the literature, possibly because of differences in the species or cell type used or the means by which CAs were examined. Notably though, when Puerto et al (2001) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Puerto1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> compared the human constitutive heterochromatic 1cen-1q12 region with the similarly sized euchromatic 17cen-p53 region they found no difference in the initial number of &#x003b3;-radiation induced chromosome breaks, leading to the conclusion that chromatin configuration does not affect radiosensitivity. Histone H2AX phosphorylation is a well established marker of DSBs, and in this study we have found that following ionising radiation, &#x003b3;H2AX foci, are under-represented in heterochromatin in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ionizing radiation-induced &#x003b3;H2AX foci are largely excluded from heterochromatin</title><p>We previously noticed an apparently uneven distribution of &#x003b3;H2AX foci across the nucleus of X-irradiated MCF7 breast carcinoma cells, nuclei often containing islands free of &#x003b3;H2AX foci. We suspected that these &#x003b3;-H2AX-free islands might include heterochromatic regions. To test this hypothesis we carried out immunofluorescence analysis for &#x003b3;H2AX and the heterochromatin protein HP1&#x003b1; in X-irradiated MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

Similarly, in the present study, HP1&#x003b1; staining was concentrated in several large nuclear domains in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g001">Fig. 1b, e, h, k&#x00026;n</xref>). Prior to irradiation, &#x003b3;H2AX staining revealed one or two foci in most cells, as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Cowell2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Rogakou2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g001">Fig. 1m</xref>). When cells were fixed 30 minutes after irradiation (2Gy), nuclei contained an average of 50 &#x003b3;H2AX foci per cell. These foci were distributed throughout the nuclei, but with apparent islands where foci were absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g001">Fig. 1d, g, j, p</xref>). When the &#x003b3;H2AX and HP1&#x003b1; signals were overlaid, it could be seen that the bright HP1&#x003b1; signals corresponded to some of the islands free of &#x003b3;H2AX signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g001">Fig. 1</xref> third column). Line traces through selected cells emphasized this inverse correlation between &#x003b3;H2AX and HP1&#x003b1; staining. The images shown were obtained using methanol fixation, but similar results were obtained when cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and then permeabilised. Approximately 64&#x00025; of nuclei displayed no overlap between &#x003b3;H2AX foci and any HP1&#x003b1;-bright region. Cells where fewer than half of the HP1&#x003b1; regions contained at least one &#x003b3;H2AX focus made up 89&#x00025; of the asynchronous cell population (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001057-t001">Table 1</xref>). Similar results were obtained when &#x003b3;H2AX foci were compared with another heterochromatin marker, Histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9Me<sub>3</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g001">Fig 1p&#x02013;r</xref>). This phenomenon was not limited to IR-generated DNA damage, as &#x003b3;H2AX foci appearing during treatment of MCF7 cells with the topoisomerase II poison etoposide were also largely excluded from HP1&#x003b1;-staining regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). In this case, 60&#x00025; of cells displayed no overlap between &#x003b3;H2AX and HP1&#x003b1;, while cells where less than half of the HP1&#x003b1;-bright regions contained at least one &#x003b3;H2AX focus made up 89&#x00025; of the population.

Furthermore, nucleoli are often bordered by regions of dense chromatin as judged by staining with dyes such as DAPI or TO-PRO-3. In human cells this can have the appearance of a perinucleolar rim (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g003">Fig. 3a</xref> and Wu et al 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Wu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, for example) that partially overlaps with HP1&#x003b1; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g003">Fig. 3c, d&#x00026;g</xref>).

This interpretation was confirmed using MCF7 cells synchronized by serum starvation and release into medium containing 20&#x00025; serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Scully1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g005">Fig. 5,b, f, j</xref>). Notably, in S-L cells, the large &#x003b3;H2AX clusters coincided with the HP1&#x003b1; staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g004">Fig. 4d&#x02013;i</xref>). The colocalisation of &#x003b3;H2AX and HP1&#x003b1; was examined by line traces drawn across selected nuclei, confirming the heterochromatic origin or the strongest &#x003b3;H2AX signals. In cells displaying the fine speckled S-phase &#x003b3;H2AX pattern (S-E pattern), the speckles were excluded from the HP1&#x003b1; staining regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g004">Fig 4. j&#x02013;l</xref>). Similarly, treatment with the DNA crosslinking cytotoxic drug cisplatin led to phosphorylation of histone H2AX during S-phase, with &#x003b3;H2AX appearing in heterochromatic regions of late S-phase cells after 1 hour exposure to cisplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g004">Fig. 4 m&#x02013;r</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g005">Fig. 5c, g, k</xref>). Thus, H2AX is phosphorylated at sites of replication stress induced by agents such as HU and cisplatin even when those sites are within heterochromatin. Notably, when a late S-phase-enriched population of MCF7 cells were X-irradiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g005">Fig 5l</xref>), &#x003b3;H2AX foci appeared similar in overall distribution to those induced in G<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;enriched cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g005">Fig 5d</xref>), but the proportion of cells exhibiting &#x003b3;H2AX foci overlapping HP1&#x003b1; domains was greater than for G1 cells (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001057-t002">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that during replication heterochromatic H2AX is generally more amenable to phosphorylation.</p><fig id="pone-0001057-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001057.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Replication stress can induce phosphorylation of histone H2AX in heterochromatin.</title><p>Panels a&#x02013;l, subconfluent asynchronous MCF7 cells were exposed to hydroxyurea (2 mM) for one hour immediately prior to fixation and processing for &#x003b3;H2AX (green) and HP1&#x003b1; (red) immunofluorescence.

To our knowledge, this differential nuclear distribution of IR-induced &#x003b3;H2AX foci has not been reported previously, although re-examination of images presented in certain papers (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-FernandezCapetillo2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>) shows an apparently similar pattern in mouse cells, where heterochromatin can easily be recognized as bright DAPI staining regions. Also consistent with the findings reported here, Karagiannis et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Karagiannis1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> reported that satellite 2 and alpha satellite-containing chromatin is resistant to the induction of &#x003b3;H2AX by ionizing radiation according to ChIP analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Karagiannis1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, these satellite sequences are constituents of centromeric heterochromatin. In addition, this phenomenon appears to be conserved through evolution. Kim <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Kim1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> reported during the preparation of this manuscript, that in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the heterochromatic silent <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> loci are resistant to &#x003b3;H2AX formation following the introduction a targeted DSB.</p><p>Several possible reasons can be postulated for the apparent preference of H2AX phosphorylation for the euchromatic fraction of the genome. (i) Fewer DSBs are generated in heterochromatin, (ii) histone H2AX is absent or at low abundance in heterochromatin, (iii) epigenetic or other features of heterochromatin prevent the phosphorylation of H2AX over a large enough chromatin domain to generate a detectable focus, or these features restricts access of ATM and DNA-PK, (iv) DSBs rapidly migrate to the periphery of heterochromatic regions or cause local decondensation and loss of heterochromatin features.</p><p>Starting with the first possibility, there is no consistent evidence that IR induces fewer DSBs in heterochromatin than in euchromatin. Since no intermediates other than free radicals generated following energy deposition and their interaction with the DNA molecule are involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Brenner1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Ward3">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Ward4">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, it appears theoretically unlikely that heterochromatin would be very refractory to DSB generation by IR. However, differences in free radical scavenging capacity between chromatin compartments could result in different sensitivities to IR. Notably, Warters and Lyons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Warters1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> showed that decondensation of chromatin in isolated nuclei by hypotonic treatment resulted in a 4.5-fold increase in the sensitivity of DNA to DSB induction as estimated by gel electrophoresis. This was presumably due to reduced protection of DNA from radical damage in decondensed chromatin associated with a reduced local concentration of histones and other proteins and molecules that scavenge free radicals. A considerable body of published work exists that compares the frequencies of radiation induced CAs originating in heterochromatin versus euchromatin, (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-MartinezLopez1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and references within), but there is no consensus as to whether radiation induced CAs occur with higher or lower than expected frequencies in heterochromatin. Notably though, a recent study has shown no difference in the frequency of &#x003b3;-radiation-induced chromosome breaks between the largest block of heterochromatin in the human genome (1cen-1q12) and a similarly sized euchromatic region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Puerto1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. On balance, it seems unlikely that the lack of &#x003b3;H2AX foci in heterochromatin could be fully accounted for by a lower sensitivity to DSB induction in these regions.</p><p>If the abundance of the H2AX histone variant was markedly lower in heterochromatin, heterochromatic DSBs would not lead to a sufficient local concentration of phospho-H2AX molecules to generate &#x003b3;H2AX foci that are detectable by immunofluorescence. However, this does not appear to be the case, as exposure of cells to HU during replication leads to the appearance of abundant &#x003b3;H2AX in heterochromatin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g004">Figs 4</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001057-g005">5</xref>). Other histone modifications such as histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation, the presence of heterochromatin-specific proteins such as HP1&#x003b1;, or structural features of heterochromatin may prevent access of ATM and/or DNA-PK to H2AX molecules, or may limit the extent of the domain over which H2AX is phosphorylated. However, ATR, which is responsible for H2AX phosphorylation following replication inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Ward1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, appears to have access to heterochromatin at least during S-phase. Thus, ongoing replication may leave heterochromatin more amenable to DSB-induced H2AX phosphorylation. In support of this notion, a greater number of nuclei exhibit at least some overlapping &#x003b3;H2AX and HP1&#x003b1; signals when cells were irradiated in late S phase compared to G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001057-t002">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that transient decondensation of heterochromatin or depletion of heterochromatin proteins during replication allows H2AX phosphorylation. Further support for the role of the condensed nature of heterochromatin or its specific epigenetic and protein binding complement in preventing H2AX phosphorylation following IR comes from the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Prolonged exposure to low concentrations of the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA results in reorganization of heterochromatin, characterized by increased acetylation, loss of HP1 proteins from heterochromatin and the movement of pericentromeric heterochromatin regions to the nuclear periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Taddei1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, Karagiannis et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Karagiannis1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> reported an IR-induced increase &#x003b1;-satellite-derived &#x003b3;H2AX only when cells were first exposed to TSA (0.2 &#x000b5;M, 72 hr). The alternative hypothesis (iv above) that the occurrence of a DSB in a heterochromatic region does result in efficient H2AX phosphorylation, but that this is coupled to local decondensation and loss of heterochromatic features seems less likely, particularly considering the data reported by Karagiannis et al. However, this possibility cannot be completely discounted in the light of data showing local chromatin decondensation at the sites of DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001057-Kruhlak1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Thus, we conclude that DSBs-inducing agents fail to efficiently generate &#x003b3;H2AX foci in heterochromatin. The evidence discussed above suggests that this is due to the epigenetic or packaging properties of heterochromatin, preventing efficient H2AX phosphorylation. Since &#x003b3;H2AX is regarded as forming a platform for the recruitment or retention of other DNA repair and signaling molecules at DSBs, this implies that the processing of DSBs in heterochromatin differs from that in euchromatic regions. The differential response of heterochromatic and euchromatic compartments of the genome to DSBs will have implications for understanding the processes of DNA repair in relation to nuclear and chromatin organization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>MCF7 cells were cultured as monolayers in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; (v/v) FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g/mL streptomycin.
