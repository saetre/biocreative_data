Thus, the genetic basis for the majority of hereditary colorectal cancer remains unknown. <italic>EPHB2</italic> has recently been implicated as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of <italic>EPHB2</italic> to hereditary colorectal cancer. We screened for germline <italic>EPHB2</italic> sequence variants in 116 population-based familial colorectal cancer cases by DNA sequencing. We then estimated the population frequencies and characterized the biological activities of the <italic>EPHB2</italic> variants identified. Three novel nonsynonymous missense alterations were detected. Two of these variants (A438T and G787R) result in significant residue changes, while the third leads to a conservative substitution in the carboxy-terminal SAM domain (V945I). The former two variants were found once in the 116 cases, while the V945I variant was present in 2 cases. Genotyping of additional patients with colorectal cancer and control subjects revealed that A438T and G787R represent rare <italic>EPHB2</italic> alleles. <italic>In vitro</italic> functional studies show that the G787R substitution, located in the kinase domain, causes impaired receptor kinase activity and is therefore pathogenic, whereas the A438T variant retains its receptor function and likely represents a neutral polymorphism. Tumor tissue from the G787R variant case manifested loss of heterozygosity, with loss of the wild-type allele, supporting a tumor suppressor role for <italic>EPHB2</italic> in rare colorectal cancer cases. Rare germline <italic>EPHB2</italic> variants may contribute to a small fraction of hereditary colorectal cancer.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer is a common malignancy in Western society, with 15&#x02013;20&#x00025; of cases developing on the basis of apparent genetic predisposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002885-delaChapelle1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

These genetic alterations lead to constitutive activation of &#x003b2;&#x02212;catenin /TCF4 complex which, in turn, drives overexpression of WNT signaling targets.

These findings taken together with the established role of EPHB receptors in colorectal cancer, prompted us to hypothesize that germline <italic>EPHB2</italic> mutations may account for at least a fraction of the genetic alterations underlying the unexplained portion of hereditary colorectal cancer, and may represent a new cancer syndrome causing genetic predisposition to colorectal and prostate cancer. Therefore, in this study, we screened 116 population-based familial colorectal cancer cases for germline <italic>EPHB2</italic> mutations. The 116 probands tested had at least one additional affected first degree relative. These cases had microsatellite stable tumors, and did not meet diagnostic criteria for FAP, HNPCC and MAP. We also enriched our series with individuals who met the above inclusion criteria and had personal or family histories of prostate cancer.

This family is further subdivided into two distinct classes, EphA (A1 to A10) and EphB (B1 to B6), based on their binding affinities for two membrane-anchored ligand families with the corresponding names of type A (A1 to A5) and B (B1 to B3) ephrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002885-Pasquale1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002885-Aasheim1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since loss of mitotic activity control, epithelial patterning and tissue architecture are hallmarks of tumorigenesis, disruption of normal EPHB receptor expression and function likely promotes colorectal carcinogenesis. Constitutive EPHB receptor expression may stimulate tumor initiation by disturbing proliferative stem cell homeostasis, and secondary silencing of EPHB receptor activity may permit expansion of cancer cells, beyond the spatial boundaries imposed by intact EPHB receptor function to populate adjacent tissue structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002885-Batlle1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002885-Clevers1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002885-Holmberg1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In support of this hypothesis, we and others have recently shown a causal role for EphB inactivation in tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002885-Batlle2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that <italic>EphB2</italic> or <italic>EphB3</italic> silencing in Apc<sup>Min/&#x0002b;</sup> mice results in accelerated and more aggressive colorectal tumorigenesis.</p><p>In the current study, we screened 116 population-based familial cases of colorectal cancer for mutations in a candidate tumor suppressor gene, EPHB2, and identified three candidate variants (A438T, D679N, G787R), which were further characterized. Even though the A438T allele was not observed in control subjects and was found to segregate with disease in Family 1, biochemical characterization suggests that A438T is a rare neutral polymorphism; we cannot exclude the possibility that it affects more subtle aspects of EPHB2 signaling, such as the formation of higher order oligomers. The D679N variant has been previously reported to be associated with prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002885-Huusko1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Although, it remains possible that this variant modulates predisposition to prostate cancer, our data suggest that it occurs at a population frequency of approximately 1&#x00025; and that it does not, on its own, increase susceptibility to colorectal cancer. We observed the D679N allele in a similar number of patients with colorectal cancer and population-matched controls. In contrast to these latter variants, our data suggest that the G787R variant is functionally compromised and may be a rare cause of hereditary colorectal cancer. The G787R variant was identified in a patient diagnosed with rectal cancer at 67 years of age, and biochemical characterization revealed that the G787R substitution markedly diminishes the receptor's intrinsic kinase activity.</p><p>There have been two other investigations examining the contribution of germline <italic>EPHB2</italic> mutations to colorectal cancer susceptibility. Oba <italic>et al.</italic> screened for <italic>EPHB2</italic> mutations in colon tumors and respective normal colon tissues from 50 patients with colorectal cancer, and identified an intron 8 alteration in a single tumor sample, which results in a nonsense mutation. However, it is unclear if this is a somatic mutation, as there is no indication whether this genetic change was also observed in the paired normal colon sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002885-Oba1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This investigation also identified 15 cases with LOH involving the <italic>EPHB2</italic> gene and screened for mutations in the remaining <italic>EPHB2</italic> allele. Since mutations in the remaining allele were not identified, Oba <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that <italic>EPHB2</italic> is not a classical tumor suppressor gene. However, since only 50 samples of likely sporadic cases of colorectal cancer were analyzed, a tumor suppressor role for <italic>EPHB2</italic> cannot be excluded. In a more recent study, Kokko <italic>et al.</italic> reported an association of three novel variants with colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002885-Kokko1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Germline missense changes resulting in I361V, R568W, and D861N were observed in colorectal cancer patients, but not in healthy controls. However, it is possible that these three variants are rare neutral polymorphisms since the biological significance of the variants was not evaluated using direct functional assays. The patients screened in these latter two studies did not necessarily have significant family histories of colorectal cancer. In contrast to these two earlier reports, our study was designed to specifically evaluate the role of germline <italic>EPHB2</italic> mutations in patients with familial colorectal cancer, and not in sporadic cases. Despite study design differences, together these three investigations suggest that <italic>EPHB2</italic> germline mutations are not common occurrences in colorectal cancer. Further investigations of larger sample sizes are needed to confirm this observation.</p><p>In summary, we identified a germline <italic>EPHB2</italic> variant (G787R) with diminished biological activity in a colorectal cancer patient, and suggest that <italic>EPHB2</italic> mutations contribute to a small fraction of hereditary colorectal cancer. The rarity of germline <italic>EPHB2</italic> mutations supports a more significant role for EPHB2 in colorectal tumor progression rather than in tumor initiation. Since the EPHB receptors (EPHB2, EPHB3 and EPHB4) follow a similar pattern of transcriptional silencing in colorectal cancers, all EPHB receptor family members probably play a similar role in this disease. Therefore, the EPHB family likely accounts for a minor proportion of genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer but has an important role in tumor progression. Although our findings suggest that the <italic>EPHB</italic> gene family should not be routinely screened for germline mutations in familial cases, the <italic>EPHB</italic> genes are candidate tumor suppressors, likely accounting for rare cases of familial colorectal cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002885.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002885.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002885.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002885.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. D.
