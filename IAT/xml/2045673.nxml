The local accessibility of DNA is regulated by many chromatin modifying enzymes, among them the nucleosome remodelling factors. These enzymes couple the hydrolysis of ATP to disruption of histone-DNA interactions, which may lead to partial or complete disassembly of nucleosomes or their sliding on DNA. The diversity of nucleosome remodelling factors is reflected by a multitude of ATPase complexes with distinct subunit composition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found further diversification of remodelling factors by posttranslational modification. The histone acetyltransferase GCN5 can acetylate the <italic>Drosophila </italic>remodelling ATPase ISWI at a single, conserved lysine, K753, <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The target sequence is strikingly similar to the N-terminus of histone H3, where the corresponding lysine, H3K14, can also be acetylated by GCN5. The acetylated form of ISWI represents a minor species presumably associated with the nucleosome remodelling factor NURF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Acetylation of histone H3 and ISWI by GCN5 is explained by the sequence similarity between the histone and ISWI around the acetylation site. The common motif RK<sup>T</sup>/<sub>S</sub>xGx(K<sup>ac</sup>)xP<sup>R</sup>/<sub>K </sub>differs from the previously suggested GCN5/PCAF recognition motif GKxxP. This raises the possibility of co-regulation of a nucleosome remodelling factor and its nucleosome substrate through acetylation of related epitopes and suggests a direct crosstalk between two distinct nucleosome modification principles.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Disruption of DNA-histone interactions by nucleosome remodelling ATPases may lead to a variety of transitions of chromatin structure, such as the partial or complete disassembly of nucleosomes, the exchange of histones, or the sliding of intact histone octamers on DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In many cases their activity is focused on local disruption of the nucleosomal fibre through recruitment of DNA-binding regulators to promote access of factors further downstream in the cascade of events that leads to promoter opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, genome-wide processes like replication, DNA damage responses or homologous recombination require chromatin to be dynamic on a global scale. In addition to generating local access to nucleosomal DNA, nucleosome disruption may also have profound consequences for the folding of the nucleosomal fibre into higher order structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>One largely unresolved issue to date is how the activity of chromatin remodelling enzymes is regulated. Established regulatory principles that govern, for example, metabolic enzymes also apply to nucleosome remodelling ATPases, but our knowledge is still anecdotal. The expression of nucleosome remodelling ATPases may be selective. For example, the fact that the mammalian ISWI isoform SNF2H is abundant in proliferating cells, whereas the related SNF2L is enriched in terminally differentiated neurons points to functional diversification of related remodelling enzymes and specialized roles in proliferation/differentiation control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Such a role has also been suggested for the SWI2/SNF2-type ATPase hBRM by the early finding that its expression is down-regulated when cells receive a mitogenic stimulus or during <italic>ras</italic>-mediated oncogenic transformation, whereas its forced expression partially reverses transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>A further regulatory strategy involves post-translational modifications of enzymes, such as their phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of hBRM and BRG-1 during mitosis correlates with dissociation of these remodellers from the chromosomes during condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Muchardt and colleagues also showed that acetylation of hBRM correlates with a reduced inhibition of cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The possibility of regulating nucleosome remodelling ATPases by lysine acetylation is intriguing given that properties of their substrates, the histones, are most prominently modulated by acetylation at their exposed N-termini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Here we describe another example of potential regulation of a remodelling ATPase by acetylation. We found that <italic>Drosophila </italic>ISWI, the founding member of a family of nucleosome remodelling ATPases, was preferentially acetylated by GCN5 at a single lysine within a amino acid sequence of high similarity to the N-terminus of histone H3. This acetylated lysine corresponds to lysine 14 in histone H3 (H3K14), a known target for GCN5, suggesting that this acetyltransferase may affect the chromatin structure by two distinct strategies: by acetylation of the nucleosomes and by modification of a nucleosome remodelling enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>ISWI is acetylated in vivo</title><p>In order to explore whether ISWI was acetylated in <italic>Drosophila </italic>cell lines we immunoprecipitated the ATPase from extracts of SF4 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Probing the precipitate with a pan-acetyl-lysine antibody (&#x003b1;AcLysine) we detected a labelled protein migrating at the position of ISWI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 4, 5). To facilitate detection of acetylated ISWI we treated Kc cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), prepared whole cell extracts and monitored ISWI levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 1, 2). We then immunoprecipitated ISWI or proteins containing acetylated lysines from these extracts. In the absence of TSA ISWI was barely detectable in the &#x003b1;AcLysine precipitate, which may be due to the inefficiency of the antibody and/or the small amounts of acetylated ISWI present in Kc cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;5). However, upon overnight TSA treatment the levels of acetylated ISWI increased significantly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;8). Taken together these results suggested that a minor fraction of ISWI was acetylated in Kc and SF4 cells. In order to confirm this notion by an independent experiment we metabolically labelled SF4 and Kc cells by addition of [<sup>3</sup>H]-acetic acid for 3 hrs to the growth medium, prepared extracts and determined the ISWI levels as before (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, lanes 9, 10). ISWI was immunoprecipitated from these extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;8) and acetylated proteins in the precipitate were detected by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A band migrating at the position of ISWI was only detectable in the &#x003b1;ISWI precipitate, but was absent in the control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4). A second labelled band points to an acetylated ISWI-associated protein of unknown identity (asterisk in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that a relatively minor fraction of ISWI is acetylated in <italic>Drosophila </italic>tissue culture cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>ISWI is acetylated <italic>in vivo</italic></bold>. (A) ISWI was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts of <italic>Drosophila </italic>SF4 cells. A parallel immunoprecipitation (IP) with rabbit IgG antibodies served as specificity control. Enrichment of ISWI was documented by Western blotting (WB) using an &#x003b1;ISWI antibody (lanes 1&#x02013;3). A pan-acetyl-lysine (&#x003b1;AcLysine) antibody detects a protein co-migrating with ISWI (lanes 4, 5). (B) Kc cells were cultured for 17 hrs in the presence or absence (control) of 200 ng/ml trichostatin A (TSA). Whole cell extracts contained equal amounts of ISWI (lanes 1, 2).

Towards this end we expressed and purified GCN5, p300 and MOF and confirmed their activity and specificity on histone substrates. In agreement with published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], GCN5 only acetylated histone H3, p300 mainly acetylated H3 and to a lesser extent H4 and MOF preferred histone H4 as a substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Replacing the histone substrate with recombinant ISWI we found that GCN5 and p300 were also able to acetylate ISWI, whereas MOF did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The activity of all HATs in these assays is conveniently controlled by their autoacetylation (bands labelled with asterisks in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Interestingly, the ability to acetylate ISWI correlated with the enzymes' preference for H3 among the histones. Because acetylation of ISWI by GCN5 was particularly robust, we employed GCN5 in the subsequent analyses.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vitro</italic>, ISWI is specifically acetylated by HATs able to modify histone H3</bold>.

Bands corresponding to acetylated histones are marked by arrows. (B) Recombinant ISWI was incubated in acetylation reactions with GCN5, p300 or MOF. Acetylated ISWI (arrow) was detected as in (A).

The ATPase domain of ISWI is located in the central part of the protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). While more N-terminal sequences of the protein have no discernable features, the structure and function of the C-terminal third are better known. A region defined by HAND, SANT and SLIDE domains harbours a prominent nucleosome recognition module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. At the very C-terminus an ACF1-interaction determinant (AID) has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A panel of different ISWI fragments fused to hexahistidine- (His<sub>6</sub>-) or GST-tags (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) were expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>and used as substrates for GCN5-dependent acetylation. Acetylation of the first 697 N-terminal amino acids (aa) of ISWI containing the ATPase domain and sequences up to the HAND domain was barely detectable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lane 1). By contrast, the remaining C-terminal part (aa 691&#x02013;1027) was strongly labelled (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lane 2). Trimming this fragment from the C-terminus to aa 962 did not affect its acetylation, however, deleting amino acids between 691 and 796 abolished the acetylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;7). We concluded that a prominent acceptor site for acetylation must reside within the HAND fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This region of ISWI contains 10 lysines that could potentially be acetylated. Upon closer inspection we found the region between aa 747 and 756 to be remarkably similar to the N-terminus of histone H3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In this alignment ISWI residues 748 and 753 (K748 and K753, respectively) correspond to lysines 9 and 14 of H3, which are frequently acetylated by GCN5. These ISWI residues and their sequence context are conserved in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>(xISWI) and the human ISWI isoforms hSNF2H and hSNF2L (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). We therefore focused our attention on this part of ISWI.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>ISWI is acetylated in the HAND domain</bold>.

(B) Peptides corresponding to the histone H3 N-terminal tail (aa 1&#x02013;19, left panel) and to aa 740&#x02013;759 of ISWI (right panel) were acetylated <italic>in vitro </italic>by GCN5, p300 or MOF as in Figure 2. Peptide acetylation was determined from incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]-acetate and by subtracting the values for autoacetylation of enzymes (from reactions lacking substrate) and the values for non-specific adsorption of label to the peptides (from reactions lacking enzyme) from the experimental values. (C) MALDI analysis of the <italic>in vitro </italic>acetylated ISWI peptide (aa 740&#x02013;759). The acetylation reaction was stopped by addition of 10% acetic acid, and the reaction products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF.

In the lower spectrum the arrow points to a peak representing the product of the acetylation reaction (M-H<sup>+ </sup>= 2622.32 amu). A Deltamass (Dm) of 42.01 amu indicates mono-acetylation. A second peak of very low intensity (asterisk) suggests minor di-acetylation (M-H<sup>+ </sup>= 2664.33).

The spectrum is enlarged over the region <sub>750</sub>VGYKV<sub>754 </sub>in order to observe the y7 ion (M-H<sup>+ </sup>= 815.46) corresponding to the unacetylated K753. Lower spectrum: sequencing of the peptide with a (M-3H<sup>+</sup>) value of 716.73 reveals the sequence IYYFRKTVGYK<sub>Ac</sub>VPKNTE, with only K753 being acetylated, (mass of the y7 ion M-H<sup>+ </sup>= 857.47, which differs in mass from the corresponding unmodified y7 ion in the upper spectrum by 42.012 amu). Detailed analysis of K748 and K756 revealed no acetylation at these sites (data notshown).

By direct comparison, a peptide spanning the corresponding 19 aa of ISWI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) is well acetylated by GCN5, but not at all by MOF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, right panel). Maldi-TOF mass spectrometry and nano-electrospray sequencing documented that the peptide was mono-acetylated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) exclusively at K753 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). In order to test for the contribution of K753 to ISWI acetylation in the context of the entire protein we expressed recombinant ISWI derivatives that had either K748 or K753 or both lysines replaced by alanines (A) or arginines (R). Equivalent protein amounts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, lower panel) were used as substrate for GCN5-dependent acetylation reactions. The ISWI derivative bearing the K748A mutation was acetylated as the wildtype protein, whereas replacement of lysine 753 by alanine (K753A) led to a significantly reduced acetylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, compare lanes 4, 5).

In order to explore whether ISWI<sup>K753ac </sup>was preferentially associated with one of these complexes we ablated the signature subunits ACF1 and NURF301 by RNA interference in SL2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) and found that the ISWI<sup>K753ac </sup>epitope was significantly reduced in the absence of NURF301, but remained unperturbed if ACF1 was knocked down (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In agreement with the notion that ISWI<sup>K753ac </sup>is not a subunit of CHRAC/ACF we found that the expression pattern of the acetylated ISWI form was unperturbed in <italic>acf1 </italic>null flies (data not shown). ISWI<sup>K753ac </sup>staining was unperturbed in flies heterozygous for the NURF301 allele [E(bx)<sup>ry122</sup>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Homozygous mutants are lethal, but survive until the end of the larval stage due to maternal contribution of NURF301 and were not analysed. Immunoprecipitation of NURF301 from extracts of SL2 cells and 8&#x02013;12 hr embryos co-precipitated acetylated ISWI, which was not the case if ACF1 was precipitated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C, D</xref>). We conclude that in SL2 cells ISWI may be acetylated in the context of NURF but is not acetylated in association with ACF1. The data do not exclude the existence of additional complexes harbouring the modification.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Many acetyltransferases were first identified following their histone acetylation function and hence named histone acetyltransferases (HATs). However, most of them have now been shown to acetylate non-histone proteins as well, and these modifications can have profound effects on the structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For example, the effects of acetylation on the tumour suppressor protein p53 have been heavily studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The current work, together with the earlier observation that the effect of the BRM ATPase on cell proliferation can be regulated by acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] highlight the potential for direct regulatory cross-talk between different chromatin modifying principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The fact that ISWI can be acetylated <italic>in vitro </italic>and in tissue culture cells by GCN5, which is also known to target the H3 N-terminus, is explained by the sequence similarity between the histone and ISWI around the K753 acetylation site. The common motif RK<sup>T</sup>/<sub>S</sub>xGx(K<sup>ac</sup>)xP<sup>R</sup>/<sub>K </sub>differs from the previously suggested GCN5/PCAF recognition motif GKxxP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This raises the possibility of specific co-regulation of a nucleosome remodelling factor and its nucleosome substrate through acetylation of related epitopes. Strikingly, the related motif D<underline>K</underline>GK<underline>G</underline>K<underline>K</underline>R<underline>P</underline> also occurs in the C-terminus of hBRM, overlapping with potential acetylation sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Acetylation at one or more C-terminal lysines of BRM correlates with reduced interference with cell cycle progression in mammalian cells and mutation of several of these lysines into arginines impairs BRM function. The data suggest that site-specific acetylation of the ATPase by, for example P/CAF, may adversely affect its function, possibly by interfering with targeting interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The fact that the acetylated ISWI epitope is conserved during evolution suggests functional significance. However, so far we were unable to document an effect of acetylation on the catalytic properties or protein interactions of ISWI, due to the small proportion of ISWI either acetylated <italic>in vitro </italic>or naturally present <italic>in vivo</italic>. Lysine 753 of ISWI resides in the HAND domain, a fold of unknown function situated between the ATPase domain and the C-terminal SANT/SLIDE domains that mediate nucleosome interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Exploring the role of the HAND domain in ISWI may lead to novel approaches towards evaluating the impact of K753 acetylation. Applying the K753ac-specific antibody to developmental stages of <italic>Drosophila </italic>revealed that the acetylation of ISWI is a developmentally regulated process, which occurs during oogenesis and early embryogenesis, but is absent from later developmental stages (CC and PBB, unpublished observations). We also obtained preliminary support for the idea that the acetylation of ISWI marks a functionally distinct subpopulation: the acetylated epitope was dramatically enriched on the condensed metaphase chromosomes in early embryos (CC and PBB, unpublished observations). A causal role between the acetylation and the unusual ability of the ATPase to interact with compact chromatin remains to be explored.</p><p>The ATPase ISWI is the catalytic moiety of several nucleosome remodelling complexes. Better known and characterized are the factors CHRAC, ACF and NURF (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The available data suggest that the acetylated form of ISWI may mark a subpopulation of the NURF complex. NURF is involved in the transcription of selected sets of <italic>Drosophila </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] but flies mutant for the large, defining NURF301 subunit also show defects of chromosome structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Assessment of which of these functions may be modulated by ISWI acetylation requires a genetic approach.</p><p>The acetylation of the amino terminus of histone H3 is an important determinant of active chromatin, but chromatin structure can also be modulated by other modifications of the histone 'tail', notable its methylation or phosphorylation. Whether the analogy between the ISWI and the H3 N-terminus can also be extended to include phosphorylation and methylation remains an interesting aspect for future research.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified and characterised a site-specific acetylation of the remodelling ATPase ISWI by GCN5. The modification occurs predominantly in the context of the remodelling factor NURF, however, due to the fact that the acetylation marks a minor subpopulation of the remodeller a functional evaluation of the modification has not yet been achieved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Recombinant DNA technology</title><p>pGEX-4T-3 and pProEx-Htb vectors for expression of GST-ISWI and (His6)-ISWI deletion mutants, respectively have been described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. pFastBacHTa-FLAG-ISWI WT was generated by inserting the NcoI-KpnI fragment from pMYB4-FLAG-ISWI WT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] into pFastBacHTa vector ("Bac-to-Bac" expression system, Invitrogen). pMYB4-FLAG-ISWIK748A, -ISWIK753A, -ISWIKK748/753AA and -ISWIKK748/753RR were generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers listed in the supplemental materials and moved as NcoI-KpnI fragments into the pFastBacHTa vector.</p></sec><sec><title>Primers used for site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>Generation of ISWI<sup>K748A</sup>:</p><p>CCAGGAAATCTACTATTTCCGGGCCACTGTTGGTTAC and</p><p>GTAACCAACAGTGGCCCGGAAATAGTAGATTTCCTGG.</p><p>Generation of ISWI<sup>K753A</sup>:</p><p>GTTGGTTACGCGGTACCCAAGAACACGGAACTAGG and</p><p>CCTAGTTCCGTGTTCTTGGGTACCGCGTAACCAAC.</p><p>Generation of ISWI<sup>K748R</sup>:</p><p>CCAGGAAATCTACTATTTCCGGAGGACCGTTGGTTAC and</p><p>GTAACCAACGGTCCTCCGGAAATAGTAGATTTCCTGG.</p><p>Generation of ISWI<sup>K753R</sup></p><p>GTTGGTTACCGAGTGCCCAAGAACACGGAACTAGG and</p><p>CCTAGTTCCGTGTTCTTGGGCACTCGGTAACCAAC</p></sec><sec><title>Primers used for PCR to generate dsRNA fragments for RNA interference</title><p>ISWI sequences 1&#x02013;499:</p><p>TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGTCCAAAACAGATACAGCTG and</p><p>TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGCAGAGATATGGTCTGCAGG;</p><p>GCN5 sequences 1&#x02013;525:</p><p>TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGTCTGGTGGTCCATCC and</p><p>TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGCGCTGCATGGACATGAA;</p><p>ACF1 sequences 1&#x02013;560</p><p>TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGCCCATTTGCAAGCGG and</p><p>TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGCGCGAGCGACGTAAT;</p><p>NURF301 sequences 1&#x02013;521</p><p>TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGAGCGGTCGCGGCAG and</p><p>TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGCTGCATACTGACGACCT;</p><p>GST sequences 1&#x02013;527;</p><p>TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTA and</p><p>TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAACGCATCCAGGCACATTG;</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were kind gifts: &#x003b1;ISWI (J.
