These properties can be regulated by transcriptional control in the nucleus through extracellular signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The <italic>oct-4</italic> gene, also referred to as <italic>oct-3</italic> and <italic>oct-3/4</italic>, encodes a nuclear protein that belongs to a family of transcription factors containing the POU DNA-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Oct-4 is normally expressed in the pluripotent stem cells of pregastrulation embryos, including oocytes, early-cleavage-stage embryos and the ICM (inner cell mass) of the blastocyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Its expression is down-regulated during differentiation, and knockout of <italic>oct-4</italic> causes early lethality in mice due to the absence of an ICM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These results suggest that Oct-4 plays a pivotal role in mammalian development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and in the self-renewal of ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. During human development, Oct-4 is expressed at least until the blastocyst stage in which it regulates gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Transcriptional regulation by Oct-4 is complex. In ES cells, the octamer sequence motif (5&#x02032;-ATGCAAAT-3&#x02032;) is active irrespective of its distance from the site of transcriptional initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, in differentiated cells, Oct-4 can transactivate its targets only when the octamer motif is in a proximal position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. If the octamer motif is at a distal site, the protein requires stem-cell-specific bridging factors that link it to the transcription initiation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A number of factors such as Sox2, HMG (high-mobility group), E7, E1A and EWS are known to influence the ability of Oct-4 to act as an activator or repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, the physical association of Oct-4 with PKM2 (pyruvate kinase isozyme type&#x000a0;M2) was documented recently, suggesting that PKM2 may also play a role in regulating Oct-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Proliferation of ES cells is achieved through self-renewal, and should be regulated by controlling the cell cycle. In comparison with self-renewal, little is known about the cell-cycle regulation of ES cells by Oct-4. Although Oct-4 functions as a master switch during differentiation by regulating cells that have pluripotent potential, or can develop such potential, unfortunately no Oct-4 target gene involved in ES cell-cycle regulation has been identified. As a first step towards investigating how the <italic>oct-4</italic> gene product contributes to the cell-cycle regulation of ES cells, we analysed its potential to regulate the process of self-renewal and control the cell cycle. We found that down-regulation of <italic>oct-4</italic> expression led to the growth arrest of ES cells by blocking cell-cycle progression in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>. Deletion analysis of the functional domains of Oct-4 indicated that the overall integrity of the Oct-4 functional domains is important for the stimulation of S-phase entry. We also show in the present study that a CDKI [CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor] gene, <italic>p21</italic>, is a target for repression by Oct-4. Furthermore, an increase in p21 protein levels was induced by the down-regulation of <italic>oct-4</italic> gene expression in ZHBTc4 ES cells. Therefore the down-regulation of <italic>p21</italic> by Oct-4 may contribute to the maintenance of ES cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials and general methods</title><p>Restriction endonucleases, calf intestinal AP (alkaline phosphatase), the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs.

In the present study, we have characterized the effect of Oct-4 on ES cell-cycle control using ZHBTc4 ES cells.

In addition, we also showed in the present study that the <italic>p21</italic> gene is a target for repression by Oct-4 in ZHBTc4 ES cells. Our findings demonstrate that the down-regulation of <italic>p21</italic> by Oct-4 may contribute to the maintenance of ES cell proliferation.</p><p>Oct-4 is a central mediator of the undifferentiated pluripotent state of ES cells. It was previously reported that maintaining Oct-4 activity within a certain range appears to be critical for stem cell self-renewal, with any increase or decrease triggering differentiation to endoderm/mesoderm or trophectoderm respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although Oct-4 possesses two separate transactivation domains, Oct-4 deletion mutants lacking either the N-terminal domain or the C-terminal domain are able to maintain the stem cell phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Consistent with this result, ZHBTc4 ES cells expressing FLAG-tagged Oct-4(&#x00394;C)&#x02013;EGFP or FLAG-tagged Oct-4(&#x00394;N)&#x02013;EGFP proteins were positive for undifferentiated stem cell markers, such as AP, SSEA-1, Nanog, Sox2, Fgf-4 and Rex-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). However, these ES cells showed smaller colony sizes and were also positive for the expression of markers of differentiated cells, indicating that neither the N-terminal nor the C-terminal domain deletion mutant of the Oct-4 protein is sufficient to maintain the stem cell phenotype. ES cells expressing Oct-4 deletion mutants lacking either the N-terminus or the C-terminus were positive both for the undifferentiated stem cell markers and for markers of differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). It would be interesting, therefore, to see whether such ES cells are capable of long-term self-renewal and are pluripotent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Cell-cycle progression is controlled by the CDKs, and p21 is a CDKI that inhibits G<sub>1</sub> CDK&#x02013;cyclin complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In the present study, the down-regulation of Oct-4 in ES cells induced <italic>p21</italic> to a remarkable degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), in a time-dependent manner, both at the mRNA and protein levels. It is well known that p21 expression is regulated largely at the transcriptional level by a p53-dependent mechanism at the transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], which suggests that Oct-4 may regulate <italic>p21</italic> expression through the <italic>p53</italic> tumour suppressor gene. However, although ZHBTc4 ES cells did express p53, the down-regulation of Oct-4 did not significantly change p53 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Having demonstrated that <italic>p21</italic> expression is down-regulated by Oct-4 in ES cells, we attempted to determine whether this resulted from a direct effect of Oct-4 with regulatory element(s) in <italic>p21</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, the down-regulation of Oct-4 in ES cells increased <italic>p21</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D) and the introduction of increasing amounts of Oct-4 led to a reduction in <italic>p21</italic> promoter activity (up to 40% of promoter activity) in differentiated cells (HEK-293T cell line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E), suggesting that Oct-4 directly represses <italic>p21</italic> promoter activity. However, <italic>p21</italic> expression can also be regulated post-translationally by both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent proteasome-mediated degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Thus it would be interesting to determine whether Oct-4 is able to control p21 stability in ES cells and induce pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.</p><p>The expression of Oct-4 in doxycyclin-treated ZHBTc4 ES cells led to a consistent increase in the number of cells in S-phase, an effect that was not observed following the expression of EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Consistent with these results, the down-regulation of Oct-4 in ES cells also led to an increase in the number of cells in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). To clarify the contribution of the different functional domains of the Oct-4 protein to ES cell-cycle progression, we generated ES cell lines carrying functional domain deletion mutants of Oct-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Deletion of the N-terminal or C-terminal domain of Oct-4 reduced the number of cells in S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that the overall integrity of Oct-4 is required for its ability to stimulate cell-cycle progression in ES cells.</p><p>In conclusion, it is likely that Oct-4 contributes towards maintaining cells in an undifferentiated, pluripotent or totipotent state in two ways: (i) by activating certain key genes and (ii) by silencing others. The findings of the present study provide additional evidence that Oct-4 plays a key role in regulating the ES cell cycle positively, as well as maintaining ES cell pluripotency. Therefore Oct-4-mediated <italic>p21</italic> gene down-regulation may be a key mechanism for the stimulation of cell-cycle progression of the ICM.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>Jungwoon Lee and Jungho Kim designed and performed the research, and wrote and edited the manuscript.
