Furthermore, the occurrence of community acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is on the rise in this country and many others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>S. aureus </italic>has a multitude of virulence factors that allow for host immune evasion, adherence to host tissues, biofilm formation, toxin production, and dissemination during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As the biological functions of cellular components continue to be elucidated, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] more and more virulence factors are added to this extensive list. In a study designed to elucidate potential vaccine targets in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, Lorenz et al identified a protein, which they designated the immunodominant surface antigen B (IsaB), that elicited an immune response during MRSA septicemia. IsaB is a 19.5 kDa <italic>S. aureus </italic>protein with no significant homology to other proteins with known function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Another study demonstrated a mutation in the gene encoding IsaB in a hyper-virulent musculoskeletal isolate, leading the authors to suggest that mutation or loss of IsaB may increase immune evasion in the <italic>S. aureus </italic>isolate under investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Other labs have reported microarray data showing that <italic>isaB </italic>expression is increased in response to neutrophil exposure, in biofilms, under anaerobic conditions, and following internalization into human epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. All of these phenomena suggest that in spite of its role in eliciting an immune response, IsaB expression is induced during infection. Currently, IsaB is annotated as a putative virulence factor, however its function has yet to be determined.</p><p>Biofilms have been shown to be a critical component of certain <italic>S. aureus </italic>infections, as these structures confer increased survival of the bacteria under many stressful conditions such as low nutrient availability, antibiotic challenge, oxidative stress, and host immune defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The major intercellular adhesin in <italic>S. aureus </italic>biofilms is the polysaccharide poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), which is encoded by the intercellular adhesin locus (<italic>ica</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We and others have previously studied the regulation of PNAG production and <italic>ica </italic>expression at the transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. With the aim of characterizing post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>ica </italic>expression, we designed an RNA Affinity Chromatography assay to isolate proteins with high affinity for the 5'-untranslated region of the <italic>ica </italic>transcript. We isolated a single protein, IsaB. Subsequently, we found that IsaB did not play a role in regulation of <italic>ica </italic>expression, was not localized to the cytoplasm where it could potentially play a regulatory role but rather was secreted and partially associated with the bacterial cell surface, and bound to RNA, ssDNA, and dsDNA with no apparent sequence specificity. Because a number of studies have shown a role for extracellular DNA in biofilm formation, we hypothesized that the extracellular DNA-binding protein IsaB could play a role in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, we found that IsaB did not contribute to biofilm formation under a variety of conditions. This study is the first to assign a function to the putative virulence factor IsaB. The physiologic role of binding extracellular nucleic acids is still unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of IsaB by RNA Affinity Chromatography</title><p>We hypothesized that an RNA-binding protein could regulate <italic>ica </italic>expression at the post-transcriptional level through binding to the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR).

While IsaB has been referred to as a virulence factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the amino acid sequence does not display significant homology to other proteins of known function, and to date its function remains unknown. In this study we serendipitously discovered the nucleic acid-binding activity of IsaB in a RNA Affinity Chromatography assay designed to identify factors that regulate <italic>ica </italic>expression post-transcriptionally. However, further experiments indicated that while IsaB binds the transcript, it does not affect <italic>ica </italic>expression, and does not play a significant role in the post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>ica</italic>. Furthermore, IsaB was present in the spent medium and associated with the bacterial cell surface but was not found in the cytoplasm where it could function as a post-transcriptional regulatory factor.</p><p>To further characterize the RNA-binding activity of IsaB we used EMSAs and found that, while IsaB did bind RNA, the interaction was not sequence-specific and it was also capable of binding to single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. However, we did find that IsaB only binds to polymeric nucleic acids and not to deoxyribonucleotides, suggesting that the nucleic acid binding activity is not a side-effect of a nucleotide-binding site.</p><p>IsaB contains an amino-terminal signal peptide and is predicted by PSORTb to be secreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We found that indeed, IsaB is secreted into the spent medium, but a significant fraction was associated with the cell wall. According to analysis with PSORTb, IsaB lacks an LPXTG motif, so it is not immediately clear how it is retained on the cell surface.</p><p>In a recent study Rice et al found that extracellular DNA (eDNA) can contribute to the structural stability of biofilms in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and that DNase-induced degradation of the eDNA leads to dissolution of the biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, IsaB expression was found to be upregulated within biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which lead us to hypothesize that binding of eDNA by IsaB could play a role in the establishment or maturation of biofilms, which are a critical component of disease establishment and progression of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. We found, using fluorescently-labeled DNA, that IsaB does play a role in accumulation of extracellular DNA on the bacterial cell surface, however, under our experimental growth conditions, IsaB did not contribute to biofilm-forming capacity. Surprisingly, deletion of <italic>isaB </italic>actually increased biofilm formation slightly, but significantly, in LB containing 1% glucose. This suggests that the role of IsaB may differ depending upon the growth conditions. We are therefore currently exploring the possibility that IsaB may play a more significant role in biofilm formation under more physiologic conditions, and whether or not it contributes to virulence in an animal model of bacteremia.</p><p>IsaB elicits an immune response during sepsis, suggesting that it is expressed during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

However, it is not immediately clear how an extracellular DNA-binding protein could play a role in virulence. eDNA present at the site of an infection may come from a variety of sources including lysed neutrophils or neutrophils actively releasing NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps) or from lysed bacterial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. If IsaB does not play a role in biofilm formation, then binding of extracellular DNA to the cell surface could be a mechanism of immune evasion by mimickry or it could result in repulsive forces between the DNA-coated bacteria and the DNA in NETs. We are currently investigating these potential functions of IsaB.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>IsaB is a putative virulence factor and its expression is induced as a result of a variety of conditions related to the <italic>in vivo </italic>disease state. In the data presented here we show that IsaB is an extracellular nucleic acid binding protein with a greater affinity for dsDNA than for ssDNA or RNA. Using isogenic deletion mutants we were unable to demonstrate a role for IsaB on biofilm formation. Further studies are necessary to determine what role IsaB and its nucleic acid-binding activity play in establishment and/or progression of <italic>S. aureus </italic>infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>MN8 is a clinical <italic>S. aureus </italic>isolate from a Toxic Shock Syndrome patient, which was isolated by Dr. Patrick Schlievert (University of Minnesota, MN).
