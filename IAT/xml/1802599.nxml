Methylcytosine undergoes spontaneous deamination, at a rate much higher than cytosine, to generate thymine. In mammals, two repair enzymes, thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and methyl-CpG binding domain 4 (MBD4), have evolved to counteract the mutagenic effect of methylcytosines. Both recognize G/T mismatches arising from methylcytosine deamination and initiate base-excision repair that corrects them to G/C pairs. However, the mechanism by which the methylation status of the repaired cytosines is restored has remained unknown. We show here that the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a interacts with TDG. Both the PWWP domain and the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a are able to mediate the interaction with TDG at its N-terminus. The interaction affects the enzymatic activity of both proteins: Dnmt3a positively regulates the glycosylase activity of TDG, while TDG inhibits the methylation activity of Dnmt3a <italic>in vitro</italic>. These data suggest a mechanistic link between DNA repair and remethylation at sites affected by methylcytosine deamination.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA cytosine methylation is a common and rapidly evolving epigenetic mechanism among higher eukaryotic organisms with more complex genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). In mammalian genomes, 5% of the cytosines are methylated. Methylcytosines occur predominantly at CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is essential for normal development due to its important roles in genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, silencing of parasitic elements, regulation of tissue-specific gene expression and the maintenance of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). The distribution of methylated and unmethylated CpGs in genomic DNA is not random, but displays specific patterns in any given type of cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The generation of genomic methylation patterns is a dynamic process that requires demethylation and <italic>de novo</italic> methylation by the action of the two <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, during gametogenesis and early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Once the methylation patterns are created, they are perpetuated by the maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1, leading to somatic inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Aberrant methylation is known to contribute to tumorigenesis and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>However, methylcytosines are also a source of genomic instability because they are prone to hydrolytic deamination under physiological conditions. The deamination product of a methylcytosine is thymine, a naturally occurring base. If the mispaired thymine is not repaired, a C to T transition will be fixed following DNA replication. Since methylcytosines exist in large numbers throughout the mammalian genome (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> per haploid genome), they present a significant risk for mutagenesis. The mutation rate from methylcytosine to thymine is 10- to 50-fold higher than for other types of transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). One-third of all germ-line point mutations found in human diseases and an equal proportion of somatic mutations associated with cancer occur at CpG sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The methylated CpG sites in the tumor suppressor gene p53 are, for example, hot spots for mutation in carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, a specific base-excision repair pathway is devoted to the correction of G/T mismatches arising due to methylcytosine deamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The repair process is initiated by a DNA glycosylase, either thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) or methyl-CpG binding domain 4 (MBD4), that recognizes and excises the mispaired thymine from the ribose ring, generating an abasic residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). At the abasic site, a single nucleotide gap is then created by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE, also known as HAP1, APEX and Ref-1) that cleaves the phosphodiester bond 5&#x02032; of the baseless deoxyribose. The APE&#x02013;DNA complex is then channeled into an appropriate base-excision repair (BER) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The repair is completed by the concerted action of DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (POLB), XRCC1 and DNA ligase III (LIG3), which results in the replacement of the missing nucleotide and the establishment of the continuity of the DNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The question then arises as to how the original methylation state is restored to the cytosine left by base-excision repair. It was reported that cytosine incorporated by DNA repair is remethylated in a replication-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), but the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study we demonstrate that Dnmt3a interacts with TDG both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Functional assays with recombinant proteins indicate that Dnmt3a stimulates the TDG glycosylase activity whereas in turn TDG inhibits the methylation activity of Dnmt3a. The physical and functional interaction with TDG suggests that Dnmt3a might be the enzyme that remethylates the newly synthesized cytosine to ensure stable maintenance of methylation after base-excision repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>Mouse TDG was cloned into the expression vector pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma) and pCMV-Tag3C (Stratagene) to generate Flag- and myc-tagged proteins, respectively.

We consistently observed that co-expression of HA-Dnmt3a and myc-TDG resulted in a change of the distribution pattern of myc-TDG, which became concentrated in the heterochromatin domains where HA-Dnmt3a was located in the majority of co-transfected cells (over 60%).</p><p>To further investigate whether Dnmt3a can be targeted to a G/T mismatched site, a fluorescently-labeled DNA duplex containing a single G/T mismatch was transfected into 3T3 cells together with myc-TDG and HA-Dnmt3a. Signal from the G/T mismatch-containing oligoduplexes appeared strongly in the nucleus and weakly in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with previous observations with transfected DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Dnmt3a was mainly located in the nucleus when co-transfected with the mismatched oligo. However, it became distributed throughout the whole cell (in over 80% of cells) when co-transfected with both the G/T mismatch oligo and TDG (4th row). In contrast, both TDG and Dnmt3a remained nuclear when a control matched oligo was used (last row). Therefore, Dnmt3a is recruited to the cytoplasm in the presence of TDG and G/T mismatch-containing oligoduplexes. Although repair does not occur in the cytoplasm in normal cells, these data nevertheless indicate that Dnmt3a can be recruited to G/T mismatch sites through its association with TDG. The avidin&#x02013;biotin coupled DNA binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) further suggests a sequential binding of TDG and Dnmt3a onto G/T oligoduplexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction domains of Dnmt3a and TDG</title><p>Dnmt3a has a catalytic domain at the C-terminus, fused to a long regulatory region including a conserved PWWP domain, a PHD domain and an N-terminal part of &#x0223c;250 amino acids lacking sequence conservation [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>]. The PWWP domain is responsible for targeting the enzyme to heterochromatin in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) and the PHD domain mediates interaction with histone deacetylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p><p>To map the TDG-interacting domain of Dnmt3a, a deletion analysis was performed using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Fragments of Dnmt3a were expressed as fusion proteins with GAL4DB domain and tested for interaction with TDG fused with the GAL4 activation domain. Yeast expressing either the PWWP (270&#x02013;430 amino acid) or catalytic domains (592&#x02013;908 amino acid) could grow on the selective medium lacking His, Leu, Trp and adenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but neither the N-terminal part nor PHD domain endowed growth potential. Therefore, Dnmt3a appears to encompass two separate regions, the PWWP domain and the catalytic domain, either of which alone is sufficient for mediating the interaction with TDG. The TDG-interacting capacity of the two regions was confirmed by GST pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>TDG is a monofunctional glycosylase with the conserved catalytic domain spanning the major length of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). While a region from 99 to 347 amino acid encodes the G/U glycosylase activity, an additional N-terminal sequence of 43&#x02013;98 amino acid is required to process G/T mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). To map the interaction domain in TDG, GST pull-down assays were performed using the recombinant GST&#x02013;Dnmt3a fusion protein and <sup>35</sup>S-labeled TDG fragments synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, all five fragments from the N-terminal half of TDG were able to bind to Dnmt3a, while the C-terminal region (198&#x02013;397 amino acid) failed to do so. The N-terminal half contains at least two subdomains (1&#x02013;52 and 121&#x02013;205 amino acid), both of which can mediate interaction with Dnmt3a individually. Yeast two-hybrid assay confirmed the Dnmt3a-interacting capacity of the regions from the N-terminal half of TDG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Dnmt3a stimulates the glycosylase activity of TDG</title><p>Since the interaction of Dnmt3a and TDG involves their respective catalytic domains, we wanted to know whether they could functionally modulate each other's enzymatic activity. To this end, the glycosylase activity of TDG was measured in the presence and absence of purified Dnmt3a. We first expressed and purified recombinant His-tagged Dnmt3a and TDG from <italic>E.coli</italic>, and prepared a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotide duplex containing a G/T mismatch as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). APE, an endonuclease known to stimulate the TDG activity, was also purified and used for comparison.</p><p>The glycosylase activity assay is based on the fact that the excision of mismatched thymine by TDG leaves an abasic site where the DNA strand breaks under hot alkaline treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the amount of a 13mer break-down product increased when Dnmt3a was included in the reaction. Addition of 20 nM Dnmt3a resulted in a stimulation of TDG activity by 2.5-fold on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 2), and 100 nM Dnmt3a brought about a stimulation of 3.8-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 2) under standard conditions reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Moreover, the stimulatory effect appeared to be slightly stronger than that of APE (lanes 6 and 7). The fold stimulation by APE was consistent with previously reported data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). We have also observed that purified Dnmt3a alone showed no detectable glycosylase activity, ruling out the possibility of contamination with a potent bacterial glycosylase in the Dnmt3a preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 5). The reactions containing less than 100 nM Dnmt3a were made up to a similar volume with protein storage buffer, ensuring that the stimulatory effects were not due to alteration of salt or glycerol concentration. In addition, a similar degree of stimulation by Dnmt3a was also observed using a different reaction buffer containing 50 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes 11 and 12), ruling out any effects which might be due to salt in the preps.</p><p>Since the TDG activity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> was measured after 60 min of incubation, we next asked whether the stimulation of TDG by Dnmt3a could also occur in the initial phase of the reaction. Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), a fast initial reaction was seen in the first 5 min in the absence of Dnmt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). With the addition of 20 nM Dnmt3a, the reaction was accelerated by 2- to 4-fold as calculated from the measurements at the time points of 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 min. This observation suggests that the interaction with Dnmt3a may facilitate the binding of the TDG enzyme with the mismatch substrate and/or excision of the thymine.</p><p>To further examine whether the stimulation by Dnmt3a is specific for TDG, we tested its effect on other glycosylases, the <italic>E.coli</italic> uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) and its human homologue SMUG1. The glycosylase activity assay was conducted using the same DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) but containing a G/U mismatch instead of G/T. We found that Dnmt3a had no effect on the activity of UDG and SMUG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, upper panel, lanes 2&#x02013;5), while it stimulated the G/U activity of TDG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, upper panel, lanes 6 and 7). Moreover, the mouse DNA methyltransferase homologue Dnmt2 and bacterial methyltransferases M.SssI and M.HhaI did not stimulate the TDG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lower panel). Taken together, these results indicate that Dnmt3a specifically stimulates the catalytic activity of TDG.</p><p>It should be noted that the specific activity (0.05&#x02013;0.3 mol/h/mol enzyme) of our TDG enzyme preparation was similar to that reported by several other labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) but about 3- to 15-fold lower than that reported by Waters <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). It is likely that a significant fraction of TDG molecules were inactive, potentially due to protein misfolding. Therefore, we could not formally exclude the possibility that Dnmt3a may also stimulate TDG activity through promoting conversion of its inactive form into the active form. Nevertheless, the stimulatory effect of Dnmt3a, though to varying degrees, has been consistently observed for multiple batches of TDG enzyme (with different purity and specific basal activity) obtained with the same or slightly modified chromatography steps. Furthermore, absence of effect by Dnmt2 or a bacterial methyltransferase suggests that stimulation of TDG activity depends on a specific interaction with Dnmt3a.</p></sec><sec><title>TDG represses the methylation activity of Dnmt3a</title><p>Since the Dnmt3a-TDG interaction involves the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a, we next investigated whether TDG has any effect on the methylation activity of Dnmt3a. The <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation activity of Dnmt3a was measured by scintillation-counting of the incorporation of a <sup>3</sup>H-labeled methyl group into a PCR fragment in reactions with or without TDG. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the methyltransferase activity of Dnmt3a decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Incubating with an equimolar amount of TDG (33 nM) resulted in a reduction of Dnmt3a activity by 44% after 60 min, compared to the reaction without TDG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When TDG was in 2-fold excess (100 nM) over Dnmt3a, this reduced the rate of methyl transfer by 78%. TDG and other proteins were dialyzed in buffer without salt prior to the assay as it is known that Dnmt3a is sensitive to the NaCl concentration. The reactions with no TDG contained a similar volume of the dialysis buffer, ensuring that the inhibition was not due to any residual salt or glycerol present in the TDG enzyme preparation.</p><p>To confirm the inhibition of the Dnmt3a activity by TDG is specific, we tested the effect of other known Dnmt3a interaction partners on methylation. Dnmt3L is a general stimulatory factor for the two Dnmt3 <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferases and is essential for the establishment of genomic methylation patterns during germ cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Dnmt3L also interacts with Dnmt3a through the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). As expected, the incubation with an equimolar amount of Dnmt3L resulted in a 120% increase of the Dnmt3a activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, the heterochromatin protein HP1, which is known to interact with the PHD domain of Dnmt3a, had no effect on the methylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also tested the effect of TDG, if any, on two bacterial methyltransferases, M.SssI and M.HhaI. In both cases, no significant change in methylation activity was caused by the addition of TDG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data demonstrate that TDG functions as a repressor of Dnmt3a <italic>in vitro,</italic> although the exact molecular mechanism for the repression by TDG remains to be resolved. Presumably, TDG, but not HP1, may have an effect on the large mammalian enzyme by sterically hindering its binding to the DNA target.</p><p>Having shown the inhibitory effect of TDG on the activity of Dnmt3a <italic>in vitro</italic>, we then examined if TDG functions as a negative regulator of Dnmt3a <italic>in vivo</italic>. An episomal plasmid was transfected into 293 c18 cells with Dnmt3a and TDG constructs in varying amounts. The recovered plasmid was digested with the methylation-sensitive enzyme HhaI and Southern hybridization was carried out with a probe specific for the episomal plasmid. Three fragments of 1707, 738 and 189 bp would arise from the complete digestion when no methylation occurred; fragments of increased sizes show <italic>de novo</italic> methylation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, the fraction of larger-size fragments decreased when Dnmt3a was co-transfected with TDG (compare lanes 3 with 2). And when the amount of transfected TDG construct was increased by 1- and 2-fold, the fraction of fragments of increased sizes decreased further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, lanes 4, 5 and 7). This result shows that TDG can inhibit the activity of Dnmt3a <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we have shown that Dnmt3a can interact with TDG both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and have mapped the interaction domains in each protein. Both the PWWP domain and the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a are able to mediate the interaction with TDG at its N-terminus. The interaction mutually affects their respective enzyme activities: Dnmt3a stimulates the glycosylase activity of TDG while TDG represses the methylation activity of Dnmt3a. These results provide evidence for a possible coupling of cytosine methylation with the base-excision repair pathway.</p><p>Methylcytosines undergo spontaneous deamination at a much higher rate than cytosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The severity of the mutagenic threat posed by methylcytosine deamination is reflected in the existence of CpG islands in mammalian genomes, which are believed to arise due to the depletion of methylated CpG dinucleotides in the bulk of the genome during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The mutagenic consequence is also evident in the fact that mC to T conversions account for one-third of the mutations found in the tumor suppressor gene p53 and other human disease genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Mammals, like other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), have evolved mechanisms to counteract the mutagenic effect of methylcytosines. Of the eight mammalian glycosylases, TDG and MBD4 are the two enzymes that specialize in the correction of thymines in G/T mismatches to cytosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). TDG and MBD4 show very similar catalytic specificity in the excision of G/T mismatches in the CpG context, although their genes appear to be unrelated. The role of MBD4 in the elimination of deamination products in the context of a CpG dinucleotide has been confirmed in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>).</p><p>However, the consequences of methylcytosine deamination are not confined to mutations. Even when the mC&#x02192;T transition can be efficiently repaired back to cytosine, deamination itself still could have a profound impact on genome stability and gene expression. Both the restored cytosine at the mismatch site and those other newly-incorporated cytosines in the short-patch around it which are replaced by the action of the BER pathway need to be remethylated prior to the onset of DNA replication. If hemimethylated CpG sites in the repaired region are not converted into fully methylated sites, passive demethylation will occur after subsequent cell divisions. Our finding that Dnmt3a interacts with TDG, but not UDG, a uracil glycosylase which deals with the excision repair of cytosine deamination products, lends support to the idea that there is a need for remethylation of cytosines repaired from deaminated methylcytosines.</p><p>Our data show that TDG and Dnmt3a interact <italic>in vitro</italic> and that overexpression of Dnmt3a causes a significant change of TDG localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting it also interacts with Dnmt3a <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although co-localization has been consistently seen in several independent experiments, the overlap is only partial: one possible explanation is that the interaction with Dnmt3a is affected by post-translational modification of TDG such as sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) or it may reflect the experimental noise often seen when using co-transfected proteins. It is known that mismatched G/T is recognized by either TDG or MBD4, but transfected Dnmt3a seems to have a stronger inherent ability to localize to heterochromatin regions than transfected TDG. For the endogenous proteins interacting with other components of the repair pathway in a normal situation, the interaction domains may allow recruitment to occur in the other direction, with Dnmt3a recruited to the G/T mismatch site via interaction with either of the glycosylases. In support of this view, Dnmt3a can be recruited to the mismatch-containing oligoduplexes via association with TDG, which recognizes G/T mismatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Supporting a Dnmt3a-TDG interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>, Dnmt3a appears to enhance glycosylase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, possibly by facilitating the binding of TDG to the mismatch substrate and/or cleavage of the mismatched thymine. In this phase, the repressive effect of TDG on Dnmt3a could prevent a faulty transfer of methyl groups to nearby sequences. Then the second BER step ensues with the binding of the free abasic site by the APE DNA endonuclease, which has a higher affinity than TDG to the abasic DNA. Upon dissociation of TDG from the abasic site, Dnmt3a could remain at the repair site through interaction with another BER component, LIG3, the last enzyme of the short-patch BER pathway. It is noteworthy that Dnmt3a associates with LIG3 with even higher affinity compared with TDG (Supplementary Figure 1; P. Zhou and Y. Li, unpublished data). Cytosine remethylation must occur after the completion of base-excision repair by BER proteins: at this stage, TDG has left the repair site. The repressive effect on Dnmt3a doesn't exist anymore and so the methyltransfer process can proceed. Factors affecting the BER pathway or post-translational modification of TDG by sumoylation and acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>) may also play a role in the coordination of the repair and remethylation processes.</p><p>Dnmt3b also contains the conserved PWWP and catalytic domains shown to mediate the interaction of Dnmt3a with TDG. Yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays confirmed the physical interaction between Dnmt3b and TDG. Dnmt3b can also stimulate the activity of TDG (data not shown). Thus the two <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferases may both participate in the restoration of methylation status in base-excision repair.</p><p>The remethylation of cytosines is conceivably needed in a variety of DNA repair events involving strand re-synthesis in a methylated genomic region. In agreement with this, Dnmt1 was recently found to be recruited to sites of DNA damages induced by irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). However, the remethylation of cytosines restored at G/T mismatch sites is unlikely to be achieved by Dnmt1 since its recruitment to the repair site depends on PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>), which is absent from the polymerase &#x003b2;-dependent short-patch BER pathway predominantly operating at AP sites, which require incorporation of only a single nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). Consistent with this view, no interaction could be detected between Dnmt1 and TDG or LIG3 (Supplementary Figure 2).</p><p>Failure to remethylate might be an important contributor to the genomic hypomethylation observed in various diseases including cancer. The assessment of the biological significance of cytosine remethylation in disease as well as in normal development requires further investigation under physiological conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr G.

(<bold>A</bold>) Purified recombinant 6xHis-tagged Dnmt3a, APE and TDG proteins (Coomassie blue staining). The purity of Dnmt3a, APE and TDG was about 85, 90 and 80%, respectively, as determined by densitometry. Lower panel, the G/T mismatch-containing substrate (27 bp) used for the glycosylase activity assay. The upper T-containing strand was labeled with <sup>32</sup>P at the 5&#x02032; end. (<bold>B</bold>) Glycosylase activity assay for TDG in the absence and presence of Dnmt3a or APE. The reactions in lanes 1&#x02013;9 contained 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5&#x02009;mg/ml BSA and 10 nM substrate DNA. The reactions in lanes 10&#x02013;12 contained 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in addition to the above and show no difference, ruling out any possibility that the stimulation is only due to the addition of salt from the Dnmt3a prep. All reactions were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 1 h. The excision of unpaired thymine resulted in breakage of the upper strand upon subsequent hot alkaline treatment. The generation of the 13mer breakage product was examined by separation on a denaturing gel followed by quantification with phosphoimaging. The lower panel is a bar graph representation of TDG enzymatic assays. The activity of TDG alone was set to 1. The relative activity (given on the <italic>y</italic>-axis) for each reaction is the average of three experiments &#x000b1;SD. (<bold>C</bold>) The kinetics of the base-excision reaction of TDG with and without Dnmt3a. DNA substrate (10 nM) was incubated with TDG (4 nM) alone or with Dnmt3a (20 nM) in the reaction buffer without NaCl for different time periods indicated on the top. The lower panel is a line graph representation in which the activity for each reaction at different time points is the average of three experiments &#x000b1;SD. (<bold>D</bold>) Specific stimulation of TDG glycosylase activity by Dnmt3a. The glycosylase reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30&#x000b0;C. The upper panel shows the lack of stimulation of two other glycosylases UDG and SMUG1 by Dnmt3a. The DNA substrate used here had the same sequence as shown in (A) except that a G/U mismatch was incorporated in the place of G/T. The lower panel shows the absence of stimulation by M.SssI, M.HhaI and Dnmt2 on the glycosylase activity of TDG.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl1052f4"/></fig><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>TDG represses the methylation activity of Dnmt3a.

A total of 0.5 &#x003bc;g of the assay plasmid p220.2 was co-transfected with different combinations of Dnmt3a and TDG constructs (indicated on the top). The amount of Dnmt3a construct transfected was 0.5 &#x003bc;g. The amount of TDG construct ranged from 0.5 (1&#x000d7;) to 1.5 &#x003bc;g (3&#x000d7;). The methylation status of the recovered assay plasmid was analyzed by digestion with the methylation-sensitive enzyme HhaI followed by Southern hybridization.
