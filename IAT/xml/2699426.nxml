Dectin-1 plays an important role in immunity to fungi by mediating phagocytic clearance of fungal particles and inducing transcription of innate response genes. We show here that the two processes are linked and that Dectin-1 signalling for inflammation is attenuated by phagocytosis. Blocking Dectin-1 ligand-dependent internalization using either actin polymerization or dynamin inhibitors, large non-phagocytosable &#x003b2;-glucan particles or poorly phagocytic cells leads in all cases to enhanced and sustained activation of downstream signalling pathways and culminates in production of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These findings establish the importance of phagocytosis not only in the clearance of pathogens, but also in the modulation of pattern-recognition receptor signalling and strongly suggest that internalization is the first step to attenuation of Dectin-1-mediated pro-inflammatory responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DC</kwd><kwd>Dectin-1</kwd><kwd>Phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>Syk</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Direct recognition of microbes by pattern-recognition receptors on DC and M&#x003a6; is central to initiating immune responses against infectious organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

The latter, together with NFAT and transcription factors activated by MAP kinases downstream of Syk, regulates the expression of a plethora of innate response genes, including those encoding co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.

To what extent Dectin-1 internalization during phagocytosis impacts on signalling for innate gene induction remains unclear.

Some investigators, including ourselves, have previously utilized curdlan, a large particulate (1,3)-&#x003b2;-glucan from <italic>Alcaligenes faecalis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, to demonstrate that triggering of the Dectin-1/Syk pathway independently of TLR signalling promotes DC activation, including secretion of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12p40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Others have used &#x003b2;-glucan microparticles (Glu-mp), a highly purified microparticulate form of (1,3)-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucan from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, to stimulate M&#x003a6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In those cells, Glu-mp induces phosphorylation of both Syk kinase and its substrate SLP-76 but does not lead to cytokine and chemokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, Glu-mp potently synergises with TLR agonists in promoting the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and the production of TNF-&#x003b1;, MIP-1<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and MIP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. These studies suggested that distinct types of &#x003b2;-glucan vary in their ability to trigger Dectin-1-dependent innate responses and/or that DC and M&#x003a6; possess intrinsically distinct responses to Dectin-1 engagement.</p><p>To test the former hypothesis, we compared the ability of Glu-mp and curdlan with activate DC, using production of inflammatory cytokines as the major readout. First, we confirmed that, like curdlan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, Glu-mp preparations acted as specific ligands for Dectin-1. We found that fluorescent Glu-mp binds to Dectin-1-transfected HEK293 cells but not to the parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>, left). In addition, fluorescent Glu-mp bound to WT bone-marrow-derived DC (BMDC) but not to cells derived from Dectin-1-deficient mice, indicating that DC do not possess compensatory receptors for binding &#x003b2;-glucans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>, right). To directly compare the ability of curdlan and Glu-mp preparations to stimulate DC, cells were cultured with curdlan or Glu-mp and the levels of IL-6, IL-2, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-12p40 in supernatants were measured after 16 h. Glu-mp induced much lower levels of cytokines when compared with curdlan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). Extensive titration studies established that even when used at maximal dose, Glu-mp induced at best one-hundredth to one-tenth the amount of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 that could be elicited by an optimal dose of curdlan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). Thus, Glu-mp is markedly weaker than curdlan at stimulating DC. This is consistent with the data obtained with M&#x003a6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and therefore suggests that the differences previously noted for Glu-mp and curdlan are not only attributable to the use of different cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Glu-mp is weaker than curdlan at inducing inflammatory cytokine production.

In contrast, Glu-mp size is approximately 1 &#x003bc;m and, even though the particles have a tendency to form larger aggregates (5 &#x003bc;m), they are readily phagocytosed by either M&#x003a6; or DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). To examine if internalization of Glu-mp affects its ability to stimulate DC activation, we blocked phagocytosis using actin polymerization inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Like binding, the uptake of Glu-mp was Dectin-1-dependent and was completely blocked by pre-treatment of DC with latrunculin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). Notably, such blockade converted Glu-mp into a potent stimulus for induction of IL-6, IL-2, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-12p40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). The effect was not restricted to latrunculin A as it could be mimicked with other actin polymerization inhibitors such as cytochalasin D, all of which rendered Glu-mp as potent a stimulus as curdlan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B and D</xref>, and data not shown). Interestingly, the potency of the latter was paradoxically reduced by DC treatment with the same drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>), possibly because actin inhibition impairs the ability of DC to migrate and form conjugates with the large curdlan particles (data not shown). The potentiation of the Glu-mp stimulatory activity by actin polymerization inhibitors was not due to the presence of contaminating TLR agonists in the drug preparations, which acted in a synergistic fashion with Dectin-1 signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, because it was still observed when using MyD88-deficient or MyD88/TRIF doubly deficient BMDC that lack all TLR signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C and D</xref>). In addition, the stimulatory activity of Glu-mp in the presence of the drugs remained strictly Dectin-1-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>), as expected. In contrast, the response to a control TLR9 agonist such as CpG was Dectin-1-independent and MyD88/TRIF-dependent (data not shown). These data indicate that manipulation of actin-dependent endocytic processes markedly affects the ability of Dectin-1 agonists to induce pro-inflammatory responses. In this regard, the previously noted potency of curdlan as an innate stimulus appears to relate to its ability to form large particles that cannot be internalized.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Block of phagocytosis converts Glu-mp into a potent DC activator.

Because this reagent needs to be used in serum-free conditions, which are not compatible with BMDC survival (data not shown), we utilized HEK293 cells stably transfected with Dectin-1. Like DC, such transfectants avidly internalized Glu-mp and this was fully blocked in the presence of dynasore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>). Notably, the same cells stimulated with Glu-mp in the presence of dynasore showed strong and sustained phosphorylation of ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3D</xref>). In contrast to latrunculin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>), dynasore did not induce ERK phosphorylation by itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3D</xref>), supporting the notion that the strong MAPK activation observed is selectively attributable to blockade of internalization.</p><p>Finally, to diminish particle internalization while avoiding possible non-specific effects associated with chemical inhibitors, we tested cells with low phagocytic activity. In contrast to Dectin-1-expressing HEK293 cells, the B-cell hybridoma LK35.2 does not avidly internalize Glu-mp even after transfection with Dectin-1 (data not shown). We therefore stimulated LK cells expressing Dectin-1 with Glu-mp and curdlan at different doses and evaluated their ability to produce IL-2 as a readout of Dectin-1/Syk activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Notably, in contrast to its low stimulatory activity on DC, Glu-mp acted as a significant inducer of cytokine production by Dectin-1-expressing LK cells, being only slightly weaker than curdlan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3E</xref>). Thus, in poorly phagocytic cells, curdlan and Glu-mp act as comparable agonists for Dectin-1-mediated inflammatory responses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>In this study, we have used two specific ligands, curdlan and Glu-mp, to explore the effect of Dectin-1 internalization on downstream responses. We show here that curdlan is much more potent than Glu-mp at stimulating pro-inflammatory gene expression in DC and that this correlates with the inability of the cells to ingest curdlan particles. Notably, we show that Glu-mp can be converted into a &#x0201c;curdlan-like&#x0201d; stimulus simply by blocking phagocytic uptake, using dynamin or actin polymerization inhibitors, or by using poorly phagocytic cells unable to efficiently internalize Glu-mp. Notably, during the revision of this paper, complementary results were reported by Rosas <italic>et al</italic>., who similarly conclude that Dectin-1-mediated pro-inflammatory responses are associated with &#x0201c;frustrated phagocytosis&#x0201d; of &#x003b2;-glucan-containing particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Taken together, the results from the two studies suggest that internalization of Dectin-1 following interaction with ligand leads to attenuation of signalling pathways involved in innate gene induction. This does not exclude the possibility that Dectin-1 may still signal inside the endosome for alternative responses like reactive oxygen species production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Nevertheless, our data suggest that Dectin-1 behaves like another Syk-coupled receptor, the BCR, in that it signals primarily from the cell surface for induction of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The explanation for this phenomenon remains unclear even in the case of the BCR but it could be that phosphatases involved in attenuation of the signal have better access to Dectin-1 once the receptor is internalized or that the assembly or stability of signalling complexes is physically disrupted by receptor endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Our observations on the regulation of Dectin-1 signalling may therefore be particularly relevant for understanding the role of innate immune receptors such as C-type lectins that play a dual role in microbe phagocytosis and in inducing inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice, MyD88-deficient mice (a gift from Shizuo Akira, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), and TRIF&#x000d7;MyD88 doubly deficient mice were bred at CRUK.

After centrifugation, the cell pellet was lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> plus a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 30 min on ice. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation and quantitated by protein assay (Bio Rad). For Western blotting, a fixed amount of total protein was mixed with sample buffer (0.125 M Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), and resolved by 4&#x02013;20% acrylamide gradient Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). After transferring to PDVF membrane (Millipore), proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting and visualized by ECL (Pierce).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded by Cancer Research UK.
