Here, we report that androgen receptor knockout (ARKO) mice are neutropenic and susceptible to acute bacterial infection, whereas castration only results in moderate neutrophil reduction in mice and humans. Androgen supplement can restore neutrophil counts via stabilizing AR in castrated mice, but not in ARKO and testicular feminization mutant (Tfm) mice. Our results show that deletion of the AR gene does not influence myeloid lineage commitment, but significantly reduces the proliferative activity of neutrophil precursors and retards neutrophil maturation. CXCR2-dependent migration is also decreased in ARKO neutrophils as compared with wild-type controls. G-CSF is unable to delay apoptosis in ARKO neutrophils, and ARKO mice show a poor granulopoietic response to exogenous G-CSF injection. In addition, AR can restore G-CSF&#x02013;dependent granulocytic differentiation upon transduction into ARKO progenitors. We further found that AR augments G-CSF signaling by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and also by sustaining Stat3 activity via diminishing the inhibitory binding of PIAS3 to Stat3. Collectively, our findings demonstrate an essential role for AR in granulopoiesis and host defense against microbial infection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Granulopoiesis is a dynamic process leading to the production of 120 billion granulocytes daily in humans; its synthetic capacity can be increased at least 10-fold in response to certain stress conditions, such as infection. Granulopoiesis follows an orchestrated program of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, resulting in the expansion of a small pool of stem cells that evolve from granulocytic progenitors/precursors to mature granulocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant type of granulocyte, whereas eosinophils and basophils are much rarer. Originating from stem cells and progenitors, neutrophils in the bone marrow are comprised of a precursor pool and a storage pool. Peripheral blood neutrophils, which are postmitotic, consist of a free circulating pool and a marginal pool.</p><p>Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) plays a major role in regulating granulopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). G-CSF not only stimulates the proliferation of granulocytic precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), but also prolongs neutrophil survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) and reduces the mean transit time from granulocytic progenitors/precursors to mature granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). The importance of G-CSF in granulopoiesis was demonstrated in G-CSF KO mice. These mice only have 20% of the normal circulating neutrophils and a correspondingly small neutrophil precursor pool in their bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>The biological action of androgens is mediated through the androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-inducible nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of target genes at the transcriptional level via binding to an androgen-response element. Protein kinase A activators, such as cAMP, could activate AR transactivation activity in an androgen-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). In addition, AR could be activated in a ligand-independent manner by epidermal growth factor, Her2/Neu, insulin-like growth factor 1, keratinocyte growth factor, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Another study also suggested that activated G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors could induce ligand-independent AR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). On the other hand, it has been suggested that a nongenomic effect of AR may occur through the interaction with c-Src to induce the MAPK signal cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). However, transcription-independent functions of AR remain largely unclear.</p><p>The AR gene is located on the X chromosome and plays an important role in male sexual differentiation and pubertal sexual maturation, the maintenance of spermatogenesis, and male gonadotropin regulation. Phenotype analysis shows that AR knockout (ARKO) male mice exhibited a femalelike external appearance, including a vagina with a blind end, without penis and scrotum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Male reproductive organs, including seminal vesicles, vas deferens, epididymis, and prostate, were lacking in ARKO male mice. Their testes are significantly smaller and serum testosterone concentrations are lower in ARKO male mice compared with WT mice. Also, spermatogenesis is arrested at pachytene spermatocytes in ARKO male mice. In female ARKO mice, retarded development of mammary glands with reduced ductal branching is shown in the prepubertal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). The ovarian dysfunction and the lower mean number of pups per litter were observed in adult ARKO female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In addition to reproductive defects, the number/size of adipocytes and the body weight were also found to be decreased in ARKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that AR broadly expresses in neutrophil-lineage cells from the myeloblast stage to the mature neutrophil stage with no difference in the pattern of AR expression between male and female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Androgen was found to stimulate proliferation of committed erythrocytic and granulocytic precursors in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and accelerate recovery of leukocytes after radiation or chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Clinical observations with androgens in the treatment of aplastic anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), Fanconi's anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), and during therapy with myelosuppressive agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) suggest that androgen might increase neutrophil production. A clinical study with polycystic ovary syndrome patients who have high serum androgen levels showed higher neutrophil counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), also suggesting that androgen/AR might be associated with granulopoiesis. However, it is still unclear how androgen and AR regulate neutrophil homeostasis.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Targeted disruption of the AR gene in ARKO mice</title><p>Because male infertility is observed in testicular feminization mutant (Tfm) mice, which carry an unstable truncated AR mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), it is impossible to generate female homologous AR deletion mice by conventional gene disruption methods. To solve this difficulty, we used the Cre&#x02013;loxP technique to generate a mouse model with the targeted disruption of AR (ARKO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). We successfully generated ARKO mice of both genders and WT littermates, and further used these mice to investigate if loss of AR influences neutrophil production. In ARKO mice, the deletion of exon 2 in AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) results in a splice between exon 1 and exon 3, creating two sequential nonsense mutations at new amino acid positions 533 and 534, leading to premature termination of the AR protein. RT-PCR analyses of total RNA extracted from isolated bone marrow neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) showed that the mRNA from ARKO neutrophils lacked the 305-bp fragment from exon 2 of AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), evidence that the intact AR is not expressed in ARKO neutrophils and precursors. Intracellular analysis of endogenous AR protein by flow cytometry further confirmed that AR protein expression occurs in WT, but not ARKO, bone marrow neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>AR-targeted disruption and analysis of peripheral neutrophils in ARKO mice.</bold> (A) Schematic representation of murine AR protein domains and corresponding exons in AR mRNA.

On the basis of forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), FACS analyses of peripheral blood leukocytes showed that a high-SSC population (i.e., a granulocyte population) was barely detectable in ARKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Using FACS analysis with neutrophil-specific monoclonal antibodies (clone 7/4) and anti-CD11b antibodies, we found that only 3% of leukocytes were neutrophils in ARKO mice, in contrast to 26% neutrophils in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Neutrophils were rarely found in cytospin smears of blood leukocytes from ARKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). As shown by examination of blood smears with Wright-Giemsa staining, male and female ARKO mice have normal white blood cell counts, but very low percentages of neutrophils in peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Examining blood smears from Tfm mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>), we confirmed that loss of AR results in a significantly reduced neutrophil abundance in peripheral leukocytes. Automated blood analysis revealed that the numbers of total white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets remained comparable in ARKO mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I A</xref>). The mean differential ratio of peripheral lymphocytes in ARKO mice was increased from 75 to 94% without obvious alterations in monocyte and eosinophil numbers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I B</xref>). However, there was a significant reduction of neutrophils in blood compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I B</xref>). These results suggest that the AR might play a critical role in sustaining a normal number of circulating neutrophils in vivo.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table I.</label><caption><p>Blood and bone marrow analysis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood/bone marrow</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WT</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ARKO</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Statistics</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A.

Using colony-forming assays, we discovered that adding G-CSF, GM-CSF, macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), IL-3, and IL-6 induced similar levels of colony formation in ARKO bone marrow cells and WT cells in low-androgen methylcellulose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Adding DHT did not influence colony numbers induced by G-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These results suggest that the populations of early granulocytic and monocytic progenitor cells are comparable in WT and ARKO bone marrow cells. Thus, we conclude that neutrophil lineage commitments in ARKO mice must be similar to those in WT mice. In addition, using FACS analyses, we found that the abundance of both common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs) in bone marrow is also comparable between WT and ARKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Using Wright-Giemsa staining of bone marrow smears, we found that fewer isolated bone marrow neutrophils from ARKO mice than from WT mice had segmented nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Differential counting of bone marrow cells showed that ARKO mice had a decrease in myelocytes/metamyelocytes and a marked decrease in mature neutrophils as compared with bone marrow cells from WT mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I C</xref>).

In contrast, colonies from ARKO GMPs infected with retroviruses expressing functional AR consisted of more mature neutrophils, suggesting that the defects in neutrophil maturation resulting from ablation of AR can be rescued by AR overexpression. Again, we found that adding androgen did not result in an additional rescue on neutrophil maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Also, we infected WT GMPs with retroviruses carrying AR-small interfering (si)RNA to see if knockdown of endogenous AR retards neutrophil differentiation. We confirmed the AR-siRNA knockdown efficiency with reporter assays (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082521/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>) and immunoblot analyses of AR protein expression in cells infected with retroviruses carrying AR-siRNA and scramble siRNA control (Fig. S2). Colonies from sorted WT GMPs infected with retroviruses carrying AR-siRNA and GFP showed fewer mature neutrophils than those infected with retroviruses carrying scrambled siRNA and GFP or GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). These results are consistent with the ARKO mouse data, suggesting that knockdown of endogenous AR by siRNA in GMPs could retard neutrophil maturation. Results from these complementary methods of AR manipulation in cultured cells are consistent with our in vivo ARKO mice data showing that loss of AR results in retardation of neutrophil differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced proliferative activity in neutrophil precursors in bone marrow of ARKO mice</title><p>We next examined granulocytic proliferation via analysis of the cell cycling status of granulocytes within bone marrow, by labeling cells with anti&#x02013;Gr-1 antibodies and propidium iodide.

Cells derived from the neutrophil precursor pool can be labeled with BrdU because these cells are proliferating and have matured into granulocytes, which are then released from the bone marrow into the circulation. At 96 h after the injection, the BrdU-labeled granulocytes reached a maximum in the peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). It is known that BrdU labeling intensity is diluted by half with every cell division after BrdU incorporation. Consequently, by tracking the changes in relative BrdU intensity, we can determine how many division cycles the neutrophils from precusor cells have undergone. Cells in the BrdU<sup>bright</sup> region correspond to granulocytes that incorporated BrdU in their last mitosis, whereas those in the BrdU<sup>dim</sup> region have gone through one or more divisions after BrdU incorporation.

We then examined survival of mature bone marrow neutrophils in vitro and found that 25% of ARKO neutrophils were apoptotic cells as compared with 19% in WT cells in culture without G-CSF treatment, indicating that ARKO neutrophils are moderately more susceptible to spontaneous apoptosis than WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>).

We observed that ARKO mice had lower increasing rate of blood neutrophils in response to G-CSF as compared with WT mice. These results suggest that there might be an inhibition to G-CSF signaling in AR-deficit myeloid cells. Using real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR), we measured the mRNA expression of G-CSF&#x02013;downstream target genes, such as SOCS3, flotillin, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor-like 2, glycerol kinase, and complement component 3a receptor 1, and found their mRNA expressions were decreased in ARKO granulocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>).

The PIAS3 interaction with AR possibly occurs through the PIAS3 N terminus, which contains a LXXLL motif, an &#x003b1;-helical protein interaction module that mediates interactions between AR coregulators and AR.

This result suggests that loss of AR in ARKO granulocytes results in increased PIAS3-mediated sequestering of pY-Stat3, leading to the suppression of G-CSF signaling. A reporter assay further showed that suppression of constitutively active Stat3 (CA-Stat3) transactivation by PIAS3 was relieved by AR in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>). Notably, the major induction of Stat3 reporter is through increasing AR and is only slightly enhanced by adding androgen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>), suggesting that androgen is not required for the AR's rescue of stat3 activity from the inhibition by PIAS3.</p><p>Stat3 activation has been demonstrated to promote differentiation of myeloid cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>).

To assess the expression of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines in the current study, we used Q-PCR to measure the mRNA levels in WT and ARKO granulocytes. ARKO cells had lower levels of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA, and several chemokines than WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>), suggesting that reduced production of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines might influence the functions of neutrophils or other leukocytes through autocrine or paracrine pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>ARKO neutrophils show reduced neutrophil migration in response to CXCR2 ligands, but exhibit normal neutrophil degranulation</title><p>The chemokine receptor CXCR2 plays an important role in neutrophil migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Neutrophil chemoattractants macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and KC/CXCL1 can specifically bind to CXCR2, whereas fMLP signals through a different G protein&#x02013;coupled receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). To test the migration capability of ARKO neutrophils, we examined the chemotactic response toward MIP-2, KC, and fMLP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>, ARKO neutrophils demonstrated reduced migration activities toward the chemoattractants MIP-2 and KC compared with WT cells; however, ARKO and WT neutrophils had similar responses to fMLP. It has been shown that lack of Stat3 can impair CXCR2-dependent neutrophil migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>), and our results are correlated with that finding because the Stat3 activity is mostly inhibited in ARKO neutrophils.</p><p>We then examined the release of &#x003b2;-glucuronidase and lactoferrin as the markers of primary and secondary granules from isolated mature neutrophils after stimulation.

At 12 h after injection, all 10 ARKO mice showed signs of severe infection, including diarrhea, hunchback, imbalance, ruffled fur, and eye infection, but only 3 out of 10 WT mice exhibited signs of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 F</xref>). Moreover, all 10 ARKO mice were dead within 36 h, and only 1 WT mouse died within that time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 G</xref>). All remaining WT mice were still alive at 60 h.

Other evidences to support our hypothesis include the following: (a) Exogenous androgen can restore neutrophil counts in castrated WT mice, but not ARKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C&#x02013;E</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) Female ARKO mice have neutropenia, but WT female mice, with 10-fold less androgen levels compared with male, still maintain normal neutrophil counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) Our mechanistic studies indicate that AR reduces the inhibition of PIAS3 to Stat3 transcriptional activity, and adding androgen only mildly enhances the AR effect on Stat3 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) Without adding androgen, AR overexpression still increases granulocytic differentiation in colony formation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). With these observations, we believe that AR confers a direct and more profound effect than androgen. We note with interest that neutropenia resulting from AR ablation contrasts with the effect of knocking out the estrogen receptor &#x003b2;. The estrogen receptor &#x003b2; KO mice show an overproduction of mature granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). These opposing effects on granulopoiesis suggest that both AR and ER are required to maintain neutrophil homeostasis.</p><p>In vitro and transgenic mouse studies have demonstrated that Stat3 plays an essential role in G-CSF&#x02013;dependent granulopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Moreover, several reports have shown that SOCS3 KO mice, in which Stat3 activity is persistent, developed severe neutrophilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). Paradoxically, mice with targeted deletion of the Stat3 gene in hematopoietic cells were also found to develop neutrophilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). Nevertheless, ERK1/2 hyperphosphorylation was found in bone marrow cells of Stat3 conditional KO mice, and it has been shown to contribute to neutrophilia in those animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). It is possible that the ERK1/2 hyperactivation results from SHP&#x02013;Grb2&#x02013;Src binding to available Stat3 docking sites on G-CSF receptor and overactivating the Ras&#x02013;Raf&#x02013;ERK signaling cascade. This possible signal crossover has been suggested in some reports showing that G-CSFR truncated mutants lacking the receptor C terminus, which contains tyrosine Y764 (the default docking site for SHP-2/Grb2), still have the ability to activate p21Ras via the SHP/Grb2 route linked to Y704 (the stat3 docking site) of the G-CSFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>). Clearly, further investigation is still required to determine the precise role of Stat3 in neutrophil development.</p><p>Several KO models have been established for genes involved in the regulation of myelopoiesis. C/EBP&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have circulating myeloblast-like cells but lack mature neutrophils in vivo at birth. Although it was found that a lower PU.1:C/EBP&#x003b1; ratio directs granulocytic differentiation over macrophage differentiation in myeloid cell fate determination, a PU.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice study demonstrated that PU.1 is not essential for neutrophil lineage commitment, but is necessary for normal development, maturation, and function of neutrophils. Gfi<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are severely neutropenic and accumulate immature monocytic cells in blood and bone marrow. We found the mRNA levels of PU.1, C/EBP&#x003b1;, and Gfi in ARKO bone marrow neutrophils are comparable to those detected in WT neutrophils (unpublished data), indicating that C/EBP&#x003b1;, PU.1, and Gfi might not account for the granulopoietic defect observed in ARKO mice. Notably, a few mature neutrophils can still be observed in G-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, G-CSFR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and G-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>M-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>), suggesting that a myeloid-CSF independent mechanism exists in basal granulopoiesis. It might be interesting to further study whether AR also modulates a myeloid&#x02013;CSF-independent pathway.</p><p>Androgens can stimulate erythropoiesis and have been used clinically for treatment of aplastic anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). However, our data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I A</xref>) indicate that red blood cell numbers and hemoglobin levels in WT and ARKO mice are similar, suggesting that AR is not required for steady-state erythrocyte production under physiological conditions. These results, however, are at odds with early reports showing that androgens could stimulate erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>). The diverse effect on erythropoiesis by different androgen derivatives is indicative of the complexity of androgen control in erythropoiesis. 5&#x003b1;-DHT binds to the AR and might stimulate erythropoiesis indirectly by increasing levels of erythropoietin, whereas 5&#x003b2; epimers (5&#x003b2;-DHT and etiocholanolone) do not bind to the AR, yet effectively increase the number of erythropoietic progenitor cells, thereby also enhancing erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref>). It will be interesting to study if androgen stimulates erythropoiesis through an AR-independent pathway.</p><p>In summary, the data presented here indicate AR is essential for steady-state granulopoiesis. Further studies that explore potential cross talk between AR and other myeloid regulators in granulopoiesis might help reveal a better understanding of how cell signaling networks tightly control neutrophil homeostasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>Construction of targeting vectors and generation of the chimera founder mice have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).
