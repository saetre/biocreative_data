Six repetitive sequences are present in this gene region; five of them are Alu family members with an approximate length of 300 base pairs, and the other consists of a portion of an Alu family sequence. Two of these Alu family members are located in the 5'-flanking region of the gene, and the remaining four within the intervening sequences. These Alu family sequences constitute inverted repeats in the intervening sequences as well as in the 5'-flanking region of the gene.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00374-0057-a" xlink:role="1474"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00374-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1471"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00374-0055.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1472"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00374-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1473"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00374-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1474"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00374-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1475"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00374-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1476"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00374-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1477"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00374-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1478"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00374-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1479"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
