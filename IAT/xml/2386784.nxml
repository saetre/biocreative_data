These are retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells (HCs), amacrine cells, bipolar cells and photoreceptors. In the mature retina, these cell types are positioned within distinct laminas and can be further divided into subtypes based on morphology, neurochemical properties or function. At the end of the 19<sup>th </sup>century, Ram&#x000f3;n y Cajal recognized this complex lamination and morphological richness of the retina as well as identified retinal subtypes based on morphology. Today, neuronal subtypes are defined and distinguished by molecular and functional criteria rather than by morphology. Approximately 50&#x02013;70 neuronal subtypes can be identified in the mature retina depending on the species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Horizontal cells, which are the focus of this study, have been found in all vertebrate retinas from fish to man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. They are interneurons situated between photoreceptors and bipolar cells and form synapses with both cell types. In the chick retina, HCs form a distinct layer of cells that we will refer to as the horizontal cell layer (HCL), in the outermost part of the inner nuclear layer (INL). Two kinds of HCs are found in vertebrate retinas; axon-bearing and axon-less HCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. An exception are retinas from several rodents, including mice, where only one HC type is identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In several species of fish, turtles, birds and mammals (including primates) a third HC subtype have been identified or suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Regardless of the actual number of HC subtypes, the axon-bearing HC is present in all species and additional subtypes are axon-less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The chick retina has three HC subtypes that have been identified based on their distinct morphological appearances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. One is the axon-bearing "brush-shaped" HC (also denoted H1 or Type I) and the two others are axon-less HCs, denoted "stellate" (or H2/Type II) and "candelabrum-shaped" (or H3/Type III) HCs. The brush-shaped HC axon-terminus mainly connects to rod photoreceptors, whereas the dendritic trees of all three HCs mainly form connections with cone photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This functional organisation appears to be conserved within vertebrate retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>A rich literature on the morphological and functional properties of HC subtypes exists but less is known about the developmental events underlying their generation. Recent studies have demonstrated that transcription factors such as Foxn4, Ptf1a and Prox1 are pivotal for the generation of the axon-bearing HCs in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and retinas deficient of the cell cycle inhibitors Ink4d and Kip1 overproduce those HCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition to intrinsic regulators like these, extrinsic factors are known to modulate different aspects of retinal development including proliferation, determination, differentiation and cell survival/death. Members of the transforming growth factor &#x003b2;/bone morphogenetic protein (TGF&#x003b2;/BMP) family of growth factors are known to function as modulators during neuronal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and an involvement of these molecules during the generation of retinal neurons have been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Follistatin which is an endogenous inhibitor of activin, TGF-&#x003b2; 1, GDF-11, and several other TGF&#x003b2;/BMP molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], is known to be expressed in the developing retina and pigment epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study indicated that the generation of HCs may be affected by follistatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] since Prox1+ cells were found scattered at ectopic locations following virus mediated over-expression of follistatin in the developing retina.</p><p>The aim of this study was to gain further understanding of how and when HC subtypes are generated. We have molecularly characterized HC subtypes and found that the transcription factors Lim1 and Isl1 are expressed in axon-bearing and axon-less HC subtypes, respectively. We demonstrate that the axon-bearing and axon-less HC subpopulations are molecularly defined early in development, have different but overlapping birth dates, migrate to the HCL at different times and that their relative numbers are not adjusted by apoptosis. Endogenous follistatin expression is high during the earliest phase of retinal development, with levels dropping sharply at the time of HC generation. Moreover, we show that follistatin overexposure at the time of HC-generation causes an increase in both the early-generated Lim1+ axon-bearing and late Isl1+ axon-less HCs when analyzed at embryonic day 9/Hamburger &#x00026; Hamilton stage 35 (E9, st35, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). Combined, these results imply that the two HC subgroups are defined early and are generated consecutively from a progenitor cell population that is sensitive to follistatin inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Newly generated HCs express either Lim1 or Isl1 and constitute equally large populations</title><p>To identify immature HC subtypes several available antibodies against molecules known to be involved in neuronal determination were surveyed for reactivity to HCs. In addition to the transcription factors Prox1 and Lim1 that are expressed by immature HCs, Isl1 was identified as a novel transcription factor expressed in immature HCs. The result of the antibody survey is reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. First we analysed whether all HCs expressed Prox1 and Pax6, two well established HC markers, using flat-mounted retina sectioned through the HCL. The analysis showed that all cells located within the HCL expressed Prox1 and Pax6 (not shown). Stage 35 (E9) was selected for further analysis since the HCL is established within the INL at this age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Retinas were analysed with respect to Prox1, Lim1 and Isl1 expression. The results showed that Lim1 and Isl1 immunoreactivities did not overlap, and that Lim1 and Isl1 immunoreactive HCs were mixed within the HCL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). By counting double-labelled cells in the HCL of the central-most retina, the ratio of Lim1+ or Isl1+ HCs were determined to be 50/50 with respect to Prox1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These results reveal that HCs are split into two equally large sub-groups based on the expression of Lim1 and Isl1.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Horizontal cells express either Lim1 or Isl1 in equally large proportions</bold>.

We investigated whether Isl1+ HCs performed a similar bi-directional migration by comparing the patterns of Lim1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;G</xref>), Prox1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H&#x02013;L</xref>, red) and Isl1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H&#x02013;L</xref>, green). The spatio-temporal pattern of Prox1+, Isl1+ double-labelled cells was similar, but delayed to, the Prox1+, Lim1+ double-labelled cells that have been shown to migrate bi-directionally (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L</xref>, single and double asterisks). The first Prox1+, Isl1+ double-labelled cells were detected close to the prospective ganglion cell layer (GCL) at st31 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>, white arrows pointing at yellow cells).

Our analysis suggests that Prox1+, Isl1+ double-labelled cells initiate retrograde migration and reach the HCL one day after Lim1+ HCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Isl1 HCs are born one day after Lim1 HCs</title><p>To investigate if the segregated migration patterns reflected a temporal difference in birth-dates or just a delay in migration between the two subgroups, we birth-dated the two HC populations using [<sup>3</sup>H]-dT. Stage 19&#x02013;33 embryos received a single dose of [<sup>3</sup>H]-dT after which retinas were collected at st35 (E9) and processed for Lim1 and Prox1 immunocytochemistry and autoradiography. Stage 35 was analyzed since the mature 50/50 ratio of Lim1+ and Isl1+ HCs is set at this stage (see below and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The fractions of Lim1+ or Prox1+ HCs also positive for [<sup>3</sup>H]-dT incorporation (silver grains) were determined for each injected stage (see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).

This inverse correlation between HC generation and high follistatin levels suggested that follistatin overexposure may interfere with the generation of Lim1+ cells. We injected st21, st22 and st23 embryos with follistatin or vehicle and analysed the number of Lim1+ cells in the central retina 22 h after the injection.

We therefore hypothesised that the reduction of newly generated Lim1+ cells by the added follistatin, was an effect on the Lim1-generating progenitor cells. The inhibitory action of follistatin would then keep the progenitor cells proliferating and thus delaying cells from exiting the cell cycle and turning on Lim1 expression. This would lead to fewer newly generated Lim1+ cells compared to controls. To test this we added BrdU 5 h after either follistatin or activin injections to mark cells passing through S-phase. The number of BrdU cells was analyzed after a total of 22 h. The activin injections caused a robust decrease in BrdU incorporation compared to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A&#x02013;C</xref>, see also Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) while the follistatin injections did not lead to any conclusive changes (data not shown). This indicates that activin treatment caused either an overall decreased proliferation rate or caused retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) to undergo premature cell cycle withdrawal.

Some of the retinas were analysed one day later at st36 (E10).

One subgroup, corresponding to the axon-bearing HC, expresses Lim1 whereas the other subgroup, corresponding to the axon-less HCs, expresses Isl1. The axon-less (Isl1+) HC subpopulation can be further subdivided in two HC subtypes. The Lim1 and Isl1 HC subgroups are generated and then migrate bi-directionally in the developing retina during successive periods. Moreover, we show that retinal progenitor cells that are able to generate both Lim1 and Isl1 HCs respond to follistatin overexposure at E3. The treatment results in significant increases in both Lim1 and Isl1 HC subtypes at E9. This effect is specific to HCs, and is best explained by a sustained proliferation of HC-generating progenitor cells.</p><p>We have demonstrated two types of axon-less HCs, the stellate and candelabrum-shaped HCs that in addition to Isl1, express GABA and TrkA, respectively. The axon-bearing brush-shaped HCs express calretinin in addition to Lim1. We quantified the proportions of the HC subtypes in the central P0 chick retina and found that the axon-bearing brush-shaped HC and the axon-less stellate and candelabrum-shaped HCs constituted 50%, 10% and 40% of the HC population, respectively.

The same study also identified what was classified as a fourth HC subtype based on their analysis of HC markers. A fourth HC subtype is also described in the pigeon retina based on morphological criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Our results support the classical division of chick HCs into three main subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] but the actual number and extent of heterogeneity in HC subtypes in the chick retina is an unsettled issue.</p><p>As the retina undergoes late maturation, synapse rearrangement and changes in the expression levels of various proteins are known to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We found that GABA was initially present uniformly in all GABA-containing HCs, but that GABA levels progressively decreased in axon-bearing HCs and increased in axon-less stellate HCs after hatch. This implies that GABA has a role in adult stellate HCs but not in adult axon-bearing cells. Rather, GABA may have a transient function in the developing axon-bearing HCs. This is in agreement with a role for GABA during synapse maturation when connections between HCs and photoreceptors or bipolar cells are established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].

During normal development, high follistatin levels stimulate the proliferation of RPCs by preventing e.g. activin (or related factors) to decrease or inhibit proliferation. As follistatin decreases over time, RPCs specialize to generate e.g. HC progenitors. Under the influence of exogenous follistatin, again preventing activin (or related factors) from controlling cell cycle withdrawal, proliferation in the HC generating progenitor pool is stimulated and therefore, more HCs than normal are eventually generated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-8-46-10"/></fig><p>We investigated whether the two HC subpopulations marked by Lim1 or Isl1 were born simultaneously or consecutively by performing a birth-dating analysis using [<sup>3</sup>H]-dT incorporation. Our results revealed that although the two birth-curves overlapped, the majority of Lim1+ HCs were born between E3 and E4 whereas the majority of the HCs expressing Isl1+ were born between E4 and E5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, since the earliest stage when Isl1+ HCs can be positively identified using Prox1 is st31 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>, arrows), the lack of earlier HC subtype markers makes it difficult to state with certainty that HC progenitors that give rise to the Isl1+ HCs are in fact born into an Isl1-fate (and not born as Lim1+ cells). However, the birth-curve of the Isl1+ HCs is concomitant with the appearance of Prox1+, Lim1-negative cells in the retina between E5.5 and E7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These Prox1-single positive cells likely correspond to the Isl1+ HC fraction before the actual onset of Isl1 expression. Thus, the birth-dating results inferring that Isl1+ HCs undergo their last S-phase around E4&#x02013;5, which is just prior to the appearance of Prox1-single positive cells at E5.5, supports a scenario where the late HC subgroup identity is established at the time of cell cycle withdrawal. In addition, we do not find any Isl1 and Lim1 double labelling in HCs (Prox1+ cells) after st31. Godinho et al recently used live imaging in the zebrafish retina to show that the mitoses generating HCs occurred in the INL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Combined, these data opens up the possibility that HCs in chick are generated as cells committed into distinct fates (Lim1/early or Isl1/late), and that the generation of these subgroups is temporally separated.</p><p>The results from a recent lineage study of chick HCs suggested that there was no significant difference in the birth order among three identified HC subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Our birth-dating experiment only considered HCs in the very central part of the retina and as the generation of HCs proceed further peripherally in the retina the temporal overlap of the generation may be larger. This may explain the discrepancy between the different results. In addition, the two waves of migration to the HCL also imply a consecutive generation of the subtypes.</p><p>The separate birth-dates and migration periods reveal the existence of temporal windows during which HC precursors can acquire different fates. For instance, the generation of stellate HCs could result from a combination of instructive signals acting at overlapping time points. Stellate HCs could be generated during an overlap of: a) a decreasing signal instructing early born HCs to express Ap2&#x003b1; and GABA, and b) an increasing signal instructing late-born HCs to express Isl1. The 6&#x02013;10% abundance of Ap2&#x003b1; and GABA expression in the stellate HCs may suggest such a mechanism (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4T</xref>). In this scenario, later born Isl1+ HCs (i.e. the TrkA+ candelabrum HCs) would encounter only the second signal and develop along a third route. These potential signals remain to be characterized and may be either extrinsic, intrinsic or both. The signals seem not to be of a character that could be inhibited by follistatin since the subpopulations were not differentially affected by this treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Follistatin promotes the proliferation of HC-generating progenitor cells</title><p>In the developing retina extrinsic signals, exemplified by the TGF&#x003b2;/BMP family members, are suggested to regulate nearly every aspect of retinal development, such as proliferation, migration, fate determination, cell death and functional maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Follistatin, a potent inhibitor of activin and several other members of the TGF&#x003b2; super family have previously been implicated to take part in the differentiation of retinal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. For instance, a recent study indicated that follistatin could interfere with the generation of neurons in the developing retina, and also showed that follistatin was able to down-regulate the activin-dependent pSmad2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The central-to-peripheral temporal gradient of retinal development, where the central regions of the retina are more mature relative the peripherally located regions, is well characterized and makes the spatio-temporal aspect of retinal development an important factor to consider. Therefore, to understand how follistatin activity in the retina relates to our birth-dating of HCs as well as to the appearance of the early HC marker Lim1, we characterized the spatio-temporal follistatin expression. We found that follistatin expression followed a central-to-peripheral pattern and that with increasing age the immunoreactivity in the central retina decreased and an apparent wave-front of high follistatin expression moved towards to the periphery. The appearance of Lim1+ cells followed close behind this moving wave-front (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, black arrows). Combined with our qRT-PCR data demonstrating a dramatic 50-fold drop in follistatin mRNA levels that coincided with the time of HC birth, our observations show a correlation between low follistatin levels and HC generation.</p><p>In several cells and tissues, follistatin promotes proliferation by removing the inhibition of cell proliferation exerted by activin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Our observations indicate that this is also true in the developing retina. For instance, activin injections in E3 embryos caused a robust decrease in BrdU incorporation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A&#x02013;C</xref>), and during E2 (st14-18), which is a time marked by massive RPC proliferation in the developing retina, the relative levels of follistatin mRNA were extremely high (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Combined, these observations indicate that follistatin stimulate proliferation in the retina, possibly by repressing activin signalling. Interestingly, the notion that follistatin stimulates proliferation may appear inconsistent with the observation that embryos injected with follistatin and analysed 22 h after the injection had fewer Lim1+ cells than control-treated embryos. Our interpretation is that the transient follistatin overexposure prevents HC-generating progenitor cells from producing post-mitotic cells, which turn on Lim1 expression. Instead, the affected progenitor cells may produce two mitotic daughters (not yet expressing Lim1) that will both inherit the capability to produce HCs. Thus, with a follistatin-induced increase of the HC-generating progenitor pool, the observed result will be a delayed onset of Lim1 expression, followed by an increase in the total number of HCs at a later time point (e.g. at E9), and this is what our results showed. Combined, these observations suggest that follistatin is important for early RPC proliferation in general and specifically for the proliferation and generation of HC progenitor/precursor cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10B</xref>). However, since the follistatin-phenotype at E9 (st35) most often was restricted to distinct regions of the retina, this indicates the existence of a spatio-temporal window during which HC-generating progenitor cells are susceptible to follistatin treatment which give rise to the described effects.</p><p>Moreover, embryos injected with follistatin at E3 and analysed at E9 (st35) had a significantly increased number of HCs. This increase was slightly more pronounced in the later-born Isl1+ HCs (approximately +50%) compared to the early Lim1+ HCs (approximately +40%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, compare H and I, see also Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Furthermore, the ectopic HCs scattered within the retina at st35 in follistatin-treated retinas were predominantly of the Isl1 subtype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>). One day later, at st36, these ectopic cells were no longer observed and we concluded that they had settled in the HCL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>), since the increased number of Prox1, Isl1 double positive HCs was similar in st35 and st36 retinas. Moreover, TUNEL staining was not detected in these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F</xref>). Our conclusion is that the ectopic and migrating HCs at st35 represent HCs that were produced in excess following follistatin treatment. This is in agreement with a model wherein follistatin cause HC-generating progenitor cells to proliferate beyond the normal period of HC generation, thus producing extra HCs that also migrate to the HCL.</p><p>Follistatin inhibits the action of ligands such as activin and other TGF&#x003b2;-signalling molecules by binding them and thus preventing subsequent receptor activation. Hence, the inhibitory effects of follistatin depend on the presence of these ligands. Activin and its receptors are known to be present in the developing retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and therefore activin stands out as a likely candidate through which follistatin exerts its inhibitory action. However, it cannot be excluded that the effects caused by follistatin treatment are generated by the inhibition of other TGF&#x003b2;-signalling systems, or that the follistatin treatment may mediate its effects by indirectly influencing other cell signalling systems. Regardless of the pathway(s) by which follistatin affects retinal development at E3, our data suggest that the effects are exclusive to progenitor cells that generate HCs since we were unable to detect any differences in the number of other retinal cell populations at E9 following follistatin treatment at st23 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9G&#x02013;I</xref>, see also Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). This was perhaps surprising, considering the broad spectrum of ligands which follistatin can bind and inhibit, and also considering that classic lineage-tracing experiments have shown that early RPCs are homogeneously multipotent and capable of generating all retinal cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].</p><p>The result that the other major retinal cell populations studied were not affected by follistatin might, however, be explained by one or more mechanisms. First, compared to HCs, most retinal cell populations are generated over a long period of time, which allows for secondary mechanisms to control proliferation and cell-fate decisions. This can be exemplified by post-mitotic amacrine cells and ganglion cells that through feedback inhibition to progenitor cells control the continued generation of these cell types, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. In addition, apoptosis may also provide a mechanism by which, from E3 to E9, cell numbers are adjusted and corrected. Secondly, the brief overexposure-time of follistatin in our experimental setup may be insufficient to produce effects that would require long-term follistatin exposure, and may explain the inconsistency between our and Moreira and Adler's observations that following their continuous follistatin-overexposure, the region containing Ap2&#x003b1; amacrine cells decreased in thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thirdly, one may hypothesise that progenitor cells, which generate other retinal populations than HCs at E3 (for instance retinal ganglion cells and cone photoreceptors), rely on other signalling systems than follistatin to control their proliferation rate. Supporting this view are previous studies reporting that certain RPCs are biased to produce only a limited repertoire of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. These three explanations are not mutually exclusive; however, based on our and other's data, we favour an explanation that assumes a degree of heterogeneity in the early RPC pool.</p><p>Horizontal cells are in several ways the odd ones out when compared to other retinal neurons. For example, HCs undergo bi-directional migration, and in contrast to most retinal cell populations, HC cell numbers are not adjusted by apoptosis, neither during early nor late development. As shown here, HCs are the only cell type that is affected by follistatin at E3, which suggests that progenitor cells that are competent to generate HCs are follistatin-sensitive, whereas progenitor cells that generate other early-born neurons, e.g. cone photoreceptors are not. In line with this, the existence of progenitor cells biased for HC generation have been indicated in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] where Zhang et al. found using Cre-LoxP fate-mapping that an enhancer element of Pax6 was active in a restricted subset of RPCs, which almost exclusively generated HCs. The recent work by Godinho et al in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and the lineage study in chick by Rompani and Cepko [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] both shows that there are progenitor cells fated to generate HCs by a final mitosis. Rompani and Cepko's data suggest that such dedicated HC progenitors are biased to generate two HCs of only one subtype.</p><p>Our results showed that the generation of both Lim1+ and Isl1+ subtypes were affected by the follistatin injections at st20-23 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8G&#x02013;I</xref>). Assuming that the effect by the early bolus injection of follistatin is transient and that it is washed out before the peak of Isl1+ HC generation, our data agree with an interpretation that progenitors are committed to a HC fate before their terminal mitosis or even before they undergo their last S-phase. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that pre-mitotic HC precursors in zebrafish bear morphological resemblance to HCs themselves and also express Ptf1a and Cx55.5 that are normally found in post-mitotic HCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Axon-bearing and axon-less HC subtypes express Lim1 and Isl1, respectively. These two subtypes are born sequentially and their relative proportions are fixed early in development and are not adjusted by apoptosis. HCs are generated concomitantly with a decrease in endogenous follistatin levels. Adding exogenous follistatin at E3 clearly affected progenitor cells competent to generate HCs, and caused an over-production of HCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10B</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that HC progenitors are sensitive to follistatin and become committed to produce Lim1+ and/or Isl1+ HC subtypes concomitantly with or early after their own generation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and in ovo cultures</title><p>Fertilized White Leghorn eggs (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) were obtained from Ova Produktion AB (V&#x000e4;ster&#x000e5;s, Sweden) and incubated at 38&#x000b0;C in a humidified incubator (Maino, Italy).

Embryos were allowed to develop until st35, when the central most piece of retina was punched out using a sharpened metal tube 4.5 mm in diameter. Each retina was fixed (10 min, 4% PFA), washed (10 min, PBS) and dissociated to a single-cell suspension in 0,25% trypsin.

The cell suspensions were plated onto 8-well slides (PH-098, NovaKemi AB, Sweden, 50 &#x003bc;l/well) and air-dried. Slides were processed for Prox1 or Lim1 immunocytochemistry, using the Vectastain Elite ABC-kit (PK-6102) and the 3,3'-diaminobensidine (DAB) peroxidase substrate kit (SK-4100) from Vector Laboratories, according to the manufacturers instructions.

The optimal exposure time was determined for each stage and the threshold that was considered as a positive [<sup>3</sup>H]-dT labelled cell was determined for each individual experiment by identifying the most heavily [<sup>3</sup>H]-dT labelled cells per sample and using those cells as reference (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

Only cells with intense nuclear Prox1 labelling were counted.</p><p>Since Lim1+ HCs constitute half of all Prox1+ HCs at st35 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), the raw data obtained from Lim1 cell counts were divided by two. For example, if from one stage 15 out of 25 Lim1+ cells were also [<sup>3</sup>H]-dT+, then this indicated that 60% of the Lim1 expressing HCs were born around this time. However, since Lim1+ HCs at the time of analysis (st35) constitute half of all HCs, this number actually corresponds to 30% of all HCs with respect to Prox1. Thus, to relate the fraction of [<sup>3</sup>H]-dT+ Lim1 cells to the fraction of [<sup>3</sup>H]-dT+ Prox1 cells at the same stage, 30% (and not 60%) would be the Lim1 percentage plotted in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> for that specific stage (see also Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Moreover, since we were unable to determine the birth-curve of Isl1+ HCs directly, the numerical difference between [<sup>3</sup>H]-dT+ Prox1 and Lim1 fractions were plotted as a line to represent the birth-curve of Isl1+ HCs.
