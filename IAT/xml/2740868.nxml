BRCA1 plays important roles in protecting numerous cellular processes in response to cell damaging signals. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) is a potent regulator of growth, apoptosis and invasiveness of tumor cells. TFG-&#x003b2; activates Smad signaling via its two cell surface receptors, the TbetaRII and ALK5/TbetaRI, leading to Smad-mediated transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here, we report an important role of BRCA1 in modulating TGF-&#x003b2; signaling during oxidative stress responses. Wild-type (WT) BRCA1, but not mutated BRCA1 failed to activate TGF-&#x003b2; mediated transactivation of the TGF-&#x003b2; responsive reporter, p3TP-Lux. Further, WT-BRCA1, but not mutated BRCA1 increased the expression of Smad3 protein in a dose-dependent manner, while silencing of WT-BRCA1 by siRNA decreased Smad3 and Smad4 interaction induced by TGF-&#x003b2; in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. BRCA1 interacted with Smad3 upon TGF-&#x003b2;1 stimulation in MCF-7 cells and this interaction was mediated via the domain of 298&#x02013;436aa of BRCA1 and Smad3 domain of 207&#x02013;426aa. In addition, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased the colocalization and the interaction of Smad3 with WT-BRCA1. Interestingly, TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced Smad3 and Smad4 interaction was increased in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in cells expressing WT-BRCA1, while the TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced interaction between Smad3 and Smad4 was decreased upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in a dose-dependent manner in HCC1937 breast cancer cells, deficient for endogenous BRCA1. This interaction between Smad3 and Smad4 was increased in reconstituted HCC1937 cells expressing WT-BRCA1 (HCC1937/BRCA1). Further, loss of BRCA1 resulted in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced nuclear export of phosphor-Smad3 protein to the cytoplasm, resulting decreased of Smad3 and Smad4 interaction induced by TGF-&#x003b2; and in significant decrease in Smad3 and Smad4 transcriptional activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These results strongly suggest that loss or reduction of BRCA1 alters TGF-&#x003b2; growth inhibiting activity via Smad3 during oxidative stress responses.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Patients who inherit genetic defects in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have an increased lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. BRCA1 is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in many cellular processes, including genomic stability, the cell-cycle checkpoint, DNA-damage repair, apoptosis, and gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Rosen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the precise mechanism by which loss of BRCA1 affects specific tissues in humans is unclear. BRCA1 has two important structural motifs, including a highly conserved amino-terminal RING finger motif and tandem BRCT motifs at its C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Miki1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Koonin1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The RING finger motif confers BRCA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, one of the intriguing aspects of BRCA1 function, regulating activity, stability and distribution of target molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Ohta1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The BRCT region of BRCA1 is essential for its DNA repair, transcriptional regulation and tumor suppressor functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Williams1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Germline mutations in BRCA1 were often seen in the two regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Nathanson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that the RING finger and BRCT motifs play an important role in the development of breast and ovarian cancers.</p><p>Emerging evidence has indicated that BRCA1 is involved in ROS production and oxidative stress responses. BRCA1 was shown to exert antioxidant activity by inducing antioxidant expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Bae1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and Brca1-deficient mice were reported to produce excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to be sensitive to oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Xiao1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the molecules and signaling pathways susceptible to oxidative stress due to BRCA1 inactivation remain elusive. Studies have suggested that oxidative stress and ROS play important roles in the development of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Benhar1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Sander1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, understanding the targets and signaling pathways of ROS may provide insights into the impact of environmental factors in cancer initiation and progression.</p><p>The TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> family has been demonstrated to contribute to normal mammary gland development as well as the progression of human breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Gupta1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Loss of inhibition or increased promotion of proliferation for TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> is believed to contribute to carcinogenesis in the mammary gland. TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> transduces signals via phosphorylation of intracellular mediators, Smad2 and Smad3. The TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> receptor-activated Smads form a complex with Smad4 co-activator. The heteromeric Smad complexes then translocate into the nucleus, where they induce or repress transcription of defined genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Shi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Smad-dependent downregulation of c-Myc or upregulation of p15 and p21 is related to the anti-proliferative activity of TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Orian1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> also signals independently of Smads, via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein phosphatase 2A/p70 S6 kinase (PP2A/p70S6K), and various mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which may result in promotion of proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Wakefield1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

FoxH1 (forkhead box H1) and ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2) block nuclear export of Smad2 or Smad3 by inhibiting the interaction of Smads with nuclear export components.

In response to hypoxia, wild type BRCA1 increases the nuclear accumulation of HIF-1&#x003b1;, resulting in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Kang1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, wild type BRCA1 induces the transcription of antioxidants through the Nrf2 transcription factor during oxidative stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007091-Bae1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Loss of growth inhibition by TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> occurs early in breast cell transformation. Our observations suggest that inactivation of BRCA1 may result in a reduction in Smad3-mediated growth inhibitory activity during oxidative stress responses. Understanding of whether the pro-oncogenic activity of TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> signaling is increased during oxidative stress responses in BRCA1-deficient cells is of great interest. Given that BRCA1-deficiency causes excess ROS generation <italic>in vivo</italic>, our data suggest that ROS downregulate ROS-sensitive signaling molecules. With the BRCA1 genetic defect as a model system, underlying cross-talk between developmental signals and environmental factors may help elucidate the breast cancer risk factors in breast cancer initiation and progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293, HEK293T, MCF-7, HaCaT, and COS-7 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA).
