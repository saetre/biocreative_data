In order to elucidate whether the observed anti-inflammatory status is related to the inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1;, we also investigated the effect of etanercept, a TNF-&#x003b1; soluble receptor construct, on lung TJ function. Pharmacological and genetic TNF-&#x003b1; inhibition significantly reduced the degree of (1) TNF-&#x003b1; production in pleural exudates and in the lung tissues, (2) the inflammatory cell infiltration in the pleural cavity as well as in the lung tissues (evaluated by MPO activity), (3) the alteration of ZO-1, Claudin-2, Claudin-4, Claudin-5 and &#x003b2;-catenin (immunohistochemistry) and (4) apoptosis (TUNEL staining, Bax, Bcl-2 expression). Taken together, our results demonstrate that inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; reduces the tight junction permeability in the lung tissues associated with acute lung inflammation, suggesting a possible role of TNF-&#x003b1; on lung barrier dysfunction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>An important consequence of acute lung injury is the disruption of the paracellular alveolar permeability barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The permeability barrier in terminal airspaces of the lung is due in large part to tight junctions between alveolar epithelial cells, which regulate the flow of molecules between apical and basolateral compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Transmembrane proteins in the occludin and claudin families are the major transmembrane structural elements of tight junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has previously been shown that alveolar epithelial cells express occludin and zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) as part of the tight junction complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition to these components, the importance of claudins in pulmonary barrier function is underscored by the viability of occludin-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, is well known that airway epithelial cells perform many important functions, serving as an interface between environmental stimuli and the lung parenchyma. Normally the lower airways are pristine, free of bacterial flora or inflammatory cells, and are well protected by several layers of defenses including antimicrobial peptides, mucin, and ciliary action. There is a brisk epithelial response to airway injury caused by many different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Acute lung inflammatory response is also is associated to epithelial cytokine expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] as well as to the expression of the signaling cascade leading to apoptosis (programmed cell death). Activation of epithelial proinflammatory signaling cascades is mediated by tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; a prototypic member of a cytokine family which regulates essential biologic functions (e.g. cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, apoptosis) and a broad spectrum of responses to stress and injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is primarily produced by immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages, but it can also be released by many other cell types, including acinar cells. Membrane bound or soluble TNF-&#x003b1; interacts with two different surface receptors, TNF-&#x003b1; receptor 1 (TNFR1), or p55, and TNF-&#x003b1; receptor 2 (TNFR2), or p75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although the extracellular domains of TNFR1 and TNFR2 are homologous and manifest similar affinity for TNF-&#x003b1;, the cytoplasmic regions of the two receptors are distinct and mediate different downstream events. Although most cell lines and primary tissues express both isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], most of the biological activities of TNF-&#x003b1; are mediated through TNF-R1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. TNF-R2 is a poor inducer of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and binding affinities of soluble TNF-a are significantly higher to TNF-R1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>After exposure to TNF-&#x003b1;, target cells may down-regulate their responsiveness to the cytokine by shedding the receptors into the circulation. A natural mechanism which has been hypothesized to counteract excessive concentrations of circulating TNF-&#x003b1; (and the subsequent enhanced surface receptor activation) is the release of soluble receptors. The two soluble receptor forms (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2) have longer half lives than TNF-&#x003b1;, and their concentration may reflect TNF-&#x003b1; activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>A primary role for TNF-&#x003b1; in inflammatory process (e.g. sepsis, endotoxiemic shock and acute pancreatitis) is suggested by several studies conducted upon cell lines, animal models and human beings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In inflammation, over-production of TNF-&#x003b1; is pivotal in the induction of inflammatory genes, cell death, endothelial up-regulation and in the recruitment and activation of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It has been also regarded as one of the major mediators of systemic progression and tissue damage in severe disease. However, the biologic significance of TNFR shedding is unclear. It could represent a neutralizing mechanism to counteract excessive TNF-&#x003b1; activity, but &#x02013; on the other hand &#x02013; it has been suggested that in relatively low concentrations sTNFR may serve as carriers to distant organs. Furthermore, sTNFR stabilize TNF-&#x003b1; trimeric structure thereby prolonging its half-life and augmenting its biological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Etanercept is a fully humanized dimeric soluble form of the p75 TNF receptor that can bind to two TNF-&#x003b1; molecules blocking their interaction with cell surface TNFRs and rendering TNF-&#x003b1; biologically inactive. TNF-&#x003b1; inactivation is one thousand times stronger than inactivation by p75 monomeric TNFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It inhibits the activity of TNF-&#x003b1; <italic>in vitro </italic>and has been examined <italic>in vivo </italic>for its effects in different animal model systems of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In addition, it has been demonstrated that TNF plays a role in the control of epithelial permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] as well as in the regulation of pulmonary microvessels endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Moreover, TNF at higher concentrations leads to down-regulation of ZO-1 protein expression and disturbance in junction localization of ZO-1 protein and functional opening of tight junction barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Base on this evidence, we have hypothesized that increased production of TNF-&#x003b1; might lead to structural and functional alterations in pulmonary TJ function in vivo as a result of acute lung inflammation induced by carrageenan in mice. Herein, we demonstrate that acute lung injury is associated with decreased expression and function of several TJ proteins in the lung epithelium. Moreover, we also demonstrate that Etanercept treatment attenuates TJ alteration associated with acute inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Mice (4&#x02013;5 weeks old, 20&#x02013;22 g) with a targeted disruption of the TNF-&#x003b1;R1 (TNF-&#x003b1; R1KO) and wild-type controls (TNF-&#x003b1;WT) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Charles River, Italy).

Acute lung injury and its most severe form, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are conditions characterized by a diffuse, intense inflammatory process, by damage to both endothelial and epithelial cell barriers, resulting in marked extravasation of vascular fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The filling of alveolar spaces by proteinaceous edema fluid and inflammatory cells leads to severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The normal functioning of the lung depends on the establishment and maintenance of a milieu in the alveolar space that is distinct from the composition of the subepithelial compartment. This process depends on the formation and proper functioning of specialized structures, called tight junctions (TJ), between adjacent cells making up the epithelial sheet. The TJ is a complex of several integral membrane proteins and peripheral membrane proteins that interact strongly with the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Integral membrane proteins involved in TJ formation include occludin and members of a large class of proteins called claudins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. These proteins contain four transmembrane domains and are thought to be the points of cell-to-cell contact within the TJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Cosedimentation assays of TJ proteins suggest that there is a strong interaction between occludin and another protein associated with TJ formation, zonula occludens (ZO)-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. ZO-1 has been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of occludin and the claudins. In addition, ZO-1 interacts with two additional members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family of proteins, ZO-2 and ZO-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The TJ serves as a fence that differentiates the plasma membrane into apical and basolateral domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. TJs also serve as a regulated semipermeable barrier that limits the passive diffusion of solutes across the paracellular pathway between adjacent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. These properties of TJs, in combination with transcellular vectorial transport processes, generate distinct internal environments in the opposing compartments.</p><p>Recently, we have demonstrated, using an experimental model of colitis, that the structure and function of TJs in the intestinal epithelial is dependent of the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In particular in one study, we have showed that the structure and function of TJs in the ileum were altered in mice at 4 days after the induction of experimental colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These changes were ameliorated when mice were treated with Thalidomide. In the study reported here, we obtained similar results and showed that the structure and function of TJs in the lung were altered in mice injected 4 and 24 h earlier with carrageenan. Moreover, these changes were ameliorated by treatment with Etanercept, a TNF-&#x003b1; soluble receptor construct, as well as in mice with a targeted deletion of the TNF-&#x003b1;R1 gene. As a result of these efforts, we point out that acute lung inflammation induced alterations in the function of lungs, is due, at least in part, to massive changes in the expression and localization of key TJ proteins. Furthermore, we propose that excessive TNF-&#x003b1; production is an important component of this process.</p><p>What is then the mechanism by which inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; induced the structure and function of TJs alteration in acute inflammation caused by carrageenan?</p><p>There is good evidence that TNF-&#x003b1; help to propagate the extension of a local or systemic inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. We confirm here that carrageenan injection a substantial increase of TNF-&#x003b1; in the exudates and lung tissues which likely contribute in different capacities to the evolution of acute inflammation. As expected, the TNF-&#x003b1; levels were abolished in TNF-&#x003b1;R1KO mice and significantly reduced in the TNF-&#x003b1; R1WT mice treated with Etanercept.</p><p>Moreover various study have clearly point out that the immune system plays an important role in modulating epithelial permeability in different organs such us gut and lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The regulation of epithelial barrier function by cytokines has been studied most extensively in the gut using different epithelial cell line. For examples some studies have demonstrated that two cytokines, interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN&#x003b3;) and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;), decreased barrier function of cultured intestinal epithelial monolayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Moreover, incubation of intestinal epithelial cell monolayers with both IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; leads to reorganization of many tight junction proteins, including ZO-1, junction adhesion molecule 1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on lung epithelial barrier function were studied using lung epithelial cells. In a recent study Ahdieh and colleagues have clearly demonstrated Th1 and Th2 cytokines have distinct activities in lung epithelial cells that are consistent with the role of these cytokines in lung inflammation (e.g. asthma) In particular, IL-4 and IL-13 disrupt epithelial barrier function and wound healing, both of which would be expected to exacerbate inflammation. In contrast, IFN-&#x003b3; enhances epithelial barrier function and wound healing, which would contribute to a reduction in inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we also demonstrate that carrageenan administration to mice induced an alteration of immunohistochemical localization signal for ZO-1, Claudin-2, Claudin-4, Claudin-5 and &#x003b2;-catenin at 4 h and 24 h after carrageenan. The genetic or pharmacological inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; abolished the alteration of tight junction permeability. Thus, a key step in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury may be myosin light chain kinase activation by TNF&#x003b1;, leading to epithelial barrier dysfunction. There is extensive literature examining the consequences of specific proinflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, on the induction of apoptosis. An important biologic effect of TNF-&#x003b1; is the induction of apoptosis through its interaction with its receptor, TNFR. However, the same TNF-TNFR ligand-receptor interaction can also activate NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Activation of the Fas ligand is another major signaling pathway that leads to apoptosis. In bronchial epithelial cells, ligation of Fas stimulates both apoptosis and expression of IL-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Thus, the activation of proinflammatory signaling pathways can elicit apoptotic responses as well as the expression of cytokines. The response of the normal airway epithelial cell to inflammatory stimuli may consist of activation of both apoptotic and proinflammatory cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. However, in diseases such as acute lung injury, in which there appears to be an excessive inflammatory response, the balance between the activation and suppression of these potentially opposing pathways may be abnormal. In the present study, using the tunnel coloration we have clearly confirmed that TNF-&#x003b1; plays an important role in the induction of apoptosis during acute lung injury and that the treatment with etanercept and genetic inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1;R1 attenuates the degree of apoptosis. Moreover, it is well known that Bax, a pro-apoptotic gene, plays an important role in developmental cell death (34). Similarly, it has been shown that the overexpression of Bcl-2, a known antiapoptotic factor, significantly reduced the bronchial as well as intestinal epithelial apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Base on these evidences, we have identified proapoptotic transcriptional changes, including upregulation of proapoptotic Bax and down regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 by immunohystochemical staining. We report in the present study for the first time that the treatment with etanercept and genetic inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; R1prevents the lost of the antiapoptotic way and reduced the proapoptotic pathway activation with a mechanism still to discover.</p><p>Further studies are needed to address this point. Thus, we propose the following cycle: Inflammation -&#x0003e; TNF-&#x003b1;-&#x0003e; endothelial/epithelial TJ alteration -&#x0003e; PMN infiltration -&#x0003e; more pro-inflammatory mediator release -&#x0003e; organ damage. The confirmation of this proposed feedback cycle, however, requires further investigation. In conclusion, we have demonstrated <italic>in vivo </italic>that the pharmacological inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; by Etanercept attenuates the development of TJ alteration in acute inflammation in mice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by grant from Caminiti SRL foundation.
