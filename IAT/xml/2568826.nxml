Cardiomyocytes accumulate creatine via a specific creatine transporter (CrT), the capacity of which is reduced in the failing heart, resulting in lower myocardial creatine concentration. Therefore, to gain insight into how the CrT is regulated, we studied two mouse models of severely altered myocardial creatine levels. Cardiac creatine uptake levels were measured in isolated hearts from creatine-free guanidinoacetate-<italic>N</italic>-methyl transferase knock out (GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice and from mice overexpressing the myocardial CrT (CrT-OE) using <sup>14</sup>C-radiolabeled creatine. CrT mRNA levels were measured using real time RT-PCR and creatine levels with HPLC. Hearts from GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed a 7-fold increase in <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of creatine uptake and a 1.4-fold increase in CrT mRNA levels. The increase in Cr uptake and in CrT mRNA levels, however, was almost completely prevented when mice were fed a creatine supplemented diet, indicating that creatine uptake is subject to negative feedback regulation. Cardiac creatine uptake levels in CrT-OE mice were increased on average 2.7-fold, showing a considerable variation, in line with a similar variation in creatine content. Total CrT mRNA levels correlated well with myocardial creatine content (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.67; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) but endogenous CrT mRNA levels did not correlate at all with myocardial creatine content (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.96). This study shows that creatine uptake can be massively upregulated in the heart, by almost an order of magnitude and that this upregulation is subject to feedback inhibition. In addition, our results strongly suggest that CrT activity is predominantly regulated by mechanisms other than alterations in gene expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Creatine transport</kwd><kwd>Creatine</kwd><kwd>Energy metabolism</kwd><kwd>GAMT</kwd><kwd>Transgenic mouse model</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>In tissues with a high energy demand, such as myocardium, creatine plays an important role in energy metabolism. ATP synthesized by the mitochondria reacts with creatine in the creatine kinase (CK) reaction to form ADP and phosphocreatine (PCr). At the ATP consuming site the reverse reaction takes place replenishing ATP levels and maintaining low ADP concentrations.</p><p>Creatine originates from both dietary intake and from biosynthesis, predominantly in the liver and kidneys. Cardiomyocytes cannot synthesize creatine and so must accumulate it from the plasma against a large concentration gradient via a specific Na<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;creatine cotransporter (CrT) <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Creatine is lost from the cardiomyocyte due to spontaneous, nonenzymatic conversion into creatinine, which is membrane permeable and diffuses out of the cell, and, possibly, via efflux of creatine itself <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>. Such uptake and the resulting intracellular creatine concentration are tightly controlled. For example, oral creatine supplementation in rats results in elevated plasma creatine concentration, but due to downregulation of the cardiac creatine uptake capacity, myocardial creatine levels remain unchanged <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Heart failure is characterized by reduced myocardial PCr and total creatine (Cr) levels <xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>. We have previously shown that, in both rat and mouse models of heart failure due to chronic coronary ligation, the reduced myocardial creatine content can at least in part be explained by reduced myocardial creatine uptake capacity <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and CrT gene expression <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>However, little is known about how and to what extent CrT expression and activity can be regulated and, thus on how and why CrT function is downregulated in heart failure. Upregulation of uptake capacity can be achieved via administration of the creatine analogue &#x003b2;-guanidinoproprionic acid (&#x003b2;-GPA), which acts as a competitive inhibitor of the CrT <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, suggesting that intracellular creatine concentration is an important regulating factor. A recent report demonstrated that CrT activity can be upregulated by the serum and glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1) in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing the CrT <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, but it is unknown whether cardiac CrT is regulated in the same way.</p><p>We recently reported the first two genetically manipulated mouse models of altered myocardial creatine concentration. Guanidinoacetate-<italic>N</italic>-methyl transferase knock out (GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice are unable to synthesize creatine <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, such that when fed a creatine-free diet they are entirely creatine-free. Instead, these mice accumulate the creatine precursor guanidinoacetate (GA), which is phosphorylated in the CK reaction instead of creatine and partially takes over the role of creatine <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, the CK reaction velocity is reduced by two orders of magnitude with GA as substrate <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In contrast, mice overexpressing the cardiac CrT (CrT-OE) have elevated myocardial creatine levels <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The cardiac creatine uptake capacity of both these mouse models is currently unknown. An understanding of the creatine uptake capacity under these extreme conditions (i.e. no creatine at all and forced increase of creatine levels) could provide important new insights into the regulation of cardiac creatine transport.</p><p>We hypothesized that absence of creatine would trigger upregulation of the cardiac creatine uptake capacity, and that overexpression of the myocardial CrT would result in increased creatine uptake levels. To test this, and to quantify the degree of potential CrT upregulation, we measured the creatine uptake capacity in isolated hearts from GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and CrT overexpressing mice. In addition, we measured CrT mRNA levels in hearts of these mice as well as protein levels of SGK1, a candidate CrT regulator, in the hearts of GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Mice</title><p>GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wildtype (WT) littermates used for experiments were created by intercrossing heterozygous GAMT<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice, as previously described <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. From 6 weeks of age, mice were housed per genotype to prevent ingestion of creatine in GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice through coprophagia.

After stabilization, hearts were perfused with trace amounts of [<sup>14</sup>C]creatine (Apin Chemicals Ltd, UK) added to the buffer for 30 min followed by a 15min <sup>14</sup>C-label free washout. At the end of each of the perfusion protocols, hearts were divided into left ventricle, right ventricle and atria. Tissue samples were weighed and minced with scissors in glass scintillation vials containing 0.5 mL of a 9:1 v/v solution of hyamine hydroxide (MP Biomedicals, UK) and water. The vials were incubated shaking at 60 &#x000b0;C until clear (&#x0223c; 3&#x02013;4 h). To minimize colour quenching of samples, 100 &#x003bc;L of 30% (w/w) hydrogen peroxide was added followed by heating at 60 &#x000b0;C for another 30min. After the samples were cooled to room temperature, 10 mL of Cytoscint ES (MP Biomedicals, UK) was added to each sample followed by vigorous mixing. The vials were then allowed to equilibrate in the dark for at least 60 min before scintillation counting.</p><p>In a separate set of experiments hearts were used from WT and GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that were fed a creatine supplemented diet (5 g/kg) to test if any differences between the two genotypes were specific for the absence of creatine.

In addition, we have shown that in hearts with increased creatine levels due to overexpression of the CrT, the creatine uptake capacity is increased, but endogenous CrT mRNA levels do not change with increased intracellular creatine content. Together, these results suggest that CrT activity can be regulated by CrT gene expression but that transcriptional control is very limited and other mechanisms are likely to dominate the regulation of CrT activity in (patho-) physiological conditions.</p><p>There are several lines of evidence to suggest that intra- and extracellular creatine concentrations alter CrT activity. For example, chronic increases in plasma creatine concentrations due to creatine feeding result in a decrease in creatine uptake kinetics and unaltered myocardial intracellular creatine levels <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This finding is confirmed by our current observation that creatine uptake in hearts from WT mice is reduced when mice are fed a creatine supplemented diet. Similarly, intracellular creatine depletion by feeding the creatine analogue &#x003b2;-GPA results in an increased creatine uptake capacity <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In human muscle cells as well as in G8 myoblasts high extracellular creatine concentrations reduced creatine uptake whereas low extracellular creatine concentrations resulted in increased creatine uptake <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, the mechanism whereby creatine concentrations alter CrT activity is poorly understood and literature data regarding CrT regulation should be interpreted with caution since anti-CrT antibodies used in many studies have since been found to cross react with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Regulation of CrT activity could take place at different levels. Sandoval et al. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> characterized the human CrT promoter, and suggested that its features were compatible with that of a housekeeping gene. However, the increase in CrT mRNA levels in hearts from creatine-free GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and the reversal of this increase upon creatine feeding, shows for the first time that (in the mouse at least) the gene is susceptible to transcriptional regulation in response to a changing physiological environment. And yet an increase of only 40% in CrT mRNA in these hearts is relatively small compared to the 7-fold increase in creatine uptake, especially considering the extreme stimulus of zero creatine, and suggests that alterations in gene expression play only a minor role in regulation of CrT activity. In support of this conclusion is our finding that endogenous CrT mRNA is not downregulated by increased intracellular creatine concentrations in hearts from CrT-OE mice, and by the fact that we did not find any reduction in CrT mRNA levels after feeding WT mice a creatine supplemented diet, despite CrT activity being reduced in these hearts. Finally, the finding that total CrT mRNA levels in hearts from CrT-OE mice are higher than those in hearts from creatine-free GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice despite the much higher creatine uptake capacity in the GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hearts also indicates that CrT activity is primarily subject to post-transcriptional, rather than transcriptional, regulation.</p><p>Such post-transcriptional regulation could occur via CrT protein modification such as phosphorylation since the CrT protein has putative phosphorylation sites for PKC <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition, activity of the closely related transmembrane dopamine transporter is known to be downregulated by translocation of intracellular dopamine transporter protein from the sarcolemma to intracellular pools <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and it is conceivable that a similar regulating mechanism exists for the CrT.</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing the CrT, coexpression of SGK1 resulted in an increase in creatine uptake, showing that SGK1 stimulates CrT activity <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, the unaltered SGK1 levels in GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice do not suggest that SGK1 is involved in the upregulation in creatine uptake capacity in these hearts, although we cannot exclude a difference in SGK1 phosphorylation state in GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hearts, which may have been undetectable with the methodology available to us.</p><p>In hearts from mice overexpressing the cardiac CrT we observed elevated creatine uptake with a high degree of variation between mice. This is in line with the variation in creatine concentration and CrT-<italic>myc</italic> mRNA levels in this, and our previous study <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It is interesting to note that right ventricular (RV) creatine uptake in the CrT-OE hearts was, on average, 50% lower than left ventricular (LV) creatine uptake. Transgenic CrT-<italic>myc</italic> expression is under control of the MLC2v promoter, which is normally expressed in both ventricles, but differences between ventricular expression levels for a transgene under the control of the MLC2v promoter have been reported before <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This, and the lower levels of MLC2v in the RV measured here, probably explains the lower creatine uptake levels in the right ventricle.</p><p>In contrast to rat myocardium where RV and LV creatine levels were found to be the same <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, RV creatine content was significantly lower than LV creatine content in mouse hearts. However, while creatine uptake was 50% lower in the RV of CrT-OE mice compared to LV, the actual creatine concentration was only 6% lower in RV. This discrepancy can mainly be attributed to hearts with very high LV creatine uptake, since those hearts showed the greatest difference between right and left ventricular creatine uptake. A further discrepancy is that creatine uptake has been measured at up to six times higher than normal values, while LV creatine concentrations have never been observed at more than 3&#x02013;4 times higher than WT levels, in this or our previous study <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Altogether, this suggests that when the creatine uptake capacity exceeds three to four times the normal levels, other factors start to play a significant role in determining the myocardial creatine concentration. One potential factor is whether the CrT can ever operate in reverse to transport creatine out of the cell. Therefore, we calculated the reverse potential at which creatine transport out of the cell becomes thermodynamically possible. Our results suggest that reverse transport is not possible under normal conditions. However, in hearts with very high creatine levels the reverse potential will be reduced to such an extent that during the plateau phase of the action potential &#x02018;reverse creatine transport&#x02019; is thermodynamically possible. From previous (unpublished) conscious ECG data in these CrT-OE mice we calculate that the Q-T interval, which reflects action potential duration, can take up to 30% of the cardiac cycle. Thus, it is theoretically possible that reverse creatine transport could take place during a substantial fraction of the time in hearts with very high creatine levels.</p><p>Although we do not provide direct evidence of CrT reversal, this theory may well explain our findings. Thus, we hypothesize that in hearts with very high LV expression of transgenic CrT, reverse creatine transport will occur during systole, acting to lower the intracellular creatine concentration below expected values. This could explain the dissociation between LV creatine uptake levels and creatine content in these hearts, as well as the relatively small difference in creatine concentrations between ventricles despite large differences in creatine uptake.</p><p>GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice accumulate the creatine precursor guanidinoacetate, which, although it is capable of being phosphorylated in the creatine kinase reaction, is a very poor substrate <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This implies that GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hearts will have a very high capacity to phosphorylate creatine, rapidly converting to PCr the instant it is transported into the cell. This will act to keep the intracellular free creatine concentration particularly low, facilitating further creatine uptake during the experiment. One limitation of this study is that we cannot exclude <sup>14</sup>C accumulation in myocardium through processes other than CrT mediated uptake. However, residual extracellular <sup>14</sup>C-creatine is unlikely to be a confounding factor as we used a 15&#x000a0;min washout period, when in a previous study using rat hearts, no <sup>14</sup>C could be detected in the coronary effluent after 10&#x000a0;min of washout <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Regardless, residual extracellular <sup>14</sup>C would be similar in absolute terms for all groups and would therefore not affect relative differences between groups, or at worst result in an underestimation. In creatine-free hearts from GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the lack of intracellular creatine means that the transsarcolemmal creatine gradient is reversed during the experiment and passive diffusion of creatine into the cells could potentially contribute to <sup>14</sup>C accumulation in these hearts. However, the high creatine uptake rates in these hearts imply that this gradient rapidly disappears during the experiment and, therefore, is unlikely to substantially contribute to the <sup>14</sup>C-creatine accumulation.</p><p>The large increase in creatine uptake levels in hearts from GAMT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice show that the heart has an enormous capacity to regulate its creatine uptake capacity, over a much larger range than known before. Previously reported changes in creatine uptake capacity are generally smaller than 50%, in contrast to the &#x0003e;&#x000a0;7-fold increase reported here. The increase is particularly large when compared to the increase in creatine uptake in hearts from rats fed with &#x003b2;-GPA. In these hearts intracellular creatine levels were reduced to only 20% of control, while the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> for creatine uptake was increased by 63%. This suggests that the removal of the last 20% of creatine provides a very strong signal to increase CrT activity. Our results show that the heart has the ability to upregulate its creatine uptake capacity to an extent that is more than required to reverse the reduction in creatine uptake capacity that is observed in the failing heart. Therefore, it is worthwhile to unravel the molecular signalling mechanisms activated by a lack of creatine since it may lead to novel molecular targets for pharmacological manipulation and restoration of myocardial creatine content in the failing heart.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This study was supported by the British Heart Foundation.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>[1]</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wyss</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaddurah-Daouk</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Creatine and creatinine metabolism</article-title><source>Physiol.
