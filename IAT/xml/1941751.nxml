In the organisms studied to date with both interfering and noninterfering COs, the majority of events are thought to be generated by the primary, interference-sensitive pathway.

Analysis of the distribution of the residual chiasmata in <italic>msh4/msh4</italic> meiocytes has led to the suggestion that the remaining COs are processed by a secondary pathway that is not subject to interference. We report here on the mitotic and meiotic characterization of <italic>AtMus81</italic>(At4g30870), which strongly suggests a role for this gene in an interference-insensitive crossover pathway in <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. thaliana</named-content>.</p><p>Our lab has developed a unique pollen-based visual assay for meiotic recombination in <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. thaliana</named-content> that has facilitated these investigations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030132-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030132-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. This assay system is based on a series of transgenic lines, each carrying a gene encoding either a red, cyan, or yellow fluorescent marker protein excitable by different wavelengths of light. Transcription of these markers is directed by a post-meiotic pollen-specific promoter (LAT52) in the mutant <italic>qrt1</italic> background that produces tetrads of meiotically related pollen grains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030132-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030132-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. We constructed visually assayable genetic intervals by crossing lines carrying linked markers. Lines carrying two or more markers of different colors on the same chromosome produce tetrads that segregate the marker genes (and thus the proteins they encode) in patterns that reflect whether or not a recombination event has happened between them. Using this system, we can detect CO events directly in the gametes, and through the construction of double intervals delineated by three colors, we can assay CO interference. We used this system to assay the meiotic recombination phenotypes of the <italic>Atmus81, Atmsh4,</italic> and double mutants. We have also monitored production of fluorescent protein (or lack thereof) in homozygous constructs to quantify pollen viability.</p><p>The methyl methansulfonate UV sensitive (<italic>MUS81</italic>) gene was originally identified in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> in a two-hybrid screen for protein products that interact with the recombination factor Rad54p &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030132-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> mutant alleles of <italic>MUS81</italic> reduce, but do not eliminate, meiotic recombination.

This is in contrast to other meiotic mutants such as <italic>msh4,</italic> in which the reduction in COs is greater, and the remaining COs are interference insensitive. This has led to the suggestion that in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> there are at least two distinct classes of COs: interference-sensitive COs that require <italic>MSH4/MSH5</italic> and interference-insensitive COs that require <italic>MUS81</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030132-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

But even this combination, which reduced COs by 13- to 15-fold, had some residual CO activity, implying a possible third pathway in this organism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030132-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Not all organisms have both interfering and noninterfering COs.

Recent evidence from <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> suggests a role for Mus81-Eme1 in the resolution of single Holliday junctions (HJs), which may be the primary recombination intermediates in this organism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030132-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. This finding is supported by the previous observation that, in <italic>S. pombe,</italic> expression of the bacterial HJ resolvase RusA can partially suppress the <italic>mus81</italic> mutant phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030132-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, studies in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> show that the role of Mus81p as the essential HJ resolvase is not universal. In budding yeast, double (not single) Holliday Junctions (dHJs) may be the primary recombination intermediate, and expression of RusA failed to suppress the <italic>mus81</italic> meiotic phenotype. Physical analysis of the <italic>S. cerevisiae mus81</italic> deletion mutant is not consistent with a HJ resolution defect, as dHJs are processed; however, the kinetics are delayed about 2 h.
