The coordinated migration of different kinds of cells in space and time gives rise to the three germ layers and the three-dimensional architecture of different organs and organisms. Cells of the immune system migrate through blood vessels and tissues to reach infected sites; and cancer cells migrate away from their tissues of origin to ectopic places during metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedl and Wolf, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sahai, 2005</xref>). Thus far, the basic mechanisms of cell migration have been elucidated mostly from in vitro studies in solitary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iijima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Van Haastert and Devreotes, 2004</xref>). Cell migration in living, multicellular organisms, however, is likely much more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rorth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kunwar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Montell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raz and Reichman-Fried, 2006</xref>). At the onset of directed migration, cells not only have to acquire motility but also have to be able to perceive specific, directional migration cues. During their journey, migrating cells may be required to detect and interpret multiple, possibly conflicting guidance cues, and must coordinate their adhesion to surrounding cells to reorient, pause, and move in a directed fashion while targets change. Finally, at the end, cells have to know when they have reached their target and cease their motility.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in identifying guidance molecules, receptors, and intracellular mediators that act during directed migration. G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been widely studied for their role in directional migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doitsidou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knaut et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kunwar and Lehmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Molyneaux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kunwar et al., 2006</xref>). Cells use GPCRs to detect and migrate toward higher concentrations of chemoattractants. Immune cells and germ cells, for example, express the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and follow the distribution of the chemokine SDF1 (stromal cell&#x02013;derived factor 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doitsidou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knaut et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kunwar and Lehmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Molyneaux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kunwar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boldajipour et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Lymphocytes use sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors to egress from lymphoid tissues, where S1P levels are higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moser et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwab et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2005</xref>). Despite significant progress in identifying the guidance molecules, receptors, and intracellular mediators that act during directed migration, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that initiate cell migration are only poorly understood. At the start of migration, cells need to acquire motility, may lose cell adhesion with neighboring cells, and are required to gain the ability to respond directionally to external cues. The detailed cellular transformations, the temporal sequence of these events, and the relative influence caused by intrinsic and extrinsic cell information are the focus of our study.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> germ cells provide a genetically tractable system to visualize and follow individual germ cells as they start directed migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Santos and Lehmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kunwar et al., 2006</xref>). The onset of directed germ cell migration coincides with the transepithelial migration of germ cells through the primordium of the future midgut. Evidence for a germ cell autonomous function for transepithelial migration came from the identification of a novel GPCR <italic>trapped in endoderm 1</italic> (<italic>tre1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kunwar et al., 2003</xref>). Maternal <italic>tre1</italic> RNA is present in germ cells, and <italic>tre1</italic> function is required there. General cell motility and the movements of germ cells toward the gonad do not depend on Tre1, which suggests that Tre1 specifically regulates the onset of migration.</p><p>To understand the cellular mechanisms underlying the onset of directed migration, we used two-photon imaging to visualize the cellular transformations that occur in vivo as germ cells migrate through the midgut epithelium. Comparison of wild-type and <italic>tre1</italic> mutant germ cells suggests that regulated activation of the Tre1 GPCR controls three phases of early migration: polarization of germ cells, dispersal into individual cells, and transepithelial migration. Germ cell polarization leads to a redistribution of cell&#x02013;cell adherens proteins, such that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> E-cadherin (DE-cadherin) levels are reduced from the leading edge of the migrating cells and accumulate in the tail region. Tre1 likely signals via the G proteins G&#x003b3;1 and G&#x003b2;13f as well as Rho-1, as we detect G&#x003b2; and Rho-1 protein localization in the tail region, and deletion of their function specifically in germ cells causes the same phenotype as mutation in <italic>tre1</italic>. Our results suggest a novel function for GPCR signaling in initiating cell migration by polarizing the migrating cell. This polarization leads to the redistribution of signaling components and adherens proteins and may trigger cell dispersal and directed migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Live imaging of early steps in germ cell migration</title><p>To visualize germ cell migration in developing embryos, we used two-photon microscopy and a germ cell&#x02013;specific expression system, which translates the actin-binding domain of Moesin fused to EGFP under the control of <italic>nanos</italic> regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sano et al., 2005</xref>). Germ cells appeared motile soon after their formation at the blastoderm stage (stage 5, 2 h and 10 min to 2 h and 50 min after egg laying [AEL]), as they produced small protrusions away from their neighbors (Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807049/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807049/DC1</ext-link>). Despite this apparent motility, germ cells only rarely (1&#x02013;2 germ cells per embryo) separated from their neighbors and migrated directly through the underlying blastoderm cells (Video 1). Subsequently, during gastrulation (stage 7&#x02013;8, 3 h to 3 h and 40 min AEL), as germ cells were internalized together with the invaginating posterior midgut primordium, they rounded up and showed less protrusive activity (Video 2). At stage 9 (3 h and 40 min to 4 h and 20 min AEL), germ cells were found inside the midgut primordium in a tight cluster (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>); they were in close contact with each other and showed little contact with the surrounding somatic midgut cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and E, 1 and 2</xref>; and Video 3). During this stage, germ cells started to reorganize, changed their shape, and took on a highly polarized morphology. Using electron microscopy, a radial organization of germ cells within the midgut was clearly visible, with the large germ cell nuclei pointed toward the midgut while fine membranous material, apparently corresponding to the tail region, filled the inside of the cluster (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). This organization oriented the leading edge of each germ cell toward the surrounding midgut primordium. Next, the germ cells lost adhesion to each other, and extensions reached from the germ cells toward the midgut epithelium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E, 3 and 4</xref>; and Fig. S1 A).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Live imaging of germ cell migration through the midgut in wild-type and <italic>tre1</italic> mutant embryos.</bold> (A&#x02013;F) Migration of germ cells in the wild type.

Long cytoplasmic extensions connected germ cells with each other immediately after the onset of transepithelial migration (Fig. S2 and Video 3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807049/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807049/DC1</ext-link>). As germ cells transmigrated through the midgut epithelium, they appeared completely individualized, displayed amoeboid behavior, and were polarized with a broad lagging edge and actin localized at the leading edge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E 5</xref>; Fig. S2; and Videos S3 and S4). On average, individual germ cells transmigrated the midgut within 40 min from the onset of polarization. Tracking of individual germ cells showed that they dispersed radially and transmigrated in all directions through the pocket of the midgut epithelium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). After transmigration, germ cells reoriented on the midgut toward the dorsal side of the embryo, sorted into two bilateral groups, and migrated toward the gonadal mesoderm, which forms on either side of the embryo, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sano et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Tre1 GPCR signaling is required for germ cell polarization and dispersal</title><p><italic>Tre1</italic> encodes an orphan GPCR that is required maternally in germ cells for their migration through the midgut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kunwar et al., 2003</xref>).

Loss of maternal G&#x003b2;13f or G&#x003b3;1 function causes defects in gastrulation, which precluded an immediate analysis of germ cell migration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). However, we were able to rescue the gastrulation defect through early zygotic, soma-specific expression of the respective G protein (see Materials and methods and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). This genetic manipulation allowed us to test for a germ cell&#x02013;specific role of these G proteins, as early <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> germ cells are transcriptionally silent, and germ cells thus depend completely on the maternally provided G proteins. In embryos rescued for the gastrulation defect, <italic>G&#x003b2;13f</italic> mutant germ cells were unable to disperse and migrate through the midgut epithelium, and thus resembled the <italic>tre1</italic> phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, G&#x02013;I</xref>). <italic>G&#x003b3;1</italic> mutants showed a similar although slightly weaker phenotype likely caused by residual function of the <italic>G&#x003b3;1<sup>N159</sup></italic> allele used, which lacks the C-terminal isoprenylation site required for membrane anchoring (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, J&#x02013;L</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Izumi et al., 2004</xref>).

In contrast to our findings with <italic>G&#x003b2;</italic> and <italic>G&#x003b3;</italic> mutants, however, <italic>cta</italic> mutant germ cells migrated normally to the gonad (Table S1).

We found that before transepithelial migration, germ cells polarize toward the midgut and down-regulate E-cadherin from the leading edge and accumulate E-cadherin in the tail region. This polarization requires Tre1 GPCR activity. We propose that GPCR-mediated polarization triggers germ cell dispersal and orients germ cells toward the midgut for directed transepithelial migration.</p><p>A requirement for GPCR signaling during the directed migration toward a chemokine gradient has been described in detail in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> amoeba and in mammalian neutrophils. The events underlying signal transduction leading to the polarization of migrating cells have been worked out extensively in these cells. The first localized response to receptor activation is the enrichment of the activated G protein &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits, which results in the activation of phosphoinositide 3 (PI3) kinase. As a consequence of chemokine sensing, the PI3 kinase product phosphatidylinositide 3,4,5-tris phosphate (PIP3) becomes localized to the leading edge, and the phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) moves to the lagging edge in a Rho dependent manner (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affolter and Weijer, 2005</xref>). These signaling events organize the cytoskeleton leading to cellular polarization and directional movement. Our studies suggest a new mechanism by which GPCR signaling initiates directed cell migration. We find that activation of Tre1 causes a redistribution of G protein &#x003b2;, the GTPase Rho1, DE-cadherin, and other adherens junction components to a small region in the tail of the germ cells. The decrease in DE-cadherin from the leading edge of germ cells causes a loss of adhesion across the broad leading edge of the germ cells and causes germ cell polarization toward the midgut. This localization event may thereby convert an adherent group of cells into directionally migrating individuals. Tre1 belongs to a family of GPCRs that includes Moody in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and GPR84 in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bainton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouchard et al., 2007</xref>). Based on our results with Tre1, this family may act to regulate cellular polarity and adhesion, a view in line with the proposed function of Moody in epithelial morphology at the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, and with GPR84, which was recently described to be up-regulated in microglia upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwabe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouchard et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>How could Tre1 activation cause DE-cadherin redistribution? Regulation of E-cadherin is widely attributed to play an important role in metastasis and in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that occurs during gastrulation and neural crest migration. In these systems, it has been proposed that E-cadherin is regulated by transcriptional repression or by G&#x003b1;12/13-mediated uptake and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kelly et al., 2006a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">b</xref>). Our data suggest the presence of a different mode of regulation, as neither transcriptional regulation nor G&#x003b1;12/13 activity seem to be required for the regulation of DE-cadherin in germ cells. An attractive mechanism for DE-cadherin down-regulation could be the control of its endocytosis by Tre1. During zebrafish gastrulation, Rab GTPases have been shown to control E-cadherin turnover and the adhesion of mesendodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ulrich et al., 2005</xref>). A role for Rab proteins in germ cell migration has yet to be demonstrated. We find the same localization pattern for G&#x003b2;13f, Rho1, and DE-cadherin in the wild type, and this pattern is disrupted in <italic>tre1</italic> mutant germ cells. This suggests a role for G protein and Rho1 activation in the polarization of DE-cadherin in germ cells.</p><p>Tre1 also affects transepithelial migration independently of global DE-cadherin regulation. We show that uniform down-regulation of DE-cadherin or loss of germ cell&#x02013;germ cell contact in single cells are neither sufficient to trigger precocious transepithelial migration in the wild type nor able to suppress the <italic>tre1</italic> transepithelial migration phenotype. One possibility is that the localized activation of Tre1 and polarized down-regulation of DE-cadherin at the leading edge would orient germ cells radially toward the midgut. This radial orientation would allow germ cells to respond to additional guidance cues required for directed transepithelial migration. Although these additional guidance cues may not depend on DE-cadherin, they require G protein signaling and Tre1.</p><p>A function for E-cadherin in controlling adhesion and migration has been studied extensively in the progression of tumor metastasis and the development of epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transitions (EMTs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Radisky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thiery and Sleeman, 2006</xref>). Cells undergoing metastasis and EMTs express lower levels of E-cadherin, and the loss of E-cadherin promotes invasion of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). The loss of E-cadherin in these cases promotes the disruption of E-cadherin&#x02013;mediated cell adhesion between epithelial cells, allowing these cells to spread and migrate, and is often triggered through induction of the transcriptional repressors Twist and Snail in response to inductive signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). However, in the case of germ cell dispersal, the effect of Tre1 on DE-cadherin is not transcriptional because DE-cadherin is provided maternally in the germ cells. Our data suggest that Tre1 GPCR signaling might regulate the turnover or cellular distribution of DE-cadherin&#x02013;mediated adhesion complexes in a polarized fashion. It is possible that in addition to transcriptional mechanisms, such a polarized regulation also functions during EMT and metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly stocks and genetics</title><p>P<italic><sub>nos</sub>&#x02237;egfp-moe&#x02237;nos</italic> 3&#x02032; untranslated region was used to label germ cells with EGFP for live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sano et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>tre1<sup>&#x00394;EP5</sup></italic> is a deletion lacking the first exons of the <italic>tre1</italic> and the <italic>Gr5a</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ueno et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kunwar et al., 2003</xref>).

Ultrathin (80-nm) sections were cut on an ultramicrotome (Ultracut UCT; Reichert), stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate, and viewed on a transmission electron microscope (1200EX; JEOL Ltd.) at 80 kV.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Antibody staining of embryos was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stein et al., 2002</xref>), except for anti&#x02013;DE-cadherin staining, in which we fixed embryos with calcium and devitellinized embryos with ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oda et al., 1993</xref>). The following antibodies were used (dilutions follow in parenthesis): rabbit anti-Vasa (1:10,000; provided by A. Williamson and H.

DAPI staining was done after the secondary antibody reaction (1:1,000; Roche). Antibody detection for the biotinylated antibody was performed with the Vectastain Elite ABC Standard kit (Vector Laboratories). Embryos were observed with an Axiophoto microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and were photographed with a charge-coupled device camera (14.2 Color Mosaic; Insight 4; Diagnostics Instruments, Inc.) using Spot version 4.5 software (Diagnostics Instruments, Inc.).

Embryos were scanned with an LSM510 confocal microscope, and the intensity of the DE-cadherin staining in the germ cell membrane was measured with LSM510 software.
