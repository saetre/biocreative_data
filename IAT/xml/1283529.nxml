Expression of the dnmA gene is downregulated during the developmental cycle. Overall DNA methylation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is &#x0223c;0.2% of the cytosine residues, which indicates its restriction to a limited set of genomic loci. Bisulfite sequencing of specific sites revealed that DnmA is responsible for methylation of mostly asymmetric C-residues in the retrotransposons DIRS-1 and Skipper. Disruption of the gene resulted in a loss of methylation and in increased transcription and mobilization of Skipper. Skipper transcription was also upregulated in strains that had genes encoding components of the RNA interference pathway disrupted. In contrast, DIRS-1 expression was not affected by a loss of DnmA but was strongly increased in strains that had the RNA-directed RNA polymerase gene rrpC disrupted. A large number of siRNAs were found that corresponded to the DIRS-1 sequence, suggesting concerted regulation of DIRS-1 expression by RNAi and DNA modification. No siRNAs corresponding to the standard Skipper element were found. The data show that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in epigenetic gene silencing in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> but that different, partially overlapping mechanisms control transposon silencing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA methylation plays a crucial role in epigenetic gene regulation in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). In most eukaryotes, cytosines in the symmetric CpG or CpNpG context are methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) and methylation is propagated by maintenance methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) on the newly synthesized DNA strand shortly after replication. In addition, other methyltransferases may place new marks on DNA by <italic>de novo</italic> methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), including the modification of asymmetric sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Methylated cytosines may recruit specific chromatin components and initiate heterochromatin formation by histone deacetylation and methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). On the other hand, modified histones may recruit DNA methyltransferases and mediate C-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Though DNA methylation is found in organisms as diverse as animals, plants and fungi, it appears to be absent in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and other organisms where epigenetic silencing is mediated by histone modification alone.</p><p>It was first detected in tobacco that RNA can direct the methylation of homologous sequences in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In plants and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) silencing of chromatin was found to be mediated by small RNAs that originate from the RNA interference pathway. RdDM (RNA-directed DNA methylation) is thus another branch of regulation by small RNAs. Recently, several models have been presented as to how the RNA guides for DNA modification may be generated and which components of the cellular machinery are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Targets for epigenetic chromatin silencing are frequently transposons and retrotransposons that are a source for naturally occurring siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Transposons are reactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) and may be mobilized when components of the RNAi pathway are disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>The presence of a functional RNAi machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), the cloning of numerous siRNA-like molecules from <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> containing sequences of retrotransposons (F. S&#x000f6;derbom and V. Ambros, manuscript in preparation) and the suggestion that pericentric heterochromatin contained clustered retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) raised the question whether RNA-mediated DNA modification may be involved in epigenetic gene regulation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Similar to the situation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, previous work had suggested that <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> DNA was not methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The discovery of a methyltransferase gene of the Dnmt2 family in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome and the subsequent detection of low levels of cytosine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) prompted us to reinvestigate this issue in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. In the recently completed genome of the social amoeba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), we found a Dnmt2-like gene that had also been independently detected by Ponger <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> contains a functional DNA methyltransferase enzyme that methylates specific C-residues in the retrotransposons DIRS-1 and Skipper. Skipper silencing depends on both DNA methylation and a functional RNAi machinery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p>All experiments were carried out with Ax2, strain 214 and derivatives.

The predicted gene product of 379 amino acids and 44.1 kDa displayed 41% identity with the human enzyme. All 10 characteristic motifs of DNA methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) could be identified. Additional genes with similarity to DNA methyltransferases of the Dnmt1 or Dnmt3a/b type were not detected by blast searches in the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> genome.</p><p>RT&#x02013;PCR showed that dnmA RNA expression was high in vegetative cells and decreased during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). N-terminal fusions with GFP or a c-Myc-tag were predominantly found in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), thus confirming the <italic>in silico</italic> predicted nuclear localization by PSORTII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) and LOCtree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>).</p><p>We generated a knock-out strain of the dnmA gene by homologous recombination. The gene disruption was confirmed by PCR, Southern blot (data not shown) and RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). No obvious phenotypic alterations were observed during growth or in development.</p></sec><sec><title>The transposons DIRS-1 and Skipper are methylated by DnmA at specific, mostly asymmetric C-residues</title><p>By using global methods for DNA methylation analysis, such as capillary electrophoresis and Southwestern blots with an antibody directed against 5-methyl cytosine, we were unable to obtain conclusive evidence for a loss of DNA methylation in the mutant strain, presumably, because both methods were operating close to their detection limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and data not shown). For this reason, we focused our experiments on gene-specific methylation analysis. Based on observations in plants that RNAi could mediate transcriptional silencing by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>), we first investigated one of the discoidin gene loci after silencing by an RNAi construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Bilsulfite sequencing revealed complete conversion of C-residues and no evidence for DNA methylation (data not shown). This was not unexpected since RNAi-mediated DNA methylation is predominantly found in promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The RNAi construct was, however, directed against the coding sequence. Attempts to achieve silencing with a hairpin construct in order to generate siRNAs directed against the promoter region failed (data not shown).</p><p>In order to identify specific targets for DNA methylation, we analysed RNA derived from the dnmA knock out and from wild-type cells by microarray. Setting a threshold of at least 2-fold difference, 7 genes were found to be overexpressed in the KO strain and 12 were underexpressed. Among the upregulated genes, the ESTs SLD246 and SLE355 contained sequences encoding the gag and RT genes, respectively, of the retrotransposon Skipper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). We concentrated initially on the analysis of Skipper, as this was of special interest since transposable elements are frequently targets for methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Interestingly, the ESTs SSL485 containing non-coding Skipper sequences and SLC703 at the very end of the RT/integrase sequence were not overexpressed in the mutant. Skipper has 20 copies in the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> genome and consists of direct long terminal repeats and three open reading frames (ORFs) encoding GAG (matrix protein), PRO (protease) and RT (reverse transcriptase), POL (polymerase) and IN (invertase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Skipper is expressed at very low levels during growth and development. Bisufite sequencing of a 294 bp region in the RT gene bottom strand showed that 12 out of 21 C-residues were methylated. Methylation was mostly at asymmetric sites and could not be correlated with any obvious sequence context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). By bisulfite sequencing of the RT fragment derived from the dnmA knock-out strain no methylated C-residues (with the exception of two that are likely to be artifacts, see below) could be detected. This indicated that methylation within this sequence depended on DnmA.</p><p>Bisulfite sequencing of 214 bp of the Skipper LTR bottom strand revealed no methylation of the 12 C-residues within this sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>We then analysed the retrotransposon DIRS-1 that was not covered by the microarray. DIRS-1 occurs in 40 complete and &#x0223c;200 incomplete copies in the genome. It consists of inverted long terminal repeats and three overlapping open reading frames encoding protein1, reverse transcriptase and a recombinase. In addition, a heat-shock-induced transcript in antisense orientation termed E1 is derived from the right LTR of the locus. Transcription of DIRS-1 is developmentally regulated and expression increases substantially after the onset of starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>).</p><p>We sequenced 128 bp of the right LTR (bottom strand) and found that 7 out of 23 C-residues in this region were consistently methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Similar to the results from Skipper, methylation sites were mostly asymmetric and no obvious sequence context could be correlated with methylation.</p><p>Using DNA derived from the knock-out strain, no DNA methylation (with the exception of four that are likely to be artifacts, see below) could be detected, thus indicating that DnmA was responsible for all C modification of DIRS-1, as we had seen for Skipper.</p><p>Overall, eight non-converted C-residues were found by bisulfite sequencing in the dnmA mutant strain (two in Skipper RT, two in Skipper LTR and four in DIRS-1 LTR). This is a very small proportion of the unambiguously sequenced C-residues and we assume that this is due to an incomplete bisulfite reaction, or to PCR or sequencing errors. Importantly, most of these cytosine residues were never found to be methylated in the wild type and thus likely represent an <italic>in vitro</italic> artifact. However, we cannot exclude that an additional minor, non-conventional methyltransferase is active in the knock-out strain.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of Skipper and DIRS-1 in dnmA knock-out cells and other mutants</title><p>Skipper as well as DIRS-1 are barely expressed in cells growing in axenic suspension culture. We were interested to see whether the loss of C-methylation had an influence on the abundance of transcripts from both transposons as suggested for Skipper by the microarray. We examined RNA in the mutant and in the wild type after multiple passages through the differentiation cycle, assuming that transposon mobilization may be activated during development. Cells were grown on a lawn of <italic>K.aerogenes</italic> until they had developed mature fruiting bodies; spores were harvested and used to inoculate a new plate to begin the next cycle. After 0 and 16 cycles, spores were transferred to axenic medium and cells were grown up to prepare RNA. After 16 cycles, mutant cells were severely compromised in growth on axenic medium in one experiment (generation time of &#x0223c;25 h) but not in a second experiment over 16 cycles. This could be due to retrotransposon activation that may affect growth in one but not the other population. Wild-type cells displayed the normal generation time of 8 h over at least 20 passages in two independent experiments. Northern blot analysis revealed that DIRS-1 expression during growth was unaffected in the mutant while Skipper expression was significantly upregulated and further increased after 16 rounds of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, Skipper expression was also stronger in wild-type cells after 16 rounds of growth and development even though no significant effect on the doubling time was detected. This suggested that the frequently observed genome instability of laboratory strains after prolonged growth could be due to transposon activation.</p><p>In <italic>S.pombe</italic> siRNAs are involved in chromatin remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>) and in plants(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation is mediated by small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). We therefore examined if Skipper and DIRS-1 expression was impaired in mutants affecting the RNAi pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, Skipper expression was not only upregulated in the dnmA knock-out but also in strains where one of the three RdRP genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) was disrupted. A minor degree of overexpression was also observed in dicer A (drnA) and the heterochromatin protein gene hcpA (M. Kaller, U. Euteneuer and W. Nellen, manuscript submitted) knock-outs. In contrast, DIRS-1 expression was only affected in the rrpC mutant. The data showed that components of the RNAi pathway are involved in suppression of both retrotransposons but that DIRS-1 and Skipper are regulated by distinct mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>siRNAs cover the entire DIRS-1 sequence</title><p>The observation that components of the RNAi pathway were involved in the silencing of the retrotransposons prompted us to search for siRNAs complementary to Skipper and DIRS-1. Out of more than 9000 small RNAs represented in two small RNA libraries, &#x0223c;600 were complementary to either the bottom or the top strand of DIRS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, for details see Supplementary Figure 1S). Even though the libraries are probably not complete, DIRS-1 siRNAs are clearly overrepresented because the retrotransposon contributes &#x0223c;3.2% to the total <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) but more than 7.2% of the siRNAs contain DIRS-1 sequences. In contrast, &#x0223c;1% of the genome are Skipper sequences but no siRNAs corresponding to the complete element were found.</p></sec><sec><title>Mobilization of Skipper</title><p>To examine whether the increase of Skipper transcription had an effect on retrotransposon mobility, DNA was isolated from cell populations grown continuously over 0 and 16 passages of the life cycle. DNA was digested with SacI that generates a close to full-length fragment of 7 kb for Skipper and more than 4.5 kb for DIRS-1 from all complete copies. Southern analysis was carried out using specific Skipper and DIRS-1 fragments as probes. Hybridization signals were adjusted by comparison with ethidium bromide staining in two regions of the gel and by hybridization to a single copy gene (eriA) on the same filter. The relative copy number was calculated for both transposable elements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows the Southern blot for wild-type and dnmA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells after 0 and 16 cycles of growth and development, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> shows the change in relative copy number of the retrotransposons. No difference was detected for DIRS-1 while Skipper had already increased by 40% in mutant cells after selection of the transformants. A further increase was observed after 16 passages of growth and development to a total of 70% above the wild-type value. Wild-type cells were largely unaffected by multiple growth and development cycles and no increase of copy number was observed for either transposon.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Until now, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> DNA was considered not to be modified by cytosine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). With the completion of the genome sequencing project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), a gene, dnmA, highly homologous to the methyltransferases of the Dnmt2 family, was detected. We show here that the dnmA gene product is responsible for methylation of C-residues in the retrotransposons Skipper and DIRS-1. As might be expected, a disruption of the methyltransferase gene results in transcriptional activation of Skipper and, probably as a consequence, in mobilization of the retrotransposon. Surprisingly, DIRS-1 expression is not affected by a loss of DNA methylation. We assume that the different organization and the different strategies of transposition of the elements may cause this discrepancy: While DIRS-1 has inverted terminal repeats that contain methylated C-residues, Skipper has direct terminal repeats that are not methylated. Furthermore, there are many incomplete copies of DIRS-1 in the genome and the element frequently transposes into its own copies while Skipper has almost exclusively complete and separate copies in the genome. DIRS-1 appears to constitute centromeres in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and is also clustered in the vicinity of the telomeres while Skipper is more spread out over the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). Though these characteristics argue for mechanistic differences in transposition, they cannot functionally explain the susceptibility of Skipper but not DIRS-1 expression to DNA methylation. It is noteworthy that the promoter for Skipper transcription is probably located in the LTR and promoter methylation usually causes transcriptional silencing. In the case of Skipper, however, coding sequences rather than the LTR are methylated. We therefore propose that DNA methylation causes chromatin remodelling over the entire retroelement and thus blocks accessibility for the transcription machinery. The component(s) mediating chromatin remodelling remain elusive since a search for methyl-C binding proteins in the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> database did not reveal any candidate gene containing significant similarity to methyl binding domains. This may not be surprising since conventional MBDs bind to the symmetric CpG motif in a certain sequence context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) and most methylated C-residues are in a non-symmetric context in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. In contrast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> contains a putative methyl-C binding protein MBD2/3 that associates with specific regions in the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) but it has not been shown to bind to the methylated, asymmetric C-residues.</p><p>In yeast, siRNAs are required to recruit heterochromatin components to specific sites in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and in plants DNA methylation is targeted by small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). We therefore investigated whether siRNAs complementary to retrotransposon sequences could be found. Again, completely different results were obtained for the two retroelements: while no siRNAs corresponding to the complete Skipper element could be detected, more than 600 different molecules were found for DIRS-1. Since siRNAs covered essentially the entire DIRS-1 sequence, all methylation sites in the short segment that we sequenced by the bisulfite method had a corresponding siRNA. However, not all siRNAs covered C-residues that were methylated. Since methylation sites are mostly asymmetric, cytosine modification has to occur <italic>de novo</italic> as would be predicted for a Dnmt2-like enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). Our observations strongly suggest that siRNAs are involved in DNA methylation. However, their role in the regulation of DNA methylation cannot be determined at this point. In fact, it has been shown in <italic>Neurospora</italic> that <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation is independent of RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>).</p><p>With the detection of siRNAs for DIRS-1, it was obvious to examine if components of the RNAi machinery were involved in silencing of the retrotransposons. The results were unexpected since Skipper silencing was strongly dependent on functional RdRPs and the dicer A gene even though no siRNAs had been found. In contrast, DIRS-1 expression was induced only when the RdRPC gene (rrpC) was knocked out. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), we had shown that rrpC was not required for post-transcriptional gene silencing by RNAi. However, rrpC is necessary for PTGS mediated by antisense RNA, indicating differences between gene silencing by single stranded (antisense) and double-stranded (RNAi) RNA molecules (H. Martens and W. Nellen, unpublished data). It is tempting to correlate this with the fact that the antisense transcript E1 is transcribed from the right DIRS-1 LTR. The observation that a knock out of the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> Dicer homologue drnA had no effect on DIRS-1 expression could be explained by the activity of the second Dicer gene drnB. However, since Skipper was clearly upregulated in a drnA knock-out strain, this provides evidence that the two dicer genes are not completely redundant.</p><p>In a transposition active transcript of DIRS-1, the inverted repeats can form a double strand of more than 300 bp and the formation of a 1.7 kb double strand with the antisense transcript E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>) is feasible. However, siRNAs are also found in regions that do not form putative double strands. They may therefore originate from RdRP copies of the primary transcript and would thus constitute secondary siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Alternatively, an antisense strand could be generated by an RNA polymerase IV-like activity that has recently been detected in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). However, a polymerase IV-like enzyme has not yet been identified in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Though we do not know whether the abundant siRNAs that we found for DIRS-1 are functionally involved in silencing, it is still surprising that most knock outs of RNAi components (except for rrpC) did not show an effect on DIRS-1 activity. Possibly, DNA methylation followed by chromatin remodelling as proposed above and antisense regulation provide redundant pathways for DIRS-1 silencing and both alone are sufficient. In contrast, Skipper, responded to the gene knock outs as if it was silenced by the RNAi machinery. Though no Skipper siRNAs were found, they could still be generated but escape detection due to rapid turnover or low abundance.</p><p>Various mechanisms to silence transposons and retrotransposons in one organism have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, different classes of transposable elements are regulated by different, though overlapping mechanisms that require DNA methylation, histone modification and the RNAi system. Remarkably, different components contribute to various degrees to silencing of specific transposable elements. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute simultaneously to the silencing machinery.</p><p>In an independent approach, Shaulsky and co-workers detected low levels of DnmA dependent DNA methylation in Dictyostelium (M. Katoh, T. Curk, Q. Xu, B. Zupan, A. Kuspa, G. Shaulsky, in press). Using methylation sensitive restriction enzymes, they identified methylated CpG sites in DIRS-1 and in the guaB gene.</p><p>Taken together, our data establish Dictyostelium as a model system to study mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation by DNA methylation and RNA interference. Both mechanisms appear to overlap in function to silence the retrotransposons DIRS-1 and Skipper but further experiments are required to elucidate how the two pathways interact.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_33_19_6405__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_19_6405__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Michael Wassenegger (Centrum Gr&#x000fc;ne Gentechnik, Neustadt) for providing DNA from tobacco infected with PSTVd.
