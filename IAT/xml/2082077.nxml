Loss of Ce HCF-1 protein at reduced temperatures (e.g., 12&#x000b0;C), however, leads to a high incidence of embryonic lethality and early embryonic mitotic and cytokinetic defects reminiscent of mammalian cell-division defects upon loss of HCF-1 function. Even when viable, however, at normal temperature, mutant embryos display reduced levels of phospho-histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10P), a modification implicated in both transcriptional and mitotic regulation.

Other examples of such seeming discrepancies in the importance of cell-cycle regulators exist, however. For example, in mice, loss of the retinoblastoma protein pRb, an important regulator of the cell cycle, results in embryonic lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001213-Clarke1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001213-Lee2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>; in worms, however, the pRb homolog (encoded by the <italic>lin-35</italic> gene) is not required for development but, as with Ce HCF-1, its loss causes reduced fertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001213-Ferguson1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001213-Lu1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, HCF-1 and pRb proteins are both involved in chromatin modification and thus the reduced effects of loss of HCF-1 and pRb proteins in worms when compared to mammals may reflect differences in the role(s) of chromatin modifications in these distantly related species.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Role of Ce HCF-1 in early embryonic cell division</title><p>Although molecular aspects of HCF-protein function are highly conserved (e.g., VP16-induced complex formation), cellular aspects seem to vary. Thus, there is no evident G1-phase arrest, a phenotype observed in mammalian cells, during worm embryonic development upon loss of <italic>hcf-1</italic> function. In mammalian cells, HCF-1 appears to promote G1-S phase progression by binding to E2F1 via a so called HCF-1 binding motif or HBM. The HBM is the tetrapeptide sequence <sup>D</sup>/<sub>E</sub>HxY, where x is any amino acid, found in HCF-1 interacting proteins that is recognized by the HCF-1 Kelch domain for binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001213-Freiman1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001213-Lu2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Human, as well as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, E2F1 proteins possess the HBM and associate with human and Drosphila HCF proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001213-Tyagi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. We find it interesting that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> E2F1 homolog, called EFL-1, does not conserve the HBM sequence. Given that loss of CeHCF-1 does not lead to a cell-cycle arrest, perhaps this E2F1-related role has not been conserved in worms.</p><p>Some relationships to E2F factors and pRb pocket proteins probably have been conserved, however, because, like the <italic>C. elegans</italic> pRb and E2F1 homologs, CeHCF-1 is implicated in the synthetic multivulval phenotype. Thus, <italic>lin-35</italic> (pRb homolog) and <italic>efl-1</italic> (E2F1 homolog) belong to the same class of genes called SynMuv B whose loss of function can lead to the multivulval phenotype when combined with loss of function of a gene of the SynMuv A or C group. Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001213-Cui1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> have shown that <italic>hcf-1</italic> function is important to promote the multivulval phenotype of a SynMuv AB combination suggesting that one or more relationships exist between HCF-1, pRb and E2F1 homologs from worms to humans.</p><p>In toto, these results described here suggest that HCF-1 activity has been conserved in animals for chromatin modification and cell cycle regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001213.s001"><label>Methods S1</label><caption><p>Supporting Materials and Methods</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001213.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001213.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Brood size and embryonic viability analysis at 20 and 12 degrees in pk924 and ok559 backgrounds.
