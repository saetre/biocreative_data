Identification of genes that restrain BCR-mediated proliferation is therefore an important goal toward improving the therapy of B cell lymphoma. Here, we identify <italic>Ptger4</italic> as a negative feedback regulator of proliferation in response to BCR signals and show that its encoded EP4 receptor is a principal molecule conveying the growth-suppressive effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Stable knockdown of <italic>Ptger4</italic> in B cell lymphoma markedly accelerated tumor spread in mice, whereas <italic>Ptger4</italic> overexpression yielded significant protection. Mechanistically, we show that the intrinsic activity of <italic>Ptger4</italic> and PGE2&#x02013;EP4 signaling target a similar set of activating genes, and find <italic>Ptger4</italic> to be significantly down-regulated in human B cell lymphoma. We postulate that <italic>Ptger4</italic> functions in B cells as a candidate tumor suppressor whose activity is regulated by PGE2 in the microenvironment. These findings suggest that targeting EP4 receptor for prostaglandin may present a novel strategy for treatment of B cell malignancies.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: BCR, B cell receptor; DLBCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; GC, germinal center; miRNA, micro RNA; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; qPCR, quantitative real-time PCR; Tet, tetracycline.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Recognition of foreign antigens by BCRs expressed on the surface of mature naive B cells triggers their massive proliferation, which is critically important for the effective defense of the organism against invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Antigen-activated B cells undergo clonal expansion in dynamic structures called germinal centers (GCs) where much of the diversity of the Ig genes is generated by somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). These molecular processes require frequent DNA strand breaks that can, when deregulated, provide a rich source for the genesis of B cell lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). For instance, the hallmark of Burkitt's lymphoma and some cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a reciprocal chromosomal translocation where the <italic>MYC</italic> protooncogene comes under the control of an active Ig locus, resulting in constitutive expression of <italic>MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). However, although this and other translocations are thought to cause many types of B cell lymphoma, additional transforming events that override the normal mechanisms controlling B cell proliferation are needed for malignant transformation. Indeed, mutations affecting the expression level or the activity of tumor suppressor genes, as well as genomic amplifications and hypermutations of multiple protooncogenes have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of B cell lymphomas (for review see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>]).</p><p>Despite the aggressive behavior of several types of B cell lymphoma, data gathered over the past few years have demonstrated that BCR signaling is essential for the survival of neoplastic B lymphoma cells, which also holds true for their nonmalignant counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Observations that the majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas persistently express BCR and that IgH translocations almost never affect the functionality of Ig alleles, as well as the discovery of autoreactive BCR in certain neoplasms, indirectly suggests the need for BCR-derived survival and proliferation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Correspondingly, BCR signaling was found to promote growth of DLBCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), whereas follicular lymphoma B cells displayed potentiated BCR signaling versus tumor-infiltrating normal B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Most recently, a direct link between BCR signaling and B lymphomagenesis was established by demonstrating that <italic>PAX5</italic> promotes neoplastic growth by activating BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). These findings, together with the recognition that the survival of many B cell tumors depends on signals provided by their microenvironment, might lead to novel treatment options for B cell lymphoma.</p><p>More than three decades have passed since the first description of macrophage-derived PGE2 as a potent suppressor of splenic B cell colony formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), and it was later demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of PGE2 was caused by its direct influence on B cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Further studies identified tingible body macrophages as a major source of prostaglandins in the GC microenvironment, and proposed that these scavengers of apoptotic lymphocytes may use prostaglandin to down-regulate the GC reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). However, since these seminal observations, no further insight into the mechanism or relevance of the attenuating effect of PGE2 on B cell proliferation has been provided. In this study, we investigated how, mechanistically, PGE2 and its receptors may regulate B cell proliferation triggered by BCR signaling, and evaluated the potential contribution to B cell lymphoma growth in mice and humans.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title><italic>Ptger4</italic> is a delayed-early gene that inhibits B cell proliferation</title><p>BCR-triggered activation of mature B cells leads to transcriptional reprogramming, which can be observed by a strong induction of immediate-early genes within minutes after mitogenic stimulation, preparing a cell to quickly respond with proliferation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; see also <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). In an attempt to identify negative regulators of B cell proliferation, we performed transcriptome analysis at 2 h after BCR stimulation and looked for putative delayed-early genes, which are generally known to function as negative feedback regulators of growth factor signaling (GEO database accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="geo" xlink:href="GSE9215">GSE9215</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Among the most strongly induced genes, we found <italic>Ptger4</italic>, whose expression kinetics appeared similar to a wave of delayed-early genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In addition to its high induction upon BCR cross-linking, <italic>Ptger4</italic> also seemed interesting as a candidate regulator of B cell activation because it encodes an EP4 subtype of receptor for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), and PGE2 is known for its potent yet poorly understood immunosuppressive role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Notably, none of the other genes coding for PGE2 receptors showed altered expression after BCR triggering (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We found the induction of <italic>Ptger4</italic> to be conserved in mouse A20 and human P493-6 B cell lines, and confirmed that it resulted in protein expression by Western blotting and immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B&#x02013;D</xref> and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081163/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081163/DC1</ext-link>; see also Fig. S2).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Ptger4</italic> is a delayed-early gene that inhibits B cell proliferation.</bold> (A) Mouse splenic B cells stimulated with (BCR) or without (ctrl) anti-IgM F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> for 72 h in culture.

We observed that knockout mice consistently harboured significantly increased numbers of B cells that showed greater resistance to spontaneous cell death in vitro compared with wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). In addition, cell cycle analysis and ATP content measurements revealed an augmented mitogenic response of <italic>Ptger4</italic>-deficient B cells upon BCR ligation, indicating that the early induction of <italic>Ptger4</italic> may serve to counterbalance antigen-induced proliferation in mouse B cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, G and H</xref>). To check whether the endogenously produced PGE2 may have influenced the growth of BCR-activated B cells, we examined the levels of PGE2 in culture supernatants and saw that these remained below the detection limit of 15 pg/ml during the course of the experiment (unpublished data). In addition, cotreatment with COX inhibitors indomethacin or NS-398 had no significant effect on proliferation or viability of BCR-stimulated cultures, suggesting that de novo&#x02013;produced PGE2 may not be a major factor in suppressing the growth of activated wild-type compared with <italic>Ptger4</italic>-deficient B cells in culture (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081163/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081163/DC1</ext-link>). In summary, these observations suggested that <italic>Ptger4</italic> functions as a delayed-early gene upon BCR-triggering, and prompted us to further investigate the mechanism used by <italic>Ptger4</italic> to attenuate BCR-signaled proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Ptger4</italic> acts as a negative feedback regulator of BCR-signaling</title><p>First, to understand how lack of <italic>Ptger4</italic> may have enhanced BCR-driven proliferation, we examined the early transcriptional response of both <italic>Ptger4</italic>-deficient and wild-type mouse B cells to stimulation with anti-IgM F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> in culture. We were surprised by the regulation of genes known to affect lymphocyte proliferation, which showed two functionally coherent groups of genes defined by the presence or absence of <italic>Ptger4</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In line with the aforementioned observations, 11 out of 13 genes (85%) that had higher expression levels in knockout relative to wild-type B cells were found to promote proliferation, whereas all (5 out of 5) genes overexpressed in wild-types had an inhibitory role. Surprisingly, signaling through the BCR in wild-type cells resulted in a profound down-regulation of most genes encoding components of the proximal BCR-signaling cascade itself, suggesting the existence of a potent negative feedback mechanism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Although triggering of <italic>Ptger4</italic>-deficient B cells also repressed the majority of these genes, several crucial genes of the upper BCR pathway, including <italic>Ptprc</italic> coding for CD45 (also known as B220) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and <italic>Ighm</italic> coding for the immunoglobulin heavy chain of the B cell receptor itself, were induced nearly twofold in <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells compared with wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This indicates that by maintaining the relatively high expression of certain signaling components, the lack of <italic>Ptger4</italic> may prolong the duration of signaling via the BCR, cumulatively delivering a stronger proliferative stimulus.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Ptger4</italic> is a negative feedback regulator of BCR-triggered proliferation.</bold> (A) Relative expression values and functions of genes known to affect lymphocyte proliferation, according to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis database (IPA; see URLs in Materials and methods).

The knockdown efficiency was similar to that achieved in stable cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

To exclude the possibility of saturation, the assay for EGR1 and CRE activity was also performed at a lower concentration (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) of anti-IgG F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> (Fig. S4).

Notably, CD74 has been shown to promote B cell lymphoma progression, and an anti-CD74 antibody is currently being clinically evaluated for the therapy of human B cell malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>Because B cells use antigen-presenting MHC class II molecules to attract activating help from helper T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), endogenous control of the MHC-encoding genes by <italic>Ptger4</italic> may thus provide another means to keep B cell activation in check. Indeed, as we demonstrate in this study, signaling via the EP4 receptor potently repressed the expression of multiple MHC components essential for effective antigen presentation by B cells (see also <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Interestingly, it has been reported that PGE2 and EP2/EP4 agonists significantly inhibit the expression of MHC class II molecules in B lymphocytes stimulated with IL-4 and/or lipopolysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), suggesting that the inhibition of MHC class II by EP4 may occur independently of the stimulus used to activate B cells.</p><p>To verify the regulatory function of <italic>Ptger4</italic> in BCR-driven gene transcription, we focused on a set of immediate-early genes induced by antigen-receptor signaling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). Transient micro RNA (miRNA)&#x02013;mediated knockdown of <italic>Ptger4</italic> in the A20 B cell lymphoma line resulted in increased transcriptional activity of NF-&#x003ba;B, in line with the observation from primary <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells, where genes coding for essential components of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, including <italic>Traf5</italic>, <italic>Nfkb1</italic>, <italic>Nfkbie</italic>, and <italic>Fbi1</italic>, have been found significantly induced over controls (GEO accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="geo" xlink:href="GSE9847">GSE9847</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). In contrast, ectopic expression of the <italic>Ptger4</italic> ORF region repressed BCR-driven transcription through NF-&#x003ba;B, complementing the results from loss-of-function studies. <italic>Ptger4</italic> exerted a similar inhibitory effect on transcriptional activity of the AP-1 components FOS and JUN, and potently decreased expression from IL-2 promoter known to contain critically important AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). On the other hand, neither silencing nor overexpression of <italic>Ptger4</italic> influenced transcriptional activity of EGR1 or transcription through cAMP-response element (CRE), both of which greatly increase upon BCR ligation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref> and Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081163/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081163/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Together, these data indicate that <italic>Ptger4</italic> negatively regulates BCR-mediated gene expression and B cell proliferation, primarily by inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 transcriptional activity.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Ptger4</italic> is a candidate tumor suppressor in mouse B cell lymphoma</title><p>As primary <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells resisted rapid cell death in vitro in the absence of activating stimuli, we next set out to determine how altering the <italic>Ptger4</italic> gene dosage would affect B cell growth and survival. To this end, we designed lentiviral vectors containing either GFP cocistronic with miRNA targeting <italic>Ptger4</italic> (miPtger4) or the cloned <italic>Ptger4</italic> ORF region to generate stable A20 B cell lines. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunoblotting confirmed the efficiency of the stably integrated <italic>Ptger4</italic> knockdown and overexpressing cassettes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Interestingly, although the introduced changes did not seem to influence the in vitro growth of A20 cells, which have a doubling time of &#x0003c;12 h, the slower growing P493-6 human B cell line was significantly impacted by a silencing construct that targeted both mouse and human <italic>Ptger4</italic> and achieved comparable gene knockdown levels in both cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> and unpublished data). The modified human B cells showed a similar rate of proliferation at low cell concentrations compared with controls, but later resisted overgrowth and reached about twice the density of viable control cells in the medium. This is in agreement with increased ex vivo survival of <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells and indicates that reducing the levels of <italic>Ptger4</italic> enhances survival of mouse and human B cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Ptger4</italic> is a candidate tumor suppressor in B cells.</bold> (A) Stable A20 cell lines were generated by lentiviral infection as described in Materials and methods. <italic>Ptger4</italic> expression was determined by qPCR and confirmed by Western blotting.

Because A20 cells are known to induce tumor formation when introduced into syngeneic mice, we injected 200,000 viable cells from each of the generated A20 lines in the BALB/c strain and monitored tumor development over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Stable coexpression of GFP in the injected cells allowed us to easily track tumor origin by fluorescence microscopy of the dissected or intact tumor tissue. Stunningly, although most of the control mice injected with nontargeting miRNA (miCTRL)-carrying cells succumbed to disseminated B-lymphoma development over the first two-month period, as expected, overexpression of <italic>Ptger4</italic> yielded significant protection against lymphoma spread, and the majority (70%) of mice survived beyond the monitoring period with no adverse symptoms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In contrast, A20 cells with stably silenced <italic>Ptger4</italic> potently aggravated tumor burden, which frequently manifested as liver and neck region metastasis, as well as hind limb paralysis, and the mice quickly became terminally ill. Additionally, the more efficient miRNA, miPtger4b, triggered a more severe phenotype than the less efficient miPtger4a, as was also evident from a separate experiment in which a higher number of injected cells induced tumor formation at the site of injection in the eye, with the size of the tumor corresponding to the <italic>Ptger4</italic> knockdown efficiency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).

Because we identified <italic>Ptger4</italic> as a delayed-early gene and the only BCR-induced gene of the <italic>Ptger</italic> series (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), we speculated that the EP4 receptor may be important for conveying the growth-regulatory actions of PGE2 in B cells. We first checked the influence of PGE2 on BCR-triggered proliferation of wild-type cells in vitro and saw that PGE2 at a concentration as low as 1 nM effectively prevented B cell cluster formation and proliferation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In contrast, EP4-null B cells were completely insensitive to the inhibition by PGE2, forming massive clusters of proliferating cells similar to the vehicle-treated controls, even at high doses of PGE2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). This strongly suggested that EP4 was the major, if not the only receptor transmitting the PGE2-delivered signal to block B cell growth. In addition, treatment with the EP4-specific agonist PGE1-OH faithfully mimicked the inhibitory activity of PGE2 in wild-type, but not EP4-null, cells, as opposed to stimulating the closest EP4-related receptor, EP2, which did not influence proliferation of either cell type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>The suppressive effect of PGE2 on B cell proliferation is mediated by the EP4 receptor.</bold><italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> (A) and <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (B) splenic B cells were incubated in vitro for 60 h with anti-IgM F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> and cotreated with PGE2 at the concentrations as indicated (ctrl, vehicle-treated control).

Although the two cell populations did not differ during the initial phase (the first 18&#x02013;24 h) of cluster formation, the effect of PGE2 became progressively more apparent, as the wild-type cells were less efficient at forming bigger groups of cells. Once <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells entered a cluster, they stayed associated with it until the activation reaction was terminated, as opposed to wild-type cells, which dynamically shuttled in and out of clusters, resulting in a smaller net size of the clusters and in more cells found dispersed throughout the culture plate (Videos S1 and S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081163/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081163/DC1</ext-link>). Notably, this time-dependent activity of PGE2 was in line with the kinetics of BCR-induced EP4 expression, as revealed by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). To discern the impact of signaling through EP4 on cell proliferation, we used the CFSE method to follow cell division of BCR-activated B cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). In agreement with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), PGE2 allowed wild-type B cells to undergo only one round of cell division, but significantly inhibited further proliferation of daughter B cells. In contrast, <italic>Ptger4</italic>-deficient cells displayed complete protection against the proliferation-limiting effects of PGE2, confirming the suggestion that EP4 is the primary molecule mediating the negative influence of PGE2 on B cell activation. The addition of PGE2 diminished the viability of activated wild-type B cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. S5), suggesting that PGE2 signaling via the EP4 receptor promoted the apoptosis of replicating progeny. The greater proportion of undivided cells at 96 h compared with 60 h in cultures supplemented with 10 nM PGE2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>) is thus a likely consequence of a preferential death of the divided population at the later time point.</p></sec><sec><title>PGE2&#x02013;EP4 signaling results in general repression of activating genes</title><p>We next asked how, mechanistically, PGE2&#x02013;EP4 signaling antagonizes the proliferative burst of B cells triggered by antigen receptor cross-linking. Therefore, we inspected the transcriptional status of activated wild-type B cells incubated with or without PGE2 in comparison to EP4-null cells at 24 h after BCR triggering, a time point at which the inhibited phenotype started to become apparent and when EP4 protein was first readily detected by immunoblotting. Interestingly, of the 263 genes whose expression was altered by more than twofold in wild-type B cells because of the presence of PGE2, 91% (240 genes) were down-regulated, indicating a general repressive effect of PGE2 on gene transcription in activated B cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). To the contrary, only 10 of the &#x0223c;22,000 genes examined were either induced or repressed in knockout cells, suggesting that EP4 was indeed the primary receptor through which PGE2 exerted its attenuation of the BCR-induced response. This finding was confirmed by an independent direct comparison of activated and PGE2-treated wild-type and <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells, which revealed EP4-mediated 85% (527 out of 623 genes affected) attenuation of gene transcription (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>PGE2&#x02013;EP4 signaling results in general repression of activating genes.</bold> (A) Genes regulated at least twofold in BCR-triggered <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and/or <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells by 1 nM PGE2 at 24 h.

However, genes that changed expression in both models had a reciprocal pattern of change; genes that were up-regulated because of the lack of EP4 were down-regulated in conditions where EP4 was abundant and stimulated by PGE2, confirming that this set of genes was specifically controlled by the EP4 receptor. PGE2&#x02013;EP4 signaling most profoundly attenuated the expression of several genes coding for molecules of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, ribosomal proteins, translation-initiation factors, and ATP-producing molecules, as well as components of the MHC and (immuno)proteasome, most of which are known to be mandatory for efficient B cell activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>, and Table S2). These data validate and complement the observations from <italic>Ptger4</italic>-deficient B cells, indicating that EP4 functions to prime the inhibitory activity of its endogenous ligand PGE2 by repressing transcription of a functionally coherent set of activating genes, eventually leading to a systemic attenuation of B cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Ptger4</italic> antagonizes GC B cell development</title><p>To verify the implications of our findings beyond the model of in vitro BCR-stimulated cells, we first screened the published data for potential differences in <italic>Ptger4</italic> expression levels between naive follicular B cells and activated GC B cells in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). In accord with the expectations, GC B cells exhibited profoundly reduced levels of <italic>Ptger4</italic> compared with naive controls, confirming the in vitro observation that low <italic>Ptger4</italic> expression favors B cell proliferation (Fig. S6, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081163/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081163/DC1</ext-link>). We then examined the expression of EP4 protein and saw that GC B cells expressed it at a much lower level compared with naive B cells, supporting the data from the aforementioned transcriptional analyses (Fig. S6 C). Furthermore, the analysis of GC B cell content in <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice immunized with a T cell&#x02013;dependent antigen found a significant increase compared with wild-type controls, indicating that the lack of <italic>Ptger4</italic> was causative for the enhanced activation of B cells in vivo (Fig. S6 D). The importance of these findings is underscored by the fact that many B cell malignancies in humans show expression patterns of differentiation markers and global gene-expression profiles characteristic of GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), thus most types of B cell lymphoma are thought to originate from GC B cells. It should be noted, however, that the higher proportion of GC B cells in <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may have resulted, at least in part, as a consequence of altered functioning of other EP4-expressing cell types, such as T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), which also participate in T cell&#x02013;dependent immune responses.</p></sec><sec><title>The protooncogene <italic>MYC</italic> down-regulates <italic>PTGER4</italic> in human B cell lymphomas</title><p>To investigate the relevance of <italic>PTGER4</italic> to human disease, we first looked for altered expression of <italic>PTGER4</italic> in normal versus malignant B cell populations by mining the GEO expression database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Interestingly, the analysis showed that <italic>PTGER4</italic> is markedly down-regulated in the most commonly occurring, aggressive form of B cell malignancy, DLBCL, indicating that the reduction of proliferation-attenuating function of <italic>PTGER4</italic> may indeed contribute to human B cell lymphoma growth (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). We then asked about the possible mechanism leading to the observed decrease in <italic>PTGER4</italic> expression in human neoplasia by focusing on the <italic>MYC</italic> gene. Because of chromosomal breakpoints at the <italic>MYC</italic> locus, increased transcription of <italic>MYC</italic> is a frequent cause of B lymphomagenesis, and has been associated with an adverse clinical outcome in several cases of aggressive B cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). To that end, we used a human B cell line (P493-6) carrying a conditional tetracycline (Tet)-regulatable <italic>MYC</italic> allele that allows for abundant expression of <italic>MYC</italic> in the absence of Tet, but only weak <italic>MYC</italic> expression when Tet is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). We saw that the presence of Tet markedly influenced BCR-induced expression of <italic>PTGER4</italic>; in the high-<italic>MYC</italic> condition, the induction of <italic>PTGER4</italic> was moderate, whereas low amounts of <italic>MYC</italic> transcripts greatly facilitated <italic>PTGER4</italic> up-regulation, suggesting that <italic>MYC</italic> represses <italic>PTGER4</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). To examine whether the association between <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>PTGER4</italic> is relevant in vivo, we selected <italic>PTGER4</italic> and several known tumor suppressors with established roles in human B cell lymphoma, and examined their expression in clinical cases of Burkitt's lymphoma, DLBCL, and some other types of mature aggressive B cell lymphomas with or without <italic>MYC</italic> translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). We observed that this set of tumor-suppressor genes, including <italic>PTGER4</italic>, was coordinately down-regulated in cases with <italic>MYC</italic> translocations compared with cases without <italic>MYC</italic> translocations, irrespective of morphological, clinical, or immunohistochemical characteristics of the investigated B cell lymphomas (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). These findings are consistent with a tumor-suppressive role of <italic>PTGER4</italic> in human B cell cancer, and implicate the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene as a potent negative regulator of <italic>PTGER4</italic> expression. Although our data allow for a causative correlation, the extent to which the reduced <italic>PTGER4</italic> expression contributes to the origin of these malignancies remains speculative, and further studies will be required to evaluate the potential of <italic>PTGER4</italic> and its encoded EP4 receptor as a target for the therapy of human B cell lymphoma.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>MYC</italic> down-regulates the expression of <italic>PTGER4</italic> in human B cell lymphoma.</bold> (A) <italic>PTGER4</italic> is significantly down-regulated in human DLBCL cells relative to normal B cells.

In this study, we identify <italic>Ptger4</italic> as a typical delayed-early gene negatively regulating the robust proliferative response of B cells to antigen receptor triggering and use transcriptome analysis to delineate the attenuating mechanism used by <italic>Ptger4</italic>.</p><p>The observation that <italic>Ptger4</italic> knockout B cells display a more activated genotype compared with wild-type controls early after BCR-stimulation in vitro suggests an inherent growth-suppressing activity of <italic>Ptger4</italic> that is independent of PGE2&#x02013;EP4 interactions. This is supported by the finding that BCR-stimulated mouse B cells do not secrete any substantial amounts of PGE2 in culture and that incubation of wild-type B cells with COX inhibitors to block the potential PGE2 biosynthesis does not augment proliferation of activated B cells, excluding the possible influence of de novo&#x02013;produced PGE2. In addition, stable knockdown of <italic>Ptger4</italic> promoted growth of a human B cell line in culture, suggesting that the intrinsic growth-limiting role of <italic>Ptger4</italic> is conserved between mouse and human B cells. Although there is evidence for the secretion of relatively high amounts of PGE2 by quiescent and activated human B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), we are not aware of any studies supporting the production of PGE2 by mouse B lymphocytes, with the exception of a study by Graf et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>) showing that a biphenotypic B/macrophage population of cells produces substantial amounts of PGE2 upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, CD40, or BCR ligand. In contrast, it has been noted that the expression of COX-1 and -2 is not observed in mouse B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), and the lack of induction of COX-2 is confirmed by our microarray analysis of mouse B cells after BCR engagement (GSE9215 and GSE9847). Interestingly, although controversy exists regarding the net effect of PGE2 on proliferative responses of activated human B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), there appears to be a consensus on the inhibitory function of PGE2 on mouse B cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Depending on the mitogenic stimulus studied, reports have documented inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), no influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>), stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), or concentration-dependent effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>) of PGE2 on proliferation of human B cells. It is possible that the various stimuli differently regulate the expression of or signaling through each of the four distinct PGE2 receptors, some of them with opposing functions, thus critically influencing the net result of PGE2 action on humans B cells. Further studies will be required to show whether PGE2&#x02013;EP4 signaling is inhibitory in each of these B cell&#x02013;activating conditions.</p><p>Two main observations lead us to assume that <italic>Ptger4</italic> acts as a feedback regulator to attenuate BCR-signaling pathway. First, <italic>Ptger4</italic> counteracted the transcriptional activity of early-induced NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 complexes, which are both essential for propagating B cell growth and proliferation, and, second, it facilitated down-regulation of several proximal BCR-signaling components. Given the &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; tendency of the BCR to undergo autoinactivation upon signal transmission, the negative feedback regulation by <italic>Ptger4</italic> may thus shorten the activation period of the BCR, ultimately resulting in a weaker proliferative response of wild-type compared with <italic>Ptger4</italic>-deficient B cells.</p><p>A striking finding of our study is the reduced in vivo tumorigenic potential of the aggressive A20 B-lymphoma cells overexpressing <italic>Ptger4</italic>. Regardless of whether the diminished tumorigenicity resulted from the enhanced cell-intrinsic effects of <italic>Ptger4</italic>, increased PGE2&#x02013;EP4 signaling, or both, the over-present <italic>Ptger4</italic> was clearly causative for protection of mice against lymphoma spread. Conversely, the aggravated symptoms caused by tumor development and the increased mortality imposed by the &#x0223c;40&#x02013;45% silenced expression of <italic>Ptger4</italic> demonstrate the inhibitory potential of <italic>Ptger4</italic> and indicate that its deficit was, indeed, the primary genetic lesion leading to the elevated rate of tumor invasion. We were therefore not surprised to find <italic>PTGER4</italic> significantly down-regulated in DLBCL, the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that accounts for 30&#x02013;40% of all lymphoma cases and that frequently shows a poor prognosis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Together, these data further establish <italic>Ptger4</italic> as a negative regulator of BCR-signaling and identify it as a candidate tumor suppressor in mouse and human B cells.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports, PGE2 potently inhibited B cell activation, and we for the first time provide definitive proof that the EP4 receptor is the principal molecule responsible for the repressive activity of PGE2 in B cells. This finding indicates that PGE2 potentiates the existing intrinsic inhibition by EP4, which is supported by the progressively greater negative influence of PGE2 on B cell proliferation and viability correlating with the expression level of EP4, and, importantly, by the reciprocal EP4-related gene regulation between activated <italic>Ptger4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and PGE2-treated wild-type B cells. Transcriptional profiling of PGE2&#x02013;EP4 signaling uncovered a systemic down-regulation of numerous prosurvival genes that likely accounted for the impacted phenotype. Several of these genes mapped to the most significantly affected NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, indicating that the latter could play a key role in the EP4&#x02013;phenotype correlation. Importantly, genetic studies in mice have confirmed the essential role of NF-&#x003ba;B in promoting B cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), and activated B cell&#x02013;like DLBCL cells depend on constitutive NF-&#x003ba;B activity for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). The EP4-attenuated expression of cell-cycling genes, as well as genes coding for components of the energy-producing and protein-translation machinery might have, at least in part, come as a consequence of the aberrant upstream NF-&#x003ba;B activity, together leading to a proliferation shutdown.</p><p>Another functionally coherent network consisted of MHC class I and II members, which B cells use to present antigens to and thus stimulate T cells, thereby ensuring appropriate immune response to foreign antigens. This suggests that EP4 not only functions to negatively regulate the activation of the B cell in which it is expressed, but may also limit the responses of other immune cells in its vicinity. Nevertheless, one of the genes most significantly up-regulated by the lack of <italic>Ptger4</italic> and repressed by PGE2&#x02013;EP4 signaling, the MHC class II chaperone CD74, was found to directly stimulate B cell survival and promote malignant B cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). The expression of <italic>PTGER4</italic> may thus be relevant to the efficiency of the anti-CD74 monoclonal antibody LL1, which is currently under evaluation as a novel therapeutic agent to treat B cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>Activation of the <italic>MYC</italic> protooncogene by chromosomal translocations or hypermutation is a key event in the pathogenesis of many B cell lymphomas, and <italic>MYC</italic> breakpoints in lymphomas with a high chromosomal complexity score strongly correlate with a poor survival rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Given that the critical mechanisms by which <italic>MYC</italic> contributes to malignant transformation are not clear, it is tempting to speculate that the coordinate down-regulation of multiple tumor suppressor genes, including <italic>PTGER4</italic>, plays an important role in <italic>MYC</italic>-induced lymphomagenesis. It is noteworthy that <italic>PTGER4</italic> has also been identified as one of a few genes targeted by the transcription factor and candidate tumor suppressor ETV6, deletions of which are observed in up to 47% of childhood pre&#x02013;B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>), implying a different mechanism of <italic>PTGER4</italic> down-regulation in B cell malignancy. Regardless of the primary genetic lesion leading to reduced expression of <italic>PTGER4</italic>, our findings support the possibility that regulation of B cell proliferation is a contributing mechanism by which <italic>PTGER4</italic> could hold human B cell lymphoma formation in check.</p><p>Collectively, our data postulate <italic>Ptger4</italic> as a delayed-early gene and a negative feedback regulator of BCR-signaled activation of B cells. This gene functions via its encoded EP4 receptor, which is also the principal molecule transmitting the inhibitory message of PGE2 to proliferating B cells. Regulation of <italic>Ptger4</italic> inversely correlates with the expression of many genes that promote growth and survival of B cell lymphoma, such as <italic>MYC</italic>, members of the NF-kB pathway, and <italic>Cd74</italic>, but appears to be coordinated with several tumor suppressors. Varying the <italic>Ptger4</italic> expression level significantly affects B cell lymphoma spread in mice and we find it down-regulated in human B cell malignancy, indicating that <italic>Ptger4</italic> is a tumor suppressor in B cells. Finally, because EP4 is expressed as an easily accessible membrane receptor, interfering with the PGE2&#x02013;EP4 signaling pathway may present a clinically useful alternative or supplement to chemotherapy in the treatment of B cell lymphoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice and reagents.</title><p>We obtained female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice from The Jackson Laboratory.
