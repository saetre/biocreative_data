Recently, it was shown that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is expressed in the kidney and activated by endogenous danger signals. The expression and function of TLR2 during renal fibrosis and chronic inflammation has however not yet been elucidated. Therefore, we studied TLR2 expression in human and murine progressive renal diseases and explored its role by inducing obstructive nephropathy in TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or TLR2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice. We found that TLR2 is markedly upregulated on tubular and tubulointerstitial cells in patients with chronic renal injury. In mice with obstructive nephropathy, renal injury was associated with a marked upregulation and change in distribution of TLR2 and upregulation of murine TLR2 danger ligands Gp96, biglycan, and HMGB1. Notably, TLR2 enhanced inflammation as reflected by a significantly reduced influx of neutrophils and production of chemokines and TGF-&#x003b2; in kidneys of TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with TLR2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> animals. Although, the obstructed kidneys of TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had less interstitial myofibroblasts in the later phase of obstructive nephropathy, tubular injury and renal matrix accumulation was similar in both mouse strains. Together, these data demonstrate that TLR2 can initiate renal inflammation during progressive renal injury and that the absence of TLR2 does not affect the development of chronic renal injury and fibrosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue fibrosis is a hallmark of a variety of chronically failing organs, including progressive renal disease, and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Wynn1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Renal fibrosis is defined by the accumulation of interstitial leukocytes and myofibroblasts that contribute to abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and eventual tubular atrophy and loss of renal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Klahr1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Iwano1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Irrespective of the nature of the primary disease and the originating renal compartment, renal fibrosis is considered to be the common final pathway by which kidney diseases with variable etiology progresses to end-stage renal failure. It is therefore important to identify factors that participate in the initiation of tubulointerstitial inflammation and subsequent interstitial fibrosis during progressive renal injury. From our own and other data, it has become clear that Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and 4 plays a crucial role in the induction of acute inflammation and early tubular injury in the kidney in a reversible model of acute renal injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Leemans1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Pulskens1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>TLR2 belongs to the TLR family of conserved pattern recognition receptors that are expressed on leukocytes, (myo)fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Otte1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Seibl1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and renal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Tsuboi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Wolfs1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and can detect motifs of pathogens and subsequently induce innate and adaptive immunity. Most interestingly, TLRs, including TLR2, also recognize endogenous danger molecules that have been altered from their native state or accumulate in non-physiologic sites or amounts during cellular injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Johnson1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Miyake1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

The expression and localization of TLRs has however not been analyzed previously during fibrinogenesis, and nothing is known about their role in renal progressive disease and fibrosis. A potential role for TLRs in the physiopathological pathway of fibrosis is suggested by a recent observation showing that TLR4 enhances myofibroblast activation and fibrinogenesis in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Seki1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, these data led to the hypothesis that TLR2 plays a key role in monitoring renal injury and in mediating inflammation and fibrosis in progressive renal disease. To test this hypothesis we studied the expression of TLR2 in human and murine chronic renal diseases and explored its role by inducing renal fibrosis in TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or TLR2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice using the murine model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), a well accepted experimental model for the study of the mechanisms of progressive renal fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>TLR2 is upregulated in kidneys from patients with tubulo-interstitial damage</title><p>Fibrosis and renal atrophy are common outcomes of hydronephrosis due to obstruction.

Extensive renal atrophy in end-stage hydronephrotic kidneys made it however impossible to phenotype TLR2-positive cells on histologic sections. Therefore, we analyzed TLR2 expression during chronic IgA nephropathy which is also associated with interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial inflammation.

Therefore, knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms involved in monitoring a primary renal insult, and in mediating renal fibrosis and infammation is essential for the development of therapeutic strategies for the prevention or treatment of progressive kidney diseases. Although we have previously shown that TLR2 plays a critical role in the initiation of acute renal inflammation and early tubular injury in a reversible model of acute renal ischemic injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Leemans1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, nothing was known about its role in chronic inflammation and fibrosis during progressive renal injury. Our results demonstrate that TLR2 and its main stress ligands are markedly upregulated in the kidney after UUO-injury, obstructive hydronephrosis (TLR2) and IgA nephropathy (TLR2) and identify TLR2 as an initiator of renal inflammation (neutrophil influx, cytokine induction) during progressive renal injury. TLR2 does not play an essential role in the development of renal fibrosis or the progression of renal disease after UUO-injury.</p><p>In this study we characterized the expression pattern of TLR2 in kidneys from patients with obstructive hydronephrosis, severe IgA nephropathy as well as from mice subjected to obstructive nephropathy. We found a clear increase in TLR2 protein expression in patients with progressive renal injury as well as an increase in TLR2 mRNA and protein through a time course of UUO with a prominent change in the distribution pattern. During early phases of UUO TLR2 was mainly located at the apical site of tubules while it was lost and in stead extended throughout the tubular cytoplasm and the interstitium at later time points when fibrosis was more severe. In agreement, we found that patients with severe IgA nephropathy had a predominant interstitial TLR2 expression with occasionally apical staining of tubuli. The apical expression of TLR2 on tubular cells could be optimal for interaction with filtered or leaked stress ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Kuroda1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Mueller1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> or with ligands that are expressed apically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Valles1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, we found a profound upregulation of tubular biglycan with expression at the apical side and in the cytoplasm during UUO injury. Moreover, there are data demonstrating that HMGB1 can be secreted from cells and can leak into the urine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-See1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> making it possible to interact with apical TLR2. Although cytoplasmic HMGB1 was only faintly found, it could as well interact with cytoplasmic TLR2. Finally, tubulointerstitial cell-associated Gp96 might interact with TLR2-positive tubulointerstitial cells at the later phases of UUO. One has to keep in mind that these ligands could potentially activate TLR4 as well. The intracellular localization of TLR2 is consistent with data demonstrating that upon stimulation by specific ligands, TLR2 receptor clusters are targeted to the Golgi apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Triantafilou1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Loss of apical TLR2 staining in tubuli in later phases of UUO or during severe forms of IgA nephropathy could reflect loss of apical brush border due to tubular damage. Of particular interest was the observation that several renal myofibroblasts coexpressed TLR2. In line, others have found that intestinal myofibroblasts and synovial fibroblasts of patients with rheumatoid arthritis express TLR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Otte1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Seibl1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. TLR2 positive interstitial cells in IgA nephropathy patients and mice subjected to UUO therefore most likely reflect the influx of leukocytes known to express TLRs and the accumulation of myofibroblasts. Indeed, we found numerous TLR2-positive macrophages in patients with IgA nephropathy. Although Wolfs <italic>et al.</italic> found constitutive TLR2 mRNA expression in murine tubular epithelial cells of normal kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Wolfs1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, we could only detect TLR2 protein in tubular cells when the kidney was damaged. This might indicate that the antibody we used is not sensitive enough to detect very low levels of protein or that some sort of regulation of the TLR2 expression is being applied at the post-transcriptional, translational or proteosomal level.</p><p>With the use of TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we additionally demonstrated that TLR2 did not play an essential role in the development of progressive renal injury and fibrosis during obstructive nephropathy. It is generally believed that fibrosis of several organs, including the kidney, is a consequence of the disturbance of the balance between ECM synthesis by myofibroblasts and ECM degradation by matrix metalloproteinases as well as by excessive and persistent inflammation. Although we found significantly less myofibroblasts in TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to Wt animals 14 days post-UUO, the accumulation of ECM components was not different between both mouse strains. The latter is in agreement with findings of Seki <italic>et al.</italic> which show that TLR2 is not required for hepatic fibrogenesis after bile duct ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Seki1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The decrease in myofibroblasts can be explained by the reduction in fibroblasts activation. Fibroblasts become activated into myofibroblasts by stimuli such as the infiltration of inflammatory cells and TGF-&#x003b2;1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Strutz2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, we found that both the amount of granulocytes as well as the amount of TGF-&#x003b2;1 was significantly decreased in mice deficient for TLR2 compared to Wt animals. In line with the similar degree of fibrosis and injury, no differences were found in the amount of infiltrated macrophages in TLR2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>Next, we investigated analyzed the MMP degrading pathway. Surprisingly, MMP2/TIMP2 and MMP9/TIMP1 mRNA expression and MMP9 activity was considerably reduced in TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to Wt animals. This is in line with findings demonstrating that MMP9 is selectively induced through TLR2 in human and murine monocytic cells stimulated with bacterial TLR ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Gebbia1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Elass1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. The diminished MMP activity in TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice would explain why there is no difference in ECM accumulation in these animals despite the reduction of matrix-producing myofibroblasts and TGF-&#x003b2;. Indeed, it is generally assumed that diminished MMP activity is responsible for ECM deposition.</p><p>In addition, we investigated the role of TLR2 in inflammation during obstructive nephropathy. The observations that renal TECs, macrophages and myofibroblasts express TLR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Otte1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Wolfs1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-McCoy1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>(this study) and that the main TLR2 danger ligands are upregulated during progressive renal injury (this study) suggest that these cells are capable of monitoring cellular damage and inducing an inflammatory response. Indeed, we found that TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had reduced chemokine levels and neutrophil influx in their kidneys compared to Wt animals during obstructive nephropathy. Although the presence and kinetics of neutrophils are not well documented during UUO and neutrophils are not a major player in this model, Duymelinck <italic>et al.</italic> as well demonstrate the presence of PMNs in UUO-kidneys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Duymelinck1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The significance of this finding is however not clear and further studies will be necessary to elucidate the exact role of neutrophils in this model. We and others have shown that TLR2 and TLR4 is needed for chemokine production of murine TECs that are exposed to simulated ischemia in vitro and that renal-associated TLR is an important initiator of inflammatory responses in ischemic acute renal failure in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Leemans1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Pulskens1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, others have shown that murine TECs, macrophages and human (myo)fibroblasts produce chemokines via TLRs when exposed to bacterial components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Otte1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Tsuboi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Pierer1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> or endogenous danger ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Zhang1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. A further explanation for the decrease in cytokines and TGF-&#x003b2; in mice lacking TLR2 could be that there is a reduction in TLR2-dependent macrophage and (myo)fibroblast activation. This would agree with our observations that various renal myofibroblasts and in particular macrophages express TLR2. Indeed, TLR ligands provide a major activating signal to macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Zhang1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> and (myo)fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Otte1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Pierer1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Hasan1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> via TLRs which on their turn can produce cytokines among which TGF-&#x003b2;. In line with this thought is a recent paper demonstrating that TLR4 induce myofibroblast activation, TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, chemokine production and fibrinogenesis in the liver after bile duct ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Seki1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Obviously, further experimental work is necessary to determine whether these TLR-dependent processes also apply to primary macrophages and (myo)fibroblasts in the kidney during renal progressive injury. Together, these data suggests that the activation of TLR2 on tubular epithelial and interstitial cells by endogenous stress ligands may play a role in renal inflammation, and apoptosis during progressive renal injury. Indeed, mice deficient for TLR2 had less tubular apoptosis as well as an impaired inflammatory response compared to wild type mice. These data underline the current concept proposing that TLRs play a central role in the pathogenesis of a number of kidney disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-ElAchkar1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Anders1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Of particular interest is the finding that TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had less TEC apoptosis 7 days after UUO-injury while the amount of proliferation was equal as compared to TLR2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice. This could be explained by the reduction in TGF-&#x003b2; and the decrease in the amount of neutrophils we found in these animals. Indeed, both neutrophils and TGF-&#x003b2; are involved in the induction of tubular cell apoptosis in UUO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Docherty1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The lower amount of TGF-&#x003b2; in TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could reflect the reduced TLR2-dependent synthesis of this factor by TECs, macrophages, and interstitial fibroblasts. The reduction in tubular apoptosis in TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice can also be explained by studies demonstrating a proapoptotic function of TLR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Aliprantis1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005704-Aliprantis2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.
