In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> heterochromatic loci, including telomeres and silent mating type loci, form clusters at the nuclear periphery. We have employed live cell 3-D imaging and chromosome conformation capture (3C) to determine the contribution of nuclear positioning and heterochromatic factors in mediating associations of the silent mating type loci. We identify specific long-range interactions between <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> that are dependent upon silencing proteins Sir2p, Sir3p, and Sir4p as well as Sir1p and Esc2p, two proteins involved in establishment of silencing. Although clustering of these loci frequently occurs near the nuclear periphery, colocalization can occur equally at more internal positions and is not affected in strains deleted for membrane anchoring proteins yKu70p and Esc1p. In addition, appropriate nucleosome assembly plays a role, as deletion of <italic>ASF1</italic> or combined disruption of the CAF-1 and HIR complexes abolishes the <italic>HML</italic>-<italic>HMR</italic> interaction. Further, silencer proteins are required for clustering, but complete loss of clustering in <italic>asf1</italic> and <italic>esc2</italic> mutants had only minor effects on silencing. Our results indicate that formation of heterochromatic clusters depends on correctly assembled heterochromatin at the silent loci and, in addition, identify an Asf1p-, Esc2p-, and Sir1p-dependent step in heterochromatin formation that is not essential for gene silencing but is required for long-range interactions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Chromosomes are non-randomly positioned inside cells, and this organization is relevant for genome regulation. Spatial clustering of heterochromatic loci provides a striking example of nuclear compartmentalization. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the presence of heterochromatic sub-nuclear domains has been well established, but their mechanisms of formation are not fully understood. Here, we analyzed the DNA elements and protein complexes that are critical for formation of heterochromatic clusters. We focused on heterochromatic regions on chromosome III&#x02014;the two telomeres, as well as the silent mating type loci <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>, located on the left and right end of the chromosome, respectively. We employed live cell 3-D imaging and chromosome conformation capture (3C) and found that these loci specifically interact most prominently near silencer elements that flank the loci. Analysis of a panel of mutants showed that complexes involved in silencing are also involved in long-range interactions. Interestingly, we find that heterochromatic interactions are mechanistically distinct from silencing and independent of tethering to the nuclear periphery. Our results indicate that formation of heterochromatic clusters depends on correctly assembled heterochromatin, and point to a step in heterochromatin formation that is not essential for gene silencing but is required for long-range interactions between heterochromatic loci.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The eukaryotic nucleus tends to be organized so that active and inactive sub-nuclear domains are spatially separated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Cremer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Miele1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, heterochromatin is found at and near the 32 telomeres, and at the two silent mating type loci, <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>, located near the left and right telomere of chromosome III, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Loo1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Rusche1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

A similar phenomenon is observed in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> in which the heterochromatic centromeres, telomeres, and mating type loci cluster in silent foci at the nuclear periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Funabiki1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Heterochromatic clusters are thought to represent nuclear sub-compartments that are enriched in silencing proteins, while the rest of the nucleus is depleted in such factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Maillet1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Thompson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Andrulis1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the importance of association of genes with silent compartments in the process of silencing is well established, the mechanisms that drive these interactions are poorly understood.</p><p>Formation of heterochromatin at <italic>HM</italic> loci has been characterized in detail (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Rusche1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Haber1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Fox1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>). Silencing at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> requires cis-acting silencer elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Rusche1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Protein complexes, such as Rap1p and the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), bind to these silencer elements and help recruit Silent Information Regulator (Sir) proteins. Sir1p associates with Orc1p. Subsequently, Sir4p is recruited to the silencers via its interaction with Rap1p and Sir1p. Sir4p likely recruits Sir2p and is also required to recruit Sir3p to the silencer. Sir2p is a NAD-dependent histone deacetylase that deacetylates H4 K16 at nearby nucleosomes, which provides a binding site for additional SIR2-4 complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Tanny1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Imai1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This positive feedback loop allows spreading of the SIR2-4 complex throughout the mating type loci, resulting in positioned nucleosomes and gene silencing throughout the region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Weiss1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Ravindra1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, histones and appropriate nucleosome assembly contribute to formation of heterochromatin, perhaps due to the fact that binding and spreading of the Sir complex occurs through direct interactions with histones. In addition, genetic evidence indicates that the histone chaperone Asf1p and the CAF-1 and HIR nucleosome assembly complexes have partially overlapping functions in heterochromatin formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Enomoto1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Sharp1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, previous work has indicated that silencer elements can cooperatively silence <italic>HMR</italic> in a manner that may involve direct interactions between <italic>HMR-E</italic> and <italic>HMR-I</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Valenzuela1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The clustering of Sir-bound loci in a limited number of sub-nuclear domains has been used as a model to study the processes that drive nuclear compartmentalization. Formation of silent nuclear compartments results in limiting Sir proteins to only a small number of locations in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Maillet1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In that situation, only loci located in these compartments will have access to silencer proteins and become heterochromatic, thereby preventing SIR complex-mediated silencing at inappropriate locations.</p><p>A major unanswered question is how compartmentalization is established and maintained. Is clustering of loci driven by association of individual loci to a common sub-nuclear structure, e.g. sites on the nuclear envelope, or is clustering an intrinsic property of heterochromatin that depends on local assembly of silencing complexes at these loci? Answers to this question can have important implications for our understanding of causal relationships between nuclear organization and gene regulation. To address this issue we have used chromosome III as a model for clustering of silent loci. This chromosome contains 4 heterochromatic loci: two telomeres and the nearby silent mating type loci, <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>. We employ live cell 3D imaging to show that <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> frequently co-localize both at the nuclear periphery as well as at more internal locations of the nucleus, indicating that anchoring to the nuclear envelope (NE) is not required for <italic>HML</italic>-<italic>HMR</italic> interactions. Using chromosome conformation capture (3C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Dekker1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> we find that <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> frequently and specifically interact with each other. Interactions are most frequent around the <italic>HML-E</italic> and <italic>HMR-I</italic> silencers. Analysis of a series of mutants reveals that clustering of these loci critically depends on silencer proteins, but that it is independent of proteins that contribute to anchoring silent loci at the nuclear periphery. Furthermore, silencing is not sufficient for the <italic>HM</italic> loci interaction to occur. Based on these observations we propose that silent compartments are not pre-assembled to facilitate subsequent recruitment of heterochromatic proteins. Instead we propose that long-range interactions between <italic>HM</italic> loci depend on a particular step in local heterochromatin assembly, which requires at least Asf1p, Esc2p and Sir1p.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the ends of chromosome III are relatively close in three-dimensional space in the yeast nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Dekker1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Bystricky1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

In an additional 38&#x00025; of nuclei, the ends of chromosome III are juxtaposed with less than 500 nm separating the fluorescent spots. The mean distance scored was 531 nm.

In this method, the cell wall is removed by zymolyase treatment and intact spheroplasts are treated with formaldehyde to induce cross-links between proteins and DNA and proteins and other proteins thereby trapping interacting chromatin fragments throughout the yeast genome. Cross-linked spheroplasts are then solubilized by SDS and Triton X-100. From here the conventional 3C protocol is followed including restriction digestion, DNA ligation, and reversal of cross-links. The identities of interacting fragments are determined through detection of 3C ligation products by semi-quantitative PCR using locus specific primers. In addition, a randomized ligation control is generated which serves as a control for primer efficiency. This template is generated by digesting purified yeast genomic DNA followed by random intermolecular ligation which results in a DNA sample in which every possible ligation product is present in equal molar amounts.</p><p>The cross-linking frequency of two loci is determined by PCR using the 3C and the control libraries as templates.

Interestingly, we observed a clear peak of crosslinking frequency corresponding to the <italic>Eco</italic>RI fragment containing <italic>HMR</italic>.

Further, 3D imaging in <italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic> cells did not reveal a difference in <italic>HML-HMR</italic> interactions, nor did 3C analysis of strains deleted for the Recombination Enhancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Haber2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000478.s002">Figure S2</xref> Panels C and D). Given the lack of any mating type specific differences in <italic>HML-HMR</italic> interactions we consider it not likely that any mating type specific proteins or the <italic>MAT</italic> locus itself plays a role in the interaction between silent mating type loci. Interestingly, we do note that there appears to be a loss of frequent interactions between <italic>HML</italic> and sites close to it specifically in <italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic> cells. Although the reason for this is unclear, future comprehensive and chromosome-wide studies can be aimed at analyzing mating type specific differences in the conformation of chromosome III. Here we focused specifically on <italic>HML</italic>-<italic>HMR</italic> interactions, which are unaffected by mating type.</p><p>Next we tested whether the <italic>HM</italic> loci also interact with the telomeres of chromosome III. We performed 3C with primers annealing immediately adjacent to the left or to the right telomere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000478.s002">Figure S2E and F</xref>).

Interactions along the length of the chromosome between the left telomere and other <italic>Eco</italic>RI fragments were generally lower than observed for <italic>HML</italic> or <italic>HMR</italic>. Interestingly, the left telomere interacted also relatively frequently with <italic>HMR</italic>. The same is true for the right telomere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000478.s002">Figure S2F</xref>): this telomere interacted frequently with nearby fragments, including <italic>HMR</italic>, and with <italic>HML</italic>. Although the telomeres interacted preferentially with the <italic>HM</italic> locus located on the opposite side of the chromosome, these interactions are clearly less frequent than the <italic>HML</italic>-<italic>HMR</italic> interaction. Contacts between the two telomeres were also less frequent than the interaction between the <italic>HM</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000478.s002">Figure S2F</xref>).</p><p>3C is used to determine the relative crosslinking frequency in a population of cells, but 3C does not directly reveal the percentage of cells that are engaged in a certain configuration, just like chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments do not provide insight in absolute occupancy levels of proteins at specific loci. Our live cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000478-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) allows direct comparison of 3C crosslinking frequencies to the probability with which loci colocalize in living cells. We find that <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> are co-localized in 21&#x00025; of cells and closely juxtaposed in an additional 38&#x00025; of cells. In contrast <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>MAT</italic> are co-localized in only 12&#x00025; of cells and closely juxtaposed in another 17&#x00025;. These different levels of <italic>in vivo</italic> co-localization closely correspond to relative 3C crosslinking frequencies detected for <italic>HML</italic>-<italic>HMR</italic> and <italic>HML</italic>-<italic>MAT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000478-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, the quantitative agreement between fluorescence microscopy results and data obtained by 3C confirm that the <italic>HM</italic> loci are co-localized in a significant fraction of cells at any given moment. Combined, our results indicate that 3C data provide an accurate proxy for frequency with which loci are closely juxtaposed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Preferred Interaction between Regions Containing the <italic>E</italic>- and <italic>I</italic>-Silencers</title><p>We wished to firmly rule out the possibility that the observed interaction between the <italic>HM</italic> loci could be indirect and a consequence of contacts between other sub-telomeric elements. We used several approaches.

We observed the same in cells of the opposite mating type (<italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic>, not shown).</p><p>As a second approach we created a <italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic> strain in which the <italic>HMR</italic> locus was replaced with the <italic>KanMX</italic> cassette. We determined crosslinking frequencies between the fragment containing <italic>HML</italic> and fragments along the length of chromosome III including the <italic>Eco</italic>RI fragments containing and directly flanking the <italic>KanMX</italic> cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000478-g001">Figure 1D</xref> third panel). We find that the peak of interaction is no longer observed and that the crosslinking frequency of <italic>HML</italic> with the fragments containing the <italic>KanMX</italic> cassette is similar to that of its neighbors. Likewise, when we analyzed interactions between the fragments containing the <italic>KanMX</italic> cassette with fragments along chromosome III including the fragment containing <italic>HML</italic>, we no longer detected the peak of interaction at <italic>HML</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000478-g001">Figure 1D</xref> fourth panel). These results indicate that the frequent interaction at <italic>HML</italic> observed in wild type cells requires the presence of <italic>HMR</italic>. In addition, this experiment rules out that the interaction is due to the presence of another genomic element in the sub-telomeric region located outside <italic>HMR</italic> but within the interacting <italic>Eco</italic>RI fragment.</p><p>As a third approach, we determined the role of specific parts of <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> in mediating their interaction. We analyzed the interaction between the heterochromatic loci using a different restriction enzyme, <italic>Xba</italic>I, as this enzyme cuts inside of <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> to create fragments in which the left and right ends of <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> are contained on separate restriction fragments. 3C primer sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000478.s005">Table S1</xref>.

To test this we repeated the 3C analysis with a frequently cutting restriction enzyme <italic>Aci</italic>I that cuts at multiple locations within the <italic>HM</italic> loci. We find that the small 814 bp <italic>Aci</italic>I fragment containing the <italic>HMR-I</italic> element (genomic position 294510&#x02013;295324) most strongly interacts with the 821 bp fragment containing the <italic>HML-E</italic> silencer (genomic position 10815&#x02013;11636), and significantly less frequently with other parts of <italic>HML</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000478-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely the fragment containing the <italic>HML-E</italic> silencer interacts most prominently with the <italic>HMR-I</italic> fragment, as compared to other regions of <italic>HMR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000478-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). As a control we determined crosslinking frequencies between an <italic>Aci</italic>I fragment located in the middle of <italic>HML</italic>. This fragment (genomic position 11679&#x02013;11906) interacted most prominently with the <italic>HMR-I</italic> fragment and the neighboring <italic>Aci</italic>I fragment located within <italic>HMR</italic>, but the crosslinking frequencies were lower than that observed between <italic>HML-E</italic> and <italic>HMR-I</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000478-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), which is as expected for a fragment located just next to the site of interaction. These results strongly suggest that the <italic>HML-E</italic> and <italic>HMR-I</italic> silencers, or elements located very close to them, are the sites of interaction. Despite intense efforts, we have not been able to generate a mutant in which <italic>HMR-I</italic> was deleted without also creating unexplained rearrangements in the locus. Therefore we cannot unequivocally conclude that the interactions between <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> are directly mediated by the silencer elements.</p><p>Given the interaction observed between regions containing <italic>E</italic>- and <italic>I</italic>-silencers from opposite loci, we then asked whether <italic>E</italic>- and <italic>I</italic>-silencers from the same loci also interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000478-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>). 3C analysis using the <italic>Aci</italic>I enzyme indicates that the <italic>Aci</italic>I fragments containing <italic>HML-E</italic> and <italic>HMR-E</italic> elements interact frequently with nearby sites. Interestingly, <italic>HML-E</italic> and <italic>HMR-E</italic> interacted more strongly with sites within the silent loci than with sites located outside <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>, despite being separated by comparable genomic distances. One explanation could be that the silent loci are more compact than active chromatin, which can result in increased 3C crosslinking frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Gheldof1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Dekker2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000478-Dekker3">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our inability to genetically disrupt peripheral localization of the silent mating type loci prevented us from directly assessing the influence of membrane anchoring on facilitating <italic>HML</italic>-<italic>HMR</italic> interactions. Therefore, as an alternative approach, we set out to follow the positions of <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> in wild type living cells over several minutes in order to determine whether <italic>HML-HMR</italic> interactions can be observed in the interior of the nucleus or only at the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000478-g006">Figure 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000478-g006">Figure 6A</xref> shows a representative movie comprising a series of 50 2D images taken at 10 s intervals of interphase cells on a wide-field Olympus XI inverted microscope. <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> tags colocalized either near the NE as identified by the nuclear pore component Nup49p fused to CFP, or at the center of the nuclei imaged.

First, it is possible that the interaction between <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> is more intimate, and thus more effectively crosslinked, in these mutants, in a manner that is not microscopically distinguishable from wild type. A more intimate association may be the result of an increase in Sir protein occupancy at the <italic>HM</italic> loci in these mutants.

An alternative explanation is that 3C underestimates the <italic>HM</italic> crosslinking frequency in wild type cells, or overestimates their crosslinking frequency in these mutants. Given that the <italic>HM</italic> loci interact with each other as well as with telomeres, a loss of telomeric heterochromatin will reduce the number of interaction partners to which <italic>HM</italic> loci can be cross-linked and ligated during the 3C procedure, resulting in detection of relatively more frequent <italic>HML</italic>-<italic>HMR</italic> interactions in these mutants.

Once heterochromatic clusters are formed, the nuclear distribution of silencer proteins becomes highly non-homogeneous with high local concentrations in the silent compartments and depletion in the rest of the nucleus. Nuclear compartmentalization could be advantageous because only loci located within the silent compartments will have access to abundant silencer proteins while the rest of the genome is precluded from inadvertently gaining access to heterochromatin proteins.

Multiple primer combinations are used that detect highly abundant 3C ligation products as well as infrequently formed products to be sure that the amount of template used in each reaction is within the linear range. The subsequent PCR reactions are done in triplicate for both the control and 3C template. The crosslinking frequency is then determined by calculating the ratio between the amount of PCR product obtained with the 3C template and the control template. The three resulting crosslinking frequencies are then averaged together and one value is obtained. This is the value that is plotted in interaction graphs.
