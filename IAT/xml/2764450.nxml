These interactions are vital to suppress DNA damage responses and unfavorable changes in chromosome dynamics. The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is critical for this process. Cells deficient for functional DNA-PKcs show increased rates of telomere loss, accompanied by chromosomal fusions and translocations. Treatment of cells with specific DNA-PK kinase inhibitors leads to similar phenotypes. These observations indicate that the kinase activity of DNA-PK is required for its function at telomeres possibly through phosphorylation of essential proteins needed for telomere length maintenance. Here we show that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is a direct substrate for DNA-PK <italic>in vitro</italic>. Phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 is stimulated not only by the presence of DNA but also by the telomerase RNA component, hTR. Furthermore, we show that hnRNP A1 is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> in a DNA-PK-dependent manner and that this phosphorylation is greatly reduced in cell lines which lack hTR. These data are the first to report that hTR stimulates the kinase activity of DNA-PK toward a known telomere-associated protein, and may provide further insights into the function of DNA-PK at telomeres.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomeres are tandem repeats of short DNA sequences (TTAGGG in humans) at the ends of linear chromosomes. In humans, the telomerase holoenzyme, minimally composed of the reverse transcriptase, hTERT, and an RNA component, hTR, is responsible for synthesizing telomeric repeats during DNA replication. hTERT utilizes hTR as a template to add the repeats onto the 3&#x02032; ends of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). In addition to its role as a polymerase, telomerase cooperates with members of the Shelterin protein complex to establish a protective nucleoprotein &#x02018;cap&#x02019; for chromosome termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Maintenance of this cap is necessary to protect telomeres from cellular DNA damage responses that can disrupt chromosome dynamics; this in turn can result in aneuploidy and/or aberrant fusion events that may result in cellular transformation. Paradoxically, many of the proteins found at the telomere are also critical for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). One such protein is the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK).</p><p>DNA-PK is composed of a DNA-binding subunit, Ku70/80 and a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). This holoenzyme is required for the repair of DSBs via the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Current models for NHEJ propose that the Ku heterodimer binds to exposed ends of double stranded (ds)DNA and serves as the signal to recruit DNA-PKcs to establish the active DNA-bound DNA-PK complex. DNA-PK is a serine-threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates its substrates predominantly on serines or threonines that are followed by glutamine (SQ/TQ motifs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> DNA-PK substrates include p53, RPA, XRCC4, Ku and DNA-PKcs itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Cells deficient for functional DNA-PKcs show high levels of chromosome end-to-end fusions due to chromosome uncapping and telomere dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Moreover, mouse cells deficient for both DNA-PKcs and <italic>Terc</italic> (mouse TR) exhibit accelerated rates of telomere shortening compared to cells solely deficient for <italic>Terc</italic>, suggesting a functional interaction between DNA-PKcs and telomerase in sustaining telomere length and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Similarly, mouse cells lacking wild type Ku70 or Ku80 display a higher rate of chromosomal end-to-end fusions due to loss of telomere end-capping function, without any significant decrease in telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). However, in mouse cells that lack both DNA-PKcs and the telomerase RNA, both telomere shortening and telomere dysfunction are observed, in contrast to cells which lack only DNA-PKcs where telomere length is sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Additionally, in mouse cells, Ku70/80 associates with telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and interacts with the core proteins of the Shelterin complex, namely TRF1 and TRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Moreover, Ku has been reported to associate with hTERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Interestingly, treatment of mouse cells with specific DNA-PK inhibitors also leads to increased rates of end-to-end fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Together, these data support a role for DNA-PK in telomere function, both in end-capping and in maintenance of telomere length. However, the precise biochemical function and mechanism of action of DNA-PK at telomeres remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that human Ku70/80 interacts with the human telomerase RNA component, hTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Moreover, the interaction between Ku70/80 and telomerase RNA (<italic>TLC1</italic>) is also observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Specifically, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains harboring either <italic>TLC1</italic> that lacks the stem loop region for yKu binding (<italic>Tlc1&#x00394;48</italic>), or Ku alleles that do not interact with <italic>TLC1</italic> (<italic>yKu80-135i</italic>), show decreased rates of telomere synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The yKu70/80/<italic>TLC1</italic> interaction is required for proper recruitment of yeast telomerase to the chromosome end for telomere synthesis in late S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Yeast, however, do not contain DNA-PKcs, suggesting that the interaction and regulation of telomerase with DNA-PK in human cells is more complex.</p><p>It is becoming clear that phosphorylation regulates the function of many proteins that are involved in the regulation of telomere length. In yeast, phosphorylation of the single strand telomere binding protein Cdc13 by Tel1 and Mec1 (the yeast homologues of human ATM and ATR, respectively) modulates its interaction with Est1p and facilitates telomerase recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In human cells, TRF2 is phosphorylated by ATM in response to DNA damage and the phosphorylated form of the protein does not interact with telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Similarly, TRF1 is phosphorylated by ATM in an Nbs1-dependent manner, promoting its release from the telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). These data indicate that protein phosphorylation is a critical regulatory mechanism for proteins involved in telomere length maintenance. Since inhibition of the kinase activity of DNA-PK results in telomere dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), we speculate that DNA-PK phosphorylates specific telomere or telomerase-associated proteins, thereby regulating their function at the telomere.</p><p>One interesting protein that has been shown to function in telomere length maintenance is hnRNP A1. hnRNP A1 is a member of the hnRNP A/B family. Members of the hnRNP family (including hnRNP A1) are involved in a variety of RNA-related processes such as alternative splicing, mRNA maturation/turnover, mRNA transport and telomere and telomerase regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The hnRNP A/B family includes hnRNP A1, A2 and A3, each of which is alternatively spliced. These proteins contain two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a glycine rich domain at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). There is strong evidence that hnRNP A1 plays a critical role in telomere biogenesis. First, hnRNP A1 and its proteolytic fragment Unwinding Protein 1 (UP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), bind telomeric DNA in a sequence specific manner <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Second, a murine erythroleukemic cell line deficient for hnRNP A1 has shortened telomeres, and reintroduction of hnRNP A1 into these cells overcomes this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Third, a UP1 containing complex assembles on telomeric DNA oligonucleotides in nuclear extracts and recombinant UP1 interacts with telomerase in mammalian cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Fourth, the first RRM motif of hnRNP A1 interacts with telomeric DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), while simultaneously the second RRM motif interacts with the telomerase RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). And finally, it has been proposed that hnRNP A1 contributes to telomere elongation by unwinding G-quadruplexes that form during telomere elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This evidence suggests a critical function for hnRNP A1 in telomere length maintenance, possibly by facilitating recruitment of telomerase to chromosome ends or modulating higher order telomere structures.</p><p>hnRNP A1 is known to undergo a number of post-translational modifications, including sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32 B33">30&#x02013;33</xref>) and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36 B37">34&#x02013;37</xref>), and each modification is reported to affect its nucleic acid binding properties. Although phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 has been shown to affect the splicing activities of hnRNP A1, little is known about whether post-translational modifications are required for its role in telomere maintenance.</p><p>To further elucidate the biological significance of our previous observation that Ku interacts with hTR in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), we asked whether the interaction of Ku with hTR can establish an active DNA-PK holoenzyme. Here, we show that like DNA, hTR promotes phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 by DNA-PK <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, hnRNP A1 interacts with Ku in a cellular context, and we have identified a novel phosphorylation site on hnRNP A1 that is targeted by DNA-PK <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, inhibition of DNA-PK reduced phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 <italic>in vivo</italic> and the phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 was greatly decreased in cells lacking hTR. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that hnRNP A1 is a direct DNA-PK substrate, and that the telomerase RNA, a specific structured and biologically active RNA molecule, can stimulate the protein kinase activity of DNA-PK.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Kinase assays</title><p>DNA-PKcs and Ku70/80 were purified from HeLa cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).

Incubation of purified DNA-PKcs and Ku70/80 with hTR did not support autophosphorylation of the complex, whereas, as expected, the addition of CT DNA did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Similarly, hTR did not support phosphorylation of the SQE peptide (data not shown).</p><p>Since both hnRNP A1 and DNA-PK are involved in telomere function, and members of the hnRNP family are DNA-PK substrates, we sought to determine whether hnRNP A1 was a direct substrate for DNA-PK. hnRNP A1 contains two potential DNA-PK phosphorylation sites at Serine 95 and Serine 192 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We also tested, whether or not the closely related protein hnRNP A2 was a DNA-PK substrate. hnRNP A2 is redundant with hnRNP A1 with respect to its splicing function, however, unlike hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2 does not function in telomere length maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

To determine whether Ku and hnRNP A1 both interact with FL-hTR, we performed EMSAs with radiolabeled FL-hTR and purified Ku and/or GST-hnRNP A1. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, upper panel, hnRNP A1 or Ku alone formed nucleoprotein complexes with FL-hTR that migrate at a different position on the non-denaturing gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, top panel, compare complex &#x02018;a&#x02019; to &#x02018;b&#x02019; in lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 4 and 5). In the presence of both Ku and hnRNP A1, a new slower ribonucleoprotein complex was formed (indicated by complex &#x02018;c&#x02019;), suggesting that Ku and hnRNP A1 may bind to the same FL-hTR molecule. Previous studies have shown that hnRNP A1 interacts with the first 208 nucleotides of hTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and Ku preferentially associates with the 3&#x02032; end of hTR constituting nucleotides 404&#x02013;451 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Consistently, in EMSA studies with the 3&#x02032; end of hTR, spanning nucleotides 404&#x02013;451, only a Ku&#x02013;hTR complex was observed, but no hnRNP A1&#x02013;hTR complex was formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lower panel). Moreover, the ribonucleoprotein complex &#x02018;c&#x02019; that formed in the presence of Ku, hnRNP A1 and hTR was not seen with the hTR (404&#x02013;451) probe.</p><p>To confirm the presence of Ku and hnRNP A1 in complex &#x02018;c&#x02019; with FL-hTR, the EMSA gel was transferred onto PVDF membrane, and analyzed by western blotting.

Collectively, these data suggest that hnRNP A1 and Ku bind the same hTR molecule, possibly at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends, respectively.</p><p>To extend these studies to a cellular context, we performed immunoprecipitation studies with extracts prepared from either HeLa cells, which are telomerase positive and express hTR, or VA-13 cells which are SV40 transformed human lung fibroblasts that lack detectable hTR and hTERT and maintain their telomeres by the ALT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Western blots of complexes from immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody to Ku indicated the presence of both Ku and hnRNP A1 in both cell lines. Immunoprecipitates from reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays using a monoclonal antibody to hnRNP A1 also contained Ku and hnRNP A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, these data suggest that Ku interacts with hnRNP A1 in cells independent of hTR. This interaction may be direct or mediated by addition factors in cells. It appears however, that the interaction between Ku and hnRNP A1 is not sufficient to support efficient phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 in the absence of hTR. Moreover, although Ku70/80 and hnRNP A1 can interact in the absence of hTR, we speculate that the binding of each protein with the telomerase RNA is necessary to activate DNA-PKcs for the phosphorylation hnRNP A1 (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA-PK phosphorylation sites on hnRNP A1</title><p>DNA-PK preferentially targets Ser/Thr followed by a Gln residue (S/T-Q motifs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). To date, hnRNP A1 has been shown to be phosphorylated on Ser 192 and Ser 310&#x02013;312 by Map Kinase interacting kinases (MNKs) during the activation of T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). As an initial step toward elucidating the importance of hnRNP A1 phosphorylation, we wanted to identify which amino acid residues are targeted by DNA-PK. Examination of the amino acid sequence of hnRNP A1 revealed two DNA-PK consensus phosphorylation sites at Ser 95 and Ser 192 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These residues are highly conserved between mouse and human. Moreover, in the closely related protein hnRNP A2, which is not a substrate for DNA-PK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), these Ser residues are not followed by Gln. We therefore reasoned that these two sites were excellent candidates for DNA-PK phosphorylation. Based on these observations, we generated GST hnRNP A1 proteins harboring either a single Ser to Ala mutation at Ser 95 (S95A) and Ser 192 (S192A) or the double mutation at both Ser 95 and Ser 192 (S95/192A). These mutant proteins were expressed as GST-recombinant proteins, purified and tested in DNA-PK assays <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of CT DNA or hTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). In the presence of either CT DNA or hTR, when compared to the WT, phosphorylation was reduced by 39% in the single S95A mutant (compare lanes 5 and 6 to lanes 2 and 3); however, phosphorylation was not significantly reduced the S192A mutant (data not shown). In contrast, DNA-PK phosphorylation was reduced by 69% in the double S95/192A mutant hnRNP A1 (compare lanes 8 and 9 to lanes 2 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). We speculate that phosphorylation of Ser-95 and Ser-192 by DNA-PK might be coordinately regulated, such that elimination of Ser-192 might enhance phosphorylation at Ser-95. Alternatively, mutation of both Ser-95 and Ser-192 might induce a conformational change that reduces the ability of DNA-PK to target hnRNP A1. Regardless, these data are the first to report the phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 at Ser 95, and also suggests that DNA-PK may target Ser-192.</p></sec><sec><title>hnRNP A1 is phosphorylated in a DNA-PK-dependent manner <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>In order to determine if hnRNP A1 is an <italic>in vivo</italic> substrate for DNA-PK, we cultured HeLa cells with <sup>32</sup>P-inorganic phosphate in the presence or absence of DNA-PK inhibitors (wortmannin or NU4771) for 4 h and prepared cell extracts for immunoprecipitation with anti-hnRNP A1 antibodies.

To elucidate the functional significance of this interaction, we examined whether or not this interaction could activate DNA-PK activity. In this study, we show that both hTR and DNA stimulate DNA-PK kinase activity towards the novel substrate, hnRNP A1. Our EMSA results suggest that hnRNP A1 and Ku70/80 can interact on the same full length, intact hTR molecule. Furthermore, we observed that Ku and hnRNP A1 were found in the same complex in immunoprecipitates from cellular extracts. Treatment of cells with the highly specific DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 resulted in reduced hnRNP A1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, in VA13 cells that lack hTR, phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 was greatly reduced and was restored by exogenous expression of the telomerase RNA. Together, these data strongly suggest that hnRNP A1 is a physiological substrate for DNA-PK. As an initial step towards understanding the functional significance of this phosphorylation event, we identified Ser 95 and Ser 192 on hnRNP A1 as potential phosphorylation sites for DNA-PK <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 has been reported to influence many of its cellular functions. In response to an inflammatory signal, hnRNP A1 is phosphorylated by MNK1 at Ser 192 and Ser cluster at Ser 310&#x02013;312 in Jurkat T cells; this phosphorylation event negatively regulates binding of hnRNP A1 to the AU rich element (ARE) in the 3&#x02032;UTR of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) mRNA, reducing expression of TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Similarly, cells stressed by osmotic shock, show accumulation of hnRNP A1 to cytoplasmic granules that is dependent on hnRNP A1 phosphorylation on Ser 192 by the MAP p38 kinase cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). It is currently unknown whether phosphorylation or other types of post-translational modifications of hnRNP A1 contribute to its function in telomere length maintenance. To our knowledge, this is the first report of direct hnRNP A1 phosphorylation by DNA-PK at a novel <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> site, Ser 95. We have also identified Ser 192 as a potential <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA-PK phosphorylation site.

Specifically, we show that, in the presence of hTR, DNA-PK is able to phosphorylate hnRNP A1, a protein known to be involved in telomere length maintenance. Furthermore, we show that this hTR stimulation is specific for hnRNP A1, in that other DNA-PK substrates, namely XRCC4 and Artemis, are only weakly phosphorylated in the presence of hTR. It is also interesting to note that hnRNP A2, a protein very closely related to hnRNP A1, is not phosphorylated by DNA-PK. With respect to its function in splicing, hnRNP A2 is thought to be redundant with hnRNP A1, however, hnRNP A2 cannot overcome the hnRNP A1 deficiency and telomere length defects in erythroleukemic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). One possible explanation for the inability of hnRNP A2 to function at telomeres might be that phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 at specific sites by DNA-PK is required for its role in telomere length maintenance. In addition, although Ku and hnRNP A1 can interact in cells lacking hTR, this interaction is not sufficient to stimulate phosphorylation of hnRNPA1 by DNA-PK since VA13, cells which lack hTR, have significantly reduced levels of hnRNP A1 phosphorylation and this phosphorylation is significantly increase upon the exogenous expression of hTR. Together, these data suggest that <italic>in vivo</italic>, hTR is required for the phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 by DNA-PK.</p><p>It is interesting to note that <italic>in vitro</italic>, DNA-mediated autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is associated with loss of protein kinase activity and dissociation of the DNA-PK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Moreover, cells expressing DNA-PKcs that lack multiple <italic>in vitro</italic> autophosphorylation sites are radiosensitive and defective in DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that upon interaction with DSBs, DNA-PK becomes activated and subsequently undergoes autophosphorylation induced inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> results showing that DNA-PK can be activated by hTR without undergoing autophosphorylation suggests the possibility that DNA-PK may be regulated differently at telomeres than at DSBs. These data suggest that hTR might stimulate DNA-PK phosphorylation of telomere associated proteins in the absence of a DSB without inactivating its kinase activity and/or releasing DNA-PKcs from the telomere.</p><p>In yeast, the association of <italic>TLC1</italic> with Ku70/80 is crucial to recruit the telomerase components, Est1p and Est2p to telomeres for telomerase synthesis during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, since yeast do not contain DNA-PKcs, the function of Ku at telomeres may be subtly different between humans and yeast. Whether or not the hTR/Ku interaction in human cells serves to recruit telomerase components to telomeres or serves another critical function in cells remains to be explored. Nevertheless, based on the data presented here we speculate that the interaction of Ku and hnRNP A1 with hTR during telomere synthesis could recruit DNA-PKcs to phosphorylate hnRNP A1 and regulate its function during telomere synthesis. We speculate that phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 could influence its ability to recruit telomerase to chromosome ends or modulate higher order telomere structures. Studies to address the function of hnRNP A1 phosphorylation mutants at telomeres are ongoing.</p><p>Unlike hTERT and telomerase activity, which are only present in germ cells, stem cells and cells with a high proliferative index, hTR is ubiquitously expressed in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). It is therefore very likely that hTR has other, yet to be discovered roles, in the cell. We suggest that in addition to its critical role in directing telomere addition by telomerase, hTR may act as a co-factor for DNA-PK to phosphorylate proteins that are involved in telomere length maintenance. Consistent with additional roles for hTR in cells, hTR levels increase irrespective of telomerase status in response to low levels of UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Consequently, the elevated levels of hTR attenuate the activity of ATR, a PIKK family member related to DNA-PKcs, and facilitate cellular recovery of cells from UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Interestingly DNA-PK interacts with, and is targeted by ATR in response to UV exposure, implicating DNA-PK in the same damage pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Together, these observations lead to the intriguing possibility that hTR may be used as a signaling molecule in response to UV-induced DNA damage to regulate the activities of DNA-PK and ATR, in a manner that is independent of its telomere templating function.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that DNA-PK phosphorylates hnRNP A1 in an hTR-dependent manner <italic>in vitro</italic> and that hTR is important for the phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 by DNA-PK in cells. These results reveal a novel property for DNA-PK, namely, the ability of a physiologically relevant RNA molecule, hTR, to activate its kinase activity. Moreover, since the kinase activity of DNA-PK is required for telomere function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) we speculate that the hTR-dependent-phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 might play a critical role in telomere function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>CIHR grants (no. 69022 to T.L.B.) and (no. 13639 to S.P.L.-M.).
