The other major group of <italic>trans</italic> acting, posttranscriptional regulatory factors are microRNAs (miRNAs), a collection of short (&#x0223c;21&#x02013;26-nt long), single-strand, noncoding RNAs that have been described in a wide variety of organisms. The molecular details of miRNA-mediated suppression of gene expression (<italic>silencing</italic>) are rapidly emerging. miRNAs are assembled into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC), which recruit a target mRNA to processing bodies (P-bodies) that function as cytoplasmic foci of mRNA degradation and translational repression (reviewed in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001864-ValenciaSanchez1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>). Depending upon the degree of complementarity of the mRNA-miRNA complex, miRNAs can promote the cleavage of the target mRNA, an occurrence that is favored by extensive complementarity with the mRNA, or they can suppress mRNA translation but not mRNA degradation in instances of less complete base-pairing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001864-Hutvagner1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001864-Pillai1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the precise mechanisms by which miRNAs inhibit translation remains controversial. Some studies indicate that miRNAs block the initiation of translation, in some instances triggering the formation of large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) &#x02018;pseudo-polysomes&#x02019;, yet others suggest that miRNAs suppress post-initiation steps by repressing translational elongation, by promoting ribosome drop-off or by inhibiting termination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001864-Humphreys1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001864-Filipowicz1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. It is likely that multiple mechanisms are operating that depend on the nature of the miRNA, the untranslated regions, and the cellular context. An integrated model of miRNA action was proposed whereby miRNA action involved both translational suppression and accelerated decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001864-ValenciaSanchez1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we have identified miR-24-2 (hereafter miR-24) as a microRNA that suppresses p16 translation in cultured human cells.

Our results are consistent with a role for miR-24 in repressing both the initiation and elongation stages of p16 translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Concomitantly Elevated p16 and Reduced miR-24 Levels in Senescent WI-38 HDFs</title><p>p16 protein and mRNA levels increased markedly as early-passage, proliferating (young, <italic>Y</italic>) WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) progressed towards senescence (<italic>S</italic>) by increasing population doublings (pdls) in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g001">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). Since senescent cells showed a lesser increase in p16 mRNA abundance (&#x0003e;7-fold) than in p16 protein levels (&#x0223c;40-fold), as previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001864-Alcorta1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, we hypothesized that p16 protein translation might be selectively favored with senescence. To test this possibility, cytoplasmic lysates prepared from Y or S WI-38 cells were centrifuged through sucrose density gradients in order to fractionate the translation machinery components according to their molecular weight. By this process, the lightest cytoplasmic components, which are not engaged in translation (mRNA not bound to ribosomes, and 40S and 60S ribosome subunits), appear at the top of the gradient (fractions 1&#x02013;4: <italic>NB/NT, not bound/not translated</italic>); heavier components, comprising mRNAs bound to one or several ribosomes, appear next, in the low molecular weight (<italic>LMW</italic>) polysome fractions (fractions 5&#x02013;7); and cosedimenting lower in the gradient (fractions 8&#x02013;10) are the mRNAs considered to be most actively translated since they form part of high molecular weight (<italic>HMW</italic>) polysomes. The distribution of p16 mRNA (and that of the housekeeping GAPDH mRNA) was compared between Y (pdl 20) and S (pdl 54) cells. Unexpectedly, despite the low p16 protein levels in Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), most of the p16 mRNA was present in the LMW and HMW polysome fractions, as was seen in S cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), although the absolute p16 mRNA levels on the gradient were significantly lower in Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, <italic>left</italic>, <italic>inset</italic>). This observation suggested that in Y cells, while p16 mRNA associated extensively with the translational machinery, it was not actively translated, possibly through an inhibition of translational <italic>elongation</italic>. In addition, we noted a small but consistent shift in the p16 mRNA of Y cells towards LMW polysomes, further indicating that translational <italic>initiation</italic> may also be diminished. Together, these observations suggest that p16 translation could be inhibited in Y WI-38 cells, likely through a combination of decreased translation initiation and elongation.</p><fig id="pone-0001864-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001864.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>p16 levels increase with replicative senescence.</title><p>(A) The levels of mRNAs encoding cyclin D1, p16, and control housekeeping GAPDH were measured by RT-qPCR, normalized to 18S rRNA levels and plotted as fold levels relative to the levels in pdl 20 HDFs.

However, the miR-24 that co-sedimented with polysomal fractions did appear to associate with actively translating mRNAs, since treatment with puromycin (Puro.) shifted the miR-24 distribution towards lower molecular weight fractions relative to untreated (Untr.) cells, particularly in Y populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). A direct comparison of miR-24 levels in each gradient fraction showed that in Y cells, miR-24 was relatively more abundant in the heavy fractions and less in the light fractions, while in S cells, miR-24 levels were relatively higher in the light fractions and lower in the heavy, polysome-associated fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). This differential distribution of miR-24 further supported the view that miR-24 might contribute to an inhibition of p16 translation in Y cells that was relieved in S cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>miR-24 Influences p16 Expression in Young and Senescent WI-38 HDFs</title><p>Next, we investigated if miR-24 directly regulated p16 protein abundance in WI-38 HDFs. The expression levels of miR-24 in WI-38 cells were modulated in both directions, elevated by using a pre-miR-24 RNA, reduced by using an antisense (AS)-miR-24 RNA. Pre-miR-24 was first introduced into late-passage cells (&#x0223c;pdl 51) in order to ectopically elevate the levels of miR-24, which are naturally low in cells of advanced pdls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Despite the pre-senescent phenotype of these cells and their high p16 levels, miR-24 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) markedly reduced p16 protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), but not p16 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). Conversely, Y HDFs were transfected with AS-miR-24 in order to reduce the function of miR-24 in these populations with high endogenous miR-24 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The intervention to reduce miR-24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) caused no significant changes in p16 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), but it strongly increased p16 protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Transfection of AS-miR-24 caused a small but consistent shift in the peak distribution of p16 mRNA on sucrose gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>).

These possibilities were tested in WI-38 cells following AS-miR-24 transfection. Forty-eight hr after transfection, we measured <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation; against our prediction, WI-38 cells in the AS-miR-24 transfection group showed <italic>elevated</italic> DNA synthesis (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001864.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>). Moreover, following an extended transfection protocol (cells were sequentially transfected with AS-miR-24 for two weeks), the number of cells staining positive for the senescence-associated (SA) &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (a marker of replicative senescence) did not increase but instead <italic>decreased</italic> in the AS-miR-24 treatment group (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001864.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of miR-24 (which reduced p16 levels, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), did not trigger the expected increase in proliferation, but instead reduced it (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001864.s004">Fig. S4A</xref>); similar findings were obtained using cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) and liver carcinoma cells (HepG2, not shown). Furthermore, extended overexpression of miR-24 after a two-week period of sequential transfections, increased SA-&#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001864.s004">Fig. S4B</xref>), instead of decreasing it, as anticipated. Delivery of Pre-miR-24 by using a lentiviral vector also failed to reduce the senescence phenotype (not shown).</p><p>The absence of a senescent phenotype was disappointing, but it illustrated critical aspects of the analysis and interpretation of microRNA data. A single miRNA can regulate many transcripts, possibly hundreds or thousands of transcripts. Thus, to expect a strictly linear sequence of events &#x0005b;single microRNA change &#x02192; single altered protein &#x02192; single phenotypic alteration&#x0005d; would be to disregard the exquisite complexity of miRNA regulatory networks. In the case of miRNA networks influencing cellular senescence, three observations can be made. First, miR-24 is predicted to bind to transcripts encoding proliferative proteins such as H-Ras (not shown), proteins acting downstream of p16, like CDK6 (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001864.s005">Fig. S5</xref>) and E2F2 (not shown), and also p14ARF, which shares much of the p16 mRNA sequence and is thus similarly inhibited by miR-24 (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001864.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). A list of additional targets of miR-24 is available from the authors. Second, p16 protein levels increase dramatically in S cells (by &#x0003e;40 fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), but much of this elevation is elicited by heightened p16 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The translational influence of modulating miR-24 levels only achieves &#x0223c;3- to 5-fold differences in p16 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), far from the magnitude of change observed with replicative senescence. Thus, the relatively modest changes in p16 mediated by altering miR-24 levels are likely insufficient to recapitulate the influence of p16 changes occurring during senescence. Third, the process of replicative senescence is accompanied by many senescence-associated changes in the levels of numerous other miRNA, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001864-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>. The influence of these miRNAs upon replicative senescence, as well as the influence of miR-24 upon additional targets which might impact on the senescence/proliferative phenotype of WI-38, both await further analysis. Instead, we set out to gain molecular insight into the regulation of p16 expression levels by miR-24. To this end, we employed another cell system that was amenable to interventions requiring large amounts of cells, as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Reduced p16 Expression by Ectopic Overexpression of miR-24</title><p>We used HeLa cells to investigate how miR-24 regulated p16 expression.
