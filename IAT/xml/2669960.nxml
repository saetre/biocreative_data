Here, we use mass spectrometry to search for additional components of the Ska complex. We identify C13Orf3 (now termed Ska3) as a novel member of this complex and map the interaction domains among the three known components. Ska3 displays similar characteristics as Ska1 and Ska2: it localizes to the spindle and KT throughout mitosis and its depletion markedly delays anaphase transition. Interestingly, a more complete removal of the Ska complex by concomitant depletion of Ska1 and Ska3 results in a chromosome congression failure followed by cell death. This severe phenotype reflects a destabilization of KT&#x02013;MT interactions, as demonstrated by reduced cold stability of KT fibres. Yet, the depletion of the Ska complex only marginally impairs KT localization of the KMN network responsible for MT attachment. We propose that the Ska complex functionally complements the KMN, providing an additional layer of stability to KT&#x02013;MT attachment and possibly signalling completion of attachment to the spindle checkpoint.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chromosome congression</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>microtubule-attachment</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitotic spindle, formed at prophase by microtubules (MTs) originating from two spindle poles, generates the forces required for both chromosome congression to a metaphase plate, and the subsequent sister chromatid separation during anaphase. Essential to its function is the spindles' ability to attach to kinetochores (KTs), proteinaceous structures that assemble at the centromere of each sister chromatid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Cleveland <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Maiato <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Erroneous KT&#x02013;MT attachment, with either both sister KTs attached to the same pole (syntelic attachment), or both poles attached to the same KT (merotelic attachment), can result in inaccurate segregation of the sister chromatids and subsequent aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Pinsky and Biggins, 2005</xref>). To prevent aneuploidy, the cell generates a &#x02018;wait-anaphase' signal known as the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) that inhibits anaphase onset until all KTs achieve biorientation, and tension is established between sister KTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Electron microscopy has revealed KT as a trilaminar structure: the inner KT, situated most proximal to the centromeric chromatin, the outer KT that provides the binding surface for spindle MTs, and a central linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>). In addition, unattached KTs also show a fibrous corona, a dense array of fibres extending from the outer KT plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">McEwen <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Binding of MTs to KTs is highly dynamic, and multiple protein complexes at the KT have been implicated in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>). Of particular importance is the so-called KMN network (named after its key components <underline>K</underline>NL-1, <underline>M</underline>is12 and <underline>N</underline>dc80) that comprises three functionally linked complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Cheeseman <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Obuse <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kline <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kiyomitsu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Ciferri <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Individually, both Ndc80 and KNL-1 bind weakly to MTs, but the interaction of the Ndc80 complex is enhanced synergistically in the presence of the other KMN complex proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Cheeseman <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Removal of any of the components of the KMN network disrupts both the structure of the outer KT plate and its ability to bind to MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">DeLuca <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kline <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although the KMN is thought to provide the core binding sites for MTs at the KT, several other protein complexes also function at this critical interphase. These include the minus-end directed motor protein complex dynein/dynactin and proteins involved in its KT recruitment such as the RZZ complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Karess, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), Spindly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Griffis <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Yamamoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) and NudE and NudEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Stehman <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Moreover, the plus-end directed motor protein Cenp-E and its binding partner BubR1 are required for the maintenance of the KT&#x02013;MT interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lampson and Kapoor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Elowe <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Matsumura <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Finally, MT plus-end binding proteins (&#x0002b;Tips) such as EB1, Clip170 and Clasp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Maiato <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), and MT-bundling proteins like RanGAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Joseph <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) have also been implicated in KT&#x02013;MT binding and stabilization.</p><p>Recently, we described the novel spindle KT-associated (Ska) complex, of which we identified two members, Ska1 and Ska2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Ska1 was originally found in a proteomic survey of the human mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Sauer <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), whereas Ska2 was identified as a Ska1 binding partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In accordance with its identification as a spindle component, Ska1 was concentrated at the outer KT in a MT-dependent manner during prometaphase, where it remained until anaphase. Moreover, this localization was lost upon disruption of the outer KT plate by depletion of the Ndc80 component Hec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, siRNA-mediated depletion of either Ska1 or Ska2 induced a prolonged metaphase arrest that could be overridden by the co-depletion of the SAC component Mad2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Eventually, however, cells overcame the metaphase arrest, progressed through a normal anaphase and exited mitosis.</p><p>Here, we describe a third member of the Ska complex, C13Orf3 (now termed Ska3), which we identified as a novel binding partner of Ska2 by mass spectrometry. Biochemical and immunocytochemical data confirm that Ska3 represents a <italic>bona fide</italic> member of the Ska complex, and its depletion induces a metaphase delay similar to that described for Ska1 and Ska2. Intriguingly, we show that a more stringent depletion of the entire Ska complex results in a severe chromosome congression defect that leads to cell death. In accordance with this phenotype, KT&#x02013;MT attachment was severely impaired in Ska-depleted cells, although, remarkably, the KMN network was barely affected. Thus, we propose that the Ska complex is an essential component of the KT&#x02013;MT interface, functioning in cooperation to the KMN network and possibly signalling the completion of successful attachment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of C13Orf3 as a new component of the Ska complex</title><p>To search for binding partners of the Ska complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), HeLa S3 cells were synchronized in mitosis and Ska2 was immunoprecipitated. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> available online) revealed not only Ska2 and Ska1, but also the earlier uncharacterized protein C13Orf3. Neither of these proteins could be detected in control immunoprecipitates produced by rabbit IgG. To confirm the interaction between C13Orf3 and the Ska complex, Myc-tagged C13Orf3 was overexpressed and immunoprecipitated from HeLa S3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>) and HEK293T cells (data not shown). For control, parallel immunoprecipitations were carried out with the unrelated protein Myc&#x02013;hSWW45. Out of both cell lines, endogenous Ska1 and Ska2 could readily be co-immunoprecipitated with Myc&#x02013;C13Orf3, but not with Myc&#x02013;hSWW45, corroborating the mass spectrometry data. From this result and from the data shown below, we conclude that C13Orf3 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> member of the Ska complex and we hereafter refer to it as Ska3.</p><p>Ska3 has a predicted molecular weight of 45 kDa but, as shown below, migrates at about 55 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>), presumably due to its acidic isoelectric point (pI=5). The protein is conserved amongst vertebrates but cannot be identified with confidence below bony fish. According to secondary structure prediction, Ska3 is expected to display a globular N-terminal domain followed by a long unstructured C-terminal region. Furthermore, the Jpred 3 algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cole <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) predicts a motif with remote resemblance to a Gle2-binding sequence (GLEBS domain) within the N terminus of Ska3 (aa 17&#x02013;51, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>), and a second potential GLEBS domain may exist in the C-terminal region (aa 345&#x02013;382, F Buchholz, personal communication). GLEBS domains, as identified in scMad3, scBub1, hsBub1, hsBubR1 and hsNup98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Pritchard <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Larsen <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), are thought to provide interfaces for interactions with &#x003b2;-propeller regions on partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Larsen <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The localization of Myc-tagged Ska3 in HeLa S3 cells was analyzed by indirect immunofluoresence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). During interphase, Myc&#x02013;Ska3 displayed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution without obvious association with any definable structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). However, beginning in prometaphase, Myc&#x02013;Ska3 localized to KTs, where it remained throughout metaphase and anaphase, before it associated with the midbody during late telophase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). A more detailed examination of the KT association of Ska3 revealed the corresponding signal to lie outside of the centromeric CREST signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panels), indicating that the KT-bound pool of Ska3 is situated at the outer plate of the KT, similar to the localizations described for Ska1 and Ska2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). A proportion of Ska3 was also seen to associate with the spindle, particularly in the vicinity of the poles during metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom panels). Co-staining of cells for Myc&#x02013;Ska3 and Ska1 revealed that the two proteins co-localized throughout all stages of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>, middle panels; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Ska3. When used for immunofluorescence microscopy, the anti-Ska3 serum produced a specific spindle and KT staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>), indistinguishable from that seen with overexpressed Myc-tagged Ska3. By western blotting, the anti-Ska3 antibody detected a protein at a molecular weight of approximately 55 kDa in asynchronously growing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, a band of even lower electrophoretic mobility was seen in mitotically arrested cells, suggesting that Ska3 is modified during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4B&#x02013;D</xref>). Importantly, both immunoreactive bands were sensitive to Ska3 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>), attesting to their specificity.</p><p>To confirm the ability of Ska proteins to directly interact with each other, the three Ska components were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and used for <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of a ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A&#x02013;D</xref>). Gel filtration revealed a single homogeneous complex, containing all three Ska components that behaved like a 700-kDa globular protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). At present, we have no definitive information on the exact stoichiometry of the complex. Given that the combined molecular weight of Ska1 (33 kDa), Ska2 (15 kDa) and Ska3 (45 kDa) is &#x0003c;100 kDa, the complex possibly comprises multiple copies of each protein and/or possesses an elongated structure. Interaction mapping using limited proteolysis revealed that the N-terminal regions of Ska3 (aa 1&#x02013;156) and Ska1 (aa 1&#x02013;130) were sufficient for stable complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 2 and 3; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, Ska3 and Ska1 formed a binary complex in the absence of Ska2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 4), whereas the ability of Ska3 to bind Ska2 was limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 3). Interestingly though, the addition of Ska1 enhanced the interaction between Ska3 and Ska2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 4). This suggests that Ska1 provides a scaffold for complex formation by interacting with both Ska3 and Ska2 through its N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether a similarly large Ska complex could be identified in mitotic cells, lysates from nocodazole-arrested HeLa S3 cells were subjected to gel filtration and probed by western blotting for Ska components. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>, all three Ska proteins comigrated in several fractions that peaked around 720 kDa, in excellent agreement with the <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution data. In addition, Ska1 could be detected in several fractions of lower molecular weight, suggesting the existence of a subpopulation of Ska1 that is not in a complex with Ska2 and Ska3.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ska3 is required for Ska complex stability and function</title><p>Earlier it has been shown that siRNA-mediated depletion of either Ska1 or Ska2 resulted in an increased mitotic index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Rines <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the two proteins were found to influence each other's stability and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). To determine whether Ska3 is also critical for the stability of the entire Ska complex, we examined the effect of Ska3 depletion on Ska1 and Ska2 in HeLa S3 cells. When compared with cells transfected with the control Gl2 oligonucleotide, the Ska3-specific siRNA oligonucleotide effectively depleted the protein, as shown by both western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5A and B</xref>) and immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, Ska3 depletion clearly reduced the levels of both Ska1 and Ska2, and likewise, depletion of any other single component of the Ska complex affected the remaining members, albeit to variable extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A, B and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5A&#x02013;C</xref>). Most importantly, Ska3 depletion effectively blocked mitotic progression in asynchronously growing HeLa S3 cells, producing a 4&#x02013;5-fold increase in the percentage of mitotic cells above that of the Gl2 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>), with most cells arrested in a metaphase-like state characterized by relatively normal-looking bipolar spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>). These results are highly reminiscent of earlier data obtained upon depletion of Ska1 and Ska2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned above, Ska3 was clearly modified in mitosis, resulting in its reduced electrophoretic mobility. Analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that Ska3 can be phosphorylated on at least 18 different Ser/Thr residues and on at least one Tyr residue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brill <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Rush <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Nousiainen <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Daub <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Dephoure <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Sui <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; Malik <italic>et al</italic>, in preparation; Santamaria <italic>et al</italic>, unpublished result). We, therefore, asked whether the upshift observed in western blots performed on mitotic lysates was due to an M-phase specific phosphorylation on Ska3. Treatment of lysates from mitotically arrested cells with &#x003bb; phosphatase resulted in the complete loss of the slower migrating band and a concomitant increase in the faster migrating form, indicating that the observed retardation in electrophoretic mobility was indeed dependent on phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, exposure to calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) resulted in an intermediate band, suggesting that different phosphorylation events on Ska3 give rise to distinct upshifts. Furthermore, when samples were collected at different times after release from a nocodazole block and examined by western blotting, we observed a step-wise increase in Ska3 mobility concomitant with securin degredation, suggesting that Ska3 is progressively dephosphorylated as cells exit mitosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref>). The M-phase specificity of Ska3 phosphorylation was further confirmed by demonstrating that Ska3 exists solely in its upshifted (phosphorylated) state when cells are blocked at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition by the addition of the proteosome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref>). The upshifted form of Ska3 was also detected in mitotic cells collected by shake-off 10 h after thymidine release (data not shown), indicating that it is not an artefact caused by prolonged exposure to an anti-mitotic drug. Taken together, these results clearly show that Ska3 is highly phosphorylated during M-phase and then dephosphorylated after SAC inactivation and anaphase onset. In future, it will be interesting to elucidate the role of Ska3 phosphorylation during mitotic progression. One possibility would be that phosphorylation regulates Ska complex formation, but given that interactions among the three Ska proteins can readily be detected amongst recombinant proteins purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>) it cannot be essential. Thus, it appears more attractive to speculate that Ska3 phosphorylation is required for the localization or function of the complex at the KT. In any event, inspection of the consensus sequences of the phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>) suggests that multiple mitotic kinases contribute to control Ska3 function.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Extensive depletion of the Ska complex causes a chromosome congression defect</title><p>To explore the function of Ska3, the consequences of depleting individual Ska proteins were examined by live cell imaging performed on HeLa S3 cells stably expressing Histone H2B-GFP. When compared with Gl2-treated control cells, depletion of Ska3, Ska2 or Ska1 resulted in a striking delay between metaphase plate formation and anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">3</xref> and data not shown), consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Eventually, however, cells underwent anaphase and completed mitosis.</p><p>The fact that knock-down of individual Ska proteins delays cells in a metaphase-like state but does not ultimately prevent the completion of mitosis could be interpreted to imply that this complex is not strictly required for mitotic progression. Alternatively, however, the transient nature of the arrest may reflect incomplete depletion of the Ska complex. To explore this latter possibility, we pooled siRNA oligonucleotides targeting two Ska components simultaneously, in the hope that this would achieve a more complete depletion of the Ska complex than any &#x02018;single' knock-down. Quantitative analysis of western blotting revealed that double-siRNA treatment resulted in a more extensive depletion of Ska complex components than single-siRNA treatment, particularly when depletion efficiency was assessed at relatively early time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5A and B</xref>). As shown by time-lapse microscopy, the single depletion of Ska components produced a marked metaphase delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B and E</xref>), consistent with earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In contrast, the more complete removal of the complex resulted in a striking chromosome congression failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">7</xref>), followed by a large proportion of cells (up to 80&#x00025;) dying without ever reaching metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). Remarkably, this phenotype was particularly pronounced whenever Ska3 was one of the two proteins being depleted.</p><p>We presume that some cells survived the double-siRNA treatment because they suffered a less complete depletion of the Ska complex. These latter cells eventually reached a stage resembling metaphase, but they required substantially more time (105&#x000b1;35 min for Ska1/Ska3 double depletion) than either cells depleted of Ska3 alone (24&#x000b1;7 min) or Gl2 controls (19&#x000b1;3 min). The exact same Ska-depleted cells then also required much more time to progress to anaphase than Gl2 controls, but differences between singly and doubly siRNA-treated cells were less pronounced (89&#x000b1;36 min for Ska3 single depletion, compared with 124&#x000b1;33 min for Ska1/Ska3 double depletion) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C&#x02013;E</xref> for complete data on all siRNA combinations). Taken together, these data thus suggest that chromosome congression is particularly sensitive to the precise levels of Ska proteins.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Removal of the Ska complex compromises MT&#x02013;KT attachment</title><p>The inability of chromosomes to form a metaphase plate after extensive removal of the Ska complex indicated a possible role of this complex in MT capture and/or maintenance of KT attachment. To explore this possibility, we first confirmed that Ska3 recruitment to KTs was dependent on MTs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>) and required the presence of the Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>), similar to results obtained earlier for Ska1 and Ska2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Next, we adapted a recently described assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Toso <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) to examine the extent of MT interactions with KTs. Specifically, the &#x003b1;-Tubulin signal of MTs was measured and normalized to the CREST signal at KTs (see Materials and methods). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, co-depletion of either Ska1/Ska3 or Ska3/Hec1 produced a marked reduction in the KT-associated Tubulin signal, similar to that seen after depletion of Hec1 alone, whereas depletion of only Ska3 produced a minor decrease. This suggested that co-depletion of Ska1/Ska3 interfered with the establishment and/or maintenance of MT&#x02013;KT attachment to a similar extent as (hypomorphic) Hec1 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">DeLuca <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Martin-Lluesma <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). To corroborate this conclusion, we also assayed the stability of KT&#x02013;MTs (k-fibres) after exposure of Ska-depleted cells to low temperature for either 5 or 15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Rieder, 1981</xref>). Again, we compared the consequences of both single- and double-Ska depletions with the earlier described Hec1-depletion phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">DeLuca <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Martin-Lluesma <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), and we also examined the consequences of Ska3/Hec1 double depletion. Detailed analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both the Gl2 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>) and the cells depleted of only Ska3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>) retained many cold-stable k-fibres. In contrast, cells depleted of both Ska1 and Ska3 almost completely lacked k-fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>), very similar to the cells depleted of Hec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E</xref>). Double depletion of Ska3 and Hec1 did not produce any obvious additional phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with the observation that the depletion of Hec1 results in the loss of the Ska complex from KTs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>). Taken together, the above data show that the Ska complex is required for the formation of stable MT&#x02013;KT attachments. Upon severe depletion of this complex, chromosomes fail to congress successfully and progression through mitosis is compromised.</p><p>In a final series of experiments, we asked whether the extensive removal of the Ska complex affected the localization of KMN components required for KT&#x02013;MT stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">DeLuca <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Cheeseman <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kline <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Co-depletion of Ska1 and Ska3 did not detectably reduce the overall cellular levels of either Hec1 or Blinkin, the human homologue of KNL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kiyomitsu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 7A</xref>), nor did they produce a major effect on the localization of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Precise quantifications did suggest slight reductions of the corresponding immunofluorescence signals at KTs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 7B and C</xref>), but this effect cannot account for the phenotype upon Ska double depletion, as there was no further reduction in the level of KT-bound KMN components when compared with cells only treated with a single Ska siRNA oligonucleotide. The localization of Mis12 could not be monitored directly, but the corresponding complex is unlikely to be affected by Ska depletion, as inferred from the near-normal localization of Hec1 and the known interdependence between the Ndc80 and the Mis12 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kline <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The localizations of other proteins involved in KT&#x02013;MT attachment, in particular CenpE, the dynein/dynactin complex member p150<sup>glued</sup>, and the RZZ complex member ZW10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lampson and Kapoor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), were also not noticeably affected by co-depletion of Ska1 and Ska3 in HeLa S3 cells (data not shown). Likewise, the SAC components Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 could readily be detected at KTs after Ska depletion, in line with persistent activation of the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>These results argue that the absence of the Ska complex does not significantly disrupt the core KT structure. However, the fact that k-fibre stability is lost upon Ska depletion despite the presence of the KMN network indicates that the Ska complex has an important function in stabilizing KT&#x02013;MT attachments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). The depletion of Hec1 results in a loss of Ska proteins from KTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>, this study), implying that a functional KT is required for Ska localization. Although this may suggest a direct interaction between these complexes, it is important to bear in mind that the Ndc80 complex is required for the overall structure of the outer KT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">DeLuca <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Thus, the loss of Ska proteins upon Hec1 depletion may well reflect the loss of an as yet unidentified anchoring protein. So far, we have been unable to show a direct interaction between the Ndc80 and the Ska complexes, and several focused screens for binding partners of the Ska complex amongst KT components, MT &#x0002b;Tip-binding proteins, or MT-bundling proteins, have failed to reveal interaction partners of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>In summary, we describe the novel phosphoprotein Ska3 (formerly C13Orf3). We show that this protein is a core component of the Ska complex, required for both complex stability and function. Furthermore, through double-depletion siRNA experiments resulting in the near-complete removal of the entire Ska complex, we have been able to describe an essential role for the Ska complex in MT&#x02013;KT attachment and chromosome congression. Thus, the Ska complex has a more central function in mitotic progression than surmised earlier. We propose that the Ska complex cooperates with the KMN to create the dynamic MT&#x02013;KT interface that is required for MT attachment, chromosome congression and subsequent segregation. In particular, we speculate that the Ska complex may function as a clamp to stabilize the MT&#x02013;KT attachments established through the KMN, perhaps providing an analogous function to the Dash&#x02013;Duo&#x02013;Dam complex of budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cheeseman <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Westermann <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Additionally, it would be premature to exclude an additional signalling function in the silencing of the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Perhaps, the functions provided by the Ska complex are particularly critical in organisms in which multiple MTs attach to a single KT. This would readily explain the apparent absence of genes coding for Ska proteins from the published yeast genomes.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cloning procedures</title><p>For cloning of Ska3 (C13Orf3), a cDNA clone (IRATp970D0864D) was obtained from the &#x02018;Deutsches Ressourzentrum f&#x000fc;r Genomforschung'.

As summarized in this schematic, we propose that the KMN network and the Ska complex cooperate to ensure stable end-on MT attachments to KTs (top panel). Stable attachment fails upon depletion of either the KMN or the Ska complex. In the absence of KMN (middle panel), the Ska complex fails to localize to KTs, whereas, conversely, the KT localization of the KMN does not strictly depend on the Ska complex (bottom panel). This implies that the KMN alone is not sufficient for stable MT attachment but requires cooperation with the Ska complex for full functionality. Finally, we emphasize that the role in chromosome congression shown here for the Ska complex does not rigorously exclude a second, additional role for this complex in SAC silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="emboj200996f6"/></fig></floats-wrap></article>
