The protein sequence of RACK1 is highly conserved in eukaryotes. However, the function of RACK1 in plants remains poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggested that RACK1 may be involved in hormone responses, but the precise role of RACK1 in any hormone signalling pathway remains elusive. Molecular and genetic evidence that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RACK1 is a negative regulator of ABA responses is provided here. It is shown that three <italic>RACK1</italic> genes act redundantly to regulate ABA responses in seed germination, cotyledon greening and root growth, because <italic>rack1a</italic> single and double mutants are hypersensitive to ABA in each of these processes. On the other hand, plants overexpressing <italic>RACK1A</italic> displayed ABA insensitivity. Consistent with their proposed roles in seed germination and early seedling development, all three <italic>RACK1</italic> genes were expressed in imbibed, germinating and germinated seeds. It was found that the ABA-responsive marker genes, <italic>RD29B</italic> and <italic>RAB18</italic>, were up-regulated in <italic>rack1a</italic> mutants. Furthermore, the expression of all three <italic>RACK1</italic> genes themselves was down-regulated by ABA. Consistent with the view that RACK1 negatively regulates ABA responses, <italic>rack1a</italic> mutants lose water significantly more slowly from the rosettes and are hypersensitive to high concentrations of NaCl during seed germination. In addition, the expression of some putative RACK1-interacting, ABA-, or abiotic stress-regulated genes was mis-regulated in <italic>rack1a rack1b</italic> double mutants in response to ABA. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence that RACK1 is a critical, negative regulator of ABA responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ABA</kwd><kwd>drought</kwd><kwd>early seedling development</kwd><kwd>RACK1</kwd><kwd>salt</kwd><kwd>seed germination</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) was originally identified as a receptor for activated protein kinase C (PKC) in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mochly-Rosen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ron <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>), but now it is viewed as a multi-functional protein that plays regulatory roles in diverse signal transduction pathways (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCahill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sklan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

In earlier studies, the characterization of plant RACK1 was mainly concentrated on gene expression and induction studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McKhann <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perennes <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Recent genetic studies using the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> revealed that RACK1 may have multiple functions in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo and Chen, 2008</xref>).

Furthermore, rice RACK1 physically interacts with multiple proteins in the Rac1 immune complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), providing evidence that the scaffolding feature of RACK1 protein may be conserved in plants.</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggested that plant RACK1 may have a role in hormone responses. For example, the first plant <italic>RACK1</italic> gene was discovered as an auxin-induced gene in tobacco BY-2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishida <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). In these tobacco cells, salicylic acid (SA) can block the UV irradiation-induced <italic>RACK1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perennes <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Interestingly, in alfalfa, <italic>RACK1</italic> was induced by cytokinin, but not by auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McKhann <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). In rice, ABA can induce the protein expression of RACK1 in imbibed seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komatsu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), whereas in rice cell cultures, the expression of <italic>RACK1</italic> can also be induced by methyl jasmonate, auxin, and ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).

However, the role of RACK1 in any hormone signalling pathways has not been defined prior to this study. Six lines of evidence directly or indirectly support the conclusion that Arabidopsis RACK1s are negative regulators of ABA responses. (i) <italic>rack1a</italic> single mutants and <italic>rack1a rack1b</italic> and <italic>rack1a rack1c</italic> double mutants were hypersensitive to ABA in the ABA inhibition of seed germination, cotyledon greening, and root growth.

ABA INSENSITIVE 1 (ABI1) and ABI2, both protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2Cs), are among the first negative regulators of ABA signalling identified through genetic screens (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Finkelstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Himmelbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCourt and Creelman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wasilewska <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Subsequently, other PP2Cs, including ABA HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION1 (AHG1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004, 2007</xref>) and AHG3/AtPP2CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), HYPERSENSITIVE TO ABA 1 (HAB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004, 2006</xref>) and HAB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) have also been demonstrated as negative regulators of ABA signalling in seed germination and early seedling development (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2007</xref>). Many other negative regulators of ABA signalling in seed germination and early seedling development have been discovered through reverse genetics or gene expression studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Finkelstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). For example, through reverse genetics, the heterotrimeric G-proteins are proposed to be negative regulators of ABA signalling in seed germination and early seedling development (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perfus-Barbeoch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Assmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen, 2008</xref>), because the loss-of-function alleles of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> heterotrimeric G-protein &#x003b1; (G&#x003b1;) and &#x003b2; (G&#x003b2;) subunits are hypersensitive to ABA in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ullah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pandey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Similarly, a putative G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>GCR1</italic>, is a negative regulator of ABA signalling in seed germination and early seedling development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pandey and Assmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pandey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). A small GTPase, Rop10, was also characterized as a negative regulator of ABA signalling in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Genetic screens have also yielded many other critical components of ABA signalling, including ABI3, ABI4, and ABI5 (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Finkelstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Himmelbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCourt and Creelman, 2008</xref>). ABI3 is a B3 domain transcription factor. ABI4 is an APETALA2 domain transcription factor. ABI5 is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor. It is believed that these transcription factors mediate ABA responses by controlling ABA-induced gene expression. Although at least three different types of proteins have been proposed as ABA receptors in the last three years, including FLOWERING TIME CONTROL PROTEIN A (FCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Razem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), a nuclear RNA-binding protein, the H subunit of Mg-chelatase (CHLH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), a chloroplast protein, and G-Protein-Coupled Receptor 2 (GCR2), a proposed seven-transmembrane GPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), as reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCourt and Creelman (2008)</xref>, none of these proposed ABA receptors appeared to function as the major receptor mediating ABA signalling in seed germination and early seedling development. Furthermore, the structure and functionality of GCR2 have been challenged by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Illingworth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Risk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Subsequent studies also do not support the claim that FCA is an ABA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Razem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Risk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). At the cell surface, there are a few candidate ABA receptors perceiving the ABA signal. For example, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor-like kinase 1, RPK1, has been shown to function as a positive regulator of ABA signalling in seed germination, early seedling growth, stomatal closure, and ABA-induced gene expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osakabe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Recently, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> A4 subfamily of lectin receptor kinases, LecRKs, has been shown to function as negative regulators of the ABA response in seed germination (Xin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008). However, the ability of these candidate receptors to bind ABA has not been established. In 2009, two new types of ABA receptors have been proposed, including two novel GPCR-type G-proteins, GTG1 and GTG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pandey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and the PYR/PYL (RCAR) family of START proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), which has led to new discussions on ABA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pennisi, 2009</xref>).</p><p>As discussed above, molecular and genetic studies have already identified a rich collection of signalling components, positive or negative regulators, involved or required in ABA signalling (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Finkelstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Himmelbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCourt and Creelman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wasilewska <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, it remains elusive how these signalling components are co-ordinated to regulate ABA responses. The identification of RACK1 proteins, whose mammalian counterparts function as multi-functional scaffold proteins, as redundant, negative regulators of ABA responses may help to provide new insights into the complex ABA signalling networks. In a preliminary analysis, a RACK1 interaction network was generated through a bioinformatics approach (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp221/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp221/DC1">Supplementary S3</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). The transcription of a total of eight genes among those 86 candidate interactors has been shown to be regulated by ABA or abiotic stresses. It was found that ABA induction of seven of these eight ABA-regulated genes was altered in the <italic>rack1a rack1b</italic> double mutant background, implying that RACK1 may be involved in the ABA signalling route towards the induction of these genes. One of the well characterized proteins in our list is CTR1 which has been shown to be a negative regulator of ethylene signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kieber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). CTR1 was down-regulated by ABA in the wild type whereas it was up-regulated in the <italic>rack1a rack1b</italic> double mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>). Because ethylene is considered to be a negative regulator of ABA signalling in seed germination and a positive regulator of ABA signalling in root growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gazzarrini and McCourt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), it raises the possibility that RACK1 may serve as a nexus for these two hormone signalling pathways. This will be investigated further in future studies. On the other hand, the relationship between RACK1 and other known components in the ABA signalling pathway is unknown. The next major challenge is to position RACK1 precisely in the intricate ABA signal transduction network.</p><p>In summary, it is demonstrated that <italic>rack1a</italic> single and double mutants are hypersensitive to ABA in the ABA inhibition of seed germination, cotyledon greening, and root growth whereas over-expression of <italic>RACK1A</italic> confers ABA hyposensitivity. It was shown that the expression of ABA-responsive marker genes, <italic>RD29B</italic> and <italic>RAB18</italic>, are up-regulated in <italic>rack1a</italic> mutants and the <italic>RACK1</italic> genes are down-regulated by ABA. Consistent with ABA hypersensitivity, <italic>rack1a</italic> mutants lose water significantly more slowly from the rosettes and are hypersensitive to high concentrations of NaCl during seed germination. Furthermore, the expression of some known ABA- or abiotic stress-regulated genes which encode putative RACK1 interactors was altered in the <italic>rack1a rack1b</italic> mutant background, in response to ABA. Collectively, these results have defined RACK1s as critical regulators of ABA signalling. Because RACK1 functions as a scaffold protein in mammalian cells, our work may help provide new insights into the complex ABA signalling network.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp221/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp221/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1.</ext-link></bold> ABA sensitivity of <italic>RACK1A</italic> over-expression lines in the seed germination assay.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp221/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2.</ext-link></bold> Water loss assay of <italic>RACK1A</italic> over-expression lines.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp221/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3.</ext-link></bold> Salt stress sensitivity of <italic>RACK1A</italic> over-expression lines during seed germination.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp221/DC1">Supplementry Table S1.</ext-link></bold> Primers used in this study.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp221/DC1">Supplementry Table S2.</ext-link></bold> RACK1A-interacting proteins identified by using the BAR <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Interactions Viewer.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp221/DC1">Supplementary Table S3.</ext-link></bold> RACK1C-interacting proteins identified by using the BAR <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Interactions Viewer.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="erp221_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="erp221_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Julia Bailey-Serres (University of California, Riverside) for providing anti-RACK1A peptide antibodies.
