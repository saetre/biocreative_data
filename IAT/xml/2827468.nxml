By vaccination diphtheria is well-controlled in e. g. Western Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; however, this disease is still a cause of morbidity and mortality in less developed countries. While the production of diphtheria toxin has been well-established as a major virulence factor, little is known about <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>factors crucial for colonization of the host and corresponding host receptors recognized by these factors, although colonization is an essential step of pathogenicity.</p><p>In the last decades it has become evident that <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>is not only the aetiological agent of diphtheria, but can cause other infections. Non-toxigenic strains have been increasingly documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and found to be the cause of invasive diseases such as endocarditis, bacteraemia, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, spleen abscesses, and septic arthritis ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and references therein). These systemic infections caused by <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>suggest that this pathogen is not only able to attach to host epithelial cells, but must be able to gain access to deeper tissues by unknown portals of entry and to persist in these tissues.</p><p>A possible clue for the background of persistence of <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>came from investigations of adherence and invasion of toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains. Using a combination of gentamicin protection assays and thin-section electron microscopy, Hirata and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] showed that toxigenic <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>were not only able to adhere to laryngeal HEp-2 cells, but also enter these cells and survive after internalization. Similar observations were made for non-toxigenic strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] showing that also pharyngeal Detroit 562 cells can be invaded by <italic>C. diphtheriae</italic>. In this study, living intracellular bacteria were detected up to 48 h after infection.</p><p>While host cell receptors and invasion-associated proteins of the pathogen are still unknown, bacterial adhesion factors have been recently at least partially characterized on the molecular level. <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>is able to assemble three distinct pili on its surface. Mutant analyses showed that the SpaA-type pilus is sufficient for adhesion to pharynx cells, shaft proteins are not crucial for pathogen-host interaction, while adherence to pharyngeal cells is greatly diminished when minor pili proteins SpaB and SpaC are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The results obtained in this study also indicated the existence of other proteins besides pili subunits involved in adhesion to larynx, pharynx, and lung epithelial cells, since a total loss of attachment to pharyngeal cells due to mutagenesis of pili- and sortase-encoding genes could not be observed and attachment to lung or larynx cells was less affected by the mutations. This is in line with a number of studies suggesting the multi-factorial mechanism of adhesion (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). Furthermore, Hirata and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] described two distinct patterns of adherence to HEp-2 cells, a localized and a diffuse form, an observation that hint also to the existence of several adhesion factors. This idea is in accordance with the situation in other bacteria such as <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>where a high number of different factors are crucial for pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The involvement of different <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>proteins to adherence to distinct cell types is further supported by work on adhesion to human erythrocytes, showing that non-fimbrial surface proteins 67p and 72p, which were up to now only characterized by their mass, are involved in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, besides strain-specific differences in adherences (see references cited above), also growth-dependent effects were observed. In a study using two toxigenic <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>strains and erythrocytes as well as HEp-2 cells, de Oliveira Moreira and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] showed an effect of iron supply on hemagglutination and lectin binding properties of the microorganisms. Also in this study, strain-specific differences in adherence were detected.</p><p>While pathogen factors responsible for adhesion are at least partially known, the molecular background of invasion is more or less unclear. Since we were interested in this process, we started a functional genetics approach to identify proteins involved in invasion, based on a recently published work presenting a comprehensive analysis of proteins secreted by <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this study, we focused on one of these identified proteins, the surface-associated protein DIP1281, a member of the NlpC/P60 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. NlpC/P60 proteins define a large superfamily of several diverse groups of proteins including putative proteases and probably invasion-associated proteins. They are found in bacteria, bacteriophages, RNA viruses, and eukaryotes and various members are highly conserved among non-pathogenic and pathogenic corynebacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>protein DIP1281 was, as its homologs Ce1659, Cg1735, and JK0967 in <italic>Corynebacterium efficiens</italic>, <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>, and <italic>Corynebacterium jeikeium</italic>, previously annotated as hypothetical invasion-associated protein and was therefore in the focus of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Adhesion and invasion of <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>wild type and mutant strains</title><p>As a basis for further analyses of DIP1281 mutants, strains ISS3319 and ISS4060, which were already shown to be adhesion- and invasion-competent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], were tested for adhesion to and internalization in Detroit562 (D562) cells. Using a slightly modified protocol (compared to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]) with increased number of washing steps, we were able to generate highly reproducible infection conditions (Table 1). In these experiments, strain ISS3319 showed a higher number of adherent bacteria compared to strain ISS4060 (corresponding to adhesion rates of 2.66 &#x000b1; 0.12% for ISS3319 and 2.16 &#x000b1; 0.29% for ISS4060), while statistically relevant differences of the number of invaded epithelial cells were not observed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Adhesion of <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>to epithelial cells and internalization.

No significant differences were observed between wild-type and mutants in respect to viability, in all cases the majority of bacteria were fully viable and exclusively stained by SYTO9 green and not by propidium iodide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). During manipulation of bacteria (washing steps, resuspension of pellets), we observed that chains of mutants were occasionally broken down to smaller units. Using LIVE/DEAD staining, we could show that disruption of chains by vigorous vortexing (5 min) was not detrimental to the bacteria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), indicating that mutant strains have a fully functional and rigid peptidoglycan layer.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>LIVE/DEAD staining of <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>wild-type and mutant strains</bold>.

This observation corresponds nicely with the increased colony size of the mutants (data not shown) and suggests that the altered bacterial size and form has no severe impact on light scattering and consequently OD measurement.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of surface proteins</title><p>Since we assumed that the altered shape of the mutants might be correlated with an altered cell surface, especially in the light of the immuno-fluorescence microscopy approach (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which showed a different antibody binding compared to the wild-type, we isolated the surface proteins of wild-type and mutant strains. When these were subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver staining, significant differences in protein patterns were observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Compared to the protein bands of the wild-type strains, DIP1281 mutants showed a decrease of bands in the upper molecular weight range accompanied by an increased number of bands in the lower molecular weight range. These changes were confirmed, when Western blot experiments were carried out (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), which also showed a dramatic change and decrease of immuno-reactive bands. As a third experimental approach to analyse surface proteins, 2-D PAGE was carried out (gels for strains ISS3319 and Lilo1 are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>; ISS4060 and Lilo2 gave comparable results, data not shown). As in the SDS-PAGE experiments, the mutant showed a decrease of proteins in the upper molecular weight range and an increased number of spots in the lower molecular weight range. Furthermore, in comparison to the wild-type, the mutant showed a dramatic increased number of multiple spots. The molecular background of these multiple protein forms is unclear.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of surface proteins</bold>.

By fluorescence staining and atomic force microscopy, we could show that DIP1281 mutations cause formation of chains of bacteria, rearrangements of cell surface structures, and dramatic changes in protein patterns. Our data indicate that DIP1281 is not crucial for the separation of the peptidoglycan layer of dividing bacteria, since disruption of chains did not decrease the viability of bacteria. Consequently, DIP1281 function seems to be limited to the outer protein layer of <italic>C. diphtheriae</italic>, which is not uniformly organized in a surface layer lattice, but comprises more than 50 different proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 &#x000d7; g for 20 min, washed twice with pre-cooled (4&#x000b0;C) 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2), resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 2% 3-[(3-choamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio] propanesulfonate (CHAPS) and incubated on ice overnight, followed by centrifugation at 3,500 &#x000d7; g and 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min to separate the cell surface proteins. After filtration of the protein solution using 0.45 &#x003bc;m pore-size filters (SARSTEDT, N&#x000fc;mbrecht, Germany), further preparation of the surface proteins by phenolic acid extraction and methanol precipitation followed a protocol described by Watt and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The precipitated proteins were harvested by centrifugation at 3,500 &#x000d7; g and 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The pellet was washed twice with 3 ml of 70% ethanol (-20&#x000b0;C) and once with 3 ml of acetone (-20&#x000b0;C). Finally, the protein pellet was dried on ice and solubilised in 450 &#x003bc;l of dehydration buffer (8 M urea, 20 mM DTT, 2% CHAPS). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (peqLab, Erlangen, Germany).

IEF was performed with commercially available IPG strips (18 cm, pH 3-10) and the Ettan IPGphor II (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). The following voltage profile was used for IEF: 1 h, 0 V; 12 h, 30 V; 2 h, 60 V; 1 h, 500 V; 1 h, 1000 V followed by a linear increase to 8000 V. The final phase of 8000 V was terminated after 90,000 Vh. The IPG strips were equilibrated for 30 min each in 5 ml of solution C (6 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% DTT) and in 5 ml of solution D (6 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 4% iodacetamide). The isolated proteins were separated in 12.5% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide gels (37.5:1) with an Ettan Dalt II system (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) applying approximately 15 mA per gel. To visualize the separated proteins, gels were stained in Coomassie staining solution (5% methanol, 42.5% ethanol, 10% acetic acid, 0.25% Serva-G250), and destained with 10% acetic acid.</p></sec><sec><title>Immuno-fluorescence</title><p>For immuno-fluorescence staining a rabbit antiserum directed against the <italic>C. diphtheriae </italic>surface proteome was used as primary antibody.
