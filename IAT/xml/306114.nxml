The three restriction maps showed perfect agreement within the overlapping regions. The 7 kb regions, which included the entire normal rat c-myc and the region 2.2 kb upstream, and one from the hepatomas, were sequenced and found to be identical. The coding regions of exons 2 and 3 were highly conserved between rat, mouse and man, but some differences in amino acids were noted. Exon 1 and the non-coding region of exon 3 showed limited homology between the three species. Rat exon 1 contained several nonsense codons in each frame and no ATG codon, indicating there to be no coding capacity in this exon. The 2.2 kb upstream regions and the introns compared showed unusual conservation between the rat and human genes. Some motifs, previously proposed as having a functional role in human c-myc, were also found in equivalent positions of the rat sequence. Nucleas S1 protection mapping revealed the second promoter to be preferentially used in most tissues or in hepatoma cells, and the second poly A addition signal to be the only one functional in all the RNA sources examined.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0124-a" xlink:role="6429"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0125-a" xlink:role="6430"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6419"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6420"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6421"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6422"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6423"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6424"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0120.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6425"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0121.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6426"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0122.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6427"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0123.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6428"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0124.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6429"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6430"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6431"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0127.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6432"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6433"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6434"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6435"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00260-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6436"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
