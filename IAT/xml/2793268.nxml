An overexpression of PTTG enhances cell proliferation, induces cellular transformation <italic>in vitro</italic>, and promotes tumor development in nude mice. PTTG also inhibits separation of sister chromatids leading to aneuploidy and genetic instability. A great amount of work has been undertaken to understand the biology of PTTG and its expression in various tumors. However, mechanisms by which PTTG mediates its tumorigenic function are not fully understood. To utilize this gene for cancer therapy, identification of the downstream signaling genes regulated by PTTG in mediation of its tumorigenic function is necessary. For this purpose, we expressed PTTG in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells that do not express PTTG and analyzed the downstream genes using microarray analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 22,277 genes printed on an Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 GeneChip&#x02122; array were screened with labeled cRNA prepared from HEK293 cells infected with adenovirus vector expressing PTTG cDNA (AdPTTG cDNA) and compared with labeled cRNA prepared from HEK293 cells infected with control adenovirus (control Ad) or adenovirus vector expressing GFP (AdGFP). Out of 22,277 genes, 71 genes were down-regulated and 35 genes were up-regulated with an FDR corrected p-value of &#x02264; 0.05 and a fold change of &#x02265;2. Most of the altered genes identified are involved in the cell cycle and cell apoptosis; a few are involved in mRNA processing and nitrogen metabolism. Most of the up-regulated genes belong to the histone protein family.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PTTG is a well-studied oncogene for its role in tumorigenesis. In addition to its importance in regulation of the cell cycle, this gene has also been recently shown to play a role in the induction of cell apoptosis. The microarray analysis in the present study demonstrated that PTTG may induce apoptosis by down-regulation of oncogenes such as v-Jun and v-maf and up-regulation of the histone family of genes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) is a multifunctional protein involved in the cell cycle, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and other cellular functions. PTTG was initially isolated from rat pituitary tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Based on its function in the inhibition of separation of sister chromatids, it was named securin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Overexpression of PTTG was reported in many cancers including ovary, lung, testis, kidney, colon, thyroid, pituitary, liver, adrenal, breast, prostate, melanoma, leukemia, and lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Many laboratories have explored this oncogene for its role in tumorigenesis since its identification (see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] for review). Pei and Melmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] showed that overexpression of PTTG in NIH3T3 cells inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell transformation <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, overexpression of PTTG in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells was shown to increase cell proliferation, induce cellular transformation <italic>in vitro</italic>, and promote tumor development in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Ishikawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and McCabe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] showed PTTG's role in angiogenesis by coinciding its function in inducing the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF). Heaney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] reported regulation of PTTG expression <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>by estrogen. Ishikawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] demonstrated that the conditioned medium collected from NIH3T3 cells overexpressing human PTTG induced angiogenesis through up-regulation of bFGF both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. This information was further confirmed by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] who showed regulation of angiogenic genes such as ID3 and TSP-1 by PTTG. Angiogenic gene ID3 has been shown to be up-regulated by VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which is believed to play a critical role in cell proliferation and to be a precursor of endothelial cell recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Shibata et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] showed the importance of PTTG in tumor metastasis and its correlation with the pathological stage, levels of pain, and extensive lymph node metastasis in esophageal cancer patients. Its expression levels were found to be correlated with a higher degree of tumor recurrence and tumor aggression in breast cancer as well as in squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In our previous studies, we [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] demonstrated the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and its relationship in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.</p><p>Role of PTTG in tumorigenesis was further confirmed by down-regulation of PTTG in tumors. Chen et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] down-regulated PTTG expression using full-length anti-PTTG complementary (c) DNA in SKOV3 and showed a significant reduction of cell proliferation and colony formation on soft agar compared to the non-transformed cells and bFGF protein levels. In this context, using PTTG siRNA to transfect an ovarian tumor cell line (A2780), El-Naggar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] showed a 50% reduction in cell proliferation and a 70% reduction in colony formation. In addition, these investigators demonstrated a reduced incidence of tumor development and tumor growth in nude mice injected with A2780 cells that constitutively expressed PTTG siRNA compared to cells expressing control siRNA. These results were confirmed by Cho-Rok et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] using an adenovirus expression system expressing PTTG siRNA in a hapotoma cell line.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms by which PTTG achieves its functions remain unclear. Although a limited number of individual target genes in various cell lines have been identified, a large-scale profile of the target genes regulated by PTTG had not been undertaken at the time of this study. For this purpose, we explored the cDNA-microarray technology to identify the differentially expressed genes by PTTG. Most of the tumors and cancer cell lines overexpress PTTG; therefore, we selected HEK293 cells, which expresses a very low or undetectable level of endogenous PTTG. The change in expression of some genes by PTTG identified by cDNA microarray analysis was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>HEK293 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) according to instructions from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA).

This gene was initially identified as the oncogenic factor of avian sarcoma virus 17 (ASV17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The cellular homologue of v-Jun is c-Jun, which is a predominant component of AP-1 transcriptional factors. The c-Jun oncogene can form homodimers and also forms heterodimers with Fos family members. This complex binds to TPA-response elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and regulates a diverse range of biological functions ranging from cell growth and differentiation to stress signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The biochemical studies on c-Jun showed that this gene negatively regulates the association of p53 with p21CIP1 gene promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Experiments by Maclaren [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] showed that the mRNA and protein levels of p21CIP1 were greatly reduced by v-Jun in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). They also found that the repression of p21CIP1 occurs by both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The cell cycle regulator p21CIP1 is a cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor, which arrests the cell cycle throughout the G1/S phase. The present study showed down-regulation of v-Jun by overexpression of PTTG in HEK293 cells in both microarray and qRT-PCR analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The microarray data showed a down-regulation of this gene by 3.86-fold. The qRT-PCR analysis of this gene showed 4.2-fold down-regulation, which is in directional correspondence with the microarray data. From these observations, we believe that overexpression of PTTG may induce p21CIP1 by down-regulating its inhibitor v-Jun. There are also reports that the p21CIP1 promoter is activated by a tumor-suppressor gene p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our microarray data also showed a slight up-regulation of p53 by PTTG-over expression (data not shown). In our previous studies, we showed up-regulation of p53 transcription by PTTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

Similar findings were also observed by other investigators where PTTG was found to induce cell proliferation via VEGF, and PTTG expression levels were always observed with the induced levels of FGF and VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. But the microarray analysis of HEK293 cells overxpressing PTTG in the present study did not show changes in VEGF, bFGF and IL-8 transcripts significantly within the selected stringency. Although we observed a slight increase in these three transcripts (&#x02264;1.5-fold) they are filtered in the selected stringent conditions (p-value &#x02264; 0.05 and &#x02265;2-fold). As we know that the cDNA-microarray can only provide approximations of gene transcripts, which is further associated with some experimental noises that detracts the experiment ability, we expect loss or gain of signal intensities. Also the previous studies showed the expression of VEGF and FGF by PTTG in transient transfection experiments, which express moderate levels of PTTG protein. Whereas in the present study we utilized adenoviral mediated expression of PTTG, which yields higher levels of PTTG protein expressions, which could be an additional possibility of variation in the experimental data. PTTG being an important protein involved in various cellular pathways, from the present study we also observed that the influence of PTTG on various cell signaling is more of quantitative than generic. From these observations, it may be possible that PTTG is involved in angiogenesis both by inducing expression of angiogenic factors such as VEGF and bFGF as well as by the down regulation of transcriptional factors that repress the secretion of VEGF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>The Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes interlinked with the v-Jun regulation by PTTG</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-10-577-5"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic diagram of PTTG's role in different pathways</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-10-577-6"/></fig><p>The present study also showed the down-regulation of another leucine zipper-bearing transcriptional factor, v-Maf, by 4-fold in microarray data, which is consistent with qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The recent findings also suggest that mutated Jun, which lacks a transactivation domain, represses cell transformation not only by itself, but also by another oncogene, Maf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. From their studies, these investigators suggest that these two oncogenes share downstream targets and induce cell transformation through similar genes. Our studies showed a correlation with these findings as both of these genes down-regulated in microarray as well as in qRT-PCR. The ingenuity pathway analysis showed that members of Maf gene transcriptional factors regulate insulin gene transcription in islet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In turn, this was supported by the findings of Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], who showed that PTTG knockout mice severely impair glucose homeostasis leading to diabetes during late adulthood due to impaired beta cell proliferation. From these observations, it is evident that PTTG has its role in the cell cycle and tumorigenesis, but also is involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis.</p><p>In addition to these relations, the Ingenuity pathway analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) also showed that the oncogene v-Myc is regulated by MAPK, which in turn is regulated by c-Kit which regulates human Slug (Snail 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. It was also known that the oncogene Jun can be regulated by MAPK and ERK[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Our microarray data also showed that along with Jun and Myc, c-Kit and Slug were also down-regulated. Slug (Snail 2) is a member of the snail family of transcriptional factors, which is found to have a major role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The recent experiments on MDCK cell lines with Slug overexpression showed that this gene promotes EMT by inducing discoid domain receptor (DDR)-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Also, the studies of Vitali et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] showed that the knockout of Slug by RNAi facilitates apoptosis and inhibits invasive growth in neuroblastoma preclinical models. From these findings, it can be concluded that the overexpression of PTTG can induce apoptosis either by inducing expression of p21CIP1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] or by inducting Bcl-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>The Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes interlinked with the v-Maf regulation by PTTG</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-10-577-7"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Histone family of genes was up-regulated by PTTG overexpression</title><p>Long-term modifications in the chromatin may cause changes in gene expression and there by regulate many important cellular pathways. The fundamental unit of chromatin, nucleosome, is composed of 146 bps of genomic DNA wrapped by an octomer of the core histone proteins H2a, H2b, H3, and H4. Each class of histone proteins consists of several subtypes that are encoded by different genes. These genes show high similarity in sequence and are synthesized during the S phase of the cell cycle. The histone proteins in the nucleosome were also found to have a direct role in execution of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Histone proteins can be modified to allow DNA to unwind and permit transcriptional factor to bind and transactivate. In addition to this, some modifications to histones can inhibit transcriptional factor binding. For example gene activation can be associated with histone acetylation by histone acetyl transferase (HAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], whereas histone deacetylation by histone deacetylase (HDAC) can suppress gene expression. Also it was evident from the studies that phosphorylation of histone is associated with activation of various immediate-early genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Also the previous studies showed that methylation of arginine and lysine residues can lead to gene activation and repression respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Though we found up-regulation of these HAT and argentine methyltransferase in PTTG1 overexpressed HEK293 cells over normal/control cell line, due to high p-value (0.2 and 0.4 respectively) we did not validate them further by qRT-PCR analysis. The overexpression of PTTG in HEK 293 cells in the present study also showed up-regulation of the histone family of genes including H2bj, H1c, H2be, H2aa, H2bo, H2bh, H2bd, H2bk, H2a, H2am, H2ac, and H3D. Out of these histone genes, we have validated H2be, H1c, H2bo, and H2ac by qRT-PCR analysis. All four of these histone genes showed directional correspondence with the microarray data. The microarray and qRT-PCR analysis of H2be, H2bo, H2ac, and H1c (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) showed up-regulation of these genes in PTTG-infected cells indicating their possible role in apoptosis. The ingenuity pathway analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>) showed that H1c is a cytochrome c-releasing factor that appears in the cytoplasm in a p53-dependent manner after irradiation and activates downstream destruction programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The ingenuity pathway also showed that HIRA can bind with Histine H2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. HIRA is a homologue of two cell cycle-regulated repressors of histone gene expression in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, whose expression blocks S-phase progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Although there is not much known on the role of PTTG in histone regulation, from the available literature it is evident that the overexpression of PTTG can induce apoptosis by up-regulating histone proteins. From these observations, we can conclude that PTTG either choosing cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis or p21CIP1-induced apoptosis depends on its expression in a quantitative manner. As we have previously used the adenovirus to infect cells, which resulted in high expression of the gene, the data confirmed the induction of apoptosis. However, in the case of lipid or chemical transfection methods, which can only yield up to 70% transfection, showed the induction of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. This dual role of PTTG therefore seems to be quantitative, making exploration of this gene important for disease regulation.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>PTTG up-regulates Histone gene expressions</bold>. <bold>A</bold>: Normalized expressions of H2be, H2bo, H2ac, and Hic in negative control, GFP control, and PTTG-overexpressed HEK293 cells by microarray analysis.

Existing evidence shows that this gene is involved in cell proliferation, migration, tumor invasion, and metastasis. In addition to these tumorigenic functions, this gene plays an important role in cell division. The recent findings of PTTG in inducing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] brings forth a new role for this gene in causing apoptosis rather than inducing cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. To identify the differentially expressed genes by PTTG overexpression in HEK293 cells, we have explored the oligonucleotide-microarray and qRT-PCR techniques. Our data clearly indicate the down-regulation of v-Maf and Jun and the up-regulation of many histone genes, which may explain the pathways by which PTTG induces apoptotic genes. In addition, the fate of the cell that overexpresses PTTG to choose either a tumorigenic or an apoptotic pathway may be based on its quantity of expression, which reveals this gene as playing dual roles.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SKP performed QRT-PCR, part of data analysis and wrote the manuscript.
