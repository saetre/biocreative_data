More than 40&#x00025; of the set had regions with significant similarity to known proteins and expressed sequences. The data demonstrate that regions flanking <italic>Not</italic>I sites are less likely to form nucleosomes efficiently and resemble promoter regions. The draft human genome sequence contained 55.7&#x00025; of the <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences, Celera&#x02019;s database contained matches to 57.2&#x00025; of the clones and all public databases (including non-human and previously sequenced <italic>Not</italic>I flanks) matched 89.2&#x00025; of the <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences (identity &#x02265;90&#x00025; over at least 50 bp, data from December 2001). The data suggest that the shotgun sequencing approach used to generate the draft human genome sequence resulted in a bias against cloning and sequencing of <italic>Not</italic>I flanks. A rough estimation (based primarily on chromosomes 21 and 22) is that the human genome contains 15 000&#x02013;20 000 <italic>Not</italic>I sites, of which 6000&#x02013;9000 are unmethylated in any particular cell. The results of the study suggest that the existing tools for computational determination of CpG islands fail to identify a significant fraction of functional CpG islands, and unmethylated DNA stretches with a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides can be found even in regions with low CG content.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x9a7d210.0x9c7fa20" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession nos<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> To whom correspondence should be addressed at: Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, Box 280, 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.

Much work remains to be done to produce a complete finished sequence and progress can be best assured by a diversity of approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>). At present, one of the principal goals for genome research is a careful and systematic validation of the assembled sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c4">4</xref>). In this respect it becomes critically important to develop and to apply strategies capable of fulfilling this crucial aim. These strategies should exploit approaches independent of those used to generate the original genome sequence. Short sequences flanking the rare restriction sites, for instance <italic>Not</italic>I, might serve as a tool for validation of human genome structure.</p><p><italic>Not</italic>I linking clones contain pairs of sequences flanking a single <italic>Not</italic>I recognition site, while <italic>Not</italic>I jumping clones contain DNA sequences spanning between neighboring <italic>Not</italic>I restriction sites. Such clones were shown to be tightly associated with CpG islands and genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c6">6</xref>). The use of <italic>Not</italic>I linking and jumping clones as framework markers was proposed to define the structure of large regions of human chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c13">13</xref>). To achieve this goal, simplified procedures for the construction of <italic>Not</italic>I jumping and <italic>Not</italic>I linking libraries were developed and a number of chromosome 3-specific and other chromosome-specific and total human <italic>Not</italic>I linking libraries were prepared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c15">15</xref>).</p><p>One thousand human chromosome 3-specific <italic>Not</italic>I linking clones were partially sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c6">6</xref>). Among these, 249 unique clones were identified and 152 were carefully analyzed. To localize these clones, PCR, Southern hybridization, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and two- or three-color fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) were applied. In many cases, chromosome jumping was successfully used to resolve ambiguous mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c13">13</xref>). This <italic>Not</italic>I map was compared to the chromosome 3 map, based on yeast artificial chromosome clones and radiation hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c14">14</xref>), and significant differences in several chromosome 3 regions were noticed. Importantly, these differences included a 3p14&#x02013;p22 region with homozygous deletions and most likely containing tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c6">6</xref>). These data supported earlier notions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c15">15</xref>) that a <italic>Not</italic>I physical map can be more informative than genetic or radiation hybrid maps.</p><p>To enable a direct assessment of the value of <italic>Not</italic>I clones in genome research, high-density grids with 50 000 <italic>Not</italic>I linking clones derived from six representative <italic>Not</italic>I linking and three <italic>Not</italic>I jumping libraries were constructed. Altogether, these libraries contained nearly 100 times the total estimated number of <italic>Not</italic>I sites in the human genome. Sequencing of 20 000 <italic>Not</italic>I clones was projected to provide information linked to 10&#x02013;20&#x00025; of all human genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c9">9</xref>) and may help in the identification of new genes. Before starting a large-scale project, a pilot study to validate the proposed strategy was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c16">16</xref>). In that work 3265 unique <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences were generated. Analysis of sequences demonstrated that &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of these clones displayed significant similarity to protein and cDNA sequences. Among these unique sequences, 1868 (57.2&#x00025;) were novel sequences, not present in the EMBL or expressed sequence tag (EST) databases (similarity &#x02264;90&#x00025; over 50 bp). The work also showed tight, specific association of <italic>Not</italic>I sites with the first exons of genes. From that <italic>Not</italic>I resource several new genes have been identified, isolated and mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c22">22</xref>).</p><p>As the pilot experiments confirmed expectations, the sequencing of <italic>Not</italic>I clones was continued and &#x0223c;22 500 unique <italic>Not</italic>I sequences were generated.

Among them, 217 (0.9&#x00025;) matched genomic sequences for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 296 (1.3&#x00025;) were from Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus (EBV) and 131 (0.6&#x00025;) sequences were most probably of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. origin. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA contaminated the vector preparation and EBV B95-8 was present in the human genomic DNA (see Materials and Methods). The level of identity in these matches was at least 90&#x00025; over 100 bp. Therefore, 22 930 sequences were classified as human. However, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp.-related sequences may be a real component of the human genome, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>). A few sequences related to <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp., <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. were also detected. Therefore, these data support the suggestion that the human genome contains sequences related to different bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>). The origin of such sequences is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c29">29</xref>).</p><p>Within the human subset, 379 (1.7&#x00025;) redundant sequences were identified. Redundant sequences were defined as sequences sharing at least 99&#x00025; identity over 360 bp of their length (this safeguard was used so as not to remove unique sequences that nevertheless have partial overlap due to common repeats or localization close to <italic>Not</italic>I, <italic>Bam</italic>HI or <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction sites).</p><p>When the stringency for the identification of redundant sequences was reduced to 93&#x00025; then only 15 702 sequences were classified as unique. However, we have previously found that <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences originating from different chromosomes can have 95&#x02013;100&#x00025; identity over &#x0003e;700 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c22">22</xref>). Therefore, to exclude the possibility of removing unique flanks we defined the unique human subset to include the 22 551 sequences identified with more stringent criteria.</p><p>The sequence set covered a total of 16 213 509 bp with an average sequence length of 720 bp. After sequencing, 0.3&#x00025; (55 144 cases) of all nucleotides were reported as ambiguous (N). Comparisons between multiple sequencing reactions of the same clones indicated a sequencing accuracy of at least 98.5&#x00025; over the first 160 bp. The sequence accuracy varied among clones with a negative relation to overall CG content and fluctuated along the sequence length. The achieved sequence fidelity was appropriate for the study as a short length cut-off for matching sequences was used (see Materials and Methods).</p><p>The repeat masking procedure (see Materials and Methods) identified 7227 (32.0&#x00025;) of the <italic>Not</italic>I sequences as containing known repeats (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf428tb1">1</xref>). The repeats comprise 1 066 657 bp or 6.6&#x00025; of the 16.2 Mb total and 20&#x00025; of the total sequence from the repeat-containing clones. Comparison of these data with the draft human genome sequence revealed striking differences. All interspersed repeats occupied 44.8&#x00025; of the total human genome sequence but only 4.7&#x00025; of the <italic>Not</italic>I flanks. Alu repeats were present 6.6 times less frequently in the <italic>Not</italic>I sequences, while for LINE repeats this difference was almost 14-fold. Simple sequence repeats were also deficient in the vicinity of <italic>Not</italic>I sites (0.54 versus 3&#x00025;). On the other hand, the youngest human LINE1 elements (L1Hs) represented 0.5&#x00025; of all LINE elements in <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences compared to 0.1&#x00025; in the total human genome. L1Hs are the only inter spersed repeats that still actively transpose in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>). One possibility is that <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences are located in actively transcribed chromosomal regions and therefore are available for transposition. However, sequences surrounding <italic>Not</italic>I sites may not tolerate such insertions and thus the older inserted elements were eliminated during evolution.</p><p>To estimate the influence of repeats on the sequence analysis results, we compared masked and unmasked <italic>Not</italic>I sequences with the RefSeq nucleotide and protein databases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf428f1">1</xref>). The presence of repeats in the <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences does not impact on the analysis results with stringent comparison criteria. In fact, only under the relaxed stringency (e.g. 60&#x00025; similarity over 50 bp) do repeats influence the results dramatically. All further analyses utilized masked sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Using <italic>Not</italic>I sequences to verify the assembled human genome sequences</title><p>Several data collections have been compared against the human genome (euchromatic) assembly to estimate sequence coverage, including the RefSeq cDNA database, the set of STS markers, the set of radiation hybrid markers and randomly produced raw sequences. The public consortium estimated the draft genome sequence covered 88&#x02013;90&#x00025; (together with other public databases up to 94&#x00025;) of the genome and Celera estimated that their draft sequence contained 91&#x02013;99&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c2">2</xref>).</p><p>The inclusion of the set of <italic>Not</italic>I sequences can be used to assess the coverage of the draft sequences. Unmethylated <italic>Not</italic>I sites from the CBMI-Ral-STO cell line were anticipated to be present in the <italic>Not</italic>I clone grids, while the HTGS database contains both methylated and unmethylated <italic>Not</italic>I sites.</p><p>The draft human genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c2">2</xref>) contains a significant portion of the <italic>Not</italic>I sequence collection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf428f2">2</xref>). With stringent criteria, 55.7&#x00025; of the <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences were present in a recent public assembly of the human genome (December 2001, identity &#x02265;90&#x00025;). Inclusion of the Celera sequences identified an additional 1.5&#x00025; of <italic>Not</italic>I flanks. All public databases (EMBL &#x0002b; HTGS &#x0002b; EST) matched 89.2&#x00025; of the <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences and search stringency is important here: this number increased to 91.1&#x00025; at identity &#x02265;78&#x00025; and went down to 84.1&#x00025; at identity &#x02265;95&#x00025;. The public draft sequence contained 19 552 <italic>Not</italic>I sites (i.e. 39 104 <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences). The EMBL coverage is misleading, as the EMBL database contains more than 4500 <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences generated in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c16">16</xref>).</p><p>Comparison with the complete chromosome 21 and 22 sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c4">4</xref>) revealed several interesting features. The assembled chromosome 21 sequence contains 122 <italic>Not</italic>I sites (methylated and unmethylated). Ichikawa <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c13">13</xref>) cloned 40 <italic>Not</italic>I sites and it was sufficient to construct the complete <italic>Not</italic>I restriction map. This map contained 43 <italic>Not</italic>I fragments but, using incomplete digestion with 40 <italic>Not</italic>I clones, it was possible to order all <italic>Not</italic>I fragments. The <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequence database contains 49 <italic>Not</italic>I sites for chromosome 21 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf428tb2">2</xref>). Altogether, out of 390 possible <italic>Not</italic>I sites on chromosomes 21 and 22, the <italic>Not</italic>I database contains 168 (43&#x00025;) sites. From our data we can conclude that unmethylated <italic>Not</italic>I sites represent at least 43&#x00025;. Eighteen clones that were identified in our work (5&#x00025;) were present in public sequences with one nucleotide mismatch in the <italic>Not</italic>I site. Thus these clones either represent polymorphic <italic>Not</italic>I sites or result from sequencing errors in the public data.</p><p>Considering the redundancies in the draft genomic sequences and large differences in methylation status of <italic>Not</italic>I sites across cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c15">15</xref>) it is difficult to estimate the coverage of <italic>Not</italic>I flanks in this study. Based on the completed chromosome 21 and 22 sequences we can draw some conclusions. First, it was shown that chromosome 22 contains &#x0003e;2-fold more genes than chromosome 21, and we see the same ratio within the <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences. We have demonstrated that nearly all of the <italic>Not</italic>I clones contained genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c9">9</xref>) and suggested that 12.5&#x02013;20&#x00025; of all genes contain <italic>Not</italic>I sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c9">9</xref>). This correlates well with the number of genes on chromosomes 21 and 22 (168&#x0002f;770 &#x0003d; 22&#x00025;). Second, the two chromosomes contain 390 <italic>Not</italic>I sites. Therefore, if we assume that each <italic>Not</italic>I site is associated with a gene (in reality we have shown that sometimes two genes are located close to the same <italic>Not</italic>I site; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c30">30</xref>), then almost half of the genes contain <italic>Not</italic>I sites. This estimate appears excessive. We suggest that there are two distinct classes of <italic>Not</italic>I sites. The first group is &#x02018;live&#x02019; <italic>Not</italic>I sites that are unmethylated or, more accurately, are not always methylated. They are located in CpG islands and associated with genes. The &#x02018;dead&#x02019; <italic>Not</italic>I sites comprise the second group and they are (always) methylated and located outside functional CpG islands and genes. Further research is necessary to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Not</italic>I sequences as a tool for gene identification</title><p>More stringent parameters were applied to the gene discovery pipeline than in the pilot study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf428f3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c16">16</xref>) (see Materials and Methods). A check against the SWISSPROT and TREMBL databases indicated that 23.2&#x00025; of the total <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences were significantly similar to known proteins.</p><p>Of the 22 551 unique <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences 48.7&#x00025; were novel, as they were not previously present in the EMBL and EST databases. For these novel sequences, potential novel coding sequences were analyzed. Based on the stringent selection criteria 8.9&#x00025; of the total sequences were identified with similarity to known proteins. Among the remaining 8972 novel clone sequences, 1649 (7.3&#x00025;) sequences had identity of &#x0003e;78&#x00025; to sequences in the EMBL and EST databases and 7323 (32.5&#x00025;) clones were not similar to previously identified sequences.</p><p>Results of a sequence comparison with full-length human cDNA protein coding sequences from Unigene are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf428f4">4</xref>A. As compared to results obtained in the pilot experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c16">16</xref>) the portion with significant matches increased &#x0223c;2-fold.</p><p>The number of sequences matching 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ESTs is higher than the total number of <italic>Not</italic>I sequences that are likely to be expressed, e.g. 11.3&#x00025; &#x0002b; 33.9&#x00025; &#x0003d; 45.2&#x00025; &#x0003e; 37.1&#x00025; (for 90&#x00025; similarity; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf428f4">4</xref>B). This is because the same <italic>Not</italic>I sequence can match 5&#x02032; as well as 3&#x02032; ESTs. These data further support a previous suggestion that many of the matching &#x02018;3&#x02032; EST&#x02019; sequences are actually situated in the 5&#x02032; ends of genes that contain <italic>Not</italic>I sites in their first exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c16">16</xref>). Venter <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c2">2</xref>) extended these results for the entire genome and demonstrated a strong correlation between CpG islands and first coding exons.</p><p>To estimate how many <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences matched genes from other organisms, <italic>Not</italic>I sequences were compared to ESTs from all organisms. Several hundred additional ESTs (e.g. 661 for identity &#x02265;78&#x00025;) were similar to <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences. These <italic>Not</italic>I clones most likely represented human genes evolutionarily related to the genes from other organisms.</p><p>It is well known that CpG islands are associated with genes and their most important feature is an absence of cytosine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c5">5</xref>). The human genome sequence data cannot discriminate between methylated and unmethylated cytosines. There are several algorithms for the identification of CpG islands on the basis of primary sequence. One quantitative definition holds that CpG islands are regions of DNA &#x0003e;200 bp long with a C&#x0002b;G content of &#x0003e;50&#x00025; and a ratio of &#x02018;observed versus expected&#x02019; frequency of CG dinucleotides which exceeds 0.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c32">32</xref>). The ratio for the entire genome is approximately 0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>). According to the previous data 82&#x00025; of <italic>Not</italic>I sites are located in CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c33">33</xref>). It is important to note that these data were obtained using either computational methods or limited experimental data sets. Using the <italic>Not</italic>I cloning method only unmethylated <italic>Not</italic>I sites can be isolated. An analysis of CG content for the first 350 bp is shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf428tb3">3</xref>. Comparing these data with Lander <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>), two main features are apparent: the fraction of sequences with &#x0003e;80&#x00025; CG content is nine times higher in the <italic>Not</italic>I collection, i.e. 142 versus 22 sequences. Another striking finding is that even <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences with a CG content &#x0003c;50&#x00025; have a very high ratio of observed versus expected frequency of CG dinucleotides (0.71). This suggests that essentially all <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences generated in the study are located in CpG islands and, therefore, the computational method misses at least 8.7&#x00025; of CpG islands associated with <italic>Not</italic>I sites.</p><p>Regulatory regions, especially promoters, are negatively associated with the formation of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c28">28</xref>). A total of 142 chromosome 3-specific <italic>Not</italic>I sequences for which 1 kb flanks were available in the human genome sequence (phase 3 &#x02018;finished&#x02019; sequence) were selected for an analysis of nucleosome formation potential (NFP). Positive NFP values indicate sequences that are likely to form nucleosomes efficiently, while negative scores indicate sequences likely to have poor nucleosome stacking ability. The results demonstrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf428f5">5</xref>) that regions flanking <italic>Not</italic>I sites are less likely to form nucleosomes efficiently as their NFP values are below &#x02013;1 and therefore resemble promoter regions in this feature.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>It should be emphasized that the enormous efforts deployed on sequencing the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c2">2</xref>) are extremely important, however, there remains a critical role for verified, integrated maps. In sequencing, the short and long repeats spread throughout the genome are sources of numerous errors. These errors are difficult to identify with a shotgun strategy, but they become evident when mapping information is combined with the sequence. Furthermore, difficulties in sequence assembly caused by the existence of large families of recently duplicated genes and pseudogenes are easier to resolve using integrated maps.</p><p>In many cases, sequence and mapping information is duplicated, overlapping or contradictory. One must always keep in mind that even absolutely correct and long nucleotide sequences may be localized incorrectly along the chromosomal DNA if the appropriate accompanying mapping information is ignored. For this reason, in spite of the vast amount of information presently available, there is an urgent need to reconcile this information in a unified framework, to generate an integrated non-controversial map for each individual chromosome.</p><p>We believe that the <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences generated in this study will be helpful in verifying contig assemblies and in connecting orphan sequence contigs into a final genome assembly. <italic>Not</italic>I clones can serve as STSs that can be mapped precisely using PFGE and FISH. These flanking sequences have already been helpful in the isolation and mapping of new genes and resolving ambiguities in chromosome 3 maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c34">34</xref>). We think that the <italic>Not</italic>I clones will also be helpful as probes to close existing gaps in the draft human genome sequence and in estimating the completeness of the human genome sequence due to the independent approach used in this study. The data demonstrate that the draft human genome sequence has a strong bias against <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences, as a significant number of the human <italic>Not</italic>I sequences were not detected.</p><p>Several explanations can be offered to account for the low representation of <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences in the draft human genome sequences. We have cloned all of the <italic>Not</italic>I sites and constructed a physical map for two chromosome 3 regions containing tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c35">35</xref>; A.I.Protopopov, V.I.Kashuba, V.Zabarovska, O.Muravenko, M.I.Lerman, G.Klein and E.R.Zabarovsky, unpublished results). In the course of these studies it became apparent that large-insert vectors from these regions were unstable and sensitive to deletions and rearrangements and that the original map was erroneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c37">37</xref>; A.I.Protopopov, V.I.Kashuba, V.Zabarovska, O.Muravenko, M.I.Lerman, G.Klein and E.R.Zabarovsky, unpublished results; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x0002f;cgi-bin&#x0002f;Entrez&#x0002f;maps.cgi?org&#x0003d;hum&#x00026;chr&#x0003d;3">http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x0002f;cgi-bin&#x0002f;Entrez&#x0002f;maps.cgi?org&#x0003d;hum&#x00026;chr&#x0003d;3</ext-link>). Thus one potential explanation is that the cloning of some <italic>Not</italic>I site-containing regions may be selected against in experiments with large-insert cloning vectors. Our experience has also proven that even in small-insert plasmid vectors some human sequences are more easy to clone than others. In our procedure, we directly selected for clones containing <italic>Not</italic>I sites, while in a shotgun sequencing approach such sequences could be under-represented. An alternative explanation, based on the observation that some <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences can have 100&#x00025; identity over long DNA stretches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c22">22</xref>), is that some <italic>Not</italic>I sites were incorrectly fused in the assembly process. Furthermore, our experience demonstrates that sometimes it is very difficult to read <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences because of the extremely high CG content. During human genome assembly such sequences would be eliminated as possessing low quality data. Further experimental analysis is needed to conclusively identify the cause(s) of the bias.</p><p>The results of this work show that <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences are a rich source for identification of new genes. A difference in this study compared with the pilot experiment is the lower fraction of <italic>Not</italic>I sequences with protein similarity (23.2&#x00025; now versus 51&#x00025; in the pilot study), resulting from more stringent analysis criteria. The comparatively high level of sequence errors (1.5&#x00025; for the first 160 bp) is likely to be a consequence of the CG-rich stretches of DNA. In some cases CG content exceeded 95&#x00025; over 100 bp. However, the sequencing accuracy does not affect the main results of the study, as short matches were used for searches. Moreover, lower stringency criteria for searches (25&#x00025; for proteins and 75&#x02013;78&#x00025; for DNA) did not significantly alter the results.</p><p>It is difficult to precisely determine the number of <italic>Not</italic>I sites in the human genome and the unmethylated portion in any particular cell type. Our rough estimation (based on chromosomes 21 and 22) is that the human genome contains 15&#x02009;000&#x02013;20 000 <italic>Not</italic>I sites, of which 6000&#x02013;9000 are unmethylated in a subset of cells.</p><p>The detection of CpG islands is difficult using only sequence data, as evidenced by existing computational methods missing a significant fraction of functional CpG islands. We conclude that unmethylated DNA stretches with a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides can be found in regions with low CG content. This conclusion is consistent with the surprising deduction made by Venter <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf428c2">2</xref>): significantly more genes than expected are located in DNA regions with low CG content. This suggests that computational identification of CpG islands will improve if more weight is placed on the ratio of observed versus expected frequency of CG dinucleotides, rather than overall CG content.</p><p>In summary, this work has demonstrated that sequences flanking <italic>Not</italic>I restriction sites can be used to complement large-scale human genome sequencing. As the organization of the human genome and that of other mammals is similar, this approach will contribute to the success of future sequencing projects.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf428f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Similarity between unmasked&#x0002f;masked <italic>Not</italic>I sequences and (<bold>A</bold>) the RefSeq nucleotide database, (<bold>B</bold>) the RefSeq protein database.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkf42801"/></fig><fig id="gkf428f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p> Fraction of <italic>Not</italic>I flanking clones present in the EMBL, EST and HTGS databases (similarity &#x02265;90&#x00025; over 50 bp).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkf42802"/></fig><fig id="gkf428f3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences general analysis scheme.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkf42803"/></fig><fig id="gkf428f4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p> Similarity between <italic>Not</italic>I and human Unigene mRNA sequences (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>Not</italic>I and expressed sequences (<bold>B</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkf42804"/></fig><fig id="gkf428f5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p> The NFP of <italic>Not</italic>I flanking sequences calculated as in Levitsky <italic>et al</italic>.
