The domains in XRCC1 have been determined, and characterization of the domain&#x02013;domain interaction in the XRCC1-&#x003b2;-Pol complex has provided information on the specificity and mechanism of binding. The domain structure of XRCC1, determined using limited proteolysis, was found to include an N-terminal domain (NTD), a central BRCT-I (breast cancer susceptibility protein-1) domain and a C-terminal BRCT-II domain. The BRCT-I<bold>&#x02013;</bold>linker&#x02013;BRCT-II C-terminal fragment and the linker&#x02013;BRCT-II C-terminal fragment were relatively stable to proteolysis suggestive of a non-random conformation of the linker. A predicted inner domain was found not to be stable to proteolysis. Using cross-linking experiments, XRCC1 was found to bind intact &#x003b2;-Pol and the &#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain. The XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> (residues 1<bold>&#x02013;</bold>183) was found to bind &#x003b2;-Pol, the &#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain and the &#x003b2;-Pol C-terminal palm-thumb (residues 140&#x02013;335), and the interaction was further localized to XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;157</sub> (residues 1&#x02013;157). The XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>-&#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain complex was stable at high salt (1 M NaCl) indicative of a hydrophobic contribution. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, polypeptides expressed from two XRCC1 constructs, which included residues 36&#x02013;355 and residues 1&#x02013;159, were found to interact with &#x003b2;-Pol, the &#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain, and the &#x003b2;-Pol C-terminal thumb-only domain polypeptides expressed from the respective &#x003b2;-Pol constructs. Neither the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;159</sub>, nor the XRCC1<sub>36&#x02013;355</sub> polypeptide was found to interact with a &#x003b2;-Pol thumbless polypeptide. A third XRCC1 polypeptide (residues 75&#x02013;212) showed no interaction with &#x003b2;-Pol. In quantitative gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> was found to bind &#x003b2;-Pol and its 31&#x000a0;kDa domain in a 1:1 complex with high affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 0.4&#x02013;2.4 &#x000b5;M). The combined results indicate a thumb-domain specific 1:1 interaction between the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;159</sub> and &#x003b2;-Pol that is of an affinity comparable to other binding interactions involving &#x003b2;-Pol.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>XRCC1 (X-ray cross-complementing group 1) is a DNA repair protein that in mammals is required for efficient repair of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation or DNA methylating agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c1">1</xref>). In cells lacking XRCC1 activity, aberrant levels of sister chromatid exchange have been observed during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c1">1</xref>). Transfection of a vector carrying the gene for human XRCC1 into hamster cell lines deficient in XRCC1 activity results in complementation and restoration of normal DNA damage repair function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c1">1</xref>). In transgenic mice, XRCC1(&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;) knockouts or DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (&#x003b2;-Pol)(&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;) knockouts are embryonic lethal, indicating an essential role for these interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c3">3</xref>).</p><p>XRCC1 has been considered a component of base excision repair (BER) (recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c4">4</xref>). XRCC1 mediates DNA repair by forming DNA repair complexes consisting of XRCC1, &#x003b2;-Pol, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP, preferentially in the ADP ribosylated form), and DNA ligase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c7">7</xref>). XRCC1 and DNA ligase III are associated <italic>in vivo</italic>, and expression of active DNA ligase III requires the co-expression of native XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c8">8</xref>). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of XRCC1 (XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>) interacts with &#x003b2;-Pol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c9">9</xref>). Additionally, the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> interacts with DNA containing a single-strand break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c9">9</xref>).</p><p>The BER pathway consists of steps that include excision of the abasic site nucleotide by the deoxyribose-5-phosphate (dRP) lyase activity that is carried by the &#x003b2;-Pol NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c11">11</xref>), single nucleotide gap-filling DNA synthesis and DNA ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c13">13</xref>). Many thousands of abasic sites are generated in cells each day by either purine hydrolysis or by a group of damage specific DNA glycosylases. Incision by AP endonuclease (APE) results in a single-strand break containing the 5&#x02032;-dRP group. The XRCC1&#x0002f;PARP complex has been described as providing a nick sensing function in BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c6">6</xref>). XRCC1 may function in &#x02018;short patch&#x02019; BER by recruiting ligation machinery to the site of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c14">14</xref>). A comparison of BER products in cell-free extracts from wild type and <italic>xrcc1</italic> mutant CHO cell lines has shown that XRCC1 may suppress strand displacement synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c5">5</xref>), or alternatively, enhance single-nucleotide insertion ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c15">15</xref>). &#x003b2;-Pol has a well-defined domain architecture first shown by limited proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c18">18</xref>) and later apparent from X-ray crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c19">19</xref>). The three-dimensional structure of &#x003b2;-Pol is formed from the C-terminal polymerase domain with fingers, palm and thumb sub-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c19">19</xref>) and the N-terminal 8 kDa DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c20">20</xref>). The three-dimensional NMR structure of the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> has been reported together with the single-strand break binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c9">9</xref>). Mapping of the &#x003b2;-Pol and DNA binding sites showed that the structure of the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> is well-suited for interaction with the inside curvature of 90&#x000b0; bent DNA and with polypeptide segments in the &#x003b2;-Pol palm and thumb in a &#x003b2;-Pol&#x02013;gapped DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c9">9</xref>).</p><p>While long-patch BER also generates single-strand breaks, it is not clear what role, if any, XRCC1 might serve in long-patch BER. In long-patch BER, 2&#x02013;13 nt are incorporated by a DNA polymerase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c21">21</xref>), and a flap endonuclease (FEN1) is required for removal of the flap structure generated by strand displacement synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c22">22</xref>). In cell-free extracts, long-patch BER is conducted by &#x003b2;-Pol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c25">25</xref>). A BER regulatory role for PARP, another XRCC1 partner, has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c26">26</xref>), and PARP may provide single-strand break recognition function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c14">14</xref>). PARP binds specifically to single-strand DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c27">27</xref>) and induces a V-like bend in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c28">28</xref>). Upon binding, PARP poly-ADP ribosylates itself and nearby proteins causing dissociation of the poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins from the damaged DNA. Whether there is a competition or cooperation of &#x003b2;-Pol and&#x0002f;or XRCC1 with PARP for damaged sites is not yet known. It has been suggested that PARP could relax the nucleosome structures and recruit the BER complex through interaction with XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c30">30</xref>).</p><p>To date, structural characterization of domains shows that XRCC1 is formed by the independently folded NTD (residues 1&#x02013;151) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c9">9</xref>) and the C-terminal BRCT-II (breast cancer susceptibility protein-1 homology C-terminal) domain (residues 538&#x02013;633) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c31">31</xref>). A central BRCT domain, BRCT-I (residues 315&#x02013;403), was predicted on the basis of sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c33">33</xref>). BRCT-II was found to interact with a C-terminal BRCT domain of DNA ligase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c34">34</xref>), and BRCT-I was found to bind to PARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c7">7</xref>). On PARP, binding was mapped to a BRCT domain of PARP, as well as to a region N-terminal to the BRCT domain. Nearly half of the XRCC1 sequence is formed by two additional segments, one unclassified segment that separates the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;151</sub> from the BRCT-I domain and a second segment that separates the BRCT domains.</p><p>In the present study, we have addressed the biochemical properties of the XRCC1&#x02013;&#x003b2;-Pol interaction in order to understand the specificity and mechanism of binding. We have characterized the XRCC1-NTD, BRCT-I and BRCT-II domains in XRCC1 by use of limited proteolysis methods. The polypeptide segment separating the NTD from BRCT-I was found not to be stable to proteolysis, while the segment separating the BRCT domains was found to be relatively stable to proteolysis. We have studied the domain specific interaction between N-terminal regions of XRCC1 and domains in &#x003b2;-Pol by <italic>in vitro</italic> cross-linking of purified components, yeast two-hybrid methods, quantitative gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium. We show evidence for a specific interaction between the &#x003b2;-Pol catalytic domain and the XRCC1-NTD with cross-linking localizing the interaction to the &#x003b2;-Pol palm&#x02013;thumb domain and a yeast two-hybrid analysis localizing the interaction to the &#x003b2;-Pol thumb. The binding affinities and stoichiometry of the interactions have been characterized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> expression plasmids and purification of proteins</title><p>Full-length XRCC1 with a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag was expressed from the plasmid pET16BXH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c14">14</xref>) kindly provided by Dr&#x000a0;Keith W.

Transformation reactions were split and added in equal amount to DO2 (media lacking Trp and Leu) and DO3 selection plates, grown at 30&#x000b0;C and photographed after 5 days. All protein interactions detected by nutrition selection were confirmed by &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays performed as described in the Matchmaker User Manual.</p></sec><sec><title>Gel filtration high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)</title><p>XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> and &#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain were mixed at 1:1 molar ratio with concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 200 &#x000b5;M.

The buffer was kept under constant helium purge to prevent DTT oxidation. Detection was performed at 280 nm. Molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) of 158, 44, 17 and 1.35&#x000a0;kDa were used to plot a standard curve of log (molecular mass) versus elution time. XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> and the 31 kDa domain migrated as an average molecular mass complex throughout the entire range of concentrations, whereas the 31&#x000a0;kDa domain alone (5&#x02013;20 &#x000b5;M) and XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> alone (12.5&#x02013;125 &#x000b5;M) migrated as monomers with apparent molecular masses (<italic>M</italic><sub>app</sub>) of 35.5 and 26 kDa, respectively. <italic>M</italic><sub>app</sub> of the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>&#x02013;&#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain complex was plotted as a function of the concentration, and the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was fitted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c38">38</xref>).

Four experiments were performed to investigate first, the self-associative behavior of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>, and second, its heterogeneous interactions with &#x003b2;-Pol and with its 8 and 31&#x000a0;kDa domains. The experiments were run simultaneously using an eight-hole rotor at a speed of 18 000 r.p.m. in a Beckman-XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. Scans were taken at 280 nm after equilibrium had been reached at two different temperatures, 4 and 20&#x000b0;C. The proteins were prepared in a 25&#x000a0;mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA buffer except for the 31 kDa &#x003b2;-Pol domain preparations for which an additional 100 mM KCl was necessary to avoid precipitation. An initial experiment in the absence of DTT from the buffer, displayed significant dimerization of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>, presumably due to formation of irreversible disulfide bonds. DTT (1.5 mM) was added to the buffer in the final experiment in order to competitively reverse such covalently formed homodimers. Two centrifuge cells were loaded with 180 &#x000b5;l columns of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> that had concentrations with observed absorbances of 0.2 and 0.3 at 280 nm.

The proteolytically obtained protein fragments were identified by sequence analysis of the first five N-terminal residues. Sequence analysis of the 16 kDa fragment indicated that the N-terminal residue was Ala311 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f1">1</xref>B). The size of the 16 kDa fragment together with the finding that another cleavage site in XRCC1 was observed between Lys436 and Thr437 to yield a 33 kDa fragment (discussed below) suggests that the C-terminus of the 16 kDa is Lys436 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f1">1</xref>B). Thus, these data indicate that the low molecular weight 16 kDa product is the proteolytically generated BRCT-I domain.</p><p>The band that migrated at ~23 kDa was found to contain two proteolytic products, that were identified as the XRCC1-NTD and the C-terminal BRCT-II domain. In the 40 min proteolysis time point the XRCC1-NTD and the C-terminal BRCT-II were in an ~2:1 molar ratio. Sequence analysis indicated that the N-terminal residue in the proteolytically generated XRCC1-NTD was Pro 2 (NTD) and the presumed C-terminal residue was Lys164 or Lys169 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f1">1</xref>B). The N-terminal residue in the proteolytically generated BRCT-II domain was Val495. Limited proteolysis of the cloned XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>, consisting of residues 1&#x02013;183, similarly yielded a 23 kDa fragment resulting from the loss of ~2 kDa (data not shown). These results for the intact XRCC1 and for the 1&#x02013;183 fragment are consistent with cleavage at Lys164 or Lys169.</p><p>Sequence analysis of the 33 kDa fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f1">1</xref>A) indicated that the N-terminal residue was Thr437. An apparent mass of 33 kDa and the N-terminal sequencing data identify this product as the linker&#x02013;BRCT-II fragment. Analysis of the 45 kDa fragment indicated that the N-terminal residue was Ala311, which corresponds to a tryptic cleavage site that is four residues N-terminal to the predicted N-terminus of BRCT-I domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c33">33</xref>). An apparent mass of 45 kDa and the N-terminal sequencing data identify this product as the BRCT-I&#x02013;linker&#x02013;BRCT-II C-terminal fragment. In addition to these products, multiple bands migrating at 55&#x02013;65 kDa are apparent at 5 and 10 min proteolysis periods. Several of these bands correspond to impurities that co-purify with the His-tagged XRCC1, and are indicative of C-terminal His-tagged fragments that have resulted from proteolytic removal of the NTD, and possible inner domain (ID) fragments, from the remainder of the protein. Accordingly, mass spectrometer analysis of XRCC1, proteolyzed for 10 min, showed four identified low molecular weight polypeptides corresponding to tryptic fragments within the predicted ID domain (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>XRCC1 sequence comparisons</title><p>There are four XRCC1 sequences in the databases, which include the sequences from human (huXRCC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c1">1</xref>), mouse (muXRCC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c40">40</xref>), hamster (haXRCC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c41">41</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (drXRCC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c43">43</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f1">1</xref>B). The three mammalian proteins have an identity of &#x0003e;80&#x00025;. The NTD (1&#x02013;151), BRCT-I (315&#x02013;403), and BRCT-II (538&#x02013;633) show &#x0003e;90&#x00025; sequence identity. The segments between the NTD and BRCT-1 and the segment between the BRCT domains consist of polar Pro, Ser and Arg&#x0002f;Lys-rich regions and are only ~60&#x00025; identical for the mammalian proteins. There are, however, two regions within these segments with &#x0003e;80&#x00025; identity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f1">1</xref>B). Residues 158&#x02013;250 (conserved region 1) have significant hydrophobicity and are predicted by PHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c37">37</xref>) to have secondary structure suggestive of folding to form an ID. This predicted domain, however, is unstable to proteolysis. Conserved region 2 (residues 469&#x02013;526) is shorter and more polar, with only one helix predicted by the PHD program and is not likely to form a folded domain.</p><p>The drXRCC1 shows limited homology to the mammalian XRCC1 sequences. It contains the NTD and BRCT-I domains with &#x0003e;40&#x00025; identity. It lacks BRCT-II and has an ~100 residue insertion between the predicted ID and BRCT-I. In addition, the predicted ID shows 27&#x00025; identity, but a BLAST search with residues 152&#x02013;250 of huXRCC1 does not independently find the weakly homologous <italic>Drosophila</italic> sequence. Homology searches for the linker regions between the BRCT domains showed conserved region 2, residues 469&#x02013;526, with 37&#x00025; identity from drXRCC1 to huXRCC1. The region 2 conservation in drXRCC1 suggests that its function is not related to BRCT-II.</p></sec><sec><title>Cross-linking analysis of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> binding to &#x003b2;-Pol and &#x003b2;-Pol domains</title><p>We performed glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments to determine whether specific domains of &#x003b2;-Pol preferentially interact with XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>. In the SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis, the 31 kDa domain of &#x003b2;-Pol was found to efficiently cross-link to XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>, as judged from the appearance and intensity of a band migrating at the expected molecular mass (~50 kDa) of the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>&#x02013;&#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain complex (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f2">2</xref>A, lanes 9&#x02013;11). No such band was observed on addition of glutaraldehyde to either of the individual proteins, further indicating that the 50 kDa band is the heterodimer. For XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> alone, incubation with glutaraldehyde under the same conditions, including the same cross-linker concentration, yielded only minor cross-linking to itself, as detected by a faint band at ~40 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f2">2</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4). Glutaraldehyde modification of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> was found to result in a second band of near equal intensity below the band corresponding to the untreated protein indicating an intramolecular cross-link. Together, these results established that a 1:1 complex of the XRCC1-NTD and the &#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain was present in the 50 kDa band, which was clearly of higher molecular mass than the molecular mass of the minor 40 kDa XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> self-crosslinked species.</p><p>XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> cross-linked efficiently to full-length &#x003b2;-Pol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f2">2</xref>B, lane 2). Higher molecular mass cross-linked species were observed for XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> cross-linking to &#x003b2;-Pol, in addition to the primary 1:1 cross-linked species. However, as shown by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation (later section), the heterodimer is the predominant species. Similarly, full-length XRCC1 cross-linked to &#x003b2;-Pol and to the &#x003b2;-Pol 31&#x000a0;kDa domain, as judged from the disappearance of the free proteins and formation of cross-linked species in the presence of glutaraldehyde (data not shown). Minor self cross-linking of XRCC1 alone was observed.</p><p>To further map the region(s) of &#x003b2;-Pol interacting with XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>, we used the 27 kDa C-terminal fragment of &#x003b2;-Pol corresponding to the palm and thumb. Nearly one-half of the 27 kDa fragment in the mixture was cross-linked to XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f2">2</xref>B, lane 6). In the control, a small amount of the &#x003b2;-Pol 27 kDa homodimer was observed that migrated close to the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>&#x02013;&#x003b2;-Pol 27 kDa heterodimer. The intensity of the crosslinked heterodimer band was significantly higher in comparison to the &#x003b2;-Pol 27 kDa homodimer in the control lane. The role of the C-terminal 27&#x000a0;kDa region of &#x003b2;-Pol in XRCC1-NTD binding was further addressed using the yeast two-hybrid screen (see below). In the &#x003b2;-Pol-XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> and the &#x003b2;-Pol 27 kDa domain&#x02013;XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> lanes, higher molecular mass cross-linked products were observed. The oligomeric cross-linked products migrated at higher masses than the self cross-linked &#x003b2;-Pol and the self cross-linked 27 kDa fragment, and this likely reflects aggregates of the heterodimeric complexes. No significant cross-linking of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> to the 8 kDa domain and the 16 kDa fragment, consisting of the 8 kDa domain and the fingers sub-domain of the 31 kDa domain, was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f2">2</xref>C, lanes 6 and 3). In controls, self cross-linking was observed with the 16 kDa fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f2">2</xref>C, lane 4). Minor self cross-linking of the &#x003b2;-Pol 8&#x000a0;kDa domain was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f2">2</xref>C, lane 7). Finally, in separate experiments, a further truncated polypeptide, XRCC1-NTD<sub>1</sub><sub>&#x02013;157</sub>, was shown to cross-link to both the &#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain and to the overexpressed and purified &#x003b2;-Pol palm&#x02013;thumb domain (data not shown).</p><p>The sensitivity of the cross-linking reaction to increasing salt concentration was studied in order to determine the nature of the interaction. The complex between XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> and the 31 kDa domain was resistant to an increase in salt concentration with little detectable change in cross-linking between 100 and 500 mM NaCl and only a slight decrease in cross-linking at 1 and 2 M NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f2">2</xref>D). The finding that the complex is stable at high salt concentrations shows that the interaction has an appreciable hydrophobic contribution. Such salt resistance is consistent with specific contacts as opposed to non-specific ionic contacts. Taken together, the cross-linking results are indicative of an interaction between XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> and the 31 kDa domain of &#x003b2;-Pol and more specifically, with the thumb and&#x0002f;or palm domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid analysis of XRCC1 N-terminal segment interaction with &#x003b2;-Pol and &#x003b2;-Pol domains</title><p>We further examined the XRCC1 interaction with &#x003b2;-Pol and &#x003b2;-Pol domains with a yeast two-hybrid screen using DNA constructs that expressed parts of the N-terminal region of XRCC1 as fusions to GAL4 BD and DNA constructs that expressed domains of &#x003b2;-Pol as fusions to GAL4 DNA AD.

In the gel filtration HPLC experiment, XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> and the &#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain, at an equimolar ratio, migrated as an average molecular mass complex throughout the concentration range tested (from 0.5 to 200 &#x000b5;M) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f4">4</xref>). The average molecular mass is due to a rapid equilibrium between the free states of the two proteins and the complex with respect to the separation time.

The <italic>M</italic><sub>app</sub> of the complex as a function of the concentration of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> and &#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain (at an equimolar ratio) was fit to a dissociation equilibrium assuming that all species present contribute to the observed molecular mass as shown in equation <bold>1</bold>. The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub>&#x02013;31 kDa domain complex in 50 mM Na-phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl was determined to be 0.43 &#x000b1; 0.05 &#x000b5;M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f4">4</xref>). The calculation of the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> assumes no dilution in the column and, therefore, represents an upper limit of the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, which could be within the range of 0.08&#x02013;0.5 &#x000b5;M. Control experiments showed that the mobility of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> did not change between 12.5 and 125 &#x000b5;M (not shown). The mobility of the 31 kDa domain of &#x003b2;-Pol (31K) did not change between 5&#x000a0;and 20&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M (not shown). 31K alone and XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> alone migrated as monomers with <italic>M</italic><sub>app</sub> of 35.5 and 26 kDa, respectively. Thus, the two proteins alone are monomeric in the concentration range used. XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> bound to full-length &#x003b2;-Pol when mixed at 20 &#x000b5;M concentrations as judged from the following observations: (i) &#x003b2;-Pol showed a greatly slowed migration indicating interaction with the column resin via the highly positively charged 8 kDa domain under the low salt conditions, and (ii) &#x003b2;-Pol and XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> together were both greatly slowed in their migration due to &#x003b2;-Pol interaction with the column resin and XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> interaction with &#x003b2;-Pol (data not shown). No apparent binding between XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> and the 8 kDa domain of &#x003b2;-Pol was seen at an 80 &#x000b5;M (i.e., 4-fold higher) concentration as judged by the following result. The 8 kDa domain showed a greatly slowed migration, while XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> migrated at its characteristic <italic>M</italic><sub>app</sub> of 26 kDa (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> binding to &#x003b2;-Pol and &#x003b2;-Pol domains</title><p>To further characterize the binding equilibria for XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> interaction with &#x003b2;-Pol and with &#x003b2;-Pol domains, we analyzed these interactions using analytical ultracentrifugation. As a first step, any possible self-association of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> alone was characterized. The addition of DTT (1.5 mM) significantly reduced the formation of irreversible dimers through disulfide bonds. Data analysis, however, indicated the presence of small amount of dimer in the solution. When the data were fitted for a monomer, it was found that the mean molecular mass of the protein species in the solution slightly exceeded the monomeric mass. The data were then fit by assuming a monomer&#x02013;dimer reversible association or by assuming the presence of two non-interacting species with molecular masses equal to and twice that of the monomer. The statistical fit was excellent in both cases and indicated the presence of ~5&#x00025; dimer. The hypothetical reversible interaction would be rather weak with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> equal to ~0.4 and 0.3 mM at temperatures 4 and 20&#x000b0; C, respectively.</p><p>The mean molecular mass of the mixture of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> with the &#x003b2;-Pol 8 kDa domain was found to lie between the two protein masses but no 1:1 heterogeneous complex of the two proteins could be detected. The best fit was achieved by assuming three non-interacting species: the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> monomer and its dimer and the 8 kDa domain of &#x003b2;-Pol. The previous finding that the 8 kDa domain of the &#x003b2;-Pol did not self-associate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c39">39</xref>) simplified the analysis.</p><p>It has recently been reported that intact &#x003b2;-Pol has the tendency to oligomerize forming oligomers of various sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c39">39</xref>). The association has been fit by a weak indefinite isodesmic association, meaning that the addition of each monomer to the oligomeric chain is energetically identical. Therefore, the protein species in the equilibrated solution could include intact &#x003b2;-Pol oligomers of all sizes, XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> monomer and dimer along with possible heterogeneous complexes. In each experiment, a heterogeneous complex of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> and &#x003b2;-Pol in a 1:1 molar ratio, was strongly present. No X<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> complex (Materials and Methods) could be detected at either temperature and inclusion of the isodesmic association of &#x003b2;-Pol or of the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> dimer in the analysis model was interchangeable with little change in the final results. The association constant for the 1:1 complex of XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> lies between 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> and 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> (i.e., <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003d; 0.3&#x02013;0.5 &#x000b5;M) at the temperatures examined, with good fits at 4&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f5">5</xref>A) and 20&#x000b0;C. This affinity is much stronger than the &#x003b2;-Pol self association or the XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> virtual association. Similar results were obtained for XRCC1-NTD with the 31 kDa domain of &#x003b2;-Pol using the same models as with intact &#x003b2;-Pol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f5">5</xref>B). As with intact &#x003b2;-Pol, there was heterogeneous association for XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> and the 31 kDa domain but the association was slightly weaker than with intact &#x003b2;-Pol. At 4&#x000b0;C the association constant was 0.15 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> or <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003d; 6.7 &#x000b5;M, and at 20&#x000b0;C the values were 0.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and 2.4 &#x000b5;M, respectively. The slight differences in the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (0.4 versus 2.4 &#x000b5;M) of the XRCC1&#x02013;31 kDa domain complex determined by gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments likely result from differences in temperatures, buffer conditions and pH in the two experiments. The results indicate binding specificity by XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> for the 31 kDa domain of &#x003b2;-Pol. The 8 kDa domain of the intact enzyme provides only a small degree of additional binding free energy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Biochemical and sequence analysis of the domain structure of XRCC1 indicated that XRCC1 is formed by an NTD (XRCC1-NTD), a central BRCT domain (BRCT-I) and a C-terminal BRCT domain (BRCT-II). A predicted fourth domain (XRCC1 ID) formed by the conserved residues 158&#x02013;250 adjacent to the NTD was found not to be stable to proteolysis. The XRCC1-NTD, with a low pI of 6.1, binds single-strand break DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c9">9</xref>). A possible role of the adjoining sequence (residues 158&#x02013;310), which includes the predicted ID, might be facilitation of DNA binding, since this segment has a high pI (10.7) and overall positive charge. In the predicted ID, a human polymorphic mutation (R194W) is seen at a conserved Arg in mammals making it of interest in terms of cancer susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c44">44</xref>). Interestingly, Arg194 (positively charged) aligns with a Trp (hydrophobic) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, while Ile195 (hydrophobic), which is conserved in mammals, aligns with a Lys (positively charged) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the region between BRCT-I and BRCT-II was found to be relatively resistant to proteolysis, suggesting that this segment of the protein is not totally flexible or exposed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f1">1</xref>A). Instead, the resistance of this segment to proteolysis, even though it contains Arg and Lys residues for tryptic cleavage, suggests that it associates with one or both of the BRCT domains of XRCC1. Approximately half of the linker segment between the BRCT domains was found to be conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to humans (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd345f1">1</xref>B). Since the BRCT-II domain is absent from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this 60 residue segment (conserved region II) may have an important role that is functionally distinct from BRCT-II. Moreover, the absence of BRCT-II in <italic>Drosophila</italic> XRCC1 may make BRCT-I a more likely candidate for association with the conserved region II. Residues 487&#x02013;500 of conserved region II were predicted using PHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c37">37</xref>) to form a helix.</p><p>Previously, the XRCC1 BRCT-II was shown to bind to the C-terminal BRCT domain of DNA ligase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c34">34</xref>). Additionally, XRCC1 BRCT-I has been shown to bind to the BRCT domain of PARP in conjunction with a region N-terminal to the PARP BRCT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c7">7</xref>). No such mapping studies have been previously reported for the interaction between the XRCC1-NTD and domains of &#x003b2;-Pol. We have found that XRCC1-NTD interacts with the C-terminal 31 kDa domain of &#x003b2;-Pol and not with the 8&#x000a0;kDa domain. The interaction has a substantial hydrophobic contribution as judged by the negligible effect of increasing salt on binding. The dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 0.4&#x02013;2.4 &#x000b5;M) of the complex formed by XRCC1-NTD and either &#x003b2;-Pol or its 31 kDa domain indicates that the interaction is physiologically relevant and is consistent with the finding that XRCC1 is co-immunoprecipitated with &#x003b2;-Pol, DNA ligase III and PARP from HeLa cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c6">6</xref>).</p><p>We have found that residues in XRCC1 that are C-terminal to Glu159 (two-hybrid screen) or Glu157 (cross-linking) were not required for &#x003b2;-Pol binding. Importantly, using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we localized the interaction of the XRCC1-NTD to the thumb of &#x003b2;-Pol. Less significant contributions by the &#x003b2;-Pol palm domain to XRCC1-NTD interaction were not ruled out. Primary thumb contacts as well as possible palm contacts are consistent with a previously proposed model for XRCC1-NTD interaction with &#x003b2;-Pol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c9">9</xref>). As predicted from the XRCC1-NTD structure, the yeast two-hybrid screen did not show an interaction between XRCC1<sub>75&#x02013;212</sub> and &#x003b2;-Pol, since the XRCC1<sub>75&#x02013;212</sub> expression fragment would be missing strands &#x003b2;ABD on the five-stranded &#x003b2;ABGDE sheet and strand &#x003b2;C on the three-stranded &#x003b2;FCH sheet, in addition to other secondary structural elements that together are required for the central &#x003b2;-sandwich fold of the XRCC1-NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c9">9</xref>). Interestingly, the XRCC1-NTD could be stripped of the N-terminal 35 residues and retain interaction with &#x003b2;-Pol when expressed as a fusion construct. The N-terminal 35 residues form an extended segment, two strands and a helix that pack on one side of the domain opposite to the side of &#x003b2;-Pol interaction. Such a deletion apparently allows the folding of the &#x003b2;-sandwich formed by the &#x003b2;BGDE (missing &#x003b2;A) and the &#x003b2;FCH sheets as well as the packing of the secondary structures that include &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3 and the &#x003b2;B&#x02032;G&#x02032; two-stranded sheet.</p><p>The XRCC1-NTD&#x02013;&#x003b2;-Pol interaction (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003d; 400 &#x000b1; 100 nM) is slightly weaker than the XRCC1-NTD interaction with duplex DNA containing a single-strand gap (half maximal binding at ~60 nM) or with a &#x003b2;-Pol single-nucleotide gap complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c9">9</xref>). The XRCC1-NTD binding affinity for &#x003b2;-Pol is approximately 100 times weaker than the binding affinity of gapped DNA for &#x003b2;-Pol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c13">13</xref>) but is comparable to the binding affinity of dNTP substrates for a &#x003b2;-Pol-gapped DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c45">45</xref>). XRCC1 is the only protein known to interact with the catalytic domain of &#x003b2;-Pol. The interaction likely involves contacts with both gapped DNA and loops in the thumb and possibly palm domains of &#x003b2;-Pol. This mechanism of interaction is supported by the results from this study. An alternate pathway for DNA repair via &#x003b2;-Pol utilizes DNA ligase I for ligation (46). Unlike the XRCC1-NTD interaction, DNA ligase I was found to interact with the 8 kDa domain and the contacts involved several charged residues on the 8 kDa domain as assessed by mutational analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c39">39</xref>). In this interaction a ligase I trimer associates with three &#x003b2;-Pol monomers to form a hexameric complex. At 32&#x000b0;C, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for &#x003b2;-Pol 8 kDa domain interaction with DNA ligase I was calculated to be ~10 &#x000b5;M. These differing interactions by XRCC1&#x0002f;DNA ligase III and DNA ligase I with &#x003b2;-Pol will likely relate to unique BER pathways but do not suggest competitive interactions with &#x003b2;-Pol.</p><p>The binding constant for the &#x003b2;-Pol&#x02013;XRCC1 complex should be considered in view of the ordered BER binding events during DNA repair and the mechanism by which XRCC1 is likely to participate. The binding constant and previous studies suggest that XRCC1 will associate with &#x003b2;-Pol <italic>in vivo</italic> and preferentially interact with &#x003b2;-Pol bound at sites of DNA damage. XRCC1 is associated with DNA ligase III <italic>in vivo</italic> through interaction between C-terminal BRCT domains on each of these proteins, and mutations in XRCC1 have been shown to decrease DNA ligase III activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. PARP interacts with the central BRCT-I domain of XRCC1. Whether PARP remains associated with XRCC1 during all steps in single-strand break repair remains to be determined. APE facilitates &#x003b2;-Pol interaction at an abasic site after incision of abasic site DNA to form a strand break, but APE does not associate with &#x003b2;-Pol in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c39">39</xref>,47). A recent structure shows the interaction of APE1 with bent DNA containing an abasic site analog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c48">48</xref>). Interestingly, like &#x003b2;-Pol, the APE is found to make contacts on the outside of the bend (i.e., the side opposite to XRCC1-NTD interaction). The DNA bend in these BER complexes is likely of importance in the ordered steps of the BER pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c49">49</xref>).</p><p>The XRCC1-NTD binds single-strand break DNA in conjunction with &#x003b2;-Pol and contributes to the overall stability of a &#x003b2;-Pol single-nucleotide gap DNA complex. The interaction of the XRCC1-NTD with the thumb is of significance, since the &#x003b2;-Pol thumb is a required domain in polymerase catalysis (functioning analogously to the fingers in the Pol I family of enzymes). Furthermore, motion of the &#x003b2;-Pol thumb with respect to the palm is likely to be important in polymerase catalysis and fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd345c50">50</xref>). Such motion during catalysis could be affected by XRCC1-NTD interaction.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd345f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Limited tryptic digestion of XRCC1.

The data points (open squares) correspond to the cells loaded with concentrations of ~9 &#x000b5;M of each protein while data points shown by stars correspond to the cells loaded with 16 &#x000b5;M of each protein. For each sample concentration, the sample and reference data curves and the fitting error plots have the same symbol. The quality of fit is excellent as can be seen in the inset, which shows the fitting errors for the two sample channels. (<bold>B</bold>) Curve fitting of transmitted light intensity data from a single centrifuge cell containing XRCC1-NTD<sub>1&#x02013;183</sub> and the &#x003b2;-Pol 31 kDa domain, in a 1:1 ratio, at 20&#x000b0;C, using the mathematical model given in equation <bold>6</bold>. The concentration for each protein was ~15 &#x000b5;M. The data points for the reference channel are shown as (open squares), and the data points for the sample channel are shown by triangles. The quality of fit is excellent as can be seen in the inset, which shows the fitting errors. The top error plot represents the sample and the bottom the reference channel. The latter was fitted using cubic splines.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkd34505"/></fig></sec><ack><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>This research was supported by a Grant GM52738 from the National Institutes of Health (to G.P.M.).</p></sec></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="gkd345c1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>L.H.</given-names></name>, Brookman,K.W., Jones,N.J., Allen,S.A. and Carrano,A.V.
