In addition, the self-renewal capacity of hNSCs is more limited than hESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007044-Palmer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. To further investigate additional similarities between hNSCs and hESCs at the transcriptional level, we analyzed the expression of key genes involved in hESC self-renewal and pluripotency utilizing semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis.

Our results showed that hNSCs express 1.4 fold higher levels of SOX2, fourfold lower levels of c-MYC, and threefold lower levels of KLF4 relative to hESC expression levels.

In addition to analyzing pluripotency gene expression in hESCs and hNSCs, we also performed our analysis on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which are also considered to have a limited differentiation potential.

Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that Oct3/4 expression in mouse NSCs was sufficient to convert them into iPS cells, suggesting this strategy might function in hNSCs. We infected 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> hNSCs with OCT3/4 retrovirus, and after multiple attempts and long incubation periods greater than two months, we did not observe any colonies. This inability to reprogram human NSCs with OCT3/4 alone might indicate possible differences between mouse and human NSCs. To rule out whether this might be due to low targeting efficiencies, we performed immunocytochemistry against OCT3/4 and observed an 80&#x00025; infection rate (data not shown), suggesting this was not an inability to deliver OCT3/4 to hNSCs.

The day after retroviral transduction, cells were grown in NSC media for four days following a change to hESC media to support iPS cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007044-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Within ten days we observed localized areas of dense cell growth and within three weeks, we observed cells that were morphologically similar to hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007044-g002">Figure 2B, C</xref>). Based on the percentage of cells that were infected with both OCT3/4 and KLF4 at 80&#x00025;, we calculated our reprogramming efficiency to be approximately 0.01&#x00025; (80 colonies from 0.8&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells infected with both OCT3/4 and KLF4), which was elevenfold less efficient than iPS induction from mouse NSCs with Oct3/4 and Klf4.

To do this, we performed bisulfite sequencing to evaluate the methylation status of these promoters in several of our iPS lines. Consistent with our earlier findings analyzing OCT3/4 and NANOG gene expression, both promoters were hypermethylated and hypomethylated in hNSCs and hESCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007044-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). All of these data highly support that iPS cells derived from hNSCs can be reprogrammed to a hESC-like state at the molecular level. This reprogramming to an ESC like state was also accompanied by an increase in proliferation as shown by flow cytometry analysis (FACS). Quantification of this data showed that hNSC-derived iPS cells were more similar to hESCs in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle than were hNSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007044.s001">Figure S1b</xref>). This increase in proliferation was not due to transformation in culture since karyotypic analysis of all iPS lines analyzed (iPS1-2) revealed a normal number of chromosomes (46XX) without gross abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007044-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Human NSC-derived iPS Cells Can Differentiate into All Three Germ Lineages <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>In vivo</italic></title><p>Pluripotent stem cells are capable of differentiating into all three germ lineages of the human body, and we thus investigated the developmental potential of our i-PS cells to determine whether they could differentiate into ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. We differentiated our iPS cells as embryoid bodies (EB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007044-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) in the presence of FBS to induce endodermal and mesodermal fates, and in the presence of retinoic acid to induce an ectodermal fate, and after ten days allowed them to adhere to tissue culture dishes. After the EBs adhered, we analyzed our cultures for different germ layer markers by immunocytochemical analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007044-g004">Figure 4</xref>, all three germ layers developed in our cultures as shown by alphafetoprotein (AFP) for endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007044-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), smooth muscle actin (SMA) and desmin for mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007044-g004">Figure 4D, E</xref>), glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and SMI31 for ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007044-g004">Figure 4G, H</xref>).

The mechanism of this two-factor reprogramming is probably largely due to the intrinsic expression of SOX2 within human NSCs, which has been shown to a major protein involved in maintaining pluripotency in hESCs. It is interesting that OCT3/4 was not sufficient to convert human NSCs into iPS cells utilizing our techniques. This could reflect intrinsic differences between mouse and human NSCs, but might still be attainable by altering some experimental parameters such as infecting more target cells, extending culturing conditions, and incubating target cells with a rho-kinase inhibitor small molecule, shown to enhance survival of human ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007044-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007044-Li1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Through extensive examination, we have shown that human NSC-derived iPS cells are phenotypically identical to hESCs by all pluripotential markers analyzed and for their ability to differentiate into all three major germ lineages.</p><p>The utilization of human NSCs as a potential source for reprogramming into iPS cells offers multiple advantages. Since the reprogramming process requires only two factors, the chance of insertional mutagenesis is minimized. Furthermore, obviating the requirement for c-MYC reduces the risk of inducing cancerous cells. In addition, since two factors are sufficient for human iPS induction from NSCs, it may be possible to substitute one or both of these factors with small molecules that activate OCT3/4 or KLF4 gene expression. Indeed, a recent report has demonstrated that the small molecule, kenpaullone could replace KLF4 in reprogramming mouse fibroblasts into iPS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007044-Lyssiotis1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. This report suggests it may be possible to reprogram human NSCs into iPS cells by OCT3/4 and kenpaullone, further minimizing the undesired effects of utilizing retroviral vectors. Another advantage of utilizing human NSCs is that they endogenously express SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC, which provides a basis to analyze the mechanism of iPS induction with two factors.</p><p>Research on induced pluripotency has been rapidly expanding providing more efficient means to generate iPS cells. Indeed, a plethora of research reports has implicated the master guardian of the genome, p53, as being a major hindrance to the iPS induction process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007044-Banito1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007044-Utikal1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. By impairing the p53 pathway on multiple levels, researchers were able to dramatically enhance the iPS cell induction up to 100 fold. By impairing the p53 pathway in hNSCs, it is probable that this will also increase the rate of IPS cell induction from these cells. In sum, human NSCs represent an invaluable source of cells to investigate human iPS induction, and also represent a potential source of cells for deriving patient-specific pluripotent stem cells for modeling human disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007044.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Multiple iPS lines show integration of both the OCT3/4 and KLF4 transgenes and progress through the cell cycle similarly to hESCs.
