Four independent ES cell clones were injected into a total of 90 blastocysts, producing 33 pups altogether. Of these, 14 were chimeric according to coat color. Two males, one each from clones 26 and 110, produced heterozygous offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000519-g004">Figure 4D, E</xref>). Heterozygotes were viable, normal looking, and fertile, producing offspring in normal Mendelian ratios when crossed with wild type animals.

For embryonic days 8.5&#x02013;10.5, we initially genotyped 82 whole animals using a Southern blot protocol to account for all animals in a litter.

However, of the 6 animals not genotyped in this group, 4 were less than half the size of siblings and were probably null. This would change the ratios to .96&#x02236;1.92&#x02236;1.04, indicating that all null embryos had implanted successfully.

Four of these genes, Psx2, Psx1(Placenta specific homeobox 2 and 1), Cx31 (Connexin 31, specific to trophoblast stem cells), and an unknown bHLH protein similar to Mash 2 are active in the trophoblast lineage in the extraembryonic tissues of the mouse. The remaining genes are either unknown, or not confined to the extraembryonic lineages. Of particular interest are two genes normally expressed in males only, but not found on the Y chromosome, Amhr2 (anti-Mullerian hormone type 2 receptor) and Ldh3 (lactate dehydrogenase 3, C chain, expressed normally in the germinal epithelium of the testis). Despite the fact that three of the null embryos were females, these genes were expressed at heightened levels.</p><p>Because of the presumed role of p66 proteins in epigenetic gene repression, we compared the mp66&#x003b1; null embryonic phenotype with published mutants in other genes implicated in this process: the DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt1, the maintenance methyltransferase, and Dnmt3a and Dnmt 3b, the de novo methyltransferases, and the histone methyltransferases G9a and SUV39H <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Sims1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. G9a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Tachibana1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> is the histone methyltransferase thought to be responsible for H3-K9 methylation in euchromatin and therefore may be involved in developmental gene regulation. SUV39H1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Peters1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> is the name for both SUV39h homologs of this histone methyltransferase known to be active in the pericentric heterochromatin and required for genome stability.</p><p>The mp66&#x003b1; null embryos were very similar to the Dnmt1 null, Dnmt3a/3b double null, and the G9a null embryos. The Dnmt1 null embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Lei1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> is distinguishable from wild type embryos at day e8.5 and by day e9.5 often has distorted neural tubes and no somites. The most advanced null embryos had no more than 8 somites. The Dnmt3a/3b double null embryos were of smaller size, had abnormal morphology at eE8.5 and e9.5, and died before e11.5. They had no somites and did not turn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Okano1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The G9a null embryos do not develop beyond the 5&#x02013;6 somite stage, representative of approximately day 8.25, though they survive until day 9.5 when they begin to die. Like mp66&#x003b1; null embryos, some G9a null embryos arrest as early as the egg cylinder and neural plate stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Tachibana1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The mp66&#x003b1; null phenotype was slightly less severe than each of these &#x02013; while the embryos died at about the same time, the mp66&#x003b1; null embryos often had 20&#x02013;30 somites. Nevertheless, the consistency of these phenotypes implicates mp66&#x003b1; in the epigenetic events that become important as differentiation begins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The NuRD/Mi2 complex, which includes p66 is found in all fetal and adult tissues and its components are expressed throughout early embryonic development from at least the 8&#x02013;16 cell stage onward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Kantor1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Because methylated DNA binding proteins or activities are capable of repressing reporter genes by recruiting histone deacetylase activity, the loss of HDAC due to loss of mp66&#x003b1; should result in a DNA methyltransferase knockout phenotype. The maintenance methyltransferase (Dnmt1)&#x02212;/&#x02212; embryo dies by the eight somite stage, around day e8.5), while the de novo Dnmt3a/3b methyltransferase double null embryo dies before e11.5, with a variety of developmental abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Li2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Okano1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with the fact that methylation and developmental gene silencing begins in earnest when the embryo implants and gastrulation begins. The death of the mp66&#x003b1;&#x02212;/&#x02212; embryo at e9.5 with variable developmental defects supports therefore a role for mp66&#x003b1; in gene silencing.</p><p>The mp66&#x003b1; null phenotype appears to be less severe than the knock-out phenotypes of two individual NuRD/Mi2 components. The MBD3 null embryo is less developed than Dnmt&#x02212;/&#x02212; embryo and the HDAC1null embryo dies prior to e9.5 with a cell proliferation defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Hendrich2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Lagger1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

These differences may be the result of non-MeCP1 functions of the NuRD/Mi2 complex. This may not be unexpected, as mammalian p66&#x003b1; has only been associated with NuRD/Mi2 in the MeCP1 context, yet MeCP1 contains only about 10&#x00025; of the NuRD in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Feng1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>On the other hand, we found that the mp66&#x003b1; phenotype is also not as severe as that due to loss of all methylation. mp66&#x003b1;&#x02212;/&#x02212; embryonic stem cells were capable of differentiating into embryoid bodies at normal rates (data not shown), while Dnmt1 homozygous mutant ES cells are reported to undergo more limited differentiation at slower rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Lei1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that if the phenotype is a result of the elimination of MeCP1activity, then MeCP1 probably mediates only a subset of the methylation-dependent repression. This might be expected because it is known that the MeCP2 and the Sin3A HDAC complex are active in the pericentromeric heterochromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Hendrich1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Nan2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

We will assume this is the mouse start site as the human and mouse genes are almost identical in all other respects.</p><p>We probed a BAC library (CITB Mouse BAC Clones, Research Genetics, Cat. No. 96022) derived from mouse strain 129/Sv and obtained 4 positive clones for mp66&#x003b1; (95E12; 412G8; 504L10; 604M1). Except for the 37 kb intron, we mapped the genomic structure using long-range PCR with primers made to the cDNA at regular intervals, and sequenced the amplimers into exon/intron boundaries when introns were detected. We identified critical sites for cloning and verified their presence in the 129/Sv genomic DNA we was using for the construct. For the long-range PCR we used the level 2 protocol of the Expand<sup>TM</sup> Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim) but scaled down to a 25 &#x000b5;L reaction volume.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Gene targeting, ES cell culture, and genotyping</title><p>We made the targeting construct by cutting a 1.4 kb short homologous arm and a 6.3 kb long homologous arm from the 129/Sv BAC clone 95E12, then used a shuttle vector to place these arms into the targeting vector, ploxPNT. The targeting vector was designed to replace exons 2&#x02013;4 of mp66&#x003b1; with a floxed pgkneo cassette. The homologous arms for the targeting construct were cut from BAC 95E12, placed into Bluescript SK-, and finally into the targeting vector ploxPNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000519-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Shalaby1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. A portion of each BAC digest was analyzed by Southern blot for identification of the correct band. The HpaII/PstI 1.4 kb short arm fragment was placed into PstI/ClaI site of BS SK- modified by the removal of the Xho1 site by SalI/XhoI digestion and religation. The BamHI/KpnI fragment was then removed and placed into the BamHI/KpnI site of ploxPNT. The EcoRI/DraI 6.3 kb long arm fragment was placed into the EcoRI/SmaI site of BS SK-. The XhoI/NotI fragment was then removed and placed into the XhoI/NotI site of ploxPNT. Internal probes and PCR assays for the short and long arms utilized the following primers: short arm: 2-24 (5&#x02032;-gcccaccatgccactcttctt-3&#x02032;), 2-25 (5&#x02032;-gtcagatgcacaggtccacaac-3&#x02032;); long arm: 2-14 (5&#x02032;-cgaggtgggcagcaggtgtct-3&#x02032;), 2-M2 (5&#x02032;-ggggacattggcgacacggataag-3&#x02032;). All junctions of the completed targeting construct were sequenced to confirm correct construction.</p><p>Gene targeting was performed on passage #15 R1 ES cells purchased from the Stanford Transgenic Research Facility. This line was developed by the Andras Nagy lab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mshri.on.ca/nagy/">http://www.mshri.on.ca/nagy/</ext-link>) in 1991 from 129/Svx129/SV-CP stock and has agouti coat color in the F1 generation. ES cells were grown in gelatinized dishes on neomycin resistant &#x003b3; irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in ES complete medium consisting of DME-H21 (UCSF#AA400) supplemented with 20&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, ES tested lot AKH12368), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (Gibco#11140-0500), 1&#x000d7; penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco #15140-122), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco#11360-070), 100 &#x000b5;M &#x003b2;-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma # M-7522), and 2000 U/mL murine LIF (ESGRO<sup>TM</sup>, Chemicon ESG1106) (Stanford Transgenic Facility protocol) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Joyner1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The targeting vector was linearized at the Not 1 site and the ES cells were transfected by electroporation. After 24 hours 0.5 mg/mL G418 (Cellgro MT61-234-RF) and 2 &#x000b5;M gancyclovir (Syntex) were added for positive and negative selection. After 7&#x02013;10 days positive colonies were picked and grown for stocks and analysis. Homologous recombinants were identified first by detection of a 2069 bp band by long range PCR (above) over the short (5&#x02032;) arm with primers 2-36 (5&#x02032;-acctggaattgaagctgtctgat-3&#x02032;) and N-6 (5&#x02032;-cgccttcttgacgagttcttctg-3&#x02032;), and then they were confirmed by Southern blot analysis of both arms. For the short arm, ES cell DNA was digested with NcoI and the blots probed with probe 11, a 550 bp fragment amplified from BAC 95E12 with primers 2-39 (5&#x02032;-tggaaggcacagttaaagggtcac-3&#x02032;) and 2-40 (5&#x02032;-ccccgaggtcaggtttcaaggtg-3&#x02032;). The wild type allele gave a 2.34 kb band while homologously recombined alleles gave a 2.80 kb band. For the long arm, DNA was digested with SpeI and SacI, then probed with probe 9, a 535 bp fragment amplified from BAC 95E12 with primers 2-41 (5&#x02032;-ggtagcatcccatagtcccaggtt-3&#x02032;) and 2-42 (5&#x02032;-atgtggctgattgggggatgg-3&#x02032;). The wild type gene gave an 8.72 kb band, while homologous recombinants gave a 7.63 kb band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000519-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>After southern blot confirmation of homologous recombination in cell and animal lines, a PCR genotyping protocol was developed utilizing primers 2-30 (5&#x02032;-agacttgagtgtgcagggttgagg-3&#x02032;), 2-32 (5&#x02032;-gccgggtattcgagtggaggaggt-3&#x02032;), 2-Q (5&#x02032;-aatcacatcaggcgagggaggtct-3&#x02032;), and N-5 (5&#x02032;-ttggctacccgtgatattgctgaa-3&#x02032;). N-5 is found only in the pgk-neo cassette while 2-Q is only in the targeted region; primers 2-30 and 2-32 flank the targeted region. A 25 &#x000b5;L PCR reaction consisting of 0.4 &#x000b5;M primer 2-30, 0.2 &#x000b5;M each remaining primer, 0.8 mM dNTPs, 1.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Cat.M2861), 1&#x000d7; Mg-free supplied PCR buffer, 4.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 &#x000b5;L template, and H<sub>2</sub>O to volume, was cycled as follows: 1 cycle: 94&#x000b0;C, 2 min; 30 cycles: 94&#x000b0;C, 1 min, 61&#x000b0;C, 1 min, 72&#x000b0;C, 1 min; 1 cycle: 72&#x000b0;C, 5 min. Primers 2-30 and N-5 gave an 835 mutant band; primers 2-30 and 2-Q gave a 632 bp wild type band; primers 2-30 and 2-32 gave a 322 bp &#x00394; mutant band and a 2000 bp wild type band.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Generation and breeding of mice</title><p>Correctly targeted ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastyocysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000519-Hogan1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> at the Stanford Transgenic Research Facility. Chimeric pups were identified by mixed black and agouti coat color and were crossed with C57BL/6 females at 6 weeks of age. The chimeras with the highest percentage of 129/Sv agouti color all developed teratocarcinomas (3) or were sterile (3). Three more were non-transmitters, and three were female. Agouti pup tail DNA was genotyped initially by Southern blot (above) but once the mutation was confirmed in both lines 110 and 26, a PCR protocol was used. The phenotype was analyzed for the most part on a mixed C57BL/6X129/Sv background in which there was no more than 75&#x00025; of one of the strains. However, we did obtain a few 100&#x00025; 129/Sv pups for both lines by crossing the proven chimeras with 129/Sv females.</p><p>We wanted to eliminate possible confounding effects of the pgk promoter on neighboring genes. To do this, we crossed the heterozygous mp66&#x003b1; females to a CMVCre recombinase male to produce offspring mosaic for the pgkneo deletion. These were then crossed to wild type animals to obtain pure &#x00394;pgk mp66&#x003b1; lines for both lines 26 and 110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000519-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). These results were on animals with a mixed 129/Sv X C57Bl/6 background. It was possible that variability would be reduced on an isogenic background. We crossed the chimeras with 129/Sv females and obtained 100&#x00025; 129/Sv heterozygotes. Although fertility was poor in these lines, we were able to confirm the phenotype in a few (6) embryos on the 100&#x00025; background. In this case the variability ranged from abnormal looking neural folds at e8.5 to embryos that did not turn at e9.5.</p><p>To remove the floxed pgk-neo cassette, we crossed heterozygous mp66&#x003b1; females of both lines, 110 and 26, to a CMV-Cre male on a C57BL/129/SV background. Offspring receiving the CMV-Cre transgene were mosaic for the deletion so these were crossed again to wild type to produce pure &#x00394;mp66&#x003b1; lines on a mixed background. The &#x00394;mp66&#x003b1;110 and &#x00394;mp66&#x003b1;26 lines were then maintained in the heterozygous condition on a mixed background as stock.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Microarray analysis</title><p>Because aberrant RNA is produced in the null animals, we could genotype the embryonic RNA using RT-PCR. Individual RNA from three litters was examined and genotyped for quality and mp66&#x003b1; genotype. Extraembryonic membranes were included with each embryo. Four sibling pairs were chosen from the three litters for microarray analysis. An Affymetrix protocol was used so that each embryo produced an individual set of expression data that could be compared as desired, and all sample pairs were prepared simultaneously. Sex was determined by examining the expression data. Two pairs were entirely female while two other pairs were mixed. The data for each pair was examined in parallel for each gene and genes were not listed unless they were above a for at least three of the four pairs. There was one male each of null and wild type, so these were compared to each other also. The wild type male and wild type females were compared to confirm known male/female differences and to include them in interpretation. In all cases examined for known genes, the results were sex appropriate.</p><p>PolyA-RNA was then isolated using the spin column protocol of the Oligotex mRNA midi kit (Qiagen). For microarray analysis, the RNA was quantitated in a Beckman DU530 spectrophotometer and labeled cDNA was made using the Cyscribe labeling kit. The lab reference RNA, (1/4 four-week whole brain : 3/4 e 12.5 complete embryo), was labeled with Cy3 and the ES cell RNA was labeled with Cy5. 0.25 M NaOH was added to degrade RNA during a 15 minute 37&#x000b0;C incubation, then 0.7 M HEPES free acid was added to neutralize. Final purification was carried out with the CyScribe GFX Purification Kit. Absorbance at 550 nm(Cy3) and 650 nm (Cy5) was determined to quantitate incorporation of label, so that equimolar amounts of Cy3 and Cy5 could be used for hybridization. Mouse microarrays were purchased from the SFGF facility, and were stabilized, immobilized, and pre-hybridized as follows. Slides were etched in one corner to identify side of slide printed with the array, and then rehydrated, array side down, over 45&#x000b0;C 1&#x000d7; SSC, then snap-dried on a 100&#x000b0;C surface until the vapor disappeared, then UV cross-linked at 65 mJoules. To prehybridize, arrays were incubated with 50&#x00025; formamide, 3&#x000d7; SSC, 0.1&#x00025;SDS, 0.1 mg/mL BSA for 45 minutes at 42&#x000b0;C, immersed in milliQ water to remove SDS, and dried by centrifugation at 600 rpm for 2 minutes.</p><p>For hybridization, 40 pmol of reference and ES cell DNA were mixed, 20 ug each of mouse Cot1 DNA, polyA RNA, and tRNA were added, and the sample was concentrated to 28 &#x000b5;L in a foil covered speed-vac. 6 &#x000b5;L 20&#x000d7; SSC and 0.5 &#x000b5;L 20&#x00025; SDS were added, samples were denatured at 100&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes, and then spun at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge for 15 minutes. The mixture was then pipetted onto the microarray slide and covered. Hybridization was carried out in a Gene Machines HybChamber<sup>TM</sup> humidified with 3&#x000d7; SSC and submersed in a 65&#x000b0;C water bath for 14&#x02013;18 hours. The slides were then washed in foil covered slide dishes as follows: 2&#x000d7; SSC, 0.2&#x00025; SDS at 55&#x000b0;C, 10 minutes, removing cover slips when immersed; 1&#x000d7; SSC. 0.2&#x00025; SDS at 55&#x000b0;C, 10 minutes; 0.1&#x000d7; SSC, 0.2&#x00025; SDS at RT, 10 minutes; 0.1&#x000d7; SSC at RT, 10 minutes; distilled water for 10 seconds followed immediately by centrifugation drying as above. The slides were then immediately scanned with a GenePix scanner with photomultiplier tube voltages in each channel adjusted to a ratio of between 0.8&#x02013;1.2. Images were then gridded and flagged using the GenePix Pro 4.0 Software, then sent to the Stanford Microarray Database.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Charlene Kon, Derk ten Berge and
