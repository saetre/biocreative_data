In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, whereas TGF-&#x003b2;&#x0002f;activin&#x0002f;Nodal signals have been implicated in meso-endoderm formation and dorsal mesoderm patterning, BMP (BMP2&#x0002f;4&#x0002f;7) has been shown to be a key regulator in the ventral mesoderm patterning, tail formation and ectodermal cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c3">3</xref>). Dorsal&#x02013;ventral and neural&#x02013;epidermal cell fates are determined by the gradient of BMP activity that is established by the negative signal from the Spemann&#x02019;s organizer.</p><p>These distinct biological effects of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily are exerted by the transcriptional regulation of target genes in a cell-type-specific manner. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the BMP signaling activates homeobox genes, <italic>Xvent-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c5">5</xref>), <italic>Xvent-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c10">10</xref>) and <italic>Msx-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c12">12</xref>) and erythroid transcription factors, <italic>GATA-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c13">13</xref>) and <italic>GATA-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c14">14</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Xenopus</italic> homeobox gene <italic>goosecoid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c16">16</xref>), <italic>Mix.2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c18">18</xref>) and <italic>Xnr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c19">19</xref>) are activated by activin&#x0002f;Nodal signals. These TGF-&#x003b2; signals from the cell surface to the nucleus are mediated through two different types of serine&#x0002f;threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II, and intracellular transducer Smad proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c21">21</xref>). Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 are involved in BMP-related signals, and Smad2 and Smad3 are involved in TGF-&#x003b2;&#x0002f;activin&#x0002f;Nodal-related signals. In addition, a common partner Smad (Co-Smad), Smad4, is required for the Smad&#x02019;s complex formation with receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) and transcriptional activation.</p><p>Our understanding of the basic principles of the molecular mechanism by which Smads activate their target genes has been accomplished mainly through the identification and characterization of TGF-&#x003b2;&#x0002f;activin target genes. The responsive regions of TGF-&#x003b2;&#x0002f;activin target genes contain Smad binding elements (SBEs), consisting of a consensus sequence of CAGAC (or minimally AGAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c23">23</xref>). But Smad binding to SBEs is very weak and lacks selectivity, therefore requiring additional DNA-binding factors for high-affinity, specific recruitment of the Smad complex to a distinct target promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c24">24</xref>). The FAST family and Mix family (Mixer and Milk) have been characterized to be such DNA-binding factors, recruiting Smad2&#x02013;Smad4 complexes to the activin responsive element of the <italic>Mix.2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c27">27</xref>), mouse <italic>goosecoid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c28">28</xref>) and <italic>Xenopus goosecoid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c29">29</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Little progress, however, had been made on the BMP responsive genes until recent characterization of <italic>Xvent2</italic> promoter regions. The <italic>Xvent2</italic> family is a direct target of BMP signaling and mimics the expression patterns and the ventralizing effects of BMP-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c10">10</xref>). Analysis of the <italic>Xvent2</italic> promoter identified the BMP response element (BRE), which contains the SBEs for Smad1&#x0002f;Smad4 binding and the 3&#x02032; flanking box (3&#x02032; box) for Olf-1&#x0002f;EBF associated zinc finger (OAZ) binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c31">31</xref>). The Smad1&#x0002f;Smad4&#x0002f;OAZ complex is required for the cooperative binding to the BRE and subsequent activation of the <italic>Xvent2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c31">31</xref>). It is therefore suggested that the cooperative interaction of the Smads and a DNA-binding cofactor is a conserved mechanism in both BMP and TGF-&#x003b2;&#x0002f;activin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c32">32</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c33">33</xref>), we isolated and added <italic>Xretpos</italic> to the limited pool of BMP-4 target genes. <italic>Xretpos</italic> is a novel family of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, whose transcripts are restricted to ventro-posterior-specific regions and induced by BMP-4 signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c33">33</xref>). In this report, we have analyzed the <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter region responsible for its spatial and temporal expression. The <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter contains multiple SBEs and an OAZ binding site similar to the BRE of the <italic>Xvent2</italic> promoter. We further demonstrated that Smads and OAZ proteins bind to their response elements and these bindings are essential for the BMP-4-induced activation of the <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter. Furthermore, the presence of endogenous Xretpos protein in the embryos and overexpression and partial loss-of-function study revealed that Xretpos has a posterio-ventralizing activity.

As a first step to understand the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation of <italic>Xretpos</italic>, we identified and characterized the <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter. Since promoter activities of most retrovirus and retrotransposons were shown to be present in the LTRs and 5&#x02032;-UTR, we generated the full-sized <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter, pGL2-<italic>Xretpos (LTR-UTR)</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f1">1</xref>A, top) and measured the promoter activity of this construct (or the promoterless vector pGL2-<italic>enhancer</italic>) during the early <italic>Xenopus</italic> development. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f1">1</xref>A, the luciferase activity was detected after midblastula transition, increased during neurulation and declined afterwards, consistent with the result of a developmental northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c33">33</xref>). No significant luciferase activity was observed in pGL2- <italic>enhancer</italic>-injected embryos.</p><p>Next, the ability of the promoter sequences to drive the regional specific expression was examined using p<italic>Xretpos-GFP</italic>, in which LTRs and 5&#x02032;-UTR were inserted upstream of GFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f1">1</xref>B, top). Four-cell stage embryos were injected into all the blastomeres with a total of 100 pg of reporter DNA, and GFP expression was analyzed and compared with the endogenous <italic>Xretpos</italic> expression by whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. The expression pattern of p<italic>Xretpos-GFP</italic> was localized to the marginal zone at the gastrula stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f1">1</xref>B, reporter-<italic>Xretpos</italic>), enriched in the dorsal-posterior region around blastopore, but was absent from the future head structure (data not shown).

This expression pattern was specific to <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter sequences, because the <italic>goosecoid</italic> promoter directed organizer-specific mosaic expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f1">1</xref>B, reporter-<italic>gsc</italic>). These results indicate that the <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the LTRs and 5&#x02032;-UTR are sufficient for the stage- and tissue-specific expression of <italic>Xretpos</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter is composed of multiple regulatory elements</title><p>To delineate the regions in the <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter that are important for the transcriptional regulation, we constructed various deletion mutants and compared their luciferase activities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f2">2</xref>).

The deletion analysis showed that the U3 region, in which a putative TATA box and CAAT motif are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c33">33</xref>), provides basal promoter activity since promoter activity was totally abolished by removing the U3 region &#x0005b;compare pGL2-<italic>Xretpos (LTR-UTR)</italic> and pGL2-<italic>Xretpos (R-U5-UTR)</italic>&#x0005d;. We also assume that 110 bp of the 5&#x02032; R region and UTR contains a positive regulatory element since promoter activities were considerably (&#x0223c;5- and 2-fold, respectively) reduced by removing these regions &#x0005b;compare pGL2-<italic>Xretpos (U3-R111)</italic> and pGL2-<italic>Xretpos (U3)</italic>, and pGL2-<italic>Xretpos (LTR-UTR)</italic> and pGL2-<italic>Xretpos (LTR)</italic>&#x0005d;. In addition to the positive regulatory elements, a negative regulatory element was defined in the 3&#x02032; R region and U5 region since elimination of these regions was found to permit &#x0223c;11-fold greater basal luciferase activity &#x0005b;compare pGL2-<italic>Xretpos (LTR-UTR)</italic> and pGL2-<italic>Xretpos (U3-R111)</italic>&#x0005d;. This may be due to a repressive effect of the 3&#x02032; R region and U5 region on transcription or translation. A similar repressive effect of sequences in the U5 region was described for other retroelements such as bovine immunodefienciency virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c37">37</xref>), human foamy virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c38">38</xref>) and HERV-K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c39">39</xref>).

CAGAC (or minimally AGAC) sequences are known to be optimal SBEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c23">23</xref>) and are found in the responsive regions of several TGF-&#x003b2;, activin or BMP target genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f3">3</xref>B). After sequence comparison between <italic>Xretpos</italic> and <italic>Xvents</italic> promoters, we further observed that SBE II constitutes a region (BRE-like) of similarity to the <italic>Xvents</italic> BRE which is composed of an SBE and 3&#x02032; box (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f3">3</xref>A and C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Smad proteins bind directly to SBEs</title><p>The presence of SBEs in the <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter suggests the possible binding of Smads to <italic>Xretpos</italic> SBEs. We performed EMSAs with a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) probe encompassing SBEs and bacterially expressed full-length Smad1, Smad3 and Smad4. As for SBE I, a 207 bp dsDNA probe (U3:1&#x02013;207) containing SBE I was used as a substrate for EMSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f4">4</xref>A). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f4">4</xref>B, Smad4 was capable of binding to this region in a concentration-dependent manner (lanes 1&#x02013;3). However, Smad1 and Smad3 had no detectable binding (lanes 6&#x02013;12). The addition of excess (100&#x000d7;), unlabeled wild-type probe reduced Smad4 binding (lane 4), indicating the specificity of binding. In contrast, mt SBE I, in which consensus CAGAC SBE was entirely mutated by the linker-substitution method did not effectively compete for Smad4 binding, suggesting that SBE I is required for Smad4 binding (compare lanes 4 and 5).</p><p>For the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding study with SBE III, we applied a 31 bp oligonucleotide duplex that encompasses SBE III (31 bp SBE III; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f4">4</xref>A). We observed concentration-dependent DNA&#x02013;protein complex formation with Smad1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f4">4</xref>C, lanes 6 and 7), but Smad4 and Smad3 resulted in low-level binding activity (lanes 1&#x02013;3 and 10&#x02013;12). The binding was SBE III sequence-dependent since mt SBE III inhibited the binding less effectively than the wild-type competitor in competition experiments (compare lanes 8 and 9).</p><p>To determine the binding profile of the <italic>Xretpos</italic> BRE-like region, we constructed a 33 bp oligonucleotide duplex which encodes SBE II and the 3&#x02032; box (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f5">5</xref>A). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f5">5</xref>B shows that Smad1 bound this fragment much stronger than Smad4 and Smad3. In competition EMSA, point mutations introduced into SBE II, 3&#x02032; box or both elements resulted in less effective competition than with the unlabeled wild-type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f5">5</xref>B, compare lanes 4&#x02013;7), suggesting that these two elements are necessary for optimal binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Smad1 binding is mediated by a GCAT motif</title><p>Further EMSA with Smads identified the other Smad1 binding region in the UTR of the <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f5">5</xref>C). Smad1 bound to this region in a concentration-dependent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f5">5</xref>C, compare lanes 1&#x02013;3) and sequence-specific manner (compare lane 3 and 4) but Smad4 binding to this region was very weakly detectable (lanes 6&#x02013;9). The identified UTR contains two tandem copies of GCAT sequences flanked by AT-rich sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f5">5</xref>A). It is of note that the same GCAT sequence and flanking AT-rich regions were identified and characterized as critical for Smad1 binding in the <italic>Xvent-2B</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c30">30</xref>). We performed competition EMSA with mt GCAT in which two tandem GCAT motifs were linker-substitution mutated and found that competition by mt GCAT was not effective as compared with the wild-type competitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f5">5</xref>C, compare lanes 4 and 5). These results suggest that Smad1 binding to the <italic>Xretpos</italic> UTR is dependent on GCAT sequence.</p><p>In the above competition EMSA, it is of note that the Smad binding was not only in competition with wild-type probe but also with mutant probes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f4">4</xref>C, lanes 8 and 9; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f5">5</xref>B, lanes 4&#x02013;7; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f5">5</xref>C, lanes 4 and 5). This suggests that other core sequences or flanking sequences outside the core SBE that were not mutated within the probes are also important for binding. Nevertheless, it is obvious that mutant probes were less effective competitors than wild-type probes in all competition EMSAs and this observation was further supported by the independent EMSA in which Smad binding to mutant probes &#x0005b;mt SBE II, mt 3&#x02032; box and mt (SBE II-3&#x02032; box)&#x0005d; was clearly shown to be less efficient than to the wild-type probe (BRE-like) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>OAZ, Smad1 and Smad4 isolated from the embryos bind to the BRE-like region</title><p>The <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter contains an <italic>Xvent-2</italic> BRE-like region consisting of a CAGAC SBE and 3&#x02032; box, which work as binding sites for Smads and OAZ, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c31">31</xref>). To examine whether OAZ can indeed bind to the <italic>Xretpos</italic> BRE-like region, an EMSA was performed with 33 bp BRE-like oligonucleotide duplex and nuclear extracts prepared from stage 13 embryos injected with 6Myc-OAZ-ZF(9&#x02013;19) RNA. Nuclear extracts were used as a protein substrate for EMSA because most OAZ proteins were localized in nuclear fractions as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f6">6</xref>C. Zinc finger 9&#x02013;19 of human OAZ &#x0005b;OAZ-ZF(9&#x02013;19)&#x0005d; was used because it contains sufficient functional domains for BRE binding and Smad1 interaction and mimics the full-length human OAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c31">31</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f6">6</xref>A, we could identify the induction of a DNA&#x02013;protein complex. This complex was also present at a low level in the reaction from the uninjected control extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f6">6</xref>A, compare lanes 2 and 4) and was competed by unlabeled probe in both reactions (lanes 3 and 6). The specificity of OAZ in the binding was confirmed by the disappearance of the complex by incubation with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f6">6</xref>A, compare lanes 4 and 5).</p><p>We next tested whether Smad1 and Smad4, which were expressed and isolated from the embryo, also interact with the <italic>Xretpos</italic> BRE-like region, by EMSA using nuclear extracts from stage 13 embryos in which Flag-Smad1 or 6Myc-Smad4 were overexpressed. As with bacterially expressed Smads, a specific DNA&#x02013;protein complex was formed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f6">6</xref>B). The incubation with a respective anti-epitope antibody also disrupted the complex (compare lanes 8 and 9, and lanes 11 and 12), indicating the specificity of Smads in the complex. The nuclear localization of epitope-tagged OAZ and Smads was visualized by western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f6">6</xref>C). The presence of a single DNA&#x02013;protein complex which is specific against competitor and antibody incubation suggests that the OAZ, Smad1 and Smad4 are components of the <italic>Xretpos</italic> BRE-binding complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Smads and OAZ binding to their response element are essential for the BMP-4-induced activation of <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter</title><p>Having demonstrated that Smads and OAZ were capable of binding to the specific binding sites in the <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter, we next examined the functional role of Smads and OAZ in the <italic>Xretpos</italic> regulation by BMP-4. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f7">7</xref>A, Smad1&#x0002f;Smad4 and OAZ functionally cooperated in BMP-4-induced activation of the <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter. To further confirm the requirement of OAZ in BMP-4-induced activation of <italic>Xretpos</italic>, we used a dominant-negative OAZ mutant &#x0005b;OAZ-ZF(1&#x02013;13)&#x0005d;. This mutant contains zinc finger domains responsible for BRE binding but lacks a Smad1 binding domain, therefore working in a dominant negative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c31">31</xref>). Overexpression of the dominant-negative OAZ mutant reduced the OAZ-ZF(9&#x02013;19)-induced <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f7">7</xref>B).</p><p>To examine the importance of SBE II, 3&#x02032; box and GCAT motif in BMP-4-induced activation of <italic>Xretpos</italic>, we introduced linker-substitution mutations into these sites and analyzed the functional consequences. In contrast to the potent activation of the wild-type reporter construct by BMP-4&#x0002f;Smad1&#x0002f;Smad4, luciferase activities were considerably reduced in all three mutant constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f7">7</xref>C), suggesting that all these sites are important. Together, these results suggest that the binding of Smads and OAZ to their response elements is essential for the BMP-4-induced activation of <italic>Xretpos</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Xretpos protein expression was temporally regulated and BMP-4 inducible</title><p>Together with the ventro-posterior expression and BMP-4-induction of <italic>Xretpos</italic> in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c33">33</xref>), the above results from the <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter study indicate that <italic>Xretpos</italic> is a downstream target gene in BMP-4 signaling and suggest a potential role in embryonic development. Since <italic>Xretpos</italic> is a family of LTR-retrotransposon-like elements, we first tested whether Xretpos protein is indeed synthesized in the embryo. Anti-Xretpos polyclonal antibody was obtained by using bacterially expressed His<sub>6</sub>-Xretpos (amino acids 1&#x02013;272) fusion proteins as an antigen and applied for western blot analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f8">8</xref>A, a single band of the predicted size for the endogenous Xretpos, as well as an antigen (lane 1), was detected in embryo extracts, and antibody staining was temporally regulated during the early development. Moreover, Xretpos protein was activated by BMP-4 and restricted only to the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f8">8</xref>B). This temporal regulation and BMP-4 induction of Xretpos protein clearly correlates with the expression pattern of <italic>Xretpos</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c33">33</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Xretpos has a posterio-ventralizing activity</title><p>Next we investigated the potential embryonic activity of <italic>Xretpos</italic> in early development by microinjection experiment. We injected 4 ng of <italic>Xretpos</italic> RNA into dorsal animal or marginal regions at the four-cell stage embryos and assessed the resulting phenotype. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f9">9</xref>A, we obtained posterio-ventralized embryos with reduced anterior head structures and no eyes &#x0005b;27&#x00025;, dorso-anterior index (DAI) &#x0003d; 0&#x02013;2, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 88&#x0005d;. Control injection of <italic>preprolactin</italic> (<italic>PPL</italic>) RNA with the same concentration had no effect on development.</p><p>Posterio-ventralizing activity of <italic>Xretpos</italic> was further assessed by the partial loss-of-function experiments by antisense <italic>Xretpos</italic> RNA injection. First, we tested whether antisense <italic>Xretpos</italic> RNA was able to rescue axis structures in UV-ventralized embryos. <italic>Xenopus</italic> zygotes were UV-irradiated and two non-adjacent blastomeres were injected with antisense <italic>Xretpos</italic> RNA (1 ng&#x0002f;blastomere) at the four-cell stage. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f9">9</xref>B, these embryos produced partial twinned axes with high frequency (65&#x00025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 23), whereas uninjected, UV-treated control embryos were strongly ventralized (average DAI &#x0003d; 0.9, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 38). The induction of twinned axes in the embryos injected into two opposing sites at the four-cell stage may exclude the possibility that these embryos escaped the UV irradiation. We next analyzed the phenotypic effects of loss of <italic>Xretpos</italic> function in the wild-type <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo. When the wild-type four-cell stage embryos were diagonally injected with antisense <italic>Xretpos</italic> RNA (1 ng&#x0002f;blastomere), antero-dorsalized embryos were produced (32&#x00025;; DAI &#x0003d; 6&#x02013;8, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 38), whereas uninjected control embryos developed normally (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f9">9</xref>C). These antero-dorsalized embryos resembled LiCl-treated embryos with a DAI of 7&#x02013;8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c44">44</xref>) or embryos in which <italic>BMP-4</italic> function was partially blocked by antisense <italic>BMP-4</italic> RNA injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c45">45</xref>). We found that antisense <italic>Xretpos</italic> RNA injection indeed reduced the amount of Xretpos protein to &#x0223c;60&#x00025; of wild-type levels in embryo extracts in western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f9">9</xref>D). Together, these results strongly demonstrate an antero-dorsalizing activity of antisense <italic>Xretpos</italic> RNA, and in turn support the evidence that <italic>Xretpos</italic> indeed has a posterio-ventralizing activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study describes <italic>Xretpos</italic> as a novel BMP-4 downstream gene with posterio-ventralizing activity, whose activation by BMP-4 is mediated by the association between Smads&#x0002f;OAZ and their consensus binding sites in the <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter. <italic>Xretpos</italic> was previously identified as a novel LTR-retrotransposon-like element in <italic>X.laevis</italic> and it was shown that its transcripts are restricted to ventro-posterior-specific regions and induced by BMP-4 overexpression in animal cap and whole embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c33">33</xref>). In this paper, we studied <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter regions consisting of LTRs and 5&#x02032;-UTR in order to understand the mechanism of transcriptional activation of <italic>Xretpos</italic> by BMP-4. We showed, through luciferase assay and whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization detection of reporter constructs, that this <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter was sufficient to provide the stage- and tissue-specific expression of <italic>Xretpos</italic> during early <italic>Xenopus</italic> development. The <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter contained three copies of consensus SBEs (SBE I&#x02013;III) and a BRE-like region that is composed of SBE II and 3&#x02032; box and similar to the <italic>Xvents</italic> BRE. Additionally, we demonstrated that Smads and OAZ proteins actually bind to these sites and cooperatively activate the transcription. Mutations in the consensus sites of the SBE and 3&#x02032; box motif abolished the BMP-4-induced activation of <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter. These findings support the idea that the assembly of OAZ and BMP-activated Smads to promoters containing the Smad&#x0002f;OAZ consensus BRE would be the conserved mechanisms for BMP target gene activation.</p><p>Independent study on <italic>Xvent2</italic> promoter by Henningfeld <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c30">30</xref>) identified a novel Smad1 binding site consisting of GCAT and flanking AT-rich sequences and showed that this site is required for full transcriptional activation. The similar GCAT motif containing two tandem copies of GCAT sequence and flanking AT-rich sequences were found in the <italic>Xretpos</italic> UTR. Through competition EMSA and mutational luciferase assay, this motif was shown to be required for Smad1 binding and promoter activation. The importance of flanking AT-rich sequences in this motif in Smad1 binding was shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c30">30</xref>) and further confirmed when a probe containing only the GCAT sequence without flanking AT-rich sequences present in the U3 region could not be bound by Smad1 (data not shown). Therefore, the GCAT motif may be the conserved <italic>cis</italic>-element responsible for Smad1 binding and activity.</p><p>The <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter contains three putative CAGAC SBEs, which showed differential affinity and specificity for Smads. Through EMSA with bacterially purified Smads, it was shown that Smad1 strongly bound to SBE II and SBE III but did not bind to SBE I, whereas Smad4 bound strongly to SBE I but weakly to SBE II and SBE III. Smad3 had no binding affinity to SBE I and bound only weakly to SBE II and SBE III. Since the core CAGAC sequences in three SBEs are identical, it seems that the surrounding sequences outside the core SBE may be additional determinants for the specificity of Smad binding. This interpretation may be further supported by the finding that, in addition to the core SBE II sequence, the 3&#x02032; box in the <italic>Xretpos</italic> BRE-like region was important for Smad1 binding as revealed by competition EMSA experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f5">5</xref>B, lanes 4&#x02013;7). Moreover, according to the previous DNase I protection experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c30">30</xref>), the region protected by Smad4 and Smad1 was &#x0223c;20 bp long, extending the core motifs in the <italic>Xvent2</italic> promoter.</p><p>There have been some controversies as to the exact DNA sequences that are recognized by Smads. Since first identified as optimal DNA-binding sequences for Smad3 and Smad4 by PCR-based selection from a pool of degenerate oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c22">22</xref>), one or two copies of SBEs began to be identified in TGF-&#x003b2;-responsive genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f3">3</xref>B). Whereas these SBEs were bound and transactivated by Smad3 and Smad4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c42">42</xref>), they were neither bound by Smad1 nor responded to BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c41">41</xref>). Additionally, SBEs in the <italic>Xvent2</italic> BRE were directly bound and protected by Smad4 but not by Smad1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c30">30</xref>). There fore, it was suggested that the CAGAC sequence represents the binding site for Smad3 and Smad4 but not BMP-regulated Smads. However, mounting evidence suggests the alternative hypothesis that BMP-regulated Smads (Smad1&#x0002f;5&#x0002f;8) recognize the same CAGAC sequence, as do Smad3 and Smad4. First, the crystal structure analysis revealed that both the core DNA-contacting residues and the surrounding region of DNA-binding &#x003b2; hairpin are highly conserved invariantly among Smads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c23">23</xref>). Secondly, it was shown that the MH1 domain of the Smad1 binds specifically to SBE with a similar affinity to Smad4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c23">23</xref>). Thirdly, multimerized SBE sequences from the <italic>JunB</italic> promoter were responsive to BMP as well as activin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c40">40</xref>), and Smad1 was able to activate artificial tandem copies of SBE synergistically in combination with Smad4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c46">46</xref>). Additionally, Smad5, a BMP-regulated Smad, was shown to be capable of binding AGAC-containing oligonucleotides and 8 bp palindromic SBE (GTCTAGAC) in the <italic>Smad7</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c47">47</xref>). Therefore, our present findings that SBE CAGAC sequences in the <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter are recognized not only by Smad3 and Smad4 but also by Smad1 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf437f6">6</xref>) provide additional evidence that the same SBE CAGAC sequence can be recognized both by BMP-regulated Smads and Smad3 and Smad4, but it may depend on the flanking sequences.</p><p><italic>Xretpos</italic> is not the only retroviral element that is regulated by TGF-&#x003b2; family members. Human endogenous retrovirus HERV-K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c48">48</xref>) was shown to be induced by BMP and retinoic acid, and <italic>Xenopus</italic> LTR-retrotransposon-like element <italic>BIG3&#x0002f;1A11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c50">50</xref>) was shown to be induced by activin, FGF and the T-box gene <italic>Xbra</italic>. Moreover, multiple SBE CAGAC sequences were found in their respective LTR sequences (the presence of SBEs in <italic>BIG3&#x0002f;1A11</italic> LTRs were unpublished observations by S.Shim), although the potential Smad binding activity was not verified. Zebrafish LTR-retroelement <italic>bhikhari</italic> (<italic>bic</italic>) was also shown to be induced by activin and the induction was mediated by FAST protein binding to an activin response element in <italic>bic</italic> LTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c42">42</xref>). Addition ally, it is interesting to find that <italic>BORG</italic>, an immediate early response gene of BMPs without any extensive ORFs, contained, in its middle part, a cluster of multiple interspersed repetitive sequences including one region related to mammalian short interspersed element and three regions related to mammalian apparent LTR-retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c51">51</xref>). The evolutionary and functional implications of this apparently general mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of the retroviral genome by the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily and other growth factors remains to be determined.</p><p>The Smad binding and transcription assays in this study suggest that <italic>Xretpos</italic> may behave like an immediate early gene via BMP-4. According to our previous study, however, BMP-4 induction of <italic>Xretpos</italic> was greatly reduced by the translational inhibitor cycloheximide treatment before midblastula transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c33">33</xref>). It was also shown that BMP-4 activation of <italic>Xretpos</italic> transcription was detected at neurula stage but not gastrula stage from northern blot analysis. Therefore, it seems likely that <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis of newly activated transcripts after late gastrulation or neurulation is required for the full activation of <italic>Xretpos</italic> by BMP-4. OAZ seems unlikely to be such a candidate because, although OAZ transcripts increase from the neurula stage, they are also present before the midblastula transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c31">31</xref>).</p><p>Our previous studies showed that <italic>Xretpos</italic> has only limited homology to the <italic>gag</italic> gene and no homology to the <italic>pol</italic> gene such as protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase that are required for its retrotransposition, suggesting that it is a defective transposable element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c33">33</xref>). However, our previous findings of the presence of multiple copies of <italic>Xretpos</italic>-related elements in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> genome implied that the <italic>Xretpos</italic> element might once have been active in the early days of its evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c33">33</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Xretpos</italic> probably constitutes a rare case of a cellular gene that lost its capability of retrotransposition with the loss of <italic>pol</italic> gene but instead acquired a novel gene function through transduction by an LTR element. To our knowledge, Xretpos is the first example of a protein that was proven to be expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> from an LTR-retrotransposon-like element, as revealed by the western blot analysis with anti-Xretpos antibody. Only ORF1 of L1Hs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c52">52</xref>), a non-LTR retrotransposon in human, has so far been detected as an endogenous product in human cells, and coding potential was only presumed for other LTR- or non-LTR retrotransposons such as <italic>Bs1</italic> in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c53">53</xref>) and ORF2 of L1Hs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c54">54</xref>). More importantly, <italic>Xretpos</italic> may be the first retrotransposon element whose biological function was manifested in the embryo besides its evolutionary and gene regulatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c57">57</xref>).</p><p>The most interesting and prospective structural features by which Xretpos may exert its biological effects are a &#x02018;CCHC&#x02019; zinc finger motif and a coiled-coil leucine zipper structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c33">33</xref>). The &#x02018;CCHC&#x02019; motif is found in the nucleocapsid proteins, products of the retroviral <italic>gag</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c58">58</xref>) and is also included in a variety of eukaryotic proteins postulated to regulate transcription, RNA splicing or translation such as <italic>SLU7</italic> in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c59">59</xref>), <italic>Xpo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c60">60</xref>) and <italic>X-cat2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c61">61</xref>) in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, <italic>glh</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c62">62</xref>) and <italic>lin-28</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c63">63</xref>) in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and cellular nucleic acid binding proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c64">64</xref>) or mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c66">66</xref>). Despite the high level of conservation of its structure, a direct role for the &#x02018;CCHC&#x02019; motif still needs further investigation.</p><p>Xretpos protein also encodes a leucine zipper structure at its C-terminus (amino acids 328&#x02013;370), which is embedded in a region of high amphipathic &#x003b1;-helical structure and can mediate specific dimeric complex formation between homologous or heterologous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c67">67</xref>). This observation was obtained from both the coiled-coil algorithm prediction &#x0005b;Paircoils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c68">68</xref>); COIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c69">69</xref>)&#x0005d; and PSI-BLAST homology search program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c70">70</xref>; data not shown). The additional findings that Xretpos proteins are cytoplasmic and lack a basic domain required for DNA binding suggest that it may play an Id-like role in negative regulation of transcription factors; Id family proteins that have a helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (HLH) domain but lack a basic domain act in a dominant-negative manner by sequestering basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (bHLH) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c71">71</xref>). In this respect it is interesting to find that <italic>Id</italic> expression is activated by BMP through an SBE-containing BMP-responsive region in the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c73">73</xref>) and Id proteins contribute to the anti-myogenic and anti-neurogenic effect of BMP by negatively regulating myogenic and proneural bHLH factors such as MyoD and neurogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c73">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c75">75</xref>). Additionally, leucine zipper-containing <italic>JunB</italic> is activated by TGF-&#x003b2; and BMP putatively through SBE in the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c76">76</xref>) and involved in the BMP-2-induced inhibition of myogenic differentiation. Direct physical interaction of the leucine zipper domain of Jun with the HLH region of MyoD was implicated in repressing bHLH function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf437c77">77</xref>). Therefore, our putative hypothesis is that the posterio-ventralizing effect of Xretpos protein may be accomplished by negatively regulating basic leucine zipper or bHLH proteins that are involved in anterior&#x02013;posterior or dorso&#x02013;ventral specification in which myogenesis and neurogenesis are its essential components. Identification of the proteins with which Xretpos interacts will allow us to verify our hypothesis and clarify the mechanism of how Xretpos acts in the axis specification.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf437f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Stage- and tissue-specific expression of reporter constructs containing the LTR and 5&#x02032;-UTR of <italic>Xretpos</italic> promoter.
