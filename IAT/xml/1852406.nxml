However, the exon content in mammalian genes is far from static. Rather, it is constantly changing through a dynamic evolutionary process in which exons are newly created and deleted. New exons can arise from gene duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and exon duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but perhaps the most intriguing process by which exons can be born is exonization by exaptation, where genomic sequences that did not originally function as exons are adopted into exonic sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>We have recently shown that <italic>Alu </italic>elements use this exonization mechanism to give rise to hundreds of novel internal exons in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. <italic>Alu </italic>elements are unique primate-specific retrotransposons that occur in over one million copies in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Their 300 bases-long consensus sequence contains motifs that resemble 5' and 3' potential splice sites (5' ss and 3' ss, respectively). Random mutations can turn these motifs into functional splice sites that can be recognized by the splicing machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>Alu</italic>-derived internal exons are almost always alternatively spliced, allowing the original isoform to coexist with the new one and preventing the deleterious effects of introducing a new protein at the expense of the original one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, <italic>Alu </italic>elements can increase the coding capacity of human genes while maintaining the original protein repertoire.</p><p>Recently, <italic>Alu</italic>s were reported to contribute to human transcriptome diversity by an additional mechanism, involving adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. A-to-I RNA editing refers to the deamination of selected adenosine residues, altering the nucleotide sequence of RNA transcripts from that encoded by genomic DNA. It is catalyzed by enzymes from the ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) family. Editing targets are typically located within double stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is recognized by the ADAR enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. RNA editing can cause non-synonymous codon changes when occurring inside the coding sequence or occur in the non-coding parts of the pre-RNA molecule. It was lately reported that human transcripts contain excess editing over mouse, rat, chicken and fly transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The majority of editing sites in human (approximately 96%) were found to occur within <italic>Alu </italic>sequences. Due to the abundance of <italic>Alu </italic>elements in the human genome, two <italic>Alu</italic>s in opposite orientation are frequently found near each other. When transcribed in the pre-mRNA, these two <italic>Alu</italic>s can presumably fold to create a dsRNA; this substrate is recognized and edited by the ADAR enzymes. Edited <italic>Alu</italic>s typically do not contribute to the protein repertoire, but rather reside in non-coding parts of the pre-RNA molecule - untranslated regions (UTRs) and introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The observation that <italic>Alu </italic>elements are both extensively edited and can give rise to novel alternatively spliced exons in primate genomes raises the question of whether RNA editing can be involved in the birth of new <italic>Alu</italic>-exons. RNA editing was previously shown to regulate alternative splicing by creating a splice site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The most studied event is the auto-editing of the <italic>ADAR2 </italic>gene, in which intronic AA dinucleotide turns into a functional AG 3' ss following RNA editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Indeed, it was recently suggested that such editing events may create functional splice sites in silent intronic <italic>Alu </italic>elements, thus promoting their exonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this study we detected a novel primate-specific <italic>Alu</italic>-exon that exclusively depends on RNA editing for its exonization. We show that RNA editing regulates the exonization in a tissue-dependent manner, both through creation of a functional AG 3' ss, elimination of a premature stop codon, and regulation of the inclusion/skipping level through alteration of exonic splicing enhancers and silencers within the exon. We also demonstrated that the sequence around an editing site is important not only for the editing in that site but also editing in neighboring sites located along this <italic>Alu</italic>-exon. Our results show that RNA editing can be recruited as a mechanism supporting the birth of new exons in the human genome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>RNA editing enables exonization of a nuclear prelamin A recognition factor <italic>Alu</italic>-exon</title><p>To check the possibility that <italic>Alu</italic>-derived exons were fixed into protein-coding genes through an RNA-editing-mediated process, we first used expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and cDNAs from GenBank version 136 aligned to the human genome (version hg16) to identify internal human exons that contain <italic>Alu </italic>elements, as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We looked for <italic>Alu</italic>-containing exons flanked by either AA at the 3' ss or AT at the 5'ss. These non-canonical splice sites will normally not be selected by the splicing machinery; however, each of these splice sites is theoretically capable of becoming a <italic>bona fide </italic>splice site through A-to-I RNA editing, because inosine is recognized by the splicing apparatus as a guanosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We demanded that the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon will be supported by more than one EST/cDNA, and that it neither induced frame-shift nor contained a stop codon, as these parameters were shown to be indicative of functional alternatively spliced exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>We were able to detect one such <italic>Alu</italic>-derived exon, having an AA 3' ss, that conformed to the above conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This exon is the eighth exon in the nuclear prelamin A recognition factor (NARF), a protein that interacts with the carboxyl-terminal tail of prelamin A and localizes to the nuclear lamina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As with all internal <italic>Alu</italic>-containing exons described to date, it is alternatively spliced, and exon-inclusion is supported by seven cDNAs, including the full-length cDNA (GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BC000438">BC000438</ext-link>; UCSC March 2006 version). The exon inserts 46 in-frame additional amino acids into the coding sequence of NARF.</p><p>A-to-I RNA editing takes place in the context of dsRNA, to which the ADAR proteins bind through a dsRNA-binding domain (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). It was therefore shown that, for the vast majority of edited <italic>Alu</italic>s in human exons, there is a nearby (up to 2,000 base-pairs apart) intronic <italic>Alu </italic>counterpart in the opposite orientation, which presumably serves as the template for dsRNA formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Indeed, we were able to find an oppositely oriented <italic>Alu </italic>sequence 25 bases upstream of the exonized <italic>Alu</italic>. The antisense <italic>Alu </italic>has 81% identity when aligned to the exon-producing <italic>Alu</italic>, suggesting that these two <italic>Alu</italic>s might form a stable intramolecular dsRNA formation following transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). This, in addition to the non-canonical AA splice site, implies that RNA editing participates in the exonization of that <italic>Alu</italic>.</p><p>Editing within <italic>Alu </italic>elements frequently occurs in more than one position, due to the long RNA duplex usually formed by two oppositely oriented nearby <italic>Alu</italic>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Indeed, by searching for A&#x02192;G discrepancies in the alignments of cDNAs to the human genome we detected five additional potential editing sites in the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>, E1-E5). The first of these, found in position 19 of the exon, is of particular interest, because it has the potential to change a TAG codon (termination of translation) to a TGG codon (coding for tryptophane). In the absence of RNA editing in the E1 position, the insertion of this <italic>Alu</italic>-exon would have caused a premature termination. It is important to note that the editing in the exonic E1-E5 sites is directly recognizable from the ESTs or cDNAs in comparison to human genomic DNA, whereas editing in the potential 3'ss is postulated based only on the genomic sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Different levels of exonization among human tissues</title><p>To check whether this putative <italic>Alu</italic>-exon is indeed spliced into the mature mRNA of NARF, we tested the existence of the exon-inclusion and exon-skipping forms in endogenous mRNA from various normal human tissues and cell-lines. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, the inclusion form was detected in all cDNAs generated from normal human tissues as well as from different human cell lines. This indicates that the exonization of the NARF <italic>Alu </italic>is evolutionarily fixed in the human transcriptome. Moreover, exon inclusion levels in different tissues followed expected levels of RNA editing in those tissues. For example, brain, kidney and spleen showed the highest levels of exon inclusion while skeletal muscle showed the lowest levels of exon inclusion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>; Additional data file 1). These results are in line with genome wide analysis of edited RNA in different tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and to the amount of inosine detected in RNA in various tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The above results further suggest that RNA editing is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing of the exonized <italic>Alu </italic>in the gene encoding NARF. Interestingly, we note high levels of exon inclusion in MCF7 and 293T cell-lines, but not in HeLa, SKOV3 and MDAH cell-lines (human cancer cell lines originated from breast, kidney, cervix and ovaries, respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), although the global editing level in cell-lines is expected to be relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This demonstrates that the amplitude of editing level in various cell line types is of a variable nature.</p><p>We sequenced all of the exon inclusion PCR products and analyzed the editing frequencies at the five editing sites (named E1-E5, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) using the Discovery Studio (DS) Gene 1.5 program (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Importantly, the first exonic editing site, E1 (at position 19 of the exon), was edited at nearly 100% efficiency in all tested tissues and cell lines, whereas the editing levels of the other sites varied (E2 being edited in an average of 53.6% of RNAs, E3 in an average of 26.1%, E4 in an average of 7.9% and E5 in an average of 37.5%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Notably, editing sites E1, E3 and E5 are mistakenly annotated as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in dbSNP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] (rs17855348, rs17849311 and rs17855349, respectively) based on the variance in cDNA data. Many similar examples of RNA editing sites erroneously deposited in dbSNP have been recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Usually, editing efficiency is much lower than 100% per site, depending on the expression levels of the ADAR enzymes in the given tissue, the secondary structure of the substrate, or the surrounding sequence. As shown above, position E1 in the NARF <italic>Alu</italic>-exon is edited in nearly all RNA molecules containing this exon. Inactivation of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by adding puromycine (see Materials and methods) to 293T cell line did not affect the &#x0003e;97% editing efficiency in site E1 (data not shown). This indicates that the high level of editing in site E1 is not due to elimination of unedited, stop-codon containing mRNAs, but rather is indicative of a high efficiency of editing in that site. Apart from the Q/R site of gluR-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], which is restricted to brain, this is the highest editing efficiency documented in human, though it has a much broader tissue expression spectrum. This result suggests that additional regulatory mechanisms have evolved to ensure that the stop codon is edited to a Trp codon in all mRNAs containing the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon. It further implies that the exonization of the NARF <italic>Alu</italic>-exon is functional in the human transcriptome.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Alu</italic>-<italic>Alu </italic>dsRNA directs exonization</title><p>To substantiate the possibility that exon 8 in NARF was exonized through an RNA-editing-mediated process, we constructed a minigene containing the human genomic sequence of the gene encoding NARF from exon 7 to 9, including the two introns in between and the alternative <italic>Alu</italic>-exon. Following transfection of this minigene into 293T cells, total RNA was collected, and the splicing pattern of the NARF minigene was examined by RT-PCR analysis using primers specific to the plasmid cDNA and not the endogenous one (see Materials and methods). We then tested the effect of serial intronic and exonic mutations on the splicing of the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>).</p><p>When the wild-type minigene was transfected into 293T cells, 23% of the mature mRNAs derived from this minigene represented the exon-inclusion form (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, lane 1). However, deletion of the antisense <italic>Alu </italic>element upstream of the exonized <italic>Alu </italic>resulted in total abrogation of exon inclusion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, lane 2), indicating that these two adjacent <italic>Alu</italic>s probably pair to create the dsRNA that is required for RNA editing. Without this dsRNA, editing does not occur, and functional AG in the 3'ss cannot be created. The effect of the antisense <italic>Alu </italic>deletion was reversed when the AA splice site near the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon was mutated to AG, indicating that a single AA&#x02192;AG change is sufficient for exonization of this <italic>Alu </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, lane 3). Interestingly, the AA&#x02192;AG mutation increased exon-inclusion two-fold over the wild type, suggesting that, in 293T cells, about one-third of the AA pairs in the 3'ss are edited into a functional AG 3' ss. Also, a single AA&#x02192;AT mutation at the 3'ss, created on the wild-type plasmid, resulted in full exon skipping, indicating the importance of editing at that site for exonization. Whereas, a single AA&#x02192;AG mutation resulted in approximately 30% exonization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). The higher level of exonization after a single AA&#x02192;AG mutation at the 3'ss without and with the antisense <italic>Alu </italic>presumably suggests that although the antisense <italic>Alu </italic>is essential for exonization, it also reduces the level of maximum exonization by interfering with spliceosome accessibility to the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon due to dsRNA formation (compare lanes 3 and 5). Combined together, these results demonstrate that the exonization of the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon 8 in NARF is mediated by RNA editing, and that this mechanism also controls the level of inclusion of this exon in different tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Editing in one site affects the level of editing in other sites and the surrounding sequence and the opposite nucleotide are important for editing</title><p>To test the possibility that specific sequences within the <italic>Alu</italic>-<italic>Alu </italic>duplex are involved in the regulation of high efficiency editing at the E1 site, we mutated the two nucleotides surrounding the edited site, as well as the nucleotide in the antisense <italic>Alu </italic>that is postulated to be opposite to the edited nucleotide within the dsRNA (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref> for the mutated nucleotides). All these mutations substantially reduced the editing in the E1 site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b,c</xref>), indicating the importance of the surrounding sequence and the postulated opposite nucleotide in the antisense <italic>Alu </italic>for editing at that site. Moreover, mutations M2 and M3 also resulted in a significant reduction of RNA editing in the other exonic sites - the most significant effect was on site E2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b,c</xref>). This might suggest that the edited position is part of a sequence motif that directs high efficiency RNA editing at the other sites as well.</p><p>Our results indicate that RNA editing not only enables the exonization of the NARF <italic>Alu</italic>-exon, but also regulates its inclusion levels in different tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This regulation is probably attributed to the efficiency by which the AA splice site is edited to AG. However, another possible mechanism by which RNA editing can control exon inclusion levels is by altering exonic splicing enhancers and silencers (ESEs and ESSs, also denoted exonic splicing regulatory sequences (ESRs)) within the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Indeed, editing of the first exonic site (E1) is predicted to eliminate a putative ESR ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; see also ESRsearch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It also exchanges a putative ESS (GGT<underline>A</underline>GT) with another putative ESS (TGGT<underline>G</underline>G), as predicted by RescueESE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, the second exonic edited site (E2; position 30 in the exon) is part of four putative SR binding sites (Serine/Argenine-rich domain); editing reduces the score of the SF2/ASF binding site, eliminates a putative SRp40 ESR, creates a SRp55 ESR and also eliminates a putative ESR (as predicted by ESEfinder and ESRsearch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]). In site E3, editing creates a putative high-scoring recognition site for the splicing factor SC35, as predicted by ESEfinder. Editing of E4 creates a putative recognition site for the splicing factor SC35, as predicted by ESEfinder. Editing of site E5 is predicted to have an effect on multiple ESRs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA editing regulates the inclusion level of the NARF <italic>Alu</italic>-exon</title><p>To test the possibility that RNA editing regulates the inclusion levels of the NARF <italic>Alu</italic>-exon by altering ESRs within the exon, we serially mutated each of the exonic edited sites from A-to-G, simulating 100% editing efficiency. To examine the effect of the exonic sites only we used a minigene in which an A-to-G mutation mimics 100% editing in the 3'ss, and we also deleted the antisense <italic>Alu </italic>that affects editing of the exonic sites. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, an A-to-G mutation in E1 and E3, but not in E2 and E5, resulted in a significant increase in exon inclusion levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 3 and 6). However, editing in position E4 significantly reduced the inclusion level, suggesting the creation of a putative SC35 site that functions as an ESS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lane 5). These results indicate that editing of three out of the five exonic edited sites affects alternative splicing levels. However, it is unlikely that alternative splicing is regulated through editing in the E1 site, because it is uniformly edited at high levels in all tissues tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have demonstrated that the NARF <italic>Alu</italic>-exon 8 is exonized via RNA editing and that RNA editing is also involved in its tissue-dependent regulation. Previously, RNA editing was implicated in both anti-viral protection and transcript diversity regulation; we now show that editing can also support evolutionary processes such as the birth of new exons.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] presented computational predictions of several <italic>Alu </italic>exonization events (not including the NARF <italic>Alu</italic>-exon) that were hypothesized to be regulated by RNA editing; our results provide exemplary confirmation of the validity of these predictions.</p><p>It has been shown that a few hundred <italic>Alu </italic>elements become exonized through single base-pair mutations that create functional splice sites within their sequences. Yet in the case of the NARF <italic>Alu</italic>-exon, exonization strictly depends on RNA editing. This situation provides a simple, yet powerful, way to regulate the levels of exon inclusion in a tissue/developmental stage-specific manner. Since editing levels control the level of <italic>Alu</italic>-exon inclusion, exon inclusion rates would follow the varying editing levels in different tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Usually, many regulatory sequence elements are needed to regulate alternative splicing in a tissue-specific manner. These sequence elements presumably can extend up to 150 bases from each side of the regulated exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It is unlikely that a recently retroposed <italic>Alu </italic>element will carry all needed splicing regulatory elements; however, the RNA-editing-dependent exonization does not rely on such extensive sequence elements, and mainly depends on the expression level of the editing enzymes (ADARs) in the specific tissue. Moreover, we show that editing of two out of the five exonic edited sites affects alternative splicing levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This provides an additional layer of regulation of alternative splicing through RNA editing.</p><p>Interestingly, the E1 as well as the E5 editing sites in the rhesus macaque (but not in chimpanzee) genome encode 'G', thus presenting only the edited version of the gene in those sites. However, there are differences between the genomic sequence of human and chimpanzee and that of rhesus. The <italic>Alu</italic>-exon (<italic>Alu</italic>Sx) and the sequence upstream and downstream of it are highly conserved between human and chimpanzee. But in the rhesus macaque there was an insertion of <italic>Alu</italic>Y (in the sense orientation) immediately upstream of <italic>Alu</italic>Sx (the one that exonized in human), leading the antisense <italic>Alu</italic>Sg (the one that forms the dsRNA) to be located 344 nucleotides upstream of the sense <italic>Alu</italic>Sx (and not 25 nucleotides upstream as it is in human). In addition, there was an insertion of 8 nucleotides in the sense <italic>Alu</italic>Sx in the rhesus macaque as well as a deletion of 44 nucleotides that includes the site used in human as 3'ss (Additional data file 2). These differences raise the question of whether <italic>Alu</italic>Sx in the rhesus macaque exonized at all.</p><p>The observed exonization of the NARF <italic>Alu</italic>-exon in all tested tissues and cell lines indicates that this exon is a <italic>bona fide</italic>, fixed functional exon in the human genome that originated from an exapted <italic>Alu </italic>(that is, an <italic>Alu </italic>that adopted a new function that was not its original function) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. An additional example for such exaptation is exon 8 of the <italic>ADAR2 </italic>gene, which is an <italic>Alu</italic>-exon of 120 nucleotides (inserts 40 amino acids). The <italic>Alu</italic>-exon inclusion isoform does not change the specificity of ADAR2 activity compared to the original isoform (exon skipping) but rather changes the rate of the enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Few mammalian ADAR substrates in which editing causes amino acid substitutions have been found so far; the first (and most studied ones) encode receptors that are all expressed in the central nervous system, including subunits of the glutamate receptor superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], the serotonin 5-HT2C-receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and the potassium channel KCNA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In all these examples, the amino acid substitutions due to editing have been shown to have a major impact on protein properties, and altered editing patterns in the genes encoding them have been found to be associated with several diseases, such as epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and malignant gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Lately, additional evolutionarily conserved RNA editing sites that lead to a codon exchange have been discovered in another four genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] - the functional importance of these sites was deduced by their extreme evolutionary conservation. The editing in the NARF <italic>Alu</italic>-exon is the only experimentally verified editing site in the coding region that is primate-specific. It would be interesting, therefore, to understand the function of the <italic>Alu</italic>-containing NARF isoform in the human transcriptome (as it might be responsible for a primate-specific trait); however, as the function of NARF itself is currently not clear, this must await future studies. A Pfam analysis indicates that the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon is inserted in NARF within a domain defined as 'Iron only hydrogenase large subunit, carboxy-terminal domain', and hence can presumably affect the substrate binding affinity/specificity, or the catalytic activity, of this domain.</p><p>It is worth noting that several other editing targets that cause predicted amino acid changes were detected in a genome-wide search for editing in <italic>Alu </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], but most of them were located in predicted genes or in aberrantly spliced RNAs. Thus, the actual expression of proteins from these transcripts and the possible functional implications of these sites remain to be verified.</p><p>Our study provides additional verification for the close relationship between splicing and editing, which was demonstrated when physical association between spliceosomal components and ADAR proteins was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The actual mechanism that controls the interconnection of splicing and editing is still largely unknown, but it was shown that additional nuclear machineries are involved, such as the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II in the auto-editing of ADAR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This auto-editing is so far the most studied demonstration of the feedback loop between editing and splicing, where editing-mediated inclusion of an exon fragment in the rat <italic>ADAR2 </italic>gene changes, in turn, the editing capacitates of the ADAR protein itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Editing-mediated selection of splice sites has also been observed in other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. ADAR2 knockout mice provide another example of the tight connection between editing and splicing, since the absence of editing in the Q/R site prevents proper splicing of the nearby intron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Our results show that this splicing-editing interconnection can also have evolutionary significance.</p><p>Although several thousand <italic>Alu </italic>sequences have the potential to undergo exonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], we were able to detect only one reliable event of a coding <italic>Alu</italic>-exon that seemed to be exonized through RNA editing, indicating that such a combination of evolutionary events is relatively rare in the human genome. However, this evolutionary mechanism for the birth of new exons might recur in other genomes. Moreover, this mechanism might allow additional <italic>Alu </italic>exonizations in the evolutionary future of <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>and other primate species. As some <italic>Alu</italic>s are still active in the human genome (at a rate of 1 transposition every 200 births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]), a novel <italic>Alu </italic>retroposition in the opposite orientation from a nearby preexisting <italic>Alu </italic>might lead to dsRNA formation and <italic>Alu</italic>-exonization even if this <italic>Alu </italic>does not contain a canonical splice site.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that RNA editing can lead to the creation of a new exon in the human genome. Similarly to <italic>Alu </italic>retroposition and alternative splicing, RNA editing was not originally 'designed' to serve evolutionary purposes; it was rather recruited for this, probably serendipitously. This demonstrates that the creation of genomic novelty can be assisted by numerous molecular biological mechanisms, most of which were originally designed to function in other processes. The dynamism of our genome can, therefore, arise through surprising paths.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Computational search for candidate edited <italic>Alus</italic></title><p>ESTs and cDNAs from GenBank version 136 were aligned to the human genome (version hg16) to identify internal human exons that contain <italic>Alu </italic>elements, as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]<italic>Alu</italic>-containing exons were identified using blastn analysis against the <italic>Alu </italic>consensus with a threshold of 1E-10. <italic>Alu</italic>s having AA/GT or AG/AT 3' ss/5' ss, which flank exons in the protein-coding region of the genes, were taken for further analysis.

1</label><caption><p>The birth of an <italic>Alu</italic>-exon through RNA editing. Editing prediction was inferred from alignment of cDNAs to human genomic DNA. <bold>(a) </bold>Schematic illustration of exons 7 to 9 of the <italic>NARF </italic>gene. Exons are depicted as blue boxes; the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon, derived from <italic>Alu</italic>Sx (AEx; purple box), is in a sense orientation and is shown in the middle. The intronic, antisense-orientation <italic>Alu </italic>sequence (<italic>Alu</italic>S) is 25 base-pairs upstream of the exonized <italic>Alu</italic>. Sense and antisense <italic>Alu</italic>s are expected to create a dsRNA secondary structure, thus allowing RNA editing. RNA editing changes an AA dinucleotide into a functional AG 3' splice site (lower panel). RNA editing also occurs in five positions in the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon itself (E1, E2, E3, E4 and E5). In the first position (E1), editing changes a UAG stop codon into a UGG Trp codon. <bold>(b) </bold>Predicted folding between the sense and antisense <italic>Alu </italic>sequences (upper and lower lines, respectively). Adenosines that undergo editing are marked by red. Splice sites utilized for <italic>Alu </italic>exonization are marked as 5' ss and 3' ss on the alignment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2007-8-2-r29-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Levels of <italic>Alu</italic>-exon inclusion and RNA editing in the endogenous human <italic>NARF </italic>gene. <bold>(a) </bold>cDNAs from various normal human tissues or cDNAs from various cell-lines were PCR amplified using primers specific for the two exons flanking the exonized <italic>Alu </italic>(upper and lower panels, respectively). The inclusion level of the <italic>Alu</italic>-exon is indicated at the top of the panel, and represents the total percentage of the <italic>Alu</italic>-containing mRNA isoform, where 100% corresponds to the total of both mRNA isoforms (inferred by the ImageJ program). Each PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. Schemata of the two mRNA products are shown on the right. <bold>(b) </bold>Editing efficiency in the five exonic sites (E1, E2, E3, E4 and E5; see Figure 1 for site positions) in different tissues and cell lines. The editing frequencies in each of the five edited sites, derived from sequence results obtained from an average of three independent amplifications, were quantified using the Discovery Studio Gene 1.5 program.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2007-8-2-r29-2"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The antisense <italic>Alu </italic>is essential for exonization. <bold>(a) </bold>An illustration of the <italic>NARF </italic>minigene that was constructed, containing the genomic sequence of the human <italic>NARF </italic>gene from exon 7 to 9.
