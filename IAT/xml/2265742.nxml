Tuberin downregulates the DNA repair enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase (OGG1) with important functional consequences, compromising the ability of cells to repair damaged DNA resulting in the accumulation of the mutagenic oxidized DNA, 8-oxo-dG. Loss of function mutations of OGG1 also occurs in human kidney clear cell carcinoma and may contribute to tumorgenesis.

Mutations that influence the repair of oxidized DNA modifications are expected to increase the steady-state (background) levels of these modifications and thus create a mutator phenotype that predisposes to malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Many of these mutations occur as a result of irreparable or incompletely repaired genomic DNA, which is constantly subject to assault from intrinsic and environmental insults. Oxidized forms of DNA in particular are produced in mammalian cells as a byproduct of normal oxidative metabolism or in response to exogenous sources of reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. 8-Oxo-deoxyguanine (8-oxodG) is one of the major base lesions formed after oxidative damage to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. 8-oxodG is mutagenic since it pairs with adenine during DNA synthesis, increasing G:C to T:A transversions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Oxidative damage-induced mutations activate oncogenes or inactivate tumor suppressor genes, altering cell growth control. 8-oxodG in DNA is repaired primarily via the DNA base excision repair pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The gene encoding the DNA repair enzyme that recognizes and excises 8-oxodG is 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase (OGG1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Deficiency of OGG1 in yeast, or its homologue formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase in bacteria, results in a spontaneous mutator phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The steady-state levels of 8-oxoG, which reflect the balance between continuous generation and removal, are significantly higher in livers of <italic>OGG1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice compared to wild-type animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The <italic>OGG1 </italic>gene is somatically mutated in some cancer cells and is highly polymorphic among humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Loss of heterozygosity at the <italic>OGG1 </italic>allele, located on chromosome 3p25, was found in 85% of 99 human kidney clear cell carcinoma samples, identifying the loss of OGG1 function as a possible consequence of multistep carcinogenesis in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder associated with tumors in many organs, including renal cell carcinoma. It affects about 1 million individuals worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of up to one in 6,000 newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at <italic>TSC2 </italic>locus has been detected in <italic>TSC</italic>-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The Eker rat has been used for many years to model TSC and RCC. In this strain, the incidence of clear cell RCC in gene carriers approaches 100% by 1 year of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The constitutive expression of OGG1 in heterozygous Eker rat (TSC2<sup>+/-</sup>) kidneys is lower than in wild-type rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] suggesting that these proteins may be functionally linked. The present study was conducted to investigate the basal levels and localization of tuberin, 8-oxodG and OGG1 in different regions of wild type and Eker rat kidneys.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Distribution of tuberin and OGG1 in kidney</title><p>Kidney homogenates from cortex, inner medulla and papilla were subjected to western blot analysis. As expected, tuberin expression in kidney of wild type animals was higher than in Eker rats. Kidney cortex including the outer medulla shows higher tuberin and OGG1 expression compared to inner medulla and papilla. Deficiency of tuberin in Eker rats was associated with decrease in OGG1 expression compared to wild type rat in all three regions of the kidney (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of tuberin and OGG1 protein in kidney cortex (C), medulla (M) and papilla (P) of wild type and Eker rats.

DNA glycosylase activity of the OGG1 enzyme was assayed as the cleavage of an 8-oxoG-containing oligomer, which releases oxidized guanine base from a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 21 oligonuleotide. OGG1 activity was higher in cortex compared to the medulla (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). OGG1 activity was significantly lower in kidney cortex and medulla of Eker rats compared to wild type rats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). OGG1 is the major DNA base excision repair enzyme that recognizes and excises 8-oxodG, therefore we determined whether the change in OGG1 abundance influenced the accumulation of 8-oxodG, a substrate of OGG1 enzyme. In order to evaluate the basal level of oxidative DNA damage in the cortices and inner medullae of Eker and wild type rats, we examined the content of 8-oxo-dG in the nuclear DNA extracted from both section using HPLC-EC. DNA was isolated from kidney cortices and medulla of Eker and wild type rats and 8-oxodG levels were analyzed by HPLC. 8-OxodG levels were higher in kidney tissue from Eker compared to wild type rats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The levels of 8-oxodG in nuclear DNA were significantly higher (2 fold) in cortices of Eker compared to wild type rat. The levels of 8-oxodG were significantly higher in kidney medullae compared to kidney cortices. These data suggest that OGG1 protein and activity express the low levels in inner medullae may not be sufficient to repair the generated 8-oxodG compared to cortex region.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of renal OGG1 activity and 8-oxodG in cortices (C) and medulla (M) of wild type and Eker rat.

Our data demonstrate that tuberin deficiency is associated with deficiency of protein as well as with marked inhibition of OGG1 activity indicating that tuberin is upstream of OGG1. In addition, our data show that inhibition of OGG1 activity is associated with increased accumulation of 8-oxodG in kidneys of Eker compared to wild type rats. We have show that the constitutive expression of OGG1 in TSC2 heterozygous Eker rat (TSC2<sup>+/-</sup>) kidneys is lower than in wild-type rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The protein and activity levels of OGG1 were higher in cortical region than in the medullary region of wild type rat. However, OGG1 protein and activity were lower in kidney cortices and medullae of Eker compared to wild type rats. In addition, 8-oxodG accumulation was significantly higher in kidney medulla compared to kidney cortex indicating that inner medulla could express low level of DNA repair OGG1 that not sufficient to repair the amount of 8-oxodG compared to cortex region. OGG1 expression was low in kidney of Eker rat and that associated with high amount of 8-oxodG compared to wild rat suggesting that Eker rats are more susceptible to oxidative DNA damage. In addition, tumor kidney of Eker rat show null tuberin and OGG1 expression indicating that tuberin is an upstream regulator of OGG1 protein and gene expression. Furthermore, the kidney has an unusually high rate of oxygen metabolism, and it has been shown that the high concentrations of urea frequently present in kidney cells trigger oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and therefore increase the likelihood of DNA damage by 8-oxodG formations.</p><p>In mammalian cells, the base excision pathway initiated by OGG1 represents the main defense against the mutagenic effects of 8-oxodG. However, the decrease in OGG1 expression in <italic>Tsc-2</italic><sup>+/- </sup>rats has important functional consequences, compromising the ability of these animals to respond to oxidative stress. Indeed, the loss of OGG1 expression in kidney tumor tissue from Eker rat resulted in the accumulation of significant amounts of 8-oxodG (unrepaired DNA lesions), suggesting that loss of tuberin was biologically significant in affecting OGG1. Treatment of Eker rats with an oxidative DNA damaging agent increases 8-oxodG formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], but the accumulation of 8-oxodG in wild type and Eker rats in our studies occurs in the absence of exposure to exogenous oxidants. 8-OxodG induces mutation via misincorporation of DNA bases present in the unrepaired DNA adducts, or by slippage of DNA polymerase during replicative bypass. We have recently shown that the basis for the suppression of renal OGG1 in tuberindeficient cells is sufficient to downregulate OGG1, at least in part through the transcription factor, NF-YA, the major transcription factor regulate OGG1 activity, with consequent decreased transcription of OGG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The OGG1 protein initiates the base excision repair process by recognizing and excising the modified base. Consistent with the yeast findings, mice lacking a functional OGG1 protein accumulate abnormal levels of 8-oxoG in their genomes and display a moderately elevated spontaneous mutation rate in nonproliferative tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Because inactivation of the <italic>OGG1 </italic>gene in mammalian cells causes a mutator phenotype, it can be expected that cells lacking OGG1 activity could have an enhanced probability of undergoing malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The validation of this hypothesis requires the identification of human tumors where both alleles of the <italic>OGG1 </italic>gene are nonfunctional. The human <italic>OGG1 </italic>gene is located on chromosome 3p25. Human chromosome 3p cytogenetic abnormalities and LOH have been observed at high frequency in sporadic forms of RCC. The 3p21.2-p21.3 locus is frequently deleted in RCC and also in other cancers, but to date, no candidate gene has been identified.</p><p>In summary, deficiency of tuberin is associated with loss of function of OGG1 in tumors of Eker rat. Impaired OGG1 repair enzyme activity results in the accumulation of 8-oxodG, suggesting that tuberin plays a significant role in protecting the cells from oxidative DNA damage. We propose that loss of OGG1 expression and function in tuberin-deficient tumor tissue predisposes to further genetic alterations as a result accumulation of mismatched DNA base lesions, a form of genomic instability that if left unrepaired promotes additional genetic alterations leading to the full blown tumor phenotype in kidney patients with TSC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The protein and activity levels of OGG1 were higher in cortical region than in the medullary region of wild type rat. However, OGG1 protein and activity were lower in kidney cortices and medullae of Eker compared to wild type rats. 8-Oxo-dG levels were highest in the medulla, which expressed the lowest levels of OGG1. The basal levels of 8-oxo-dG were also higher than in both cortex and medulla of Eker rats compared to wild type rats.

Membranes were stripped with 0.2 M NaOH for 10 min each, blocked with 5% milk for 1 h, and then incubated with GAPDH (Santa Cruz, CA) as loading control. Expression of each protein was quantified by densitometry using National Institutes of Health Image 1.62 software and normalized to a loading control.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunostaining of OGG1 and tuberin</title><p>Localization of OGG1 and tuberin was assessed by immunofluorescence histochemistry as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Acetone-fixed frozen sections (6 &#x003bc;m) were incubated with nonimmune donkey IgG to block nonspecific binding, then incubated with rabbit anti-tuberin (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotech) or OGG1 primary antibodies followed by FITC- or Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA, USA) as secondary antibodies for signal detection. All incubations of primary and secondary antibodies were for 30 minutes with three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5 minutes each between steps. Controls consisted of non-immune mouse IgG or PBS/BSA in place of primary antibody followed by detection procedures as outlined above. Sections were viewed and photographed using an Olympus Research microscope equipped for epifluorescence with excitation and band pass filters optimal for either FITC or Cy3.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of OGG1 activity</title><p>Kidney tissue was homogenated in 0.25 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM NaCl, 0.8 &#x003bc;g/ml antipain, 0.8 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin). The homogenate was sonicated for 8 sec at 4&#x000b0;C with pulses of 1 sec each between 10 sec intervals. After centrifugation (12,000 rpm) at 4&#x000b0;C for 15 min, the supernatant was recovered and protein content was determined by Bradford method (242). A 24-mer oligonucleotide containing the oxidized G base (R&#x00026;D Systems, Inc, MN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], was labeled at its 5' end using [32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The 32P-labeled strand was hybridized with the complementary oligonucleotide A by incubation at 90&#x000b0;C for 10 min followed by slow cooling to RT. The assay mixture (20 &#x003bc;l final volume) contained 50 fmol of 32P-labelled DNA duplex and cell extracts (50 &#x003bc;g of protein) in 1&#x000d7; REC buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCL, 10 nM EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA). Purified OGG1 enzyme was used as positive control. The reactions were performed at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. Ten &#x003bc;l of 3&#x000d7; alkali loading buffer (300 mM NaOH, 97% formamide, and 0.2% bromophenol blue) was added, the samples heated at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min and then fast cooled to 2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C. The cleavage products were resolved by 20% denaturing PAGE in the presence of 7 M urea.</p></sec><sec><title>8-OxodG assay</title><p>DNA was isolated from rat kidney tissue and detection of dG and 8-oxodG was performed on DNA hydrolyzed with nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase as previously described and validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Aliquots (90 &#x003bc;l) of DNA hydrolysates were injected onto a Partisil 5 &#x003bc;m ODS-3 reverse-phase analytical column for HPLC analysis with the eluate monitored with a UV photodiode array (Shimadzo, SPD M10A) and electrochemical (EC) detectors (ESA Coul Array). Authentic standards of 8-oxodG and dG were analyzed along with every batch of samples. Salmon sperm DNA (5&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;g) was used as a positive control for DNA digestion reactions. Standard curves for dG and 8-oxodG were prepared and quantitation performed by linear regression analyses. Data were expressed as pmol 8-oxodG/dG &#x000d7; 10-5 in 90 &#x003bc;l of DNA hydrolysate.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard error.
