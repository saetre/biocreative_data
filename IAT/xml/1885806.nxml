The pattern of glomerular convergence is remarkably stereotyped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and is strongly dependent upon the specific odorant receptor expressed by the OSN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. But despite the number of cues that have been found that are expressed by OSNs or along the path traveled by OSNs to the bulb, surprisingly little is known about the role of the olfactory bulb itself in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Transplantation and bulbectomy studies have observed the formation of glomerular-like structures by OSNs within cortical tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Genetic ablation of mitral and tufted projection neurons showed that topographically correct convergence by P2-expressing OSNs still occurred in the absence of these target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Disruption of the laminar nature of the mitral layer also did not affect convergence by P2-expressing OSNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These results have suggested that the olfactory bulb plays a minimal role, if any, in targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, studies ablating most of the bulb, as opposed to eliminating only projection neurons, have observed topographically incorrect convergence by P2-expressing OSNs, suggesting a role for the bulb in determining the ultimate location of OSNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Tracing studies have long suggested the existence of zone-to-zone mapping of OSNs onto corresponding domains within the bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Dscam </italic>expression in the antennal lobe is critical for proper olfactory receptor neuron targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], providing the first data that the target structure is important for convergence. These experiments in <italic>Drosophila </italic>suggest that the mammalian bulb may also provide guidance information to OSNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Part of the uncertainty surrounding the role of the bulb in guidance is that it is unclear what other bulbar cells in addition to mitral and tufted projection neurons could provide targeting information. While radial glia have long been suggested as one possibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], cells in the external plexiform (EPL) and glomerular (GL) layers also possess many attractive characteristics. First, in addition to projection neurons, other cells in the EPL and GL form synapses with OSNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Second, recent studies point to a diversity of cell-types within these layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and electrophysiological studies have shown the presence of different types of interneurons within the EPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Third, some glomerular cell populations migrate into the bulb much earlier than previously thought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. And finally, it has been shown that external tufted cells indirectly connect glomeruli that are innervated by OSNs expressing a common receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Collectively, these data suggest that little is known about the different sub-types and developmental profiles of these cells. In one model, a subset of these EPL and/or GL cells could provide guidance information to OSNs. If this hypothesis is correct, then it should be possible to identify genes expressed by cells within these layers that are important for guidance and targeting.</p><p>Here we have undertaken a high resolution screen for genes that spatially define distinct regions of the EPL and GL. We used laser microdissection (LMD) coupled with RNA amplification, microarrays, bioinformatics, and <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization to search for genes that are differentially expressed by cells within these layers. We identified 23 such cDNAs and show that the superficial layers of the bulb can be subdivided into large regions based upon the various expression patterns. The patterns demonstrate the existence of gradients, localized expression domains, and medial-lateral symmetry within the olfactory bulb. Moreover, these patterns are maintained in cells that do not express <italic>Tbr1</italic>, consistent with the interpretation that they are expressed in non-projection neurons. We further show, using a chemical ablation paradigm, evidence consistent with the interpretation that these genes are expressed in cells that interact with OSNs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Spatial reconstruction of gene expression using laser microdissection</title><p>We performed our screen at embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5), as this is the first time that convergence is observed <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As the EPL and GL are not distinguishable at this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] our samples contained cells from both developing layers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We will refer to the regions where these samples were taken as the nascent EPL/GL. Only sections up to the front of the accessory olfactory bulb were used. These ~ 36 coronal sections were binned into three groups corresponding to anterior, middle, and posterior bulb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). As no prior genes have been identified as being spatially differentially expressed within the nascent EPL/GL, the size of each LMD sample, orientation, and location was chosen based on the ability to easily separate individual LMD samples. We also considered the known pattern of glomerular innervation by OSNs, which is shifted ~ 45&#x000b0; from vertical. We sampled cells from the dorsolateral (DL), dorsomedial (DM), ventrolateral (VL), and ventromedial (VM) nascent EPL/GL within each section (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Three sections were chosen from each group and four LMD isolates were obtained per section for a total of 36 isolates. RNA was isolated from the ~ 30&#x02013;50 cells within each sample, amplified, and applied to microarrays [see Methods].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Spatial reconstruction of gene expression using laser microdissection. </bold>Above left &#x02013; DAPI stain.

As a result, all 33,000 cDNAs on the array could be queried to identify those whose expression patterns indicate differential expression within the bulb. For example, we examined whether or not expression for any given gene was higher or lower in the VM aspect relative to the remainder of the bulb. Genes were grouped into four categories [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>] and the top 12 from each were tested by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization. Of the 48 cDNAs, nine did not have any detectable signal. Of the remaining 39, 20 were spatially differentially expressed (51%). In one category (VL/DL), 83% were spatially differentially expressed. These results speak to the sensitivity of our analysis, as all samples differ essentially only by position. We also examined a small subset of genes chosen based on annotation. These genes, which were all ranked within the top 50, were selected because they correspond to known, transmembrane-bound molecules. As such, they would be more likely to directly interact with OSNs and influence targeting. In total, 23 cDNAs were found to be spatially varied in expression. As expected, all identified cDNAs were differentially expressed within the nascent EPL/GL, as confirmed by DAPI labeling and double-label <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (see below). Expression was not necessarily exclusive to these layers, and was often observed in the mitral layer as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Spatial differential expression of candidate cues at E17.5</title><p>We used <italic>GAP43 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and DAPI staining as controls for our initial experiments. We found <italic>GAP43 </italic>to be evenly distributed throughout the mitral and EPL layers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;B</xref>). DAPI staining showed that slightly more cells are observed laterally in the anterior bulb, but in the middle and posterior bulb the distribution of cells appears uniform (data not shown). These controls served to distinguish whether or not any of our observed <italic>in situ </italic>patterns simply reflected the presence of increased numbers of cells at a given location within the bulb.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Spatially differentially expressed genes in E17.5 bulb</bold>.

However, not all cells in this lateral domain express <italic>Gicerin</italic>, as the pattern appears stippled. Expression is also observed in the nerve layer. Strikingly, in the middle bulb, expression of <italic>Gicerin </italic>appears symmetric in some areas about the ML and DV axes, with high levels observed in the DM and VL bulb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In more posterior bulb, these expression domains gradually become connected with one another along the DL surface, forming a crescent-shaped expression domain (data not shown). Expression in the VM aspect, however, remains low throughout the AP extent of the bulb.</p><p><italic>Connective tissue growth factor</italic>, or <italic>CTGF </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], is a secreted protein that is a member of a small family of genes which interact with the extracellular matrix and growth factors, and are important for angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the anterior bulb, <italic>CTGF </italic>is localized to the lateral aspect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Like <italic>Gicerin</italic>, this expression is not uniform and significantly higher expression occurs within a subset of these cells. In the middle and posterior bulb, as with <italic>Gicerin</italic>, expression is symmetric as higher <italic>CTGF </italic>expression is detected along the DM and VL surfaces (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). <italic>CTGF is </italic>weaker in the DL aspect and noticeably reduced in the VM bulb. <italic>CTGF </italic>is also expressed in cartilage and connective tissue surrounding the bulb.</p><p><italic>Zinc finger csl-type containing 3 (Zcsl3) </italic>is a protein of unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Throughout the AP axis, <italic>Zcsl3 </italic>is expressed in a gradient-like pattern that extends from the DM to the VL bulb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>), although expression tends to shift more ventrally in the middle bulb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>).</p><p>Protocadherins have been shown to possess both homophilic and heterophilic adhesion properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>Protocadherin 17 </italic>(<italic>Pcdh17</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]) is expressed throughout the bulb, but is enhanced in the anterior bulb along the VM aspect in a small subset of cells that extend into the EPL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). In the middle bulb, a small subset of cells in the VL nerve layer expresses this gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>). <italic>Protocadherin 7 </italic>(<italic>Pcdh7</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]) is expressed anteriorly most strongly along the medial aspect, although some signal can be seen laterally (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref>). Just beyond the anterior bulb, this pattern is reversed and <italic>Pcdh7 </italic>becomes strongest laterally, although some expression can still be detected medially (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L</xref>). This pattern is maintained throughout the posterior bulb (data not shown).</p><p><italic>Jagged1</italic>, a ligand for <italic>Notch</italic>, has been shown to be required for proper endothelial branching during angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the anterior bulb, <italic>Jagged1 </italic>is symmetrically expressed about the ML axis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2M</xref>). Expression of <italic>Jagged1 </italic>in these domains appears more even than that of <italic>Gicerin </italic>or <italic>CTGF</italic>, and no obvious high or low-expressing cells are observed within the expression domain. In the middle bulb, <italic>Jagged1 </italic>maintains this ML symmetry, but weaker expression connects the two subdomains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2N</xref>). A similar pattern is observed in posterior bulb (data not shown).</p><p>Although many of our genes are expressed in the nascent mitral layer, we emphasize that at least some expressing cells are located within the developing EPL. All of our <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization experiments were counterstained with DAPI so that we could correlate the location of the observed signal with the position of the nascent mitral and external plexiform layers. <italic>Delta4</italic>, another ligand for <italic>Notch </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], is expressed primarily within the mitral layer, and does not extend into the EPL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>). This can be seen both by DAPI staining and by the relatively compact expression pattern for this gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>). <italic>Jagged1</italic>, on the other hand, extends beyond the mitral layer into the EPL, and its expression domain is broader than that of <italic>Delta4 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2P</xref>). We further demonstrate that these genes are expressed in the nascent EPL/GL using double-label experiments and temporal analysis of their expression patterns, as described below.</p><p>These expression patterns underscore the strong spatial heterogeneity within the external plexiform layer. Moreover, they emphasize that there is variation along all three axes of the bulb. They also show for the first time that the bulb does indeed express genes that appear symmetric about the ML axis.</p></sec><sec><title>A spatially differentially expressed putative microRNA</title><p>Among the remaining 17 cDNAs, significantly enhanced expression was observed along the DV axis.

Although the signal for the <italic>miR-706 </italic>probe was weaker than that of the common element, punctate signal was also observed in the nascent EPL/GL in a similar pattern as well (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). These results contrast with those for the <italic>miR-138 </italic>probe, which bound weakly and uniformly to the nerve layer and EPL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). The miRNA <italic>in situ </italic>patterns that have been published in the mouse generally show uniform expression within a given layer or structure (e.g. <italic>miR-138</italic>), and/or are detected in specific cell-types.

For example, <italic>Gicerin </italic>symmetrically labels the DM and VL bulb, but symmetry about these axes has not been previously predicted. To obtain a more detailed understanding of the expression domains distinguished by these individual genes, we generated a three-dimensional reconstruction of gene expression for these genes within the bulb.</p><p>To produce these recreations, coronal sections from E17.5 bulbs were obtained every 60&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;m along the AP extent of the bulb for every gene.

A number of genes are uniformly expressed within cells derived from the bulb (e.g. <italic>Sema3A </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]), but it is difficult to understand how, given this uniform expression, these genes would guide OSN axons to different domains within the bulb. The lack of viable potential guidance cues has led instead to genetic approaches that ablated either whole classes of cell-types within the bulb (e.g. <italic>Tbr1</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]) or eliminated much of the bulb entirely (e.g. <italic>Extratoes</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). The absence of suitable molecular candidates that could potentially guide OSN axons to subdomains of the bulb has strongly inhibited any study of the role of the bulb in guidance.</p><p>In contrast, studies manipulating odorant receptor expression have led to models where the odorant receptor plays a significant role in guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The recent discovery that the <italic>Kirrel 2/3 </italic>and <italic>Ephrin/Eph A5 </italic>expression are controlled by odorant receptor activity provides new insight into how receptor choice influences glomerular positioning. However, in all of these receptor swap experiments, it is clear that the receptor alone does not mediate all aspects of glomerular targeting. The dorsal-ventral position of the OSN within the epithelium is thought to provide position-dependent information as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. But what genes comprise these position-dependent determinants, and what potential partners are bound by such determinants are still unknown. Moreover, why OSNs innervate both a medial and a lateral glomerulus has not been explained by studies manipulating odorant receptor expression. The presence of gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] or of mirror-symmetric expression patterns within the bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] have been suggested as potential explanations for how topographic OSN projection patterns are established. However, considerable disagreement exists over the role of the bulb in guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The role of bulbar projection neurons in guiding OSN axons has been examined using different genetic paradigms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These studies have suggested that these cells are not necessary for topographic convergence of OSNs. While these analyses only examined OSNs that express the P2 odorant receptor, mitral cell tracing studies also do not necessarily support a role for these cells in guidance. Mitral cell dendritic arbors initially are distributed among several glomeruli, but are refined during the first week of postnatal development to a single glomerulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is difficult to understand, if mitral cells do indeed express the primary cues needed for OSN guidance, why such cues would be distributed among multiple glomeruli initially, and the dendritic arbor refined only after convergence has been completed. But despite the fact that these studies indicate that mitral cells may not play a primary role in guidance, genetic ablation studies removing the entire bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] have shown that topographically correct convergence by P2-expressing OSNs does not occur. One interpretion of these results is that other cell-types within the bulb are important for providing guidance information to OSNs. We theorized that these cells correspond to those in the EPL and GL.</p><p>In this hypothesis-driven microarray-based experiment, we show that the nascent EPL/GL of the bulb can be subdivided into multiple domains based on the expression of our identified genes. At E17.5, the first time that convergence is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the anterior bulb can be distinguished molecularly both laterally (<italic>CTGF</italic>, <italic>Gicerin, Jagged1</italic>) and medially (<italic>Jagged1</italic>, <italic>Pcdh7</italic>). In the middle and posterior bulb, <italic>Zcsl3 </italic>is expressed in a gradient that extends from dorsal to ventrolateral, while a probe containing the <italic>miR-706 </italic>sequence is expressed in a subset of cells that span a similar region. Perhaps most interestingly, we find that <italic>Gicerin</italic>, <italic>CTGF</italic>, and <italic>Jagged1 </italic>are expressed in a symmetric manner. While it is well-known that OSNs project to medial and lateral glomeruli, the existence of mirror-symmetric cues has, to date, only been hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, our patterns suggest that this medial-lateral symmetry is more complex than previously thought. <italic>Gicerin and CTGF </italic>are roughly symmetric about both the DV and ML axes, while <italic>Jagged1 </italic>appears symmetric only around the ML axis. Thus, each hemi-bulb can be further distinguished based on dorsal or ventral expression of <italic>Gicerin </italic>and <italic>CTGF</italic>.</p><p>Several lines of evidence are consistent with the expression of these candidate cues within cells of the EPL. First, we show by counterstaining with DAPI that expression of these genes does not colocalize precisely with the nascent mitral layer. Second, we show at P3 and in adult that many of these genes are expressed in the EPL and GL, consistent with their expression at E17.5 in the nascent EPL/GL. Finally, we show that there are populations of cells at E17.5 that express our candidate genes but do not express <italic>Tbr1</italic>, a marker for projection neurons. Thus, we have shown using a variety of approaches that, in addition to mitral layer expression, nascent EPL/GL cells also express these genes.</p><p>Interestingly, in addition to the fact that not all cells that express our genes express <italic>Tbr1</italic>, the cells that do not express <italic>Tbr1 </italic>are those that show most clearly the differential expression patterns observed with our genes. For example, <italic>Pcdh17 </italic>is strongly and selectively expressed in a subset of cells in the VM aspect of the anterior bulb. These same cells do not express <italic>Tbr1</italic>. Thus, in <italic>Tbr1 </italic>mutant animals, we predict that these cells would not only be present, but that the observed differential expression patterns would also still be present. These cells may therefore provide a potential solution to the problem of which cells within the bulb could express guidance cues important for OSN guidance.</p><p>Mitral cells are known to mature in a medial-to-lateral fashion from E14&#x02013;E17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and a rostral-caudal wave of development occurs during glomerular formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, these developmental events cannot readily explain our various observed patterns. For example, <italic>Gicerin </italic>and <italic>CTGF </italic>are expressed in subsets of cells in the lateral domain in anterior bulb, while <italic>Jagged1 </italic>and <italic>Pcdh7 </italic>are expressed medially. Several of our genes are both medially and laterally expressed. It seems unlikely that these patterns can be explained solely on the basis of neuronal maturation events during development.</p><p>Are any of our identified cDNAs involved in guiding OSNs to the bulb? An alternative interpretation would be that these genes may be important for establishing intrabulbar circuits. External tufted cells are known to indirectly connect glomeruli innervated by a common population of OSNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, these genes may act to establish these connections. Yet another potential function of these genes can be suggested based on their expression in the mitral layer. These genes may act to mediate connectivity between projection neurons and higher cortical synaptic partners. Finally, these genes may not be involved in axon guidance <italic>per se</italic>, but instead are important for events surrounding synaptogenesis.</p><p>To provide support for the hypothesis these genes are important for guiding OSN axons, we used a chemical ablation approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Expression of <italic>Tyrosine hydroxylase </italic>(<italic>TH</italic>) is known to be down-regulated initially in ablated animals, but reappears as reinnervation of the bulb proceeds. Thus, <italic>TH </italic>expression is influenced by OSN innervation. Similarly, this approach has also been used to study <italic>Sema3A </italic>expression in axotomized bulbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In these experiments, normal expression of <italic>Sema3A </italic>is greatly reduced in axotomized bulbs. Expression is instead upregulated near the site of axotomy. Two months after ablation, <italic>Sema3A </italic>expression reappeared at its normal location. These results indicate that cells which interact with OSNs can display molecular alterations in their expression profile upon deafferentation. We showed that <italic>CTGF, Pcdh17</italic>, and <italic>Pcdh7 </italic>were altered in expression in response to ablation. Based on prior studies of <italic>TH</italic>, we conclude that these genes are expressed in cells that interact with OSNs.</p><p>We note that several of our candidate cues correspond to genes known to be important for guiding axons elsewhere in the nervous system (<italic>Pcdh7</italic>, <italic>Pcdh17</italic>, <italic>Gicerin</italic>), or are involved in angiogenesis (<italic>Jagged1</italic>, <italic>CTGF</italic>). <italic>CTGF </italic>and <italic>Gicerin </italic>are known to mediate cell-cell adhesion <italic>in vitro</italic>. Cadherins have been shown to be play multiple roles during development, from neurite outgrowth to synaptogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The changing patterns of expression of <italic>Pcdh7 </italic>and <italic>Pcdh17 </italic>during development may signal multiple roles as OSN innervation of the bulb proceeds. <italic>Pcdh7 </italic>and <italic>Pcdh17 </italic>may operate initially as guidance cues based on their differential expression within the bulb and epithelium. After growth of OSNs into the bulb, they may then act secondarily in synaptogenesis. While definitive proof requires genetic manipulation of the individual candidates, these genes provide novel targets that will enable new approaches towards determining the role of the bulb in guidance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified several genes whose expression patterns define various subdomains within the developing mouse olfactory bulb. We show that these genes are expressed in cells within the nascent EPL/GL and ML, and that some of these cells do not express <italic>Tbr1</italic>. Our regeneration paradigm suggests that these genes are expressed in cells that interact with OSNs. These genes therefore represent novel candidate guidance cues that may guide OSN axons to appropriate locations within the bulb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Swiss-Webster mice were used for all experiments.
