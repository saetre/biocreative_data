RASSF1A is a candidate tumor suppressor gene which was found to be inactivated in many human cancers. Although we have had a prelimilary cognition about the function of RASSF1A, the exact mechanisms about how RASSF1A functions in human cancers were largely unknown. Moreover, the effect of mutated K-Ras gene on the function of RASSF1A is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression profile and methylation status of RASSF1A gene, and to explore its concrete mechanisms as a tumor suppressor gene in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We examined the expression profile and methylation status of RASSF1A in two NPC cell lines, 38 primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 14 normal nasopharyngeal epithelia using RT-PCR and methylated specific PCR(MSP) respectively. 5-aza-dC was then added to confirm the correlation between hypermethylation status and inactivation of RASSF1A. The NPC cell line CNE-2 was transfected with exogenous pcDNA3.1(+)/RASSF1A plasmid in the presence or absence of mutated K-Ras by liposome-mediated gene transfer method. Flow cytometry was used to examine the effect of RASSF1A on cell cycle modulation and apoptosis. Meanwhile, trypan blue dye exclusion assays was used to detect the effect of RASSF1A transfection alone and the co-transfection of RASSF1A and K-Ras on cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Promoter methylation of RASSF1A could be detected in 71.05% (27/38) of NPC samples, but not in normal nasopharyngeal epithelia. RASSF1A expression in NPC primary tumors was lower than that in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). Expression of RASSF1A was down-regulated in two NPC cell lines. Loss of RASSF1A expression was greatly restored by the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-dC in CNE-2. Ectopic expression of RASSF1A in CNE-2 could increase the percentage of G0/G1 phase cells (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01), inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). Moreover, activated K-Ras could enhance the growth inhibition effect induced by RASSF1A in CNE-2 cells (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Expression of RASSF1A is down-regulated in NPC due to the hypermethylation of promoter. Exogenous expression of RASSF1A is able to induce growth inhibition effect and apoptosis in tumor cell lines, and this effect could be enhanced by activated K-Ras.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a serious and common cancer in Southern China. The tumorigenesis of NPC is a multistage process involving cellular genetic predisposition, epigenetic alterations, including the influence of environment factors, diet and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, the molecular basis leading to the development and spread of NPC remain largely unknown. Recent years, several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] showed that silence of tumor suppressor genes by epigenetic modification is a major mechanism for inactivation of cancer-related genes in the pathogenesis of human cancers. Cheng et al. reported that epigenetic events, including DNA methylation and chromatin structure changes, are among the earliest molecular alterations during malignant transformation of human mammary epithelial cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Methylation of the CpG islands of DNA promoter is the most important and common epigenetic mechanism leading to gene silence[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Consequently, identification of genes targeted by hypermethylation may provide insight into NPC tumorigenesis.</p><p>A numer of tumor suppressor genes have been implicated to harbor promoter methylation at CpG islands in NPC, such as RASSF1A (Ras association domain family 1 isoform A), p16, BLU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and recently LARS2 (leucyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial) was found to involve in this process[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. RASSF1A inactivation is essential for tumor development. Moreover, there is growing evidence demonstrating that a high frequency of methylation associated inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene RASSF1A was detected in a wide range of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Since methylation of the RASSF1A promoter is described as an early and frequent event in tumorigenesis, it could serve as a useful diagnostic signal in cancer screens. Previous studies suggested that RASSF1A may implicate in various cellular mechanisms including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] as well as repression of tumor formation in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of RASSF1A. The most interesting structure feature of RASSF1A proteins is the presence of a Ras association (RA) domain, which determines the role of RASSF1A protein functions as a Ras-effector, and endows RASSF1A the ability to interact with Ras family protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The Ras proteins are intimately involved in the regulation of a wide variety of biological processes by interacting with different downstream effectors. Although it is widely accepted that the Ras functions as an oncoprotein that contribute to cell proliferation through the RAS-MAP-kinase pathway and antiapoptotic effect, more and more studies found that it also induces growth arrest of cells, such as apoptosis and senescence by interact with specific effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. RASSF1A, act as a newly discovered downstream negative effector of Ras protein, may interact with Ras protein in a GTP-dependent manner and induce a potent, Ras-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we characterized the hypermethylation status of promoter of RASSF1A in NPC tumor biopsies and normal nasopharyngeal epithelia. Growth inhibition effect including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence was also observed in CNE-2 cells that were transfected with exogenous RASSF1A gene. Furthermore, we have initiated to figure out whether this tumor suppression effect of RASSF1A could be enhanced in the presence of activated Ras.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>NPC cell lines and tissue samples</title><p>Two NPC cell lines, CNE1 and CNE2 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C.

The transcript A and C were expressed in all normal tissues, but RASSF1A expression was impaired in a number of lung tumor cell lines and in several other cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Loss of expression was correlated with methylation of the CpG-island promoter sequence of RASSF1A. Reintroduction of RASSF1A in SCLC lines reduces colony formation, suppressed anchorage-independent growth and inhibited tumor formation in nude mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, it was reported that Rassf1a-knockout mice are apt to suffer from various cancers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These characteristics lead to a proposal that the RASSF1A isoform is the major tumor suppressor gene inactivated in many kinds of tumors by promoter methylation, which is the major mechanism for inactivation of RASSF1A since an observation of point mutation in RASSF1A gene was found to be a rare event in a majority of human cancers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Chow et al. and Steinmann et al. demonstrated that RASSF1A is a critical tumor suppressor gene harboring with high frequency of promoter methylation, which is located on 3p21.3 in NPC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we detected that RASSF1A mRNA expression was down-regulated in NPC cell lines and primary tumors. Methylation specific PCR and RT-PCR analysis also revealed a correlation between RASSF1A expression level and methylation status in NPC cell lines, primary tumors and normal epithelial. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment further confirmed that promoter hypermethylation contributes to the lack of expression of RASSF1A in the NPC cell lines. Base on these findings, hypermethylated DNA could be served as a potential molecular tumor marker that distinguishes cancers from normal tissues.</p><p>Our MSP analysis showed that RASSF1A methylation was frequent in NPC, as the RASSF1A promoter region was subjected to methylation in 71.05% of the primary tumors, the two NPC cell lines that we examined were also both partial methylation. In addition, our findings of a lack of RASSF1A methylation in the normal nasopharyngeal epithelia support the fact that epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A is a tumor specific process. Moreover, hypermethylation of RASSF1A can be detected in both early-stage and advanced NPC tumors, suggesting that RASSF1A gene promoter methylation might play an important role in the early development of nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis.</p><p>Although the fact that a high frequency of promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A that function as a tumor suppressor is widely accepted by many researchers, and the growth inhibition effect of RASSF1A in CNE-2 cells was observed by trypan blue dye exclusion assays in our present studies. However, the regulation and mechanism of action of RASSF1A remain a topic of intense investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It appears that like many other critical tumor suppressors, RASSF1A is multifunctional, thus, inactivation of RASSF1A may impact many different facets of tumor biology. <italic>In vitro </italic>expression of RASSF1A in H1299 lung carcinoma cells inhibited cell cycle progression by negatively regulating the accumulation of cyclin D1 through a posttranscriptional mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It was reported that RASSF1A overexpression in gastric carcinoma cell lines led to a cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, and activator protein-1(AP-1) is necessary for this process[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A recent research indicated that SKP-2, an oncogenic subunit of an ubiquitin ligase complex, which founctions as a critical regulator of S phase progression, could promote degradation of RASSF1A at the G1/S checkpoint and then lead to the cell cycle proceeding in hepatocellular carcinoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In our study, we further confirmed the ability of RASSF1A to induce cell cycle arrest in NPC cell line CNE-2. Furthermore, RASSF1A was found to be capable of inducing apoptosis in our result although it was not observed by some other study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Previous studies indicated that there are several different apoptotic pathways that RASSF1A is said to be involved in. It was observed by Vos et al. that RASSF1A can activate Bax via MOAP-1(a Bax binding protein) and activated K-Ras, thus, RASSF1A and MOAP-1 synergize to induce Bax activation and cell death[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Also, RASSF1A was found to invovled in death receptor-dependent apoptosis through MOAP-1. Upon tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) stimulation, MOAP-1 associates with the TNF receptor 1, subsequently, RASSF1A was recruited to this complex and then participates in the death receptor-dependent apoptosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The Ras-signaling pathway also plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Although Ras oncoproteins were initially characterized as suppressor of apoptosis, it is now clear that they also have the ability to promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation, that serve as a protective mechanism[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The Ras family proteins are a group of membrane-bound small GTPase which comprise 21 members such as H-Ras, K-Ras and N-Ras. As a negative effector of Ras, RASSF1A may shift the balance of Ras signaling pathway toward a cell growth inhibition including senescence, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Several studies have confirmed the ablilty of RASSFs family to interact with different Ras family proteins. RASSF1A is a pro-apoptosis protein that has a potential Ras association (RA) domain, which makes the RASSF1A has the theoretical potential to bind to Ras directly <italic>in vitro</italic>, and form a complex with activated K-Ras when overexpressed in cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This suggests that it may function as an effector for Ras. However, some authors have failed to see direct binding between Ras and RASSF1A, they suggest that the interaction is indirect or RASSF1A alone binds only weakly to Ras protein due to heterodimerization of RASSF1A with NORE1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. But RASSF2, another member of RASSFs family, is thought to possess the ability to bind directly to K-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner via its RA domain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In our studies, we have hypothesized that RASSF1A may serve as an effector that mediate Ras-associated growth inhibition effect, including Ras-dependent apoptosis. Consequently, to examine the potential modulation of RASSF1A activity by Ras, we decided to measure the consequence of activated K-Ras12V expression on RASSF1A-induced growth arrest of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. The expression of mutated K-Ras which is an activated form of this gene is rare in nasopharyngeal carcinoma but is common in some other tumor types, with as high as 90% in pancreatic carcinomas, 30% in NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. As we could observed, RASSF1A has an endogenous ability to promote apoptosis in CNE-2 cells, however, this activity is indeed dramatically stimulated by activated K-Ras in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines CNE-2, which is contrast to the observations by Shivakumar <italic>et al </italic>in mammary adenocarcinoma cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although we were unable to explore the concrete association mechanism between RASSF1A and activated Ras, synergistic effect of the co-expression of the two genes could be confirmed by cell death assays and apoptosis analysis. These data leading to the possibility that Ras may positively regulate the activity of endogenous RASSF1A. In addition, a mutual exclusion between RASSF1A inactivation by methylation and K-Ras mutation was observed in a number of human cancers such as pancreatic cancer and endometrial carcinoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], supporting the association of RASSF1A with the Ras signaling pathways.</p><p>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a radiosensitive cancer. The early-diagnosed patients who receive the treatment of radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy would accquire a high curative rate. A reliable molecular marker need to be identified to diagnose and predict the progression and prognosis of NPC. It was reported by Chang et al. that a high detection rate of tumor surpressor genes such as RASSF1A could be evaluated in peripheral blood, mouth and throat rinsing fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs of NPC patients, indicating the potential role of epigenetic events in non-invasive screening of NPC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Moreover, inactivation of RASSF1A was found to be correlated with lymph node metastasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and tumor stage in NPC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], however, it was not observed in our group. These investigations support the possibility of methylation of tumor suppressor genes could be a sensitive marker in diagnosing and predicting nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis. Although hypermethylation of the promoter sequence is the major mechanism that leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, fortunately, this modified process could be reversed as there is no alterations on the gene sequences, employment of the demethylated agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine could induce the recovery of the function of these tumor suppressor gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and it indeed happened in NPC. This suggests that alteration of the epigenetic changes of the gene would be a new way of tumor therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the expression of RASSF1A was markedly reduced or completely lost in primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma compared with normal nasopharyngeal epithelia, and was correlated to hypermethylation of the promoter of the RASSF1A gene. The tumor suppressor function of this gene involved in cell cycle arrest, inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, our study confirmed that these growth-inhibitory properties could be enhanced by activated K-Ras, although the physiological interaction between Ras and RASSF1A has yet to be elucidated. Further studies are needed to be focused on understanding the molecular mechanism of RASSF1A activity. In a word, RASSF1A represents an important potential diagnostic and therapeutic target and the loss or inactivation of RASSF1A may be a critical component of the evolution of Ras-dependent tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WT and WG supervised the design of the experiments and analysed and interpreted of data.
