The study was aimed at characterizing the CD14 gene of cattle for sequence variations and to determine the effect of variations on the expression of the protein on the surfaces of monocytes and neutrophils in healthy dairy cows.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Five SNPs were identified: two within the coding regions (g.A1908G and g.A2318G, numbering is according to GenBank No. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU148609">EU148609</ext-link>), one in the 5' (g.C1291T) and two in the 3' (g.A2601G and g.G2621T) untranslated regions.

Protein variant A is more common in the breeds analyzed. All SNPs gave rise to 3 haplotypes for the breeds. SNP genotype 1908AG was significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.01) associated with a higher percentage of neutrophils expressing more CD14 molecules on their surfaces. The promoter region contains several transcription factor binding sites, including multiple AP-1 and SP1 sites and there is a high conservation of amino acid residues between the proteins of closely related species.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study has provided information on sequence variations within the CD14 gene and proteins of cattle. The SNP responsible for an amino acid exchange may play an important role in the expression of CD14 on the surfaces of neutrophils. Further observations involving a larger sample size are required to validate our findings. Our SNP and association analyses have provided baseline information that may be used at defining the role of CD14 in mediating bacterial infections. The computational analysis on the promoter and comparative analysis with other species has revealed regions of regulatory element motifs that may indicate important regulatory effects on the gene.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The bovine cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 is an important player in host innate immunity in that it mediates host defense against Gram-negative bacterial infections and also confers immunity against viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is abundant (about 99,500 to 134,600) on the cell membrane of monocytes and to a lesser extent (about 1,900 to 4,400) on neutrophils (polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Two forms exist, a membrane bound form (mCD14) and a soluble (sCD14) form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. sCD14 is known to confer lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sensitivity to cells lacking mCD14, including epithelial cells and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Also, recombinant bovine sCD14 can sensitize mammary epithelial cells to low concentrations of LPS <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>thus indicating an important role of sCD14 in initiating host responses to Gram-negative bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. During the periparturient period, individual variations have been noticed in the response of cows to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, sequence variations of the CD14 gene may play important roles in the presentation of CD14 molecules and thus, LPS sensitivity.</p><p>The CD14 gene of cattle was initially cloned and sequenced by Ikeda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and recently by the bovine genome project. It is mapped to BTA 7. A SNP of human CD14 promoter has been shown to influence the activities of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Baldini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] reported a SNP in the human CD14 gene promoter involving a C to T transition at position -159 (or -260 by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]), and associated TT homozygotes with significantly higher levels of sCD14 and lower levels of IgE in children as compared to carriers of TC or CC. Reports of association of the -159 CD14 polymorphism with several human disease conditions have emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Other authors however did not find any association between this polymorphism and several diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Despite the importance of this protein and the effect of the promoter polymorphism in humans, there is no report of sequence variations of this gene in cattle and their possible effects on circulating CD14 levels and disease susceptibility.</p><p>The objectives of this study were therefore to: (1) investigate the CD14 gene of cattle for sequence variations; (2) determine the effect of variations on CD14 expression on the surfaces of monocytes and neutrophils; and (3) use bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize the promoter region. In this study we present information on sequence variations within the CD14 gene of Canadian Holstein and Jersey cows and a possible role of one SNP in influencing the surface expression of the antigen on the surfaces of neutrophils. Furthermore, identified conserved regions of regulatory element motifs may have important regulatory effects on the gene. The results may provide baseline information that may be used in candidate gene studies aimed at defining the role of CD14 in mediating bacterial infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SNPs in the CD14 gene of Canadian Holsteins and Jersey cows</title><p>Comparison of the CD14 sequences of 106 Canadian Holsteins and 46 Jersey cows with published sequences (GenBank Nos. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NW_001495367">NW_001495367</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="D84509">D84509</ext-link>) revealed a total of five SNPs including one in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) (g.C1291T, numbering is according to GenBank No. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU148609">EU148609</ext-link>), two in the coding regions (g.A1908G and g.A2318G) and two in the 3' UTR (g.A2601G and g.G2621T) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Four of the SNPs are transitional mutations while SNP 2621 involves the transversion of guanine to thymine.

The results are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, a higher percentage of gated monocyte cells were found in the LogFITC region labeled M2 (log10<sup>2 </sup>and above) which indicates a higher fluorescence intensity coming from cells with the most CD14 antigens on their surfaces and termed the high expression region. On the other hand, more neutrophils were in the M1 or low expression region (Log10<sup>1 </sup>to 10<sup>2</sup>). The mean channel fluorescence (MCF) intensities (for all cows) observed for the gated regions were M1 = 32.04 (range 16.67 &#x02013; 65.18), M2 = 288.97 (149.85 &#x02013; 566.47) and M3 = 201.44 (73.57 &#x02013; 437.56) for monocytes and M1 = 22.76 (16.20 &#x02013; 35.52), M2 = 267.33 (148.26 &#x02013; 536.87) and M3 = 34.76 (19.49&#x02013;60.83) for neutrophils. As presented, the M3 (M1 + M2) MCF intensity for monocyte was higher than for neutrophils. SNP A1908G that changes amino acid 175Asn to Asp, and thus protein A to B, is significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.01) associated with a higher number of neutrophils in the M2 or higher expression zone. 7.26% of gated neutrophils from cows of genotype 1908AG were found in M2 as compared to 4.36% from cows of genotype 1908AA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

The analysis revealed extensive conservations in the amino acid composition and structure. For the bovine proteins, the sequence of <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="ABV68569">ABV68569</ext-link> is the same as <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAA21517">BAA21517</ext-link> while <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AAD32215">AAD32215</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP_776433">NP_776433</ext-link> differed from <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="ABV68569">ABV68569</ext-link> by having amino acid 209 changed from Ser to Thr. This indicates the presence of a further CD14 protein variant in cattle here named C. Furthermore, the amino acids of the CD14 proteins of buffalo, sheep and goat shared high conservation rates of 97.05%, 95.17%, and 87.40% respectively, with the bovine <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="ABV68569">ABV68569</ext-link>, followed by pig (76.94%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The rate of amino acid conservation of bovine A variant was less with the human (72.39%), mouse (61.66%) and rat (60.59%) proteins. While bovine, buffalo, goat, sheep and pig proteins are made up of 373 amino acids, the human protein has two more, and the rat and mouse have one more and seven less animo acids, respectively. The signal peptide, made up of the first 20 amino acids, was highly conserved (only one amino acid difference, 14Ser to Pro) between the bovine and buffalo/goat/sheep proteins. The difference between cattle and the pig was 4 amino acids while being highly diverged with human, mouse and rat (7 to 12 amino acid differences). These relationships were further represented phylogenetically (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

A gene is made up of both coding and non-coding regions which are all important in its expression and functionality. The complete description of a gene must therefore contain necessary information about the protein coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and non-coding regions. The CD14 gene is an important component in host immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and detailed information on its structure and sequence variations as shown in this study may provide further insight into its mode of action.</p><p>The coding region SNPs in our study and comparative analysis of our sequences with published sequences show that the CD14 gene of cattle codes for three putative CD14 proteins-A (GenBank No. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="ABV68569">ABV68569</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="ABV68570">ABV68570</ext-link>), B (GenBank No. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="ABV68571">ABV68571</ext-link>) and C (UniProt AAD32215 and UniProt NP_776433), with A and B described herein. The A variant, fixed in Jerseys and with a high frequency of 88.6% in Holsteins, may be the original wild type allele for the gene. Furthermore, the sequence of UniProt BAA21517 is similar to variant A and the haplotyes that contain the A variant SNPs are at the highest frequencies in the studied breeds. The other variants may therefore be the result of recent mutational events. Further three SNPs described in the 5' and 3'UTRs and one synonymous SNP in the coding region of the gene indicates a higher sequence variation for the gene in Canadian Holsteins than Jerseys.</p><p>The variations, both in the coding and non-coding regions of the gene may affect the surface expression of CD14 molecules on monocytes and neutrophils. Interestingly, the coding region SNP that gave rise to the B variant of the protein (g.A1908G or p.Asn175Asp) had the greatest effect by being associated with the highest number of neutrophils expressing more CD14 molecules on their surfaces. It is well known that, monocytes express more CD14 receptors on their surfaces, about 99,500 to 134,600 as compared to 1,900 to 4,400 for neutrophils (3). This difference was clearly shown by the pattern of expression depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> whereby, more monocytes were recorded in the M2 gated zone (region of higher expression) and more neutrophils in the M1 zone (lower expression). These results suggest that, the characteristic B protein SNP or g.A1908G may play a role in cell surface expression of CD14 on neutrophils. Also, the SNP in the 5'UTR region could be important in influencing the expression of this receptor on monocytes. Our data was however based on a small sample size necessitating further verifications on a larger scale. Neutrophils form a major line of defense against bacterial infections and their effectiveness depends on their availability at the site of infections. For Gram-negative bacterial infections, the CD14 molecule confers LPS sensitivity to neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which is necessary to initiate host immune responses. The complex of TLR4, CD14 and myeloid differentiation protein 2, enhanced by the presence of LPS binding protein is crucial in LPS signaling; leading to the release of cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Even though no promoter polymorphism was detected in this study, a promoter polymorphism of the gene in human is a risk factor in several diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The promoter region in bovine may probably be under strong purifying selection which may explain the lack of SNPs in this region. This is a positive factor considering the important role of the gene in mediating Gram-negative bacteria attack and the possible effect of the 1908 SNP on the abundance of the molecule on the surfaces of neutrophils. Determination of the roles of the individual SNPs and haplotypes on the activities of the gene under disease conditions will further shed more light on their biological significance.</p><p>Our analysis on promoter characterization indicates that part of the exon 1 reported by Ikeda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] constitutes the promoter. Since evolutionary pressures lead to the conservation of important non-protein-coding regulatory regions, including transcription factor binding sites (TFBs) across closely related species, identification of TFBs described in the CD14 genes of human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] in the present study was expected. In particular, the perfect conservation of the TATA box, 9 motifs of 6 REs motifs across cattle, human, rat, mouse and pig and 4 other motifs across at least 4 of these species including cattle shows common regions in the core promoter that act together in the same biological context to control the expression of gene products and functions. In our study, up to 5 SP1 and 8 AP1 sites (with no bp mismatch) were identified which may indicate possible roles in controlling the expression of the gene as demonstrated in the rat and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the rat, Lui et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] through mobility shift assays demonstrated that the SP1 and AP1 elements located respectively at positions -836 and -270 were required for basal promoter activity in liver cells. Also, Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] showed that the SP1 transcription factor bound to three different regions of the human CD14 promoter and that a mutation of the major SP1 binding site decreased tissue specific promoter activity. One of the AP1 sites in our study, also shared by c-Fos and c-Jun (position 960&#x02013;967, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), is similar to an AP1 site in rat promoter were JunD and Fra-2 proteins have been shown to bind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This site is also thought to transactivate the basal expression of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This site in the mouse also plays a major role in the expression of the CD14 gene in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, three motifs of PEA3 interestingly were conserved in the promoters of all species studied. PEA3 belongs to the ETS transcription factor super family and is known to appear on the promoters of many cellular genes, including HER-2/neu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and CD226 antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Conservation of C/EBP or CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins motifs in the studied species may be explained by their involvement in many aspects of cell growth. The high conservation of the amino acids of the proteins of bovine, buffalo, sheep and goat proteins was reflected in the tree of their phylogenetic relationships and is in line with other studies that found a high rate of conservation of genes and protein coding nucleotide positions between bovine, sheep and goat genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This further supports the fact that information from the sequencing of the bovine genome will greatly enhance studies in other very closely related species.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, this study provides information on sequence variations of the CD14 gene of Canadian Holstein and Jersey cows. The identified variations and association data have provided information that may shade more light on cell surface expression of CD14 by neutrophils, which are needed to control bacterial infections. Further data on the biological significance of the mutations is however necessary. Our computational analysis highlighted on the regulatory element motifs present in the promoter region of the gene. The comparative analysis with other species revealed conserved regions of regulatory element motifs that may have important regulatory effects on the gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and genomic DNA extraction</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood of 106 Canadian Holstein cows kept at the Howard Webster Centre-Macdonald Teaching Farm, McGill University and the milks of 46 Jersey cows enrolled in the Quebec Dairy Production Centre of Expertise program <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.valacta.com"/> using Nucleospin Blood Mini Kit (Macherey-Nagel Inc.

Blood was collected from the caudal vein of 64 Holstein cows with known CD14 genotypes by venipuncture into vacutainer tubes coated with heparin anticoagulant (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). After collection, samples were stored on ice and analyzed within four hours. One hundred microlitre of heparinized whole blood was placed in a 12 &#x000d7; 75 mm flow cytometric (FCM) tube and incubated with 10 &#x003bc;L of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled mouse anti human CD14 antibody (ABD Serotec Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA). This was mixed (Barnstead Thermolyne, Dubuque, IOWA, USA) thoroughly and incubated at room temperature on an orbitron rotator (Boekel Ind. Inc., PA, USA) for 30 minutes. Lysis and fixation of erythrocytes was done by adding 2 mL of lysing solution (PHAGOTEST<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Kit, Orpegen Pharma, Heidelberg, Germany) to the mixture. This was mixed gently, incubated for 20 minutes on an orbitron rotator at room temperature and centrifuged at 250 g for 5 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was aspirated leaving approximately 400 &#x003bc;L of cells in the FCM tube. This was washed with 3 mL of Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) pH 7.2 (Life Technologies) by centrifuging at 250 g for 5 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was aspirated as described above and the cells resuspended in 1 mL of DPBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson Immunocytochemistry Systems, San Jos&#x000e9;, CA, USA) within 30 minutes. Excitation of samples was at 488 nm; with FITC fluorescence measured at 525 nm &#x000b1; 10 nm. Acquisition was stopped when 20,000 gated events were collected in the fluorescence cell count histogram. Gating of monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes was based on forward scatter and side scatter dot plots by encircling the populations with amorphous regions. All parameters were recorded with logarithmic amplifications. List mode flow cytometric data from 20,000 events were stored and processed with the Windows Multiple Document Interface for flow cytometry (WinMDI) software version 2.8 (Joseph Trotter, The Sripps Research Institute, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://facs.scripps.edu/software.html"/>) on a personal computer.</p><p>The viability of neutrophils and monocytes in whole blood was determined by propidium iodide (PI) exclusion (50 &#x003bc;g/mL, final concentration) using flow cytometry after cells were incubated for 10 minutes in the dark at room temperature.
