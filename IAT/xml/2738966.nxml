These immature dendritic cells (iDCs) do not exhibit considerable APC's activity; only after antigen contact, the maturation process takes place. These iDC recognize microbial structures such as Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) and Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMP) using Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs). During this process, an increase of MHC-II molecules as well as co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80, CD86 and CD40, allows DCs to become potent APCs. Additionally, a change in their chemokine receptor expression is important for migration from peripheral tissues, via afferent lymphatics, to the T cell areas of regional lymph nodes (LN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-Sallusto1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-Saeki1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Chemokines are small chemotactic cytokines (8&#x02013;10 kDa) that regulate migration and localization of leukocytes in different tissues. Different cell types, including stromal, epithelial and endothelial cells, secrete chemokines, both under inflammatory and homeostatic conditions. Chemokines bind to 7-transmembrane domain G-protein coupled receptors (7TM-GPCR). Among these receptors, CCR7 is highly expressed on mature DCs, and its ligands, CCL21 and CCL19 are expressed in LN and spleen. Moreover, CCL21 is expressed in high endothelium venules (HEV) and in the lymphatic endothelium of multiple tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-Tanabe1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, DCs from CCR7 deficient mice fail to form dermal &#x0201c;cords&#x0201d; at the dermal lymphatic vessels, and show impaired migration into LN. Consequently, these incorrectly localized DCs are incapable to promote appropriate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-Ohl1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

More interestingly, CCL19 and CCL21 have recently been involved in DC maturation, by enhancing the up-regulation of CD86 and CD40 expression markers, whereas CCL19 stimulation also led to increased secretion of IL-12, IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-Marsland1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> from DCs.

Thus, a mechanism by which the lack of Jak3 could negatively affect their maturation might be through a deficiency in the CCR7 signalling pathway. In contrast, expression of costimulation markers on mature DCs after stimulation with IL-4 appeared to be independent of Jak3.

Furthermore, our results demonstrated that DCs from Jak3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are fully capable of leaving the epidermis.</p><p>DCs leaving the epidermis into the dermis locate along the lymphatic vessels of the dermis to form the so-called &#x0201c;cords&#x0201d;. The formation of these structures may be of relevance during the entry process into these vessels.

Similarly, our data showed that DCs from the Jak3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> are greatly impaired in their ability to form these dermal &#x0201c;cords&#x0201d;.</p><p>In addition, we analysed the ability of DCs to induce T cell proliferation in the absence of Jak3. We found that allogeneic T lymphocyte proliferation is significantly reduced after contact with Jak3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs when a ratio 1&#x02236;20 (DC: T cell) was used compared to the proliferation obtained with Jak3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> DCs at the same ratio. This decreased proliferation <bold>might be explained by</bold> a defective expression of costimulatory molecules in the Jak3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs and/or to decreased DCs cytokine production. When increased ratios of Jak3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DC: T cell were used, normal levels of proliferation were obtained, indicating that increasing the number of DCs can compensate the difference in the levels of costimulatory molecule expression. Since only 10&#x00025; of the total T lymphocyte repertoire recognizes MHC alloantigens, increasing the number of MHC-peptide complexes augmented the efficiency of peptide recognition on the allogeneic DCs. In this context, previous reports from others and from our laboratory (data not shown) using an OVA TCR-specific transgenic system, reported no significant differences in T lymphocyte activation in the absence of Jak3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-Yamaoka1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Next, to evaluate <italic>in vivo</italic> DC-mediated functions, CHS assays using DNFB were performed. A subsequent antigen challenge induces activation of macrophages and lymphocytes primarily, leading to inflammation. To reach the lymph nodes, the DCs should enter the lymphatic vessels. The evidence that Jak3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs were unable to form &#x0201c;cords&#x0201d; around the lymphatic vessels and that they did not reach the lymph nodes after adoptive transfer, is consistent with the fact that inflammation in the CHS responses, measured as the ear thickness obtained after challenge, was always lower in the skin of Jak3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to that of Jak3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice. Interestingly, even though untreated Jak3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice consistently presented thicker ears than Jak3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice, ear thickness did not increase after challenge in the Jak3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In addition, although challenge of Jak3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with DNFB induced significant cell recruitment at the site of inflammation compared to mice treated with the vehicle, the cell counts were much lower that those seen in Jak3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice. These results correlate with the <italic>in vivo</italic> data showing a decrease in the number of migrating DCs reaching the draining LN, which may result in decreased T cell activation. In addition, since Jak3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice lack peripheral LN, it is likely that cognate T lymphocyte activation takes place in another secondary lymphoid organ, such as the spleen. In this context, in the <italic>plt/plt</italic> mice, where entry of T lymphocytes and DCs to the LN is greatly impaired, a proportion of T cell responses are shifted to the spleen.

A) Homeostatic Conditions: LC exit slowly from epidermis in a multistep process that may take several days. 1). Molecules such as JAM-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-Cera1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and others, such as Jak3, mediate retention of Dendritic Cells in epidermis. Under homeostatic conditions, LC leave the epidermis towards the dermis in a process independent of CCR7. 2). LC enter into the lymph vessels to initiate migration to lymph nodes. This process involves participation of molecules such as CD47 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-Van1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and CCR7-CCL21. LC precursors present in the dermis are responsible to repopulate lymph node under steady state conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-Merad1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. B) Inflammatory state: LCs leave the epidermis in a coordinated process that includes several steps. 1). After sensing or capture of antigen, LCs leave the epidermis by a CCR7-independent mechanism. In this work we find that similar to this, the LCs do not need Jak3 to leave the epidermis. 2). To get entry into the lymphatic vessels and arrival to LNs, it has been demonstrated that LCs are dependent of CCR7 and other molecules as LT4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-DelPrete1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, MMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-Ratzinger1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007066-Kabashima2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Jak3 may also be involved in this process. 3). CCR2&#x0002b; GR1&#x0002b; blood precursors are important to restore the LC population after inflammation. Chemokine-mediated signalling through the Jak-Stat pathway, and in particular Jak3 may also be important, as it is demonstrated in the present report</p><p>(1.40 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007066.s002.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We want to thank Dr. Laura Bonifaz for providing GMCSF, Rams&#x000e9;s Ch&#x000e1;vez, Beatriz Hernandez, Juana Calder&#x000f3;n, Ver&#x000f3;nica Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Mata, Judith Reyes-Ruiz and G.
