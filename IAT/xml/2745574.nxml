However, the IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; dependent mechanisms underlying innate anti-viral functions within the CNS are poorly understood. The role of RNase L in viral encephalomyelitis was explored based on its functions in inhibiting translation, inducing apoptosis, and propagating the IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; pathway through RNA degradation intermediates. Infection of RNase L deficient (RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice with a sub-lethal, demyelinating mouse hepatitis virus variant revealed that the majority of mice succumbed to infection by day 12 p.i. However, RNase L deficiency did not affect overall control of infectious virus, or diminish IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; expression in the CNS. Furthermore, increased morbidity and mortality could not be attributed to altered proinflammatory signals or composition of cells infiltrating the CNS. The unique phenotype of infected RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was rather manifested in earlier onset and increased severity of demyelination and axonal damage in brain stem and spinal cord without evidence for enhanced neuronal infection. Increased tissue damage coincided with sustained brain stem infection, foci of microglia infection in grey matter, and increased apoptotic cells. These data demonstrate a novel protective role for RNase L in viral induced CNS encephalomyelitis, which is not reflected in overall viral control or propagation of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; mediated signals. Protective function is rather associated with cell type specific and regional restriction of viral replication in grey matter and ameliorated neurodegeneration and demyelination.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Initial spread of viruses is controlled by type I interferon induced antiviral molecules. Early intervention with viral replication is especially critical in central nervous system infections to reduce loss of non-renewable cells and mitigate immune pathology. One of the best characterized anti-viral mechanisms is mediated by ribonuclease L (RNase L). RNase L exerts activity at multiple levels, including degradation of viral and host RNA, induction of apoptosis, and propagation of the IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; pathway. Recent studies suggest that RNase L antiviral activity is dependent on the virus, as well as the cell type and tissue infected. This study demonstrates that RNase L protects mice infected with a sub-lethal, demyelinating neurotropic <italic>coronavirus</italic> by ameliorating encephalitis and morbidity, albeit without affecting control of infectious virus or IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; expression. RNase L specifically protected the brain stem from sustained infection and prevented spread of virus to microglia/macrophages located in spinal cord grey matter. The subtle regional alteration in tropism in the absence of RNase L coincided with increased apoptotic cells and earlier onset as well as increased severity of axonal damage and demyelination. The results demonstrate how subtle regional alterations in viral tropism within the CNS may severely affect the balance between neuroprotection and neurotoxicity mediated by microglia/macrophages.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type I interferon (IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) induced anti-viral responses are critical for the initial control of most virus infections. Although anti-viral responses are initiated in infected cells, they act in an autocrine and paracrine fashion, antagonizing virus replication in host cells and inducing a protective anti-viral state in neighboring cells. The anti-viral state is distinguished by the expression of numerous IFN stimulated genes (ISG), which directly or indirectly interfere with both viral and host RNA transcription and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Borden1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Many of these pathways can also result in the apoptosis of infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-GarciaSastre1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, the relative contributions of these various anti-viral effector mechanisms to overall virus control differ with the virus as well as the tissue and cell type infected.</p><p>The best characterized anti-viral mechanisms are mediated by activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and the 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-oligoadenylatesynthase (OAS)/ribonuclease L (RNase L) pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Silverman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Garcia1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon recognition of double-stranded RNA, the OAS family of proteins convert ATP into unique, unstable 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-A oligomers, which are bound by latent RNase L monomers, driving the dimerization and activation of RNase L. Activated RNase L cleaves single-stranded RNA, 3&#x02032; of U-A and U-U sites found in both viral and cellular RNA. RNase L endoribonuclease activity is thus not limited to viral RNA, but also degrades host cell RNA, including ribosomal RNA. As OAS genes are stimulated by IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, elevated OAS levels enhance the anti-viral state in adjacent, non-infected cells responding to IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;. Nevertheless, inappropriate activation of RNase L is counterbalanced by the unstable nature of 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032;A oligomers and the endogenous RNase L inhibitor, RL1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Bisbal1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. A novel aspect of the OAS/RNase L pathway is the cleavage of host RNA releasing free 3&#x02032;-monophosphates that can activate the cytoplasmic RNA helicases RIG-I and Mda-5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Malathi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Recognition by these pattern recognition receptors initiates IFN-&#x003b2; transcription, similar to the activation mediated by recognition of specific viral RNA structures. RNase L thus not only exerts anti-viral effects via RNA degradation and apoptosis, but also has the capacity to amplify and prolong expression of anti-viral genes and other ISGs.</p><p>The anti-viral activity of the OAS/RNase L system has been studied in several virus infections <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Silverman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Silverman2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Protective mechanisms of the OAS/RNase L pathway are generally more evident for RNA relative to DNA virus infections. However, the contribution of RNase L to disease severity and viral control varies significantly depending on the virus and even virus strain studied, presumably reflecting the diverse mediators and targets of these anti-viral mediators. For example, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) replication was only modestly increased in RNase L deficient (RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, consistent with enhanced susceptibility to infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although RNase L prolonged survival, mortality rates of infected RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and control mice were similar. Furthermore, IFN-&#x003b2; treatment increased the survival time of infected wild-type (wt) and to a lesser extent RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, indicating that alternate IFN-dependent anti-viral mechanisms act in the absence of RNase L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Zhou1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, the requirement for RNase L activity to protect from another <italic>picornavirus</italic>, Coxsackievirus B4, was evident by significantly increased mortality rates of infected RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared to wt mice. However, increased mortality was not the result of uncontrolled virus replication, as virus titers were only slightly elevated within pancreatic islet cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. By contrast, pancreatic islet cells derived from RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, treated with IFN-&#x003b1; and infected <italic>in vitro</italic> exhibited increased virus replication and loss of cellular integrity, compared to IFN-&#x003b1; treated RNase L sufficient cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-FlodstromTullberg1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These results revealed distinct differences in direct anti-viral functions of RNase L <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Cell type specific effects of anti-viral RNase L activity are also clearly evident from studies with West Nile virus (WNV). While mouse embryonic fibroblasts display RNase L dependent anti-viral activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Scherbik1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, IFN-&#x003b2; treatment revealed no affect of RNase L in reducing WNV replication in either cortical or peripheral motor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Samuel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, a modest effect was observed in bone marrow derived macrophages, consistent with increased viral burden in CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> splenocytes derived from RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared to wt mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Samuel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, increased mortality of RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in response to peripheral WNV infection correlated with increased replication in lymphoid tissue, but not enhanced viral dissemination into the CNS. A minor role for RNase L in control of WNV in the CNS was supported by similar viral titers in brains as well as kinetics and rates of mortality following intracranial infection of RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wt mice. Although viral replication was only transiently increased in spinal cords of intracranially infected RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the most prominent effect was increased spread to the spleen and liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Samuel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Very modest anti-viral RNase L activity in the CNS was confirmed by analysis of viral RNA from CNS tissue.

To assess the possibility that RNase L exerts cell type dependent anti-viral effects not apparent from whole tissue homogenates, the distribution of virus infected cells was analysed by immunohistochemistry.

Furthermore, the limited extent of increased focal glial infection appeared insufficient to mediate the pathological effect. To assess potential differences in the overall activation state of microglia, the distribution and morphology of Iba-1 positive cells was assessed in spinal cord grey matter. Microglia in wt mice were activated as demonstrated by their intense staining and ramified phenotype and localized in close proximity to neuronal cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000602-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). By contrast, in infected RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, fewer microglia were activated based on their Iba-1 staining and morphology and did not show preferential association with neurons. Whether the absence of RNase L itself or infection of microglia mitigates a neuroprotective function of microglia remains to be explored.

Nevertheless, both histochemical and flow cytometric analysis revealed a similar extent and composition of inflammatory cells in the CNS of infected RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wt mice. The lack of RNase L mediated alterations in T cells was supported by similar peripheral expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells and kinetics of viral control. Increased morbidity could thus not readily be attributed to altered inflammation or pro-inflammatory signals at the tissue level.</p><p>Neuronal infection by gliotropic MHV-JHM is sparse and only evident early p.i. in wt mice. No evidence for enhanced neuronal infection in RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice thus suggested that the IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; mediated anti-viral mechanisms in neurons are RNase L independent. This contrasts with a protective role for RNase L in inhibiting HSV-1 replication in neurons of IFN-&#x003b2; treated trigeminal ganglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Carr1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, and supports virus specific susceptibilities to innate anti-viral immunity. Distinguishing features in MHV-JHM infected RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are the sustained areas of microglia infection in brain stem and focal areas of infected microglia within the spinal cord grey matter. Infected cells in spinal cord grey matter are also evident in SCID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Savarin1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> and IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (unpublished observation) following infection with the gliotropic MHV-JHM. In RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice the prominent infected cells in brain stem and spinal cord grey matter were identified as Iba-1 positive microglia or infiltrating monocytes, which cannot readily be distinguished by immunohistochemistry. Nevertheless the morphology of infected cells in the grey matter was consistent with activated microglia, rather than the monocyte/macrophages with dense cytoplasm found prominently in demyelinating lesions. Furthermore, preferential microglia infection was supported by a relatively greater increase of viral RNA in microglia relative to monocytes, when comparing RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> versus wt mice. The prominent location of Iba-1 positive cells in grey matter of RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could not be attributed to the absence of activated microglia in grey matter of wt mice. In fact, microglia in wt mice exhibited a more ramified phenotype surrounding neurons compared to microglia in RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> infected mice. It remains unclear whether abrogation of the proximal localization of microglia to neurons in RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> spinal cords reflects an unknown function of an RNase L enhanced neuroprotective effect, or altered function due to infection.</p><p>Surprisingly, both prolonged brain stem infection and enhanced spinal cord grey matter infection was associated with more severe demyelination and axonal damage. Overall, the CNS pathology characteristic of MHV-JHM infection was accelerated by 3&#x02013;4 days in RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> relative to wt mice. Although infection of microglia correlated with a subsequent increase in apoptotic cells, apoptotic cells surrounding neurons were only evident in spinal cord, not in brain stem. The inability to detect increased numbers of infected or apoptotic cells in spinal cord white matter is consistent with both an apparent lack of RNase L activation in oligodendrocytes during MHV-JHM infection and paucity of apoptotic oligodendrocytes in wt mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Whether apoptotic cells originated from infected myeloid cells themselves or from lymphocytes migrating to the infected areas and exerting effector function is unclear. Preliminary analysis showed no co-localization of activated caspase 3 and Iba-1 (data not shown). Overall, the neurologic disability and morbidity of the infected RL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice appears to result from axonal or neural degeneration, independent of neuronal infection in both brain stem and spinal cord. The enhanced demyelination phenotype is thus distinct from demyelination attributed to enhanced white matter infection by recombinant neuronotropic MHV variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-DasSarma1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. RNase L deficiency and infection of microglia may contribute to this pathology in several ways. Infection in the absence of RNase L may impair neuroprotective effects exerted by microglia under inflammatory conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Trapp1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Hasegawa1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, enhanced infection of microglia may increase proinflammatory responses resulting not only in enhanced recruitment of T cells and monocytes, but also increased local production of neurotoxic factors such as TNF, nitric oxide, oxidative radicals, and matrix metalloproteases. However, only modest increases in IFN&#x003b3; mRNA in spinal cord, as well as minor differences in TNF and iNOS mRNA in microglia/monocytes suggest these effects may only be apparent at a focal level. Increased localized T cell effector function, manifested in release of perforin and granzymes, has also been shown to contribute to axonal injury without affecting demyelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000602-Howe1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although RNase L did not play an overt anti-viral role as measured by viral replication, it did provide specific protection from focal infection of microglia/macrophages in the CNS. RNase L was not crucial in protecting neurons from infection and played no obvious role in protecting oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Furthermore, RNase L deficiency did not alter proinflammatory responses, diminish IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; mediated signals, or dampen adaptive immune mediators. The results rather uncover how subtle local alterations in viral tropism may affect the balance between neuroprotection and neurotoxicity mediated by microglia/macrophages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals, viruses, and clinical scores</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Fredrick, MD).
