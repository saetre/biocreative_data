Recently we described rapid astroglial, NOS2-dependent, NO production in the neocortex of healthy mice on a time scale relevant to neuronal activity. To explore a possible role for astroglial NOS2 in normal brain function we investigated a NOS2 knockout mouse (B6;129P2-<italic>Nos2<sup>tm1Lau</sup></italic>/J, Jackson Laboratory).

These findings indicate the existence of an alternative pathway that increases basal NOS activity. In addition, the astroglial mutation instigated modifications of neuronal attributes, shown by changes in the membrane properties of pyramidal neurons, and revealed in distinct behavioral abnormalities characterized by an increase in stress-related parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The results strongly indicate the involvement of astrocytic-derived NO in modifying the activity of neuronal networks. In addition, the findings corroborate data linking NO signaling with stress-related behavior, and highlight the potential use of this genetic model for studies of stress-susceptibility.

Three different isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) synthesize NO from L-arginine, and their activity depends on the setting and the cell type involved. For example, neurons expressing the neuronal NOS isoform (NOS1) are capable of rapid release of small amounts of NO serving as neurotransmitter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Prast1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Boehning1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, astroglial NO production has been demonstrated mainly as a reaction to various detrimental stimuli such as ischemia or inflammation, through the activity of a stress-induced NOS isoform (NOS2) that can produce large amounts of NO, but on a much slower time scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Licinio1">&#x0005b;e.g. 3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Olivenza1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Using NO imaging in brain slices we recently demonstrated NOS2-dependent astroglial NO production, which occurred on a fast time scale (seconds) and did not involve de-novo protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Buskila1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These data raised, for the first time, the possibility of the involvement of astroglial-derived NO in physiological brain activity.</p><p>To test for a possible role for astroglial, NOS2-dependent NO in normal brain function, we evaluated a NOS2 knockout mouse (B6;129P2-<italic>Nos2<sup>tm1Lau</sup></italic>/J, Jackson Laboratory, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/002596rf.html">http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/002596rf.html</ext-link>). In this mouse strain, the fragment containing the calmodulin-binding domain of NOS2 was replaced by the neomycin resistance gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Laubach1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Homozygous NOS2 mutant mice are fertile, and display no developmental defects or abnormalities of blood composition. Over the past ten years, more than 100 published studies have used these NOS2 mutants to explore the role of the enzyme in various organ systems. It has been reported that these mice have no serum NO response under conditions of immune challenge, their macrophages do not produce NO in culture, and they exhibit altered responses to various systemic infections, though they are not considered immune-compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Laubach1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Mungrue1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. No compensatory pathway has been identified in this mouse strain untill now.</p><p>Only a few studies have explored some aspects of brain function in these mutants. Almost all these studies used the mutant in various models for brain pathologies such as ischemia, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, focusing on the role of NOS2 induction in the long-term outcome of the insult. The mutants were compared to control mice, assuming they lack astroglial NO production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Liberatore1">&#x0005b;e.g. 12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Martin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The behavior of these mutants received little attention, probably due to the current conviction that maintains that NOS2 does not participate in normal brain activity.</p><p>In the current study we demonstrate robust NO production by astroglia in the mutants' neocortex, suggestive of a constitutive alternative pathway. The data also imply that the mutation lead to neuronal modifications, and a distinct behavioral phenotype. Some of these data have been published in an abstract format (Buskila et al., SfN abst., Atlanta 2006).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mutants' astrocytes exhibit NOS activity</title><p>We first examined whether the NOS2 mutation eliminated astroglial NO production as expected. We incubated cortical slices from mutant and control mice in the NO indicator diaminofluorescein&#x02013;2 diacetate (DAF-2DA) to image NO-producing cells. The fluorescence intensity (FI) of this indicator is expected to roughly correlate with the concentration of NO and peroxinitrite and hence, with NOS activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Kojima1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Roychowdhury1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Briefly, punctate, putative neuronal staining appeared almost immediately and decayed within 60 to 90 seconds.

In contrast, slices from mutant mice exhibited widespread cellular fluorescence immediately after opening the fluorescence shutter. The fluorescence pattern was mixed, and both punctate and diffuse staining could be observed. Longer illumination periods led to a rapid increase in the number of diffusely fluorescent cells resulting in considerable overlap and making it impossible to differentiate single cell somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000843-g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME (1mM) abolished all fluorescent responses in slices from both mutant (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4 slices, 2 animals) and control (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4 slices, 2 animals) mice, corroborating it was due to NOS activity.</p><fig id="pone-0000843-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000843.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>DAF-2DA fluorescence in mutant mice is faster and stronger.</title><p>(A) Slices from mutant and control mice were pre-incubated in DAF-2DA (2 &#x000b5;M) for 10 minutes, and imaged with a fluorescent light source.

Since FI of single diffusely-stained cells reached saturation levels in both control and mutant mice, it can be deduced that in mutant slices, the rapid increase in FI was caused mainly by a higher number of cells participating rapidly and simultaneously in NO production.</p><p>Previous data suggested that the reason for the delayed astroglial DAF-2DA fluorescence in CD1 mice is an unidentified activation step which was triggered by phototoxic neuronal death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000843-Buskila1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with this idea, diffuse astroglial staining was rarely observed in DAF-2DA loaded slices from control mice when imaged with a confocal microscope.

However, it has been obvious for some time now that altered genes might affect many developmental processes, and compensatory mechanisms may be activated in knockouts. We demonstrate here intense NO production by astroglia in brains of homozygous NOS2 mutant mice. The data presented is strongly indicative of a constitutive, alternative pathway, which resulted in increased levels of basal NOS activity. In addition, we found that the astrocytic mutation instigated neuronal modifications: 1) neocortical pyramidal neurons exhibit mild but significant changes in their membrane properties, and 2) the mutant mice display a distinct behavioral phenotype.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>The biochemical modifications</title><p>While the neuronal DAF-2DA fluorescent response in slices from mutant and control mice was identical on all parameters of analysis, several findings clearly discerned the astrocytic response in mutant from control slices: 1) the fluorescence developed faster and reached higher intensity in mutant slices due to a large number of fast-reacting cells, 2) the fluorescence in mutant astroglia was insensitive to the NOS2 inhibitor 1400W, while this compound completely abolished it in control slices, and 3) astroglial fluorescence in the mutant, but not in the control, depended on release of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from internal stores. Although there were no changes in the expression levels of any of the three NOS isoforms, NOS activity in neocortex of mutant mice was considerably increased compared with control neocortex.</p><p>The exact nature of the biochemical modifications has not been clarified here. The imaging experiments indicate that the compensatory process occurs mainly in astrocytes. The likely possibility is that the mutated protein is now constitutively expressed and uses an alternative pathway. Another possibility for the underlying mechanism is that higher activity of the other constitutive NOS isoforms is compensating for the reduced activity of the mutated protein. However, we failed to find evidence for the expression of the NOS1 or NOS3 isoforms in mutant astroglia to support this possibility.</p><p>Whatever is the nature of the biochemical modifications, their existence needs to be taken into account when evaluating brain function in these mutants. It has been well accepted that under pathological conditions, NOS2 expression in astrocytes increases dramatically over a period of hours and days. Hence, several groups used this same NOS2 mutant strain to examine the role of NO in the long-term outcome of brain insults, assuming lack of astrocytic NO production under these conditions.

Samples containing 50 &#x000b5;g proteins were loaded and the protein size was separated in 7.5&#x00025; SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (150 V) along with a set of molecular-weight markers (Bio-Rad, UK). Blots were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with blocking buffer, and then incubated overnight with specific primary polyclonal antibodies against NOS1 (1&#x02236;200&#x02013;1&#x02236;500), NOS2 (1&#x02236;200&#x02013;1&#x02236;1000) and NOS3 (1&#x02236;200), all of them purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA. Positive controls from macrophages were used for NOS2.

In brief, brains of 21 days old mice were quickly removed and the neocortex was homogenized in 1 ml buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.4), 1mM EDTA and 1mM EGTA. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-arginine (1 &#x000b5;Ci/&#x000b5;l; Amersham, UK) and cofactors. The reaction was terminated by the addition of stop buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 5.5) and 5 mM EDTA. To determine the relative fraction of calcium-independent NOS activity, calcium was omitted from the reaction mixture in some samples and EGTA (1 mM) was added. &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-citrulline was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of the eluate, and the counts per minute for all samples were averaged and corrected with respect to the background radioactivity.

No. 482655), following standard instructions. The reading was performed with wavelength of 365 nm excitation, and 450 nm emission.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Behavioral testing</title><p>Control and mutant adult male mice were transferred to the lab prior to testing, and remained there throughout the testing period. The animals were neither handled nor habituated to the behavioral apparatus before the initial test session. Tests were carried out during the light period (12:00&#x02013;16:00). Mouse behavior was recorded from a centrally placed video camera located 0.5 m away from the apparatus under dim light. A hole-board was used to examine explorative behavior. Each animal was placed in the center of the board and its behavior videotaped for 5 minutes, and the test was repeated for three successive days. Head dipping and grooming episodes, as well as distant travel on the board were recorded off the videotapes. For the Open-Field test, each mouse was placed in the center of the field and its latency to escape to any corner was recorded. The behavior was videotaped for 10 minutes, and the following parameters were recorded: the field was divided into 25 squares (20 cm&#x000d7;20 cm each) and the total (center and peripheral) squares crossed, the distance traveled, the number of entries into the center of the field, and the number of rearing and grooming episodes. The test was repeated over a total of three consecutive days. An Elevated Plus maze with two open and two closed arms (each 30 cm long&#x000d7;5 cm wide) was used for a single 10-minutes exposure. The time spent in the open arms and duration of grooming were recorded off the videotapes as well as the number of partial (2 legs) and full (4 legs) entries into the open arms, the number of stretch/attend postures, and the head dipping over the side of the open arms (the combined last two parameters were interpreted as &#x0201c;risk assessment&#x0201d; behavior). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measure was used to examine group differences over days (when tested), with a significance level of 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0000843-Prast1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
