The functional heart is formed after 72 hours post-fertilization (hpf). During heart developmental processes, cell fate determination, specification, differentiation and migration are all involved. In view of this complexity, investigators have used model systems, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, zebrafish, chicken, and mouse, in an attempt to understand the molecular regulatory network of cardiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Stainier1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Srivastava1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. These efforts have produced two key findings important to the hypothesis of this paper: 1) that the members of the homeobox gene family are important for heart development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-McGinnis1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and 2) that the NK-class of homeodomain proteins plays key roles in the establishment of myogenic lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Bodmer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Harvey1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Among the homeobox genes, the vertebrate homologs of <italic>tinman</italic> have been cloned in many species and are highly conserved in the homeodomain structures and expression patterns. For example, <italic>Drosophila tinman</italic> is involved in the specification of the heart primordial cells. More specifically, in <italic>tinman</italic> null mutants, the heart-like dorsal vessel is absent, indicating that <italic>tinman</italic> is a critical factor in <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart-like formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Bodmer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The mouse <italic>tinman</italic> homolog is <italic>Nkx2.5</italic>, and <italic>Nkx2.5</italic>-knockout mice exhibit the formation of a primitive heart tube, which expresses most cardiac markers with the exception of <italic>mlc2v</italic>. The <italic>mlc2v</italic> marker, however, displays a thinning ventricular myocardium and, therefore, cannot undergo heart looping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Lyons1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike <italic>Drosophila tinman</italic>, mouse <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> is required for murine normal heart morphogenesis, but it is not essential for the cell fate determination of heart precursors. This suggests that there may be an <italic>Nkx</italic> homolog that compensates for the loss of function of <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> in mouse embryos. The most likely homolog of mouse <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> is mouse <italic>Nkx2.6</italic> which shares identical expression patterns at pharyngeal endoderm and at heart with <italic>Nkx2.5</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Biben1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The example cited above, mouse Nkx2.5/ Nkx2.6, suggests a redundant activity for loss of a single Nkx homolog function. In chick, <italic>cNkx2.8</italic> expression partially overlaps with <italic>cNkx2.5</italic> and <italic>cNkx2.3</italic>. This is seen in the onset of <italic>cNkx2.8</italic>, which appears at heart primordia and retains its expression until primary heart tube formation. After heart tube looping, however, <italic>cNkx2.8</italic> is no longer expressed, and <italic>cNkx2.3</italic> initiates expression at this stage and continues to express until adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Brand2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently, mouse Nkx2.7 was found (GeneID: 108060).

In zebrafish, we demonstrate in this study that <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> does compensate for the loss of <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> function in cardiac morphogenesis.</p><p>Recently, Targoff <italic>et al.</italic> (2008) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Targoff1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that Nkx2.5/Nkx2.7 morphants of zebrafish are well developed at early embryonic stage; however, morphants fail to elongate normally at heart tube stage. Thus, the authors concluded that abnormal heart tube extension will cause cardiac differentiation effects on ventricular and atrial cell numbers. In this study, we also observed similar phenotypes of Nkx2.5/Nkx2.7 morphants in that the heart tubes of Nkx2.5/Nkx2.7 morphants cannot extend further and the ventricle portion displays shorter and wider than that of wild-type embryo. However, in our study, we described the defective phenotypes and studied the functions of Nkx2.5/Nkx2.7 in more detail. To summarize, we first observed the cardiac phenotype at various developmental stages, including the period from 26 to 55 hpf when zebrafish ventricle is undergoing differentiation and proliferation. Targoff <italic>et al.</italic> (2008) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Targoff1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, on the other hand, did not investigate this important period of time. Second, by taking the advantage of zebrafish transgenic line Tg(<italic>cmlc2</italic>::GFP), which possesses the heart-specific GFP signal, we were able to observe the dynamic change of ventricular morphology in live embryos. In so doing, we found that the ventricle of Nkx2.5/Nkx2.7 morphants retained the pre-mature phase during this period rather than undergoing further cardiac morphogenesis. Thus, we suggested that the differentiation and proliferation of ventricle in Nkx2.5/Nkx2.7 morphants may cease after 26 hpf, resulting in the decrease of cell numbers of ventricle at the later stages. Third, by detecting the differentiated markers, such as <italic>versican</italic>, <italic>bmp4</italic>, <italic>tbx5</italic> and <italic>tbx20</italic>, we also found that the expression patterns of these markers in Nkx-deficient embryos were the same as those of wild type at early heart tube stage. However, the expressions of these markers in Nkx-deficient embryos were not restrained to the places where they should be confined at later cardiac differentiation stage. Based on these lines of evidence, we suggest that the decrease of ventricular myocardial proliferation and the defective myocardial differentiation both result from the up-regulation of <italic>bmp4</italic>, <italic>versican</italic>, <italic>tbx5</italic> and <italic>tbx20</italic> at late stage, even though these genes are all expressed normally in hearts at an early heart tube stage. Fourth, we performed a histological examination of the 72-hpf embryos and found that, compared to the wild-type, a thinning layer of myocardium with fewer cell numbers in the ventricle was observed in the Nkx2.5/2.7 morphants and that the endocardium of morphants did not form an endocardial cushion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004249-g003">Figs. 3C and 3D</xref>). Fifth, by using histological section of the Nkx2.5/2.7-MO-injected embryos, we found that the formation of atrioventricular valves was abnormal at 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004249-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p>We observed that the heart of Nkx2.5/2.7-MO double-knockdown morphants appeared to have a vigorous and rhythmic peristaltic contraction initially. Subsequently, however, the hearts of these double knockdown morphants failed to undergo looping morphogenesis, and the contractile function diminished progressively. Moreover, blood was regurgitated within the heart chamber after 72 hpf, and the heart became silent with cessation of blood circulation by 84 hpf. These defective phenotypes could have resulted from valve dysfunction. Interestingly, both <italic>bmp4</italic> and <italic>versican</italic> are restricted to atrioventricular boundary of heart at the later stage of heart development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Walsh1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Both genes are involved in cardiac valve formation and both are examined in this study.

Similarly, in this study, we found that <italic>bmp4</italic> and <italic>versican</italic> are dramatically upregulated and that the domains of expression are greatly expanded to the ventricle in the hearts of Nkx2.5/2.7 morphants. Therefore, we speculate that blood regurgitation occurring in the Nkx2.5/2.7 morphants' hearts resulted from valve dysfunction, which, in turn, causes the defective morphogenesis and function of heart.</p><p>Prall <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Prall1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> used cDNA microarray analysis to compare the transcripts of mouse Nkx2.5 heterozygous and null mutant embryos from E8.0 to E9.5 and found that <italic>tbx5</italic> is upregulated two-fold greater in null embryos at E8.0-E8.5. We found that both Nkx2.7 and Nkx2.5/2.7 morphants exhibit overexpression of <italic>tbx5</italic> and <italic>tbx20</italic> in heart, suggesting that Nkx2.5 and Nkx2.7 may be negative modulators of <italic>tbx5</italic> and <italic>tbx20</italic> in zebrafish. Therefore, the finding of Prall <italic>et al.</italic> supports our present study. On the other hand, Prall <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Prall1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> also demonstrated that there is an Nkx2.5/Bmp2/Smad1 negative loop pathway to regulate heart precursor specification and proliferation. They pointed out that <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> null mutants cause over-specification of cardiac progenitors and that the area of over-specification of cardiac progenitors appears to be a broad expression of early cardiac markers in the cardiac crescents.

For this reason, <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> null mutants have a thin ventricular myocardium.</p><p>However, in our study, the expression of early cardiac markers, <italic>tbx</italic>5 and <italic>hand</italic>2, do not exhibit expansion of cardiac progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004249-g004">Figs. 4A&#x02013;4D</xref>), indicating that the over-specification of cardiac progenitors does not occur. Instead, the Nkx2.5/2.7-MO-injected embryos consist of a single layer of ventricle, which does not result from over-specification of progenitors in a manner similar to mouse <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> null mutants. At the same time, <italic>tbx5</italic> was overexpressed in the ventricle and atrium of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004249-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>). The fact that overexpression of <italic>tbx5</italic> in the heart inhibits cardiomyocyte proliferation has been demonstrated in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Vaughan1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and chicks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Liberatore1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that the function of <italic>tbx5</italic> acts as growth arrest signal to regulate cellular proliferation. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the thin-layer of heart of zebrafish <italic>Nkx2.5/2.7</italic> morphants may result from the effect of higher expression of <italic>tbx5</italic>. Therefore, we reason that the heart defect induced by the knockdown of <italic>Nkx2.5/2.7</italic> is more likely to be caused by the late onset of cardiac differentiation. It was also demonstrated in this study that <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> is a modulator of <italic>tbx5</italic> and <italic>tbx20</italic> expression, which further supports the conclusion noted above and gives added support to the prominent role <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> plays in cardiac morphogenesis.</p><p>Chen and Fishman (1996) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004249-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> reported that overexpression of <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> (100 pg) in zebrafish causes a large hyperplastic heart with normal function and chamber morphology.

We speculate that ectopic expression of <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> mRNA at the one-cell stage results in nonspecific defects in zebrafish embryos. For example, there are no reports about Nkx2.5 function in dorsal-ventral axis formation. Based on this point, we suggest that <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> carries out functions similar to those of <italic>Nkx2.5</italic>, but, because there may be many unexpected effects on embryos from overexpression of either <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> or <italic>Nkx2.7</italic>, we performed a specific knockdown of morpholino and a GR-inducible assay to learn the exact functions of Nkx2.5 and Nkx2.7 in zebrafish development. Specifically, we note that injection of 5 pg <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> mRNA results in a phenotype similar in defect to the injection of 150 pg <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004249-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Compared to the injection dosage of <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> mRNA, we notice that only a one-thirtieth concentration of <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> mRNA is required to rescue the defects induced by <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> and <italic>2.7</italic> double knockdowns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004249-t002">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> has more effective function than <italic>Nkx2.5</italic>.</p><p>Finally, in the loss-of-function experiment, the ventralized embryos were not observed in the Nkx2.5/2.7-knockdown embryos. In contrast, these results were observed in the gain-of-function experiment, in which <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> and <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> were overexpressed. However, based on the GR-Nkx2.7 inducible experiment where <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> is induced after gastrulation, we proved that <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> has a specific effect on heart development, but not axis formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004249-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that this inconsistency between gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments may result from the fact that <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> and <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> are not expressed until late-gastrula stage. However, since either the overexpressed <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> or <italic>Nkx2.7</italic> is injected at the one-cell stage, these misexpressional genes can cause abnormal axis formation in embryogenesis.
