The R331A active site mutant of DbpA confers a dominant slow growth and cold sensitive phenotype when overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> containing endogenous DbpA. Ribosome profiles from cells overexpressing DbpA R331A display increased levels of 50S and 30S subunits and decreased levels 70S ribosomes. Profiles run at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> exhibit fewer 50S subunits and accumulate a 45S particle that contains incompletely processed and undermodified 23S rRNA in addition to reduced levels of several ribosomal proteins that bind late in the assembly pathway. Unlike mature 50S subunits, these 45S particles can stimulate the ATPase activity of DbpA, indicating that hairpin 92 has not yet been sequestered within the 50S subunit. Overexpression of the inactive DbpA R331A mutant appears to block assembly at a late stage when the peptidyl transferase center is formed, indicating a possible role for DbpA promoting this conformational change.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Biogenesis of the two subunits of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 70S ribosome involves coordinated transcription, processing and folding of three ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and sequential binding of the 54 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Ribosome assembly proceeds <italic>in vivo</italic> through at least two known small subunit (30S) precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and three known large subunit (50S) precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>) that are short-lived at normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Reconstitution of subunits from rRNA and total r-proteins (TP30 and TP50) <italic>in vitro</italic> is characterized by intermediate particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>) that are similar to the precursors observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The resulting assembly maps that define the sequence of r-protein binding events during <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of both subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) are generally thought to be good models for the biogenesis of ribosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, successful reconstitution of subunits <italic>in vitro</italic> requires non-physiological conditions such as long incubation times and elevated temperatures to overcome kinetic barriers due to misfolding of the rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Several proteins have been identified as assembly cofactors that interact transiently with the maturing ribosome and may serve to overcome similar kinetic barriers <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). More than 20 <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomal assembly factors identified to date can be classified in three groups: maturation factors, GTPases and DEAD-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Although the precise roles in assembly for most of these factors are not well defined, a majority of these ribosomal assembly factors have been implicated in 50S subunit assembly, possibly due to its more complex tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) compared to the 30S subunit.</p><p>One 50S assembly cofactor that is particularly well characterized is DbpA, an <italic>E. coli</italic> DEAD-box protein with ATPase activity that is strongly stimulated by 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The C-terminal domain of DbpA resembles an RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) and binds tightly and specifically to hairpin 92, which is part of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">20&#x02013;24</xref>). Two N-terminal RecA-like domains bind RNA weakly and non-specifically and form the ATP binding pocket between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In the presence of 23S rRNA, intact DbpA binds tightly to hairpin 92 and its ATPase activity is activated by nearby rRNA residues that contact the RecA-like domains. When in the presence of other RNAs, DbpA is difficult to saturate but can show much lower rates of ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). <italic>DbpA</italic> has been demonstrated to be a non-essential gene at various growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, an active site mutant, <italic>dbpA R331A</italic>, confers a dominant negative slow growth phenotype when overexpressed in a wild-type background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The DbpA R331A protein binds rRNA normally but is severely impaired in ATPase and helicase activities compared to wild-type DbpA protein. The ATPase activity of DbpA is not stimulated by mature 50S subunits or 70S ribosomes, leading to the hypothesis that DbpA is involved in ribosome assembly rather than translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Here, we examine the role of DbpA in 50S assembly by characterizing 45S particles that accumulate in the DbpA R331A mutant strain. Formation of the 45S particle is accompanied by defects in rRNA processing and modification. Analysis of the protein composition of the 45S particle reveals depleted levels of proteins, including the late-binding protein L16, which binds near the PTC and the 23S rRNA binding site of DbpA. These particles stimulate DbpA ATPase activity but this activity alone is not sufficient to reconstitute mature 50S subunits. Taken together these results suggest a possible mechanism of DbpA action during the timeline of 50S subunit maturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein, RNA and DNA preparation</title><p>Site-directed mutagenesis and purification of DbpA, DbpA R331A, DbpA K53A and DbpA E154A proteins were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>BL21(DE3) &#x00394;<italic>dbpA</italic> was a generous gift from I.

Total proteins from wild-type 50S, DbpA R331A 50S, DbpA R331A 45S and LiCl washed particles were first purified by TCA precipitation. Aliquots containing 50&#x02013;100 pmol of total protein were then mixed with an equal amount of a standard mixture consisting of stoichiometric amounts of total proteins isolated from <sup>15</sup>N-labeled 50S subunits. The mixture of unlabeled sample proteins and fully <sup>15</sup>N-labeled standard proteins was digested overnight with trypsin, and then analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled ESI-TOF MS, essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>The ESI-TOF MS data consists of pairs of peaks corresponding to unlabeled and fully labeled copies of peptides. Individual peaks are identified by their charge and mass/charge ratio and peak pairs are determined by differences in mass/charge ratios, which correspond to the number of nitrogens in the peptide. Typically, data is obtained for multiple peptides for each protein, although this number varies between samples and with the size of the protein.</p><p>The relative amounts of unlabeled sample and labeled standard for each pair of peaks are determined by fitting theoretical isotope distributions to the experimental data as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The unlabeled : labeled ratio for each protein is determined by averaging the ratios obtained for all peptides from that protein, including multiple charge states for a single peptide.</p><p>The magnitude of these ratios is dependent upon the actual amounts of sample and standard mixed together, so they are normalized such that the value obtained for L3 is one and all other values are relative to the L3 content of the particle. L3 is chosen as the basis for normalization as it is both a primary binder expected to be consistently present at near wild-type levels and is a large protein for which data from multiple peptides are consistently obtained. Proteins that are relatively less abundant in the sample than in the standard will have normalized unlabeled fractions less than one. In some cases proteins have normalized ratios slightly larger than one, and this is attributed to experimental errors and the imperfect use of L3 as a benchmark as opposed to these proteins actually being present in super-stoichiometric amounts.</p><p>To compensate for differences between strains and laboratories (the samples and standard mixture are prepared in two different laboratories), the normalized ratios from each sample are divided by the normalized ratios obtained for wild-type 50S particles on a protein-by-protein basis. The resulting values give the relative amount of each protein present in the sample as a fraction of the amount present in wild-type subunits.</p><p>As a control to demonstrate the accuracy of the ESI-TOF MS method, both unlabeled and labeled versions of the standard mixture were mixed together and the resulting ratios normalized to the value obtained for L3. Data were obtained for 30 proteins, with an average ratio of 0.97 &#x000b1; 0.06, which is a good estimate for the error inherent to the method itself (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp711/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>ATPase assay</title><p>The rate of ATP hydrolysis by DbpA in the presence of 32-mer RNA with and without the 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl at U2552 was measured using the previously described high-throughput coupled spectroscopic assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>Endpoint or kinetic rates of ATP hydrolysis by DbpA in the presence of ribosomal subunits or particles were measured using a TLC plate assay as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) with the following modifications.

The presence of this 45S particle correlates with the higher proportion of free subunits observed at high magnesium conditions, which suggests that it is unable to be incorporated into 70S subunits.

Three additional proteins (L20, L29 and L30) were reduced in only one of two replicates (levels were slightly above 75% in the other replicate). L26 is present at a reduced level, but this may be due to differential segregation of L26 between subunits in the 45S particle compared to the wild-type 50S subunits, as L26 is also protein S20 from the small subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). No data was obtained for L36 because it is a small protein for which peptides are not routinely found in the new LC/MS data.

After purifying particles through a second sucrose gradient, only very low levels of wild-type or mutant DbpA was observed in any of the particles.

The particles from higher LiCl concentrations give rates that approach the observed rates for 23S rRNA, suggesting the DbpA binding site is even less occluded than in 45S particles. <table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>ATP hydrolysis rates of rRNA and particles</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strain</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substrate</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATP hydrolyzed per DbpA (min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">+40 nM R331A</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">+100 nM R331A</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">+200 nM R331A</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATP only</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.05 &#x000b1; 0.01</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23S rRNA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.1 &#x000b1; 0.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.6 &#x000b1; 1.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.4 &#x000b1; 1.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.6 &#x000b1; 1.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tuner<italic> + dbpA</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50S</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4 &#x000b1; 0.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tuner<italic> + R331A</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">45S</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.6 &#x000b1; 1.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.3 &#x000b1; 1.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.0 &#x000b1; 0.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.0 &#x000b1; 0.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50S</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.1 &#x000b1; 0.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>rrmJ</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50S</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.5 &#x000b1; 0.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394;<italic>rrmJ</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">40S</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.3 &#x000b1; 1.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50S</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.1 &#x000b1; 1.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">LiCl cores</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4M</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.5 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.6M</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.3 &#x000b1; 2.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.8M</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.3 &#x000b1; 1.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>ATP hydrolyzed per DbpA was monitored over time in the presence of 100 nM 23S rRNA or ribosome particles, 40 nM DbpA and 20 &#x003bc;M ATP in buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 20 mM KC1, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Tween 20) at 24&#x000b0;C.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The inactive DbpA R331A mutant can bind to full 23S rRNA and 23S rRNA fragments equally as well as wild-type DbpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This suggests that the accumulation of the 45S particle results from the large amounts of DbpA R331A protein binding to hairpin 92 and blocking access to active DbpA during ribosome assembly. To confirm that DbpA R331A can effectively compete with wild-type DbpA for substrates, competition assays were performed where the activity of DbpA stimulated by saturating amounts of 23S rRNA or 45S particles was measured in the presence of DbpA R331A. The addition of increasing concentrations of the mutant DbpA R331A protein significantly reduces the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of 23S rRNA from 25 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 4.6 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of 45S particles is reduced from 10.6 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the absence of DbpA R331A protein to 4.0 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> when DbpA R331A protein is added (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This reduction in ATP hydrolysis rate confirms that the inactive DbpA R331A mutant can compete with active DbpA and therefore can block its function <italic>in vivo</italic> where the levels of wild-type DbpA are much lower than the overexpressed mutant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Since the DbpA R331A 45S particles are substrates for DbpA <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is possible that in the presence of wild-type DbpA a structural rearrangement could occur, which would allow the particle to continue on the assembly pathway and form 50S subunits <italic>in vitro</italic>. As mentioned above, this type of rearrangement of 45S particles does not occur in the absence of other components, such as L-proteins, because the addition of DbpA and ATP alone to 45S particles did not permit the formation of 70S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Therefore, DbpA R331A lysates were supplemented with high concentrations of DbpA and ATP, enough to compete with the DbpA R331A protein and relieve the block in assembly, in an environment where L-proteins are available. Fresh clarified lysates of DbpA R331A cells were incubated with up to 1 &#x000b5;M DbpA protein and 1.5 mM ATP for 60 min at 24&#x000b0;C and then run on sucrose gradients containing low magnesium. The resulting ribosome profiles showed no difference and were similar to the profiles of extracts not treated with DbpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>DEAD-box proteins catalyze structural rearrangements in many RNA&#x02013;protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54 B55 B56">54&#x02013;56</xref>), so it is reasonable to propose that DbpA carries out a similar role in the large subunit assembly pathway. However, cells lacking DbpA grow at wild-type rates and show no defect in ribosome assembly, and thus any conformational rearrangement stimulated by DbpA must not be limiting for assembly under normal growth conditions. Ribosome assembly in the absence of DbpA may proceed through a slightly different pathway, possibly involving other DEAD-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>), but still resulting in normal active ribosomes. If DbpA is not essential for 50S maturation, why do 45S particles accumulate in <italic>E. coli</italic> when inactive mutant DbpA is overproduced but not when active DbpA is overproduced? One attractive explanation is that the inactive enzyme is unable to catalyze an rRNA conformational change in the 50S assembly pathway and as a result prevents further addition of ribosomal proteins and leads to accumulation of an intermediate particle. Because this intermediate can presumably still bind DbpA, the presence of a high concentration of inactive protein can saturate the site and block any alternative assembly pathways used by the <italic>dbpA</italic> deletion strains. Presumably, the lower amounts of intact 50S subunits that are observed in the mutant strain are either the result of occasional successful competition by an alternative pathway or the activity of the low concentration of endogenous wild-type DbpA. Conversely, when wild-type DbpA is overproduced, the necessary conformational change does occur and additional ribosomal proteins bind rapidly and block further access to DbpA, allowing 50S subunits to form along the normal pathway. Therefore, although the mutant and wild-type proteins both bind and release rRNA rapidly and show similar binding constants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), only the overproduction of the inactive mutant protein leads to an assembly defect because it cannot catalyze the conformation change.</p><p>It is possible that the 45S particle that accumulates in cells overexpressing the inactive R331A mutant of DbpA is an intermediate in the 50S assembly pathway upon which DbpA normally acts. As shown above, this 45S particle exhibits reduced levels of seven L-proteins (L16, L25, L27, L28, L33, L34 and L35). Since the molecular weight of the 45S particle is only slightly less than the 50S subunit, its slower sedimentation rate is primarily due to an extended, or more open, conformation that is also observed with natural 50S precursors and reconstitution intermediates that are in the final stages of assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Indeed, many of the proteins that are reduced in the 45S subunit bind late in the proposed ribosome assembly pathways (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp711/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>), and most of them bind near the peptidyl transferase center of the 50S subunit where DbpA also binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Of particular interest is the reduced amount of L16 in the 45S particles. In <italic>in vitro</italic> ribosome assembly, the binding of L16 to a core particle induces a large conformational change, suggesting that it acts as &#x02018;molecular glue&#x02019; to hold the 50S subunit in its compact structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Additionally, it is striking that L16 makes contacts with 23S rRNA at helix 89, which has also been identified as a site of DbpA binding in the presence of ATP and thus a putative site of DbpA action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Thus, it seems possible that DbpA could promote structural changes in the 45S particle that permits binding of L16 and other late proteins that allows the final assembly of the compact 50S subunit.</p><p>Because these 45S particles contain little to no inactive DbpA after purification over two sucrose gradients, it was possible to assay them for stimulation of ATPase activity by wild-type DbpA. Although robust ATPase activity was observed, this only establishes that hairpin 92 is accessible in the 45S particle, not that the 45S particle is the natural substrate of DbpA. Because DbpA binds tightly to and reacts with 23S rRNA in the absence of L-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), it is possible that it acts early in the assembly pathway and, when inactive, prevents the further maturation of the 50S subunit. In this scenario, the 45S particle is a misfolded, dead-end intermediate that has accumulated many of the L-proteins but cannot progress further in assembly because of the absence of an early rRNA isomerization step. Additionally, the 45S particle, which appears to be a heterogeneous mixture of particles, may also be the result of the dissociation of proteins from an improperly assembled even larger particle that is not stable in the low MgCl<sub>2</sub> conditions used for purification. An important future goal is to establish whether or not this 45S particle is able to form active ribosomes. Although our failure to convert 45S particles into 50S ribosomes by adding active DbpA to crude extracts suggests that they are dead end intermediates, pulse chase experiments using either labeled RNA or proteins will be more definitive.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the observed effects of overexpression of DbpA R331A is that the methylation of U2552 in hairpin 92 by RrmJ is blocked, which may be an essential event for the final maturation of the 50S subunit. This model is supported by the observation that the 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation at U2552 is absent in DbpA R331A 45S particles and by the fact that &#x00394;<italic>rrmJ</italic> strains also accumulate 40S particles that are very similar to the 45S particles obtained by overproducing the DbpA R331A mutant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp711/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). However, since RrmJ methylates 50S particles and not 40S particles from &#x00394;<italic>rrmJ</italic> strains, it is proposed to act late in assembly after the 50S subunit is nearly complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). Therefore, the unmethylated U2552 in DbpA R331A mutant 45S particles would presumably not be recognized as a substrate for RrmJ and would not be modified until later. Consequently, inhibition of U2552 methylation seems unlikely as the explanation for the phenotype of the DbpA R331A mutant.</p><p>In summary, although the absence of DbpA activity does not affect ribosome assembly under normal conditions, the overproduction of inactive DbpA mutants cause a block in assembly resulting in slow growth due to an accumulation of incomplete 50S subunits. These 45S particles contain reduced amounts of L-proteins that are found near the DbpA binding site, which is consistent with the absence of a conformational rearrangement necessary for their binding at this site. However, the point at which DbpA acts in assembly of the 50S subunit is not precisely defined and future studies will be important in determining the nature of the conformational change as well as the stage in assembly at which it occurs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp711/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp711_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="gkp711_nar-00800-r-2009-File008.eps"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="gkp711_nar-00800-r-2009-File009.eps"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="gkp711_nar-00800-r-2009-File010.eps"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="gkp711_nar-00800-r-2009-File011.eps"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp711_nar-00800-r-2009-File012.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>National Institute of General Medical Sciences Award Number (F32GM083510 to M.T.S.); the <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (Grant <award-id>R37-GM53757</award-id> to <award-id>J.R.W</award-id>.); and the <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (Grant <award-id>R01-GM60268-08</award-id> to <award-id>O.C.U</award-id>.).
