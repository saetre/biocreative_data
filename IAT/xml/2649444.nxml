Impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and an increased frequency in deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes some of the subunits of the ETC, have been reported in the substantia nigra of PD brains. The identification of mutations in the <italic>PINK1</italic> gene, which cause an autosomal recessive form of PD, has supported mitochondrial involvement in PD. The PINK1 protein is a serine/threonine kinase localized in mitochondria and the cytosol. Its precise function is unknown, but it is involved in neuroprotection against a variety of stress signalling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In this report we have investigated the effect of silencing PINK1 expression in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells by siRNA on mtDNA synthesis and ETC function. Loss of PINK1 expression resulted in a decrease in mtDNA levels and mtDNA synthesis. We also report a concomitant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased mitochondrial ATP synthesis, with the activity of complex IV of the ETC most affected. This mitochondrial dysfunction resulted in increased markers of oxidative stress under basal conditions and increased cell death following treatment with the free radical generator paraquat.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This report highlights a novel function of PINK1 in mitochondrial biogenesis and a role in maintaining mitochondrial ETC activity. Dysfunction of both has been implicated in sporadic forms of PD suggesting that these may be key pathways in the development of the disease.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain, with surviving neurons typically containing intracytoplasmic protein inclusions known as Lewy bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Schapira1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Dopaminergic neurons are markedly affected in PD. The loss of PINK1 activity in our dopaminergic cell system has also confirmed previous reports that have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction, and sensitivity to oxidative stress and apoptosis increases over time in mixed brain cell populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Gautier1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-WoodKaczmar1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>MtDNA has previously been reported to be decreased in <italic>Drosophila</italic> not expressing PINK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Park1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This coincided with a marked reduction in mitochondrial protein indicating that this decrease was due to loss of mitochondrial number. Our experiments suggest that the depletion of mtDNA in SH-SY5Y cells was due to inhibition of mtDNA synthesis, rather than a loss of mitochondria. It should be noted that mtDNA levels have been reported to be unaffected in the fibroblasts of a single PD patient homozygous for the p.W437X PINK1 nonsense mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Piccoli1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mechanism by which PINK1 influences mtDNA is unclear. The decrease in mtDNA levels precedes the loss of ETC complex activity, mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased ATP synthesis. This suggests that the decrease in mtDNA levels is not a consequence of perturbed oxidative phosphorylation. It should also be noted that loss of complex IV activity in patients does not result in decreased mtDNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Bhm1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The regulation of mtDNA levels would also appear not to be mediated by a PINK1-parkin pathway. Despite parkin being implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Kuroda1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, over expression of parkin could not reverse mtDNA depletion following silencing of PINK1. The PINK1-parkin pathway has also been shown to affect the morphology and dynamics of the mitochondrial network. Our PINK1-silencing experiments did not result in fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, as was reported in Hela cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Exner1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, and can be also be discounted as a reason for mtDNA depletion. The number of cells required for reliable electron microscopic analysis of mitochondria following siRNA transfection was not experimentally feasible. Therefore it is unclear whether the mitochondria are swollen or have disordered cristae as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Poole1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-WoodKaczmar1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it should be noted that a significant reduction in mtDNA levels can also alter mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004756-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Margineantu1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Xu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Phosphorylation pathways have been found to increase mtDNA levels <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Livigni1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. A possible protein downstream of PINK1 is DNA polymerase-&#x003b3;. This protein is involved in the synthesis and repair of mtDNA. Mutations in this gene have been associated with PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Davidzon1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Luoma1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, although not in all studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Taanman1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. HtrA2 is another protein proposed to be downstream of PINK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-PlunFavreau1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. A recent report has shown a trend for slightly lower mtDNA levels in the brains of HtrA2 knock out mice, although it was not significant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Moisoi1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. HtrA2 has been proposed to act independently of the PINK1-parkin pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Whitworth1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Yun1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, further investigation of the PINK1-HtrA2 pathway in dopaminergic cells might elucidate the mechanism by which PINK1 affects mtDNA levels.</p><p>Despite mtDNA levels being depleted in PINK1-silenced cells, the transcription and translation of mtDNA-encoded subunits were unaffected. Therefore it does not appear that the decrease in mtDNA is the cause of the significant decrease in electron transport chain function observed. Previously it has been reported that the transcription and translation of mtDNA encoded genes is unaffected in cells with 50&#x00025; mtDNA depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Pontarin1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Lebedeva1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the levels of mtDNA in SH-SY5Y cells following PINK1 silencing may still be greater than the mitochondrial threshold required for decreased mitochondrial transcription and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Rossignol1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In agreement with the results of our PINK1 silencing, Piccoli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Piccoli2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> have reported a decrease in complex IV activity in skin fibroblasts derived from a patient homozygous for the PINK1 nonsense mutation p.W437X. A small decrease in complex I activity has also been observed in fibroblasts from PD patients with the homozygous p.G309D PINK1 mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Hoepken1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. The recent finding of impaired mitochondrial respiration in the brains of PINK1 knock out mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Gautier1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> is also in agreement with the decreased oxidative phosphorylation we observe following PINK1 silencing. As noted above, loss of PINK1 activity affects oxidative phosphorylation in a variety of cell types. It would be of interest to determine whether the ETC is more effected in dopaminergic neurons versus non-dopaminergic neurons.</p><p>Phosphorylation of ETC subunits has been shown to increase ETC activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Livigni1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Scacco1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore the loss of ETC activity following PINK1 silencing could be due to decreased phosphorylation. Interestingly, oxidative phosphorylation has also been shown to be decreased in the brains of HtrA2 knock out mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Moisoi1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. This raises the possibility that a PINK1-HtrA2 pathway might regulate mitochondrial function. Alternatively, loss of ETC function could be a result of oxidative modification (see below) or abnormal mitochondrial morphology.</p><p>The silencing of PINK1 in SH-SY5Y cells also resulted in decreased cellular levels of reduced glutathione, a key antioxidant in the brain that has been reported to be lower in the substantia nigra of sporadic PD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Sian1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Total glutathione levels have been shown to be affected in human neurons with PINK1 knock down <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-WoodKaczmar1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and human fibroblasts expressing the p.G309D PINK1 mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Hoepken1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Twelve days of PINK1 silencing also resulted in a significant increase in oxidized protein. Both these markers of oxidative stress coincided with loss of ETC function. It is unclear whether the loss of ETC function is a direct cause of the oxidative stress, or if silencing of PINK1 increases oxidative stress via another pathway, which in turn progressively inhibits the ETC and other cellular components by oxidative modification. Increasing damage to the ETC components may explain why it takes twelve days for loss of ETC activity to be observed. It should be noted that loss of mitochondrial respiration in the brains of PINK1 knock out mice increases with age, as does sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Gautier1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, while oxidative modification of complex I has also been observed in PD brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Keeney1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential following PINK1 silencing reported here has also been reported in other human cell models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Exner1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-WoodKaczmar1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The mitochondrial membrane potential is generated by the ETC and is essential for the synthesis of ATP by mitochondria. Therefore it has been suggested that the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential observed following PINK1 silencing will have a significant effect on ATP production, and thus cellular function and survival. Indeed, a reduction in ATP levels has been observed in PINK1 fly knock out models that also exhibit neuronal loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Park1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Yang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. For the first time, we have demonstrated directly that mitochondrial ATP synthesis is inhibited in cells depleted of PINK1, and that this event is concomitant with both a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibition of complex IV of the ETC.</p><p>Although mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress occur after 12 days of PINK1-silencing, there was no effect on cell viability under basal conditions. However, when these cells were treated with paraquat, they exhibited increased cell death when compared to siRNA control cells. A combination of both decreased ATP production and intracellular oxidative stress most likely contributes to the increased susceptibility to oxidizing species. This is supported by the observation that after 6 days of PINK1 silencing, when no ETC dysfunction or oxidative stress was observed, there was no increase in sensitivity to paraquat. This increase in mitochondrial dysfunction and susceptibility to apoptosis or oxidative stress over time has also been reported in brain cells with perturbed PINK1 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-Gautier1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004756-WoodKaczmar1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, loss of PINK1 activity results in a progressive loss of mitochondrial function. PINK1 silencing results in decreased mtDNA levels, impaired oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress. The decreases in mtDNA and ETC activity do not appear to be directly related. The mechanisms responsible for these two events are unclear. The loss of mtDNA precedes marked levels of oxidative stress, and can probably be discounted as a cause. Conversely, impaired oxidative phosphorylation and increased oxidative stress coincide. Further experiments are required to ascertain whether the oxidative stress is a cause or consequence of ETC inhibition, or an unrelated event. The effects we report following loss of PINK1 expression are common to events recognized in sporadic form of PD. Therefore, elucidation of PINK1 function will probably give a better understanding of the pathogenic pathways leading to both forms of PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004756.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Endogenous and recombinant PINK1 protein expression in SH-SY5Y cells.
