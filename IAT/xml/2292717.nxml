However, underlying left-right asymmetries within neural circuitry and the mechanisms by which they develop are poorly described.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we use focal electroporation to examine the morphology and connectivity of individual neurons of the lateralized habenular nuclei. Habenular projection neurons on both sides of the brain share a stereotypical unipolar morphology and elaborate remarkable spiraling terminal arbors in their target interpeduncular nucleus, a morphology unlike that of any other class of neuron described to date. There are two quite distinct sub-types of axon arbor that differ both in branching morphology and in their localization within the target nucleus. Critically, both arbor morphologies are elaborated by both left and right-sided neurons, but at greatly differing frequencies. We show that these differences in cell type composition account for the gross connectional asymmetry displayed by the left and right habenulae. Analysis of the morphology and projections of individual post-synaptic neurons suggests that the target nucleus has the capacity to either integrate left and right inputs or to handle them independently, potentially relaying information from the left and right habenulae within distinct downstream pathways, thus preserving left-right coding. Furthermore, we find that signaling from the unilateral, left-sided parapineal nucleus is necessary for both left and right axons to develop arbors with appropriate morphology and targeting. However, following parapineal ablation, left and right habenular neurons continue to elaborate arbors with distinct, lateralized morphologies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>By taking the analysis of asymmetric neural circuitry to the level of single cells, we have resolved left-right differences in circuit microarchitecture and show that lateralization can be recognized at the level of the morphology and connectivity of single projection neuron axons. Crucially, the same circuitry components are specified on both sides of the brain, but differences in the ratios of different neuronal sub-types results in a lateralized neural architecture and gross connectional asymmetry. Although signaling from the parapineal is essential for the development of normal lateralization, additional factors clearly act during development to confer left-right identity upon neurons in this highly conserved circuit.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The left (L) and right (R) sides of the central nervous system (CNS) display functional asymmetries throughout the animal kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. There is evidence that functional lateralization increases cognitive performance as well as having important consequences for social behaviors within populations and for interactions between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. At the neuroanatomical level, asymmetries have been described in the shape and size of comparible regions on the R and L sides of the brain, in subnuclear and cytoarchitectonic organization of particular nuclei, as well as at the level of neurotransmitter expression and gross connectivity patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, little is currently known about lateralization at the level of individual neurons with respect to the configuration of functional circuits that is expected to underlie LR differences in neural processing. A probable reason for this is that such asymmetries are likely to be very subtle, encoded at the level of dendrite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] or axon morphology and/or connectivity and/or at the level of synaptic organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The telencephalo-habenulo-interpeduncular system is an emerging model for studying brain asymmetries and their development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The bilateral habenular nuclei, located in the diencephalic epithalamus, are part of this evolutionarily conserved conduction system. These nuclei receive afferent inputs from the basal telencephalon and diencephalon and project efferent axons through the fasciculus retroflexus (FR) to an unpaired midline target, the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) of the ventral midbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The epithalamus also contains the pineal complex, which in zebrafish comprises two photoreceptive nuclei, the pineal and parapineal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Left-right asymmetries in the telencephalon-habenula-IPN pathway. <bold>(a) </bold>Schematic of a 4 dpf larval zebrafish brain. The bilaterally paired epithalamic habenular (Hb) nuclei receive afferent inputs from nuclei in the telencephalon (Tel) via the stria medullaris (SM; grey arrows; asymmetric innervation of the R habenula [20] is not indicated) and diencephalon (not shown). Habenular neurons send efferent projections via the fasciculi retroflexus (FR) to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) in the ventral midbrain. L- and R-sided habenular axons are segregated along the DV axis of the IPN wherein the L habenula predominantly innervates the dIPN and makes less substantial projections to the vIPN whereas the vast majority of R-sided axons terminate in the vIPN. In addition to the habenulae, the epithalamus contains the pineal complex, comprising the photoreceptive pineal (P) and parapineal (pp) nuclei. The parapineal is located on the L side of the dorsal midline and projects efferent axons that exclusively innervate the L habenula. <bold>(b) </bold>Neuroanatomical asymmetries in the epithalamus.

In larval zebrafish, the parapineal organ has a bilateral origin, but parapineal precursors migrate from the antero-dorsal epithalamus to the L side of the dorsal midline and contemporaneously extend efferent axons that exclusively innervate the L habenula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The L and R habenulae differ in the extent and organization of their neuropil and in the expression of various genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, asymmetry extends to the efferent connectivity between the habenulae and the IPN. Habenular axons innervate the IPN in a laterotopic manner wherein L and R terminals are segregated along the dorso-ventral (DV) axis of the target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we have used focal electroporation to examine individual pre- and post-synaptic neurons within the habenulo-interpeduncular tract, enabling us to resolve LR asymmetry in circuit microarchitecture. Our results uncover a fundamental aspect of CNS lateralization that serves to differentiate functional circuitry on the L and R sides of the brain. Additionally, the study extents current understanding of how brain asymmetry develops.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>L and R habenulae are coherent nuclei populated by unipolar projection neurons</title><p>The larval habenular nuclei are discrete, well de-limited and coherent groups of neurons on L and R sides of the brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b,c</xref>). They are asymmetric and levels of expression of several genes vary within each nucleus and between nuclei on L and R. However, as individual habenular neurons have not been studied, the extent of neuronal diversity within, and between, L and R nuclei is not known. To investigate this issue, we used focal electroporation to express membrane-tethered green fluorescent protein (GFP) in individual neurons or small groups of habenular neurons, enabling visualization of the entire morphology and axonal projections of these cells in the intact brain. This novel and powerful approach enables detailed comparison between neurons at the level of the soma, dendrites, axons and terminals. Given the small size of the habenulae at the stage of labeling (48&#x02013;72 hours post-fertilization (hpf)), no attempt was made to target different positions within the nucleus and so the position of labeled neurons was essentially randomized. High-resolution imaging was performed on 83 individual habenular neurons (37 L-sided and 46 R-sided).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Habenular neurons have a stereotypical unipolar morphology and their axons terminate in spiral-shaped arbors that display multiple midline crossing. <bold>(a) </bold>Three-dimensional reconstruction showing a R habenular (rHb) projection neuron in an intact 4 dpf larval zebrafish brain.

In four cases, neurons projected more caudal than the IPN, most likely to the serotonergic raph&#x000e9; nucleus in the anterior hindbrain (4.8%; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The axons of these neurons also coursed in the FR, but passed ipsilaterally around the ventral IPN (vIPN), before converging medially, crossing the ventral midline and finally terminating close to it. From here on we focus solely upon the majority population of habenular neurons with axons that terminate in the IPN.</p><p>Both L and R habenular nuclei have a central domain of dense neuropil surrounded by an ovoid shell of projection neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b,c</xref>) that elaborate dendrites within the neuropil. All labeled projection neurons, wherever they were located within the shell on either L or R sides, have a unipolar somal morphology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d&#x02013;f</xref>). In all cases, neuronal somata extend a single process directed towards the central neuropil where their dendritic trees are elaborated. While all neurons showed this same basic dendritic structure, they varied with respect to branch complexity. We did not determine if this relates to differences in neuronal location or correlates with molecular differences between neurons. In all cases, the axon emerges from one branch of the dendritic arbor and extends, unbranched, within the FR towards the IPN. The neurite arising from the soma and from which both dendrites and axon emerge is variable in length (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d,e</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>), likely reflecting the proximity of the soma to the central neuropil region.</p><p>Although there is clearly diversity among habenular projection neurons (see Discussion), these results show that all neurons in both L and R habenulae have in common a basic, stereotypical unipolar morphology.</p></sec><sec><title>Axons of habenular projection neurons cross the midline multiple times and form both ipsilateral and contralateral synaptic contacts</title><p>Bulk labeling of habenular efferent axons using lipophilic dyes has shown that both L and R nuclei project to both L and R sides of the target IPN nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The two most parsimonious explanations for this are either that each habenula contains discrete ipsilaterally and contralaterally projecting neurons or that individual neurons have axons that bifurcate and terminate on both sides of the midline. To resolve this issue, we reconstructed the entire terminal morphologies of individual L- and R-sided habenular projection neurons.</p><p>The most striking feature of both L- and R-sided axons is that they cross the ventral midline of the CNS multiple times, forming profusely branched 'spirals' of neurites, unlike any other axon type we are aware of (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref>). One hypothesis we considered was that L- and R-sided neurons might 'spiral' in opposite senses (clockwise versus counter-clockwise); however, this is not the case and indeed, branches from individual neurons frequently reverse sense within the arbor.</p><p>The bilateral projection pattern of individual habenular neurons raises the possibility that axons may form synaptic contacts on both L and R sides of the IPN. Although the IPN is usually described as an unpaired midline nucleus, confocal imaging clearly shows a LR subdivision (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3h</xref>). To determine if individual axons are likely to innervate both L and R sides of the IPN, we expressed, by focal electroporation in individual neurons, a construct driving expression of both cytoplasmic red fluorescent protein (RFP) and a Synaptophysin-GFP (Syp-GFP) fusion protein that localizes to presynaptic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Two distinct axon arbor morphologies formed by habenular projection neurons. <bold>(a-g, i) </bold>Dorsal, <bold>(c', f', i') </bold>lateral and <bold>(h) </bold>transverse confocal images of the IPN region in 4 dpf larvae.

However, the labeling techniques to date have been unable to resolve how this LR asymmetry is reflected at the level of individual neurons. For instance, most data are consistent with two hypotheses: first, individual neurons have terminals that exclusively innervate either the dorsal IPN (dIPN) or the vIPN (and there are different proportions of different classes of neuron on L and R); or second, individual neurons elaborate complex arbors with varying amounts of terminal branches in dorsal versus ventral regions of the target. To resolve this issue, we performed detailed morphometric analyses of terminals from R- and L-sided neurons, focusing on differences that could underlie the lateralization of the circuit.</p><p>Terminal arbors of habenular projection neurons adopt one of two very distinct morphologies, which we term L-typical and R-typical (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Although both types of terminal are exhibited by L and R neurons, they are present at very different frequencies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3n</xref>), with the vast majority (83.8%) of L habenular neurons elaborating L-typical terminal arbors (n = 31/37; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a&#x02013;c'</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) and 90.5% of R-sided neurons forming R-typical arbors (n = 38/42; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d&#x02013;f'</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Three-dimensional reconstructions of L-typical arbors reveal them to be formed like a 'domed crown' with branches extending over considerable DV depth (31.0 &#x000b1; 1.3 &#x003bc;m). In striking contrast, R-typical arbors are significantly more flattened, extending over less depth (17.7 &#x000b1; 1.2 &#x003bc;m; <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3k</xref>).</p><p>L-typical arbors have a circular perimeter, surrounding the central 'core' of the IPN. They possess large numbers of branches directed dorsally and medially to form the domed crown of the arbor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a&#x02013;c'</xref>). In contrast, R-typical arbors appear more elongated along the anterior-posterior axis. Much of the neurite length is concentrated towards the periphery of the arbor with relatively few branches extending towards the center of the IPN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d&#x02013;f'</xref>). Supporting these visual impressions, L-typical arbors display a significantly greater average number of branch points than R-typical arbors (L-typical = 19.3 &#x000b1; 1.9; R-typical = 7.6 &#x000b1; 1.2; <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3l</xref>). In addition, the width/length ratio of L-typical arbors showed a trend towards being greater than that for R-typical arbors, although this difference did not quite reach statistical significance at the 95% confidence level (L-typical = 1.28 &#x000b1; 0.039; R-typical = 1.13 &#x000b1; 0.070; <italic>p </italic>= 0.06; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3m</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we developed a method similar to Sholl analysis to quantify the distribution of neurite branches from the center to the periphery of the arbors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3g</xref>; see Materials and methods). This revealed distinct distribution profiles for L-typical and R-typical arbors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3j</xref>). For L-typical arbors, there is a greater proportion of axon density towards the center of the arbor as a result of the many branches that extend dorsally and medially. By contrast, in R-typical arbors, over 50% of axon density is concentrated within the outer 20% of the arbor radius because more of the axonal length is confined towards the perimeter. Both distributions showed excellent fits to fourth-order polynomial models (L-typical: R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.9580; R-typical: R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.9768; 95% confidence intervals for all parameters fit by non-linear regression were small; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) and analysis of the curves using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) showed they can be considered distinct with greater than 99% probability (&#x00394;AICc = 80.39 for global versus individual fits).</p><p>In two cases (from a total of 79 L and R neurons), axon arbors had an intermediate or 'hybrid' morphology (for example, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref>). Of the six L habenular neurons that had R-typical arbors, three had their somata located very close to the midline and actually sent their axons across the dorsal midline of the epithalamus to enter the right FR. Similarly, one of the two R habenular neurons that elaborated a L-typical arbor was located at the most medial edge of the R habenula and extended its axon down the left FR (data not shown).</p><p>In summary, although many features are shared by all habenular projection neurons, there are two major sub-types of terminal arbor morphology, one dominant for L-sided neurons and the other for R-sided neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>L-typical and R-typical arbors are elaborated at different DV positions of the target IPN</title><p>Do the distinct L-typical and R-typical morphologies arise from axons terminating in different regions of the target, and if so, does this shed light upon the differential innervation patterns of the IPN by L and R habenulae? To answer these questions, we performed anti-GFP immunostaining followed by histological sectioning of the brains of electroporated larvae. We found that L-typical arbors are localized to the dorsal IPN, whereas R-typical arbors are found in the ventral IPN (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). In addition, contemporaneous labeling of L and R neurons confirmed that L-typical arbors are located dorsal to the flattened R-typical arbors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3i,i'</xref>). These data indicate that individual habenular neurons innervate either the dIPN or the vIPN but not both domains.</p><p>The predominance of ventrally located R-typical terminals on R-sided habenular neurons provides an explanation of why bulk labeling of R habenular efferents leads to predominant labeling of the vIPN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The literature is less clear with respect to the efferent connectivity of the L habenula as Gamse and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] suggest widespread innervation of the entire IPN by L habenular neurons whereas Aizawa and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] propose that the L habenula predominantly innervates the dIPN whilst projecting substantially fewer axons to the ventral target. The predominance of dorsally localized L-typical arbors on L projection neurons supports this latter hypothesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3n</xref>). However, there remains a small possibility that our electroporation approach is biased to labeling dorsally projecting L habenular neurons. We therefore used lipophilic dyes to label all L- and R-sided efferents in a transgenic line in which dorsal and ventral IPN cells could be visualized.</p><p>A transverse confocal view through the IPN of a specimen in which the full contingent of L and R habenular axons have been labeled with different colored lipophilic dyes confirms that the larval L habenula projects predominantly to the dorsal target (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3h</xref>). Such images clearly show the dorsal arborization territory in which L-typical arbors form, surrounding and covering the dIPN. In the ventral arborization domain, R-typical arbors surround the vIPN, in a manner reminiscent of an electromagnetic coil.</p><p>In summary, the vast majority of L-sided habenular projection neurons form L-typical terminals, restricted to the dIPN, whereas the vast majority of R-sided habenular projection neurons form R-typical terminals in the vIPN.</p></sec><sec><title>Post-synaptic IPN neurons have diverse morphologies</title><p>The unique morphologies and DV segregation of habenular axon terminals raises several questions regarding the organization of the target and the morphology of its post-synaptic neurons. For example, do IPN neurons, located in the central 'core', radiate dendritic arbors outwards to synapse with the surrounding afferent axons? What are the consequences of the DV segregation of L-typical and R-typical inputs into the IPN? Are there IPN neurons that exclusively receive inputs from only dorsal or ventral axons or do some neurons synapse with both dorsal and ventral habenular axons, suggesting an integration of predominantly-left and predominantly-right information?</p><p>To address these and related questions, we used focal electroporation to label individual IPN neurons with membrane-localized Cherry fluorescent protein in Tg(ET16:GFP) transgenic larvae in which many habenular axons are labeled by GFP expression (the extent of habenular expression is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). This allowed us to examine the detailed morphology of IPN neurons whilst localizing their somata and neurite arbors with respect to the dorsal and ventral interpeduncular neuropils.</p><p>In total we labeled 20 individual neurons from 14 larvae (4&#x02013;6 days post-fertilization (dpf)). The vast majority (18/20) were located within the central core of the IPN. Two neurons were located outside, but in very close apposition to, the arborization domains that surround the core. As these neurons extend neurite arbors within the IPN neuropil, we consider them to be interpeduncular neurons.</p><p>One feature shared by all of the labeled IPN neurons is that they elaborate neurite arbors within the arborization domains of habenular axon terminals that surround and cover the IPN. For IPN neurons with cell bodies within the central core, this means the neurons are polarized such that their neurites extend radially, from the core towards the periphery of the nucleus, to synapse with the surrounding afferent axons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a&#x02013;c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Morphology of IPN neurons. <bold>(a-g, f') </bold>Three-dimensional projections of confocal <italic>z</italic>-stacks showing electroporated IPN neurons expressing membrane-Cherry (gold) and the surrounding IPN neuropil (grey), visualized using the Tg(ET16:GFP) transgenic line.

These results show that the IPN contains first, neurons with DV restricted arbors that could specifically relay L-typical or R-typical habenular inputs to downstream target nuclei, and second, neurons that extend neurites into both dorsal and ventral neuropils, which consequently have the potential to integrate predominantly-left and predominantly-right information.</p><p>R-typical axon arbors, localized in the vIPN, are often remarkably flattened along the DV axis, having DV extents of as little as 6 &#x003bc;m or less. In two cases we labeled vIPN neurons that also displayed remarkably flattened dendritic arbors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c,c'</xref>).

Four principal findings resulted from this. First, all habenular neurons, on both L and R sides, display a stereotypical unipolar morphology and their axons cross the ventral midline multiple times to establish bilateral connectivity. Second, two very distinct axon arbor morphologies are apparent, having lateralized origins and differential target connectivity; this underlies the laterotopic efferent connectivity of the habenulae. Third, IPN neurons display diverse morphologies that suggest lateralized inputs may either be integrated or maintained as distinct circuits, and are relayed to diverse downstream nuclei. Fourth, the unilateral parapineal is essential for the development of both L <italic>and </italic>R habenular axon terminals with appropriate morphology and connectivity; however, the parapineal is not a binary determinant of LR identity, indicating that additional developmental mechanisms are involved in the lateralization of this circuit.</p><sec><title>Habenular projection neurons have a unipolar morphology, and display multiple midline crossing and bilateral connectivity</title><p>Despite the fact that the L and R habenulae show conspicuous asymmetries in gene expression, neuropil organization and efferent connectivity, all of the cells we labeled in both the L and R habenulae were projection neurons that shared a stereotypical unipolar morphology. The dendritic arbors of these neurons, located in the central neuropil core of the habenulae, have the potential to integrate asymmetric afferent inputs from the telencephalon and diencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and exclusively on the L side, inputs from parapineal axons. Although dye tracing shows the entire contingent of L and R habenular axons terminating on both sides of the midline, our single cell analyses allowed us to establish that individual neurons project to, and establish synaptic contacts on, both L and R sides of the IPN. The repeated recrossing of the midline is a feature perhaps unique to habenular axons, which was previously suggested from classical neuroanatomical studies in mouse and salamander [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although in a few rare cases axons can cross from one side of the brain to the other and back again in two separate commissures (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]), we know of no other examples in normal development of decussating axons that can recross the same midline structure. Indeed, there are evolutionarily conserved mechanisms present from flies to humans by which growth cones become repelled by midline tissue once they have crossed it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>A distinctive feature of the habenular axons in zebrafish is that they not only reverse direction from one side of the brain to the other but must also change orientation along the anterio-posterior (AP) axis as they encircle the core of the IPN.

Despite sharing some morphological characteristics, habenular projection neurons possess one of two strikingly different axon arbor morphologies. L-typical arbors are tall, highly branched and take the form of a 'domed crown'. By contrast, R-typical arbors are often remarkably flattened, with neurite branches concentrated towards the arbor periphery. Although both types of arbor are elaborated by both L- and R-sided neurons, they show strongly lateralized origins, with the vast majority of L-sided neurons having L-typical arbors and most R-sided neurons having R-typical terminals. Because we have found the two arbor sub-types are restricted to different regions of the IPN, their asymmetric origins account for the laterotopic asymmetry in efferent habenular connectivity first identified using lipophilic dye tracing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Although recent studies have shown a temporal bias in the production of neurons in the L and R habenulae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we do not think that any of the differences we describe between L-typical and R-typical arbors can be explained by differences in arbor maturity. For instance, we limited our analysis to arbors that had completely encircled the IPN and did not bear visible growth cones on axon branches. In addition, normal L-typical and R-typical morphologies are still present at 10 dpf (data not shown), which suggests the arbors we compared are representative of mature larval morphologies.</p><p>Adult L and R habenulae contain medial and lateral subnuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], but these sub-divisions are not easily delineated at larval stages (either molecularly or morphologically) and our analysis did not enable us to accurately localize the somata of electroporated neurons to one subnucleus or the other. However, imaging of the epithalamus from the dorsal aspect showed that the neurons we labeled were distributed across the mediolateral extent of both L and R habenulae, suggesting that there is not a significant bias in our sample of L- and R-sided neurons. Although sub-nuclear organization was difficult to assess, one clear correlation between soma location and arbor morphology was that neurons elaborating the minority type of axon terminal arbor (that is, L-sided neurons forming R-typical arbors or R-sided neurons forming L-typical arbors) were often located at the most medial edge of the habenula and extended their axons in the contralateral FR. The relative proportions of L-typical and R-typical neurons we observed on L and R show a good qualitative agreement with subnuclear size ratios as determined by gene/transgene expression and with the strong lateralization evidenced from the laterotopic innervation of the IPN as assessed by lipophilic dye tracing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The micro-architecture of lateralized neural circuitry</title><p>It is currently unknown how lateralization of cognitive function is reflected at the level of circuit micro-architecture. However, several hypotheses could be considered. First, completely unique neuron types and/or circuitry patterns might be specified on L and R. Second, equivalent regions on L and R might both contain the same classes of neuron and patterns of connectivity, but the relative proportions of different neuron types/connections could differ. If this is the case then overall circuit architectures will be distinct, although no unique components need necessarily exist on either side. Third, L and R nuclei might be identical in composition and differ only in size. Cognitive function may then be lateralized as a consequence of more neural substrate existing on L or R. Within the telencephalon-habenula-IPN pathway, there is evidence supporting the first two models. In support of unique circuitry patterns on L and R, the parapineal exclusively innervates the L habenula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and a subset of R and L pallial axons terminate exclusively in the R habenula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Our data, together with previous work on habenula-IPN connections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], supports the idea that different proportions of neurons of distinct sub-types contribute to LR differences in circuitry. Thus, we find both L and R habenulae contain neurons with R-typical and L-typical terminals, but in very different proportions. Such a mechanism allows for flexibility and provides an easy way for evolutionary (or indeed developmental) processes to modulate the degree of lateralization by adjusting the difference in ratios of different neuronal types/connections on the two sides. Whilst epithalamic asymmetries are conspicuous in zebrafish and other anamniotes, only subtle LR differences have been described in higher vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, it is still possible that, in these species, the habenulae contain distinct classes of projection neuron with different axon terminal morphologies and connectivity preferences, but that the circuit is not strongly lateralized because the proportions of these different neuron types are similar in L and R nuclei. Although functional CNS lateralization is manifest in the form of asymmetric behavioral responses in several species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], the lateralization of many cognitive functions, such as language processing in the L cerebral cortex, does not result in overtly asymmetric behavioral outputs. The projection of L and R habenular neurons to both sides of the midline IPN potentially provides a mechanism for translating lateralized neural processing into control of bilaterally symmetric downstream circuits. This connectivity pattern enables distinct, asymmetric circuits in the L and R epithalamus to modulate behavioral outputs that require operation of motor circuits on both sides of the animal.</p><p>The IPN is a highly conserved structure found in the brains of all vertebrates and has been described as an integrative center connecting limbic regions of the forebrain with hindbrain motor circuits. The IPN is complex with respect to its subnuclear organization and neurotransmitter expression and despite its evolutionary conservation, its specific physiological and behavioral importance is not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although we find that IPN neurons display diverse morphologies, several characteristics inform hypotheses concerning how lateralized inputs might be integrated or relayed by the IPN.</p><p>The fact that L-typical and R-typical arbors are restricted to dIPN and vIPN, respectively, means that post-synaptic IPN neurons with similarly restricted neurite arbors are likely to receive only one sub-type of afferent input. Because the sub-types have strongly lateralized origins, even if the IPN neurons show no selectivity for L- or R-sided axons, they are likely to receive predominantly-left or predominantly-right signals. This suggests the IPN has the capacity to maintain lateralized habenular inputs as largely distinct, independent circuits. A key aim of future studies will be find out if dorsal and ventral IPN projection neurons with DV-restricted dendrites connect to distinct downstream targets.</p><p>IPN neurons with neurites in both dorsal and ventral neuropils suggest that the IPN has the capacity to perform a balanced integration of L- and R-sided signals, again without requiring specific recognition of the LR origin of the axons. In this case, lateralized information from the habenulae might be integrated and converge into a common output pathway. Notably, in the IPN of several mammalian species, 'crest' synapses have been described wherein one L and one R habenular axon terminal establish opposing parallel synaptic contacts on either side of a dendritic process belonging to an IPN neuron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], suggesting that the integration of L and R signals is a conserved feature of the IPN.</p><p>The strikingly different morphologies of L-typical and R-typical arbors suggest that dorsal and ventral domains of the IPN might process information differently. Within the dorsal IPN, the highly branched, basket-shaped L-typical arbors spread widely over the dIPN cells. This arrangement seems compatible with L-typical neurons providing widespread inputs to this region of the target rather than there being spatially localized, functionally distinct connections. In contradistinction, some R-typical arbors that innervate the vIPN are often remarkably flattened along the DV axis. Correspondingly, we observed that some vIPN neurons radiate similarly flattened, planar dendritic trees. This correlation raises the exciting possibility that the habenulae and vIPN are topographically patterned with different R-typical arbors contacting functionally distinct vIPN neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>The parapineal is necessary for laterotopic habenular connectivity</title><p>Our study supports and extends previous observations suggesting that the L-sided parapineal regulates laterotopic connectivity of habenular projection neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Using lipophilic dye tracing to specifically label L- and R-sided axons in parapineal-ablated larvae, we observed a massive reduction in L-sided innervation of the dIPN and a corresponding increase in innervation of the vIPN. These findings complement a recent study showing that the parapineal is required for expression of a receptor, Nrp1a, which has been proposed to guide L habenular axons to the dIPN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our data further show that in the absence of the parapineal, the default state is innervation of the ventral target.</p></sec><sec><title>Distinct, lateralized axonal arbors continue to be elaborated by L and R habenular neurons in the absence of the parapineal</title><p>Following parapineal ablation, the L habenula adopts patterns of gene expression and neuropil density that are similar to the R habenula (this study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). However, because subtle asymmetries remain in <italic>lov </italic>expression and neuropil organization (this study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]), the extent of the role of the parapineal in specifying LR identity has remained contentious. In this study, we provide clear evidence that although the parapineal regulates aspects of epithalamic asymmetry, L and R habenular neurons remain distinct following parapineal ablation.</p><p>Although both L and R habenular axons innervate the vIPN in the absence of the parapineal, they retain distinct terminal arbor morphologies and projection patterns. L-sided neurons form arbors with a unique 'Ab-L' morphology, which, whilst sharing several features of R-typical arbors, show greater branching into the interior of the vIPN. Strikingly, R habenular axons also change their terminal morphology and elaborate arbors that appear as more exaggerated forms of the wild-type R-typical morphology. Because the parapineal is only associated with the L habenula, it seems probable that interactions (direct or indirect) between the L and R axons in the vIPN are responsible for this peripheral restriction of the Ab-R axons: for example, occupancy of the more medial vIPN by Ab-L arbors might displace the Ab-R arbors towards the periphery.</p><p>In summary, signaling from the parapineal to L habenular neurons or their precursors is necessary for elaboration of several aspects of the L habenular projection neuron phenotype. These include normal levels of lateralized gene expression and axon targeting to the dIPN. However, even in the absence of the parapineal, L and R axon arbors remain quite distinct, indicating that other factors act upon this circuit to impart LR identity.</p></sec><sec><title>Specification and concordance of LR asymmetries</title><p>The various asymmetry phenotypes in the telencephalon-habenula-IPN pathway display a high degree of concordance in wild-type, mutant and experimentally manipulated embryos. The first known step in the development of these concordant asymmetries is the activation of Nodal signaling unilaterally in the L epithalamus during mid-somitogenesis. In fish in which Nodal signaling is either absent or bilaterally symmetric, asymmetries still develop, but their laterality is randomized, suggesting that Nodal is not a determinant of L identity, nor required for asymmetry <italic>per se</italic>, but is required to specify the correct laterality of the asymmetries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Importantly, in these and other experiments it was observed that if one asymmetry phenotype showed reversal (for example, parapineal positioned on the R), this was associated with reversals in other asymmetry phenotypes (for example, habenular neuropil density and <italic>lov </italic>expression). Fish were therefore considered to be either entirely reversed or entirely wild type with respect to these asymmetry characters.</p><p>These observations are compatible with the hypothesis that there is a single symmetry-breaking event that results in the L and R sides of the brain being assigned their unique identities. The subsequent development of various L- and R-typical phenotypes would be an invariant and inevitable consequence of the initial event. The unilateral migration of the parapineal was a candidate for such a binary, symmetry-breaking event. Parapineal migration occurs before other overt signs of neuroanatomical asymmetry and in parapineal-ablated larvae the L and R habenulae lose much of their asymmetry. However, as we discuss above, analysis at the level of individual projection neuron morphology has enabled us to determine that asymmetry is retained in the absence of the parapineal. This indicates that either an event earlier than parapineal migration initiates the concordant development of epithalamic asymmetries or that concordance is imposed upon structures that, at least in part, independently initiate the development of asymmetric features.</p><p>One obvious possibility is that L-sided Nodal signaling influences L habenular development independent of its influence on parapineal migration and that subsequent interactions between the L habenula and parapineal ensure concordance of laterality in the two structures. In support of this possibility, it is very likely that the Nodal pathway is activated in both parapineal and habenular precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, unpublished results from Myriam Roussigne and Patrick Blader (personal communication) suggest that Nodal signaling may have a direct influence on very early neurogenesis in the L habenula.</p><p>In future studies it will be interesting to explore these possibilities. For instance, although technically challenging, it would be informative to know if habenular neurons retain lateralized terminal arbors in fish that lack both a parapineal and lateralized Nodal signaling. It also remains a critical and technically challenging goal to relate the asymmetries in neuroanatomical circuits to behavioral lateralization.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Focal electroporation has enabled us to examine the organization of lateralized neural circuitry at single-cell resolution. We find that two distinct sub-types of projection neuron &#x02013; that differ in axonal morphology and connectivity &#x02013; are specified in both left and right habenulae, but that conspicuous differences in their relative ratios result in the major asymmetry in habenular efferent connectivity. This strategy of utilizing the same circuitry components on both sides but adjusting cell-type compositions so as to produce unique, asymmetric, circuit architectures is likely to account for neural asymmetries in other sites in the CNS in different vertebrate species. Furthermore, the morphologies of single post-synaptic neurons suggest lateralized habenular inputs may either be integrated within the IPN or maintained as largely independent circuits. These analyses of the microarchitecture of asymmetric neural tissue are likely to represent an important step towards understanding the basis for lateralization of neural processing and cognition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Zebrafish lines</title><p>Embryos and larvae were obtained by natural spawning from wild-type, Tg(<italic>fox</italic>D3:GFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], Tg(<italic>flh</italic>:eGFP); Tg(<italic>foxD3</italic>:GFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], Tg(<italic>h2afz</italic>-GFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], or Tg(ET16:GFP) fish (a gift from Dr Vladimir Korzh).

Embryos at 48&#x02013;72 hpf were mounted in 2% low melting point agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and using a microsurgical blade, a small chamber of agarose was cut out to expose the dorsal diencephalons/mesencephalon. Micropipettes with a tip diameter of 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;m were pulled on a P-87 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Company, CA, USA) using AlSi glass capillaries containing a filament. Micropipettes were filled with a solution containing purified plasmid DNA resuspended in H<sub>2</sub>O at a concentration of 1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l. For most habenular neuron electroporations we used pCS2-GAP43-GFP (a gift from Dr E Amaya). GFP synthesized from this construct is localized to the cell membrane by virtue of two amino-terminal palmitoylation signals from the GAP43 protein. To visualize presynaptic terminals, we used a 1:1 mixture of pCS2-GAL4 plasmid DNA (a gift from Dr Masahiko Hibi) and pCS2-Syp:GFP-DSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This latter construct encodes both cytoplasmic DsRed fluorescent protein and a Syp-GFP fusion protein, driven from separate UAS elements. For IPN electroporations we used pCS2-lyn-Cherry, which encodes a membrane-targetted Cherry fluorescent protein (a kind gift from Henry Roehl). Micropipettes were guided into either the L or R habenula or the IPN using an MX3000 Huxley-style micromanipulator (Soma Scientific Instruments, Irvine, CA, USA) under &#x000d7;40 water-immersion DIC optics (Axioskop 2 FS microscope, Carl Zeiss). The following stimulation parameters were used: 1&#x02013;2 s long trains of 2 ms square pulses at 200 Hz and a potential difference of 30 V. Trains were delivered 3&#x02013;5 times with approximately 0.5 s interval between trains. Pulses were generated with a Grass SD9 stimulator (Grass-Telefactor, West Warwick, RI, USA).

Three-dimensional reconstructions of each arbor were orientated such that the base of the arbor lay on a flat plane and a two-dimensional image of the reconstruction, parallel to this plane, was used for further analysis. The incoming axon was cropped where it extended beyond the maximum width and length of the arbor. Next, the image was thresholded and the convex hull method was used to define the arbor perimeter (ImageJ software, US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA; Hull and Circle plug-in by A Karperien and TR Roy). Using custom-written MATLAB software (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA), a series of 10 equally spaced concentric shells were defined, centered upon the centroid of the convex hull (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3g</xref>, for example). The number of pixels (representing axon signal) in each shell was taken as a measure of axon density. This generated a plot of cumulative fraction of axon density versus radius, for each arbor. This method is resistant to differences in the absolute area covered by the arbor and the total axonal length. Because we analyzed two-dimensional images, our method will underestimate axon density where axon segments are aligned above or below one another. This occurs rarely for L-typical arbors but is more common at the perimeter of R-typical arbors. Thus, although our method detects a greater peripheral localization of axonal length in R-typical arbors, if anything this difference between the arbor sub-types is likely to have been underestimated.</p><p>To describe the distribution profiles for the different sub-types of arbor (L-typical, R-typical and Ab-L, Ab-R) non-linear regression was used to fit fourth order polynomial models to the raw data with the y-intersect constrained to zero (at 0% radius the cumulative fraction of axon density must be zero). To compare the curves for the different arbor sub-types, we used the AIC method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Briefly, we used the AIC method to compare two models; an AICc score is computed for a 'global' model that treats all the data from two arbor sub-types as a single data set and for a second model with individual curves fit to each data set. A large difference in the AICc scores, &#x00394;AICc, indicates there is a high probability of the model with the lower AICc score being correct. If this is the model with separate fits for the two arbor sub-types it follows that the sub-types can be considered distinct. In the Results text we report &#x00394;AICc and the probability that the 'individual' model, with separate polynomial fits for the two arbor sub-types, is correct.</p></sec><sec><title>Width/length ratio</title><p>The maximum length (measured along the AP axis) and maximum width (measured perpendicular to the AP and DV axes) were measured (Volocity, Improvision).
