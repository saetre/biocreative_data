Even brief exposure of preimplantation embryos to 300 mOsm/kg culture media (in the absence of osmolytes) results in impaired development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Most mammalian embryo culture media formulations have employed osmolarities around 250 mOsm/kg. Greater culture medium osmolarities may be employed but only in the presence of osmolytes such as glycine, betaine, proline and glutamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Preimplantation embryos express a number of transporters that serve to regulate and maintain embryonic cell volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In somatic cell systems, activation of p38 MAPK is a common response of these osmoregulatory pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>MAPKs function by propagating extracellular signals via a series of phosphorylation events through sequentially arranged protein kinases, resulting in cellular responses ranging from transcriptional to post-translational events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. p38 MAPK consists of four mammalian isoforms including MAPK14/p38&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], MAPK11/p38&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], MAPK12/p38&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and MAPK13/p38&#x003b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. p38 MAPKs are activated by a variety of environmental stresses and proinflammatory cytokines resulting in phosphorylation of the Thr-Gly-Tyr phosphoacceptor sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Directly upstream of p38 MAPK, there are at least three dual specificity Thr-Tyr kinases identified that phosphorylate and activate p38: MAP2K3 (or MKK3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], MAP2K6 (or MKK6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and MAP2K4 (or MKK4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Downstream substrates of the p38 MAPKs include protein kinases such as MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and p38 regulated/activated kinase (PRAK/MAPKAPK5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], as well as several transcription factors including MEF2, CHOP, and ATF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The discovery of a class of compounds called cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs) has allowed for the specific pharmacological inhibition of MAPK14/p38&#x003b1; and MAPK11/p38&#x003b2; isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The most extensively characterized CSAIDs are the pyridinyl imidazoles SB203580 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and the more potent SB220025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We have reported that all four p38 MAPK isoforms are expressed throughout mouse preimplantation development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, embryos treated with CSAIDs experience a reversible blockade of development at the 8&#x02013;16 cell stage which is accompanied by a reversible loss of filamentous actin (F-actin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These results point towards an essential role for MAPK14/11 in directing development of the mouse embryo past the 8&#x02013;16 cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Among its possible roles in the early embryo, p38 MAPK signaling is likely to mediate embryonic responses to hyperosmotic stimuli. Recently, a novel scaffolding protein called <bold>O</bold>smosensing <bold>S</bold>caffold for <bold>M</bold>EKK3 (OSM) was characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. OSM binds to F-actin, the GTPase, RAC, and the upstream kinases MAP3K3/MEKK3 and MAP2K3 in the p38 MAPK phospho-relay module, recruiting these proteins to sites of active membrane ruffling and newly polymerized actin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Down-regulation of OSM by RNA interference demonstrated that MAP3K3 and OSM were required for p38 MAPK activation in response to sorbitol-induced hypertonicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The current mouse gene name for OSM is cerebral cavernous malformation 2 homolog (human) (CCM2).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>CCM2 as a Scaffold for p38 MAPK Activation</bold>. As described in [26] the Rho-GTPase, RAC, is recruited to actin membrane ruffles by CCM2 following hyperosmotic stress, facilitating the activation of p38 MAPK. CCM2 acts as a scaffold binding to RAC, MAP3K3, and MAP2K3 to organize these components into a functional signaling module. We have included in this model the two additional upstream MAP2Ks to p38 MAPK: MAP2K6, a specific activator of p38 MAPK related to MAP2K3; and MAP2K4, which primarily activates the JNK/SAPK pathway, but can also phosphorylate p38 MAPK <italic>in vitro</italic>. These two kinases may contribute to activating p38 MAPK in response to hyperosmotic stress but unlikely via interactions with CCM2 [26]. Downstream substrates of p38 MAPK include MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK5. Figure adapted from Uhlik et al. [26].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-7-2-1"/></fig><p>The present study was conducted to investigate whether CCM2 and upstream p38 MAPK pathway constituents are expressed during preimplantation development and to determine whether changes in CCM2 expression are associated with p38 MAPK activation following exposure of preimplantation embryos to hyperosmotic stimuli.

Cultured blastocyst stage mouse embryos were exposed to hyperosmotic treatment for 3, 6, 9, 12, or 24 hours in KSOMaa + 0.2 M sorbitol (460 mOsm) and compared with cultured blastocysts in normal KSOM medium (control group, 260 mOsm).

Our recent characterization of the expression of all four isoforms of p38 MAPK (MAPK14/p38&#x003b1;, MAPK11/p38&#x003b2;, MAPK12/p38&#x003b3;, and MAPK13/p38&#x003b4;) and a number of its downstream substrates provided the foundation for our current studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We have recently demonstrated a requirement for p38 MAPK signaling during preimplantation development by characterizing the reversible developmental blockade that occurs at the 8- to 16-cell stage following inhibition of MAPK14/p38&#x003b1; and MAPK11/p38&#x003b2; isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, p38 MAPK regulates F-actin polymerization during preimplantation development via phosphorylation of downstream substrates MAPKAPK2 and PRAK/MAPKAPK5, and subsequently through the small heat shock proteins, HSPB1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our present study has extended these initial investigations into p38 MAPK function during preimplantation development by addressing the upstream events in the three-tiered MAPK pathway module. Our first objective was to characterize the expression of regulatory kinase gene products upstream of p38 MAPK during preimplantation development. In this regard we have demonstrated that transcripts and proteins encoding all known MAPKKs upstream of p38 MAPK (i.e. MAP2K3, MAP2K6, and MAP2K4) are present throughout mouse preimplantation development. Moreover, we have also identified transcripts and proteins encoding the MAP3K, MAP3K3, as well as the novel scaffolding protein, CCM2.</p><p>Each gene of interest displayed a consistent increase in transcript abundance as embryo development advanced towards the blastocyst stage. There was a significant increase in relative mRNA levels from the 8-cell stage to the morula and blastocyst stages for all transcripts investigated. These results suggest that mRNAs for p38 MAPK pathway constituents are rapidly accumulating in the post 8-cell stage embryo and this observation correlates well with outcomes from p38 MAPK inhibition studies which suggest that p38 MAPK signaling is required to maintain development beyond the 8&#x02013;16 cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Of particular note is the nearly 40-fold increase over 1-cell levels in <italic>Map3k3 </italic>expression at the morula stage, and the 12-fold increase over the same period in <italic>Map2k3 </italic>expression which indicates that MAP3K3 and MAP2K3 may be the primary upstream activators of p38 MAPK during preimplantation development. Conversely, the relatively low expression of <italic>Map2k4 </italic>mRNA transcripts past the 1-cell stage suggests a reduced role for this kinase during early development. Our results indicate that all of these gene products are derived from both oogenetic (maternal) and embryonic origins since they are found in both pre- and post-maternal zygotic transition (MZT) stage embryos. The predominant pattern observed for transcripts encoding p38 MAPK upstream regulators was one where mRNA levels clearly increased with advancing cleavage stage. This accumulation of mRNAs with advancing embryo stage could only occur via contributions from embryonic transcriptional activity.</p><p>At the protein level, the CCM2 and MAP3K3 cytoplasmic distribution pattern observed following application of whole-mount indirect immunofluorescence was as expected considering the role of CCM2 as an actin binding scaffold protein and MAP3K3 as an upstream MAP3K that is responsive to extracellular stimuli at the cell surface. The diffuse cytoplasmic distribution mirrors the localization pattern displayed by these proteins in HEK293 and COS7 cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We also determined the distribution of phosphorylated MAP2K3/MAP2K6 proteins and MAP2K4 proteins throughout mouse preimplantation development. The use of antisera recognizing the phosphorylated forms of these proteins allowed us to not only characterize their distribution throughout preimplantation development but also report their activation during preimplantation development. Activated MAP2Ks were detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of embryos collected from the 1-cell to the blastocyst stage, indicating that the p38 MAPK pathway is activated from the earliest stages of development onward. While phospho-MAP2K3/MAP2K6 proteins were detected in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, phospho-MAP2K4 proteins were confined to the nuclei, suggesting that p38 MAPK phosphorylation by MAP2K4 may occur predominantly in the nucleus. This nuclear localization is supported by studies that investigated the activation of JNK/SAPK in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. MAP2K4 was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of differentiated P19 cells, but only in the nucleus of undifferentiated P19 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Other studies have established that JNK/SAPK and MAP2K4 are activated and translocated into the nucleus in response to cellular stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In total, these results establish the presence of all components of the Rac-CCM2-MAP3K3-MAP2K3 signaling complex throughout preimplantation development when coupled with our previous studies that determined Rac1 expression during mouse preimplantation development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Since it is well known that the roles played by p38 MAPK extend well beyond the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton our present study investigated whether embryonic p38 MAPK signaling is affected by exposure to hyperosmotic stimuli as is reported for somatic cells. Our results clearly demonstrate that hyperosmotic treatment during culture increased p38 MAPK activity as assessed by increased phosphorylation of its specific downstream substrate, MAPKAPK2. These findings are supported by numerous studies that have described the responsiveness of this pathway to hyperosmotic stress, and have indicated that increases in p38 MAPK activity are a common cellular response to hyperosmotic stimuli (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While the increased p38 MAPK activity and phosphorylation of MAPKAPK2 in itself is not a novel discovery, the responsiveness of p38 MAPK to hyperosmotic stress has not until now been demonstrated to occur during preimplantation development. One of the most exciting outcomes from our study is the differential activation of p38 MAPK that occurred in response to the solute compound used to increase the osmolarity of embryo culture media.</p><p>At both 1800 mOsm and 460 mOsm hyperosmotic treatment conditions, the addition of glycerol to KSOMaa culture medium did not result in a significant increase in phospho-MAPKAPK2 immunofluorescence in blastocysts. This is in contrast to the 1.4 M sucrose (1800 mOsm) and 0.2 M sorbitol (460 mOsm) treatments in which a significant increase in phospho-MAPKAPK2 immunofluorescence was detected at two treatment time-points. We propose that this difference in p38 MAPK activation is a result of the alleviation of osmotic stress and restoration of osmotic equilibrium across the cell membrane due to aquaporin (AQP; water channel) mediated glycerol permeability. This likelihood is supported by our previous studies which demonstrated the selective permeability of water and glycerol, but not sucrose, through apical and basolateral AQPs located in the blastocyst trophectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Since glycerol can permeate the cell membrane relatively freely via AQPs, the initial osmotic gradient (from 260 mOsm to 1800 mOsm or 460 mOsm) produced by the addition of glycerol to culture media is rapidly reversed in these treatment groups, alleviating "osmotic stress" that might induce p38 MAPK activity. This also permits the observed re-expansion of blastocyst volume that does not occur with 1.4 M sucrose treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The osmotic gradient produced by 1.4 M sucrose (1800 mOsm) or 0.2 M sorbitol (460 mOsm) persists for the duration of treatment, enough to induce p38 MAPK activity. Our results may therefore have an impact on studies directed at optimizing embryo cryopreservation protocols as the cyroprotectant used (ie glycerol or other) would be expected to have differential effects on p38 MAPK activation which may influence embryo survival and recovery post-thaw. Investigation of this possibility could result in improved outcomes following embryo cryopreservation.</p><p>Interestingly, hyperosmotic treatment of cultured rat astrocytes by mannitol or sorbitol increases the expression of AQP4 and AQP9 mRNAs and proteins, which is suppressed by treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Glycerol treatment, however, had no effect on the expression of these two AQPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Similar to our study, this was attributed to the absence of an osmotic gradient as a result of glycerol movement across cell membranes. Other AQP family members were also differentially expressed in sucrose, sorbitol, or mannitol treatment (in which an osmotic gradient <italic>is </italic>established) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Mouse preimplantation embryos are capable of regulating AQP mRNA abundance in response to environmental changes in osmolarity and changes to blastocoel volume following puncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], however, the potential role of p38 MAPK activity in mediating these events was not investigated. Based upon our results, we would hypothesize that a prolonged shift in osmotic gradient induces p38 MAPK activity, which in turn regulates AQP expression as a compensatory mechanism in preimplantation embryos. This would also represent an important direction for future studies to pursue.</p><p>By quantifying relative signal strength of phospho-MAPKAPK2 immunofluorescence, we observed a 2-fold increase in p38 MAPK activity following 1.4 M sucrose treatment for 10 minutes and a 1.75-fold increase following 0.2 M sorbitol treatment for 15 minutes. A 2-fold increase in p38 MAPK activity is consistent with results observed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. These studies describe rapid (within seconds to minutes) activation of p38 MAPK in response to hyperosmotic treatment through the addition of various solutes to culture conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This activation typically reaches peak levels following 15 minutes of treatment, but elevated p38 MAPK activity is sustained for at least 60 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. It should be noted that while the conditions of hyperosmotic treatment and the methods of assessing p38 MAPK activity vary between these studies, the results are remarkably consistent. Tilly et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]described a 2-fold increase in the enzymatic activity of MAPKAPK2 at 10 minutes after 820 mOsm mannitol-induced hyperosmotic treatment in human intestine 407 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; while Watts et al. demonstrated in rat medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL) kidney cells a 2.3-fold increase in ATF-2 (downstream transcription factor of p38 MAPK) phosphorylation with 0.3 M mannitol following 15 minutes treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, p38 MAPK activity peaked at 15 minutes of 0.2 M sucrose treatment in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) with a 2-fold increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our findings are consistent with these studies since, following peak p38 MAPK activation, there is a steady decline in activity over time. At both experimental osmolarities employed in our study we detected a decrease in RSS (of sucrose/sorbitol groups) from the first time-point (10 minutes and 15 minutes, for 1800 mOsm and 460 mOsm respectively) to the second time-point (30 minutes, for both). Other studies have described peak p38 MAPK activity at approximately 15 minutes in response to hyperosmotic stress. This would suggest that the first time-point in our treatments is near peak levels of p38 MAPK activity, with some of that activity decreased by 30 minutes in the preimplantation mouse embryo. The marginal difference in RSS between 1.4 M sucrose (at 1800 mOsm) and 0.2 M sorbitol (at 460 mOsm) is somewhat surprising. One would expect that an 1800 mOsm osmotic gradient would activate p38 MAPK to a much greater extent than a 460 mOsm gradient. A possible explanation could be that despite the difference between 1800 mOsm and 460 mOsm that we may perceive, the embryo may consider both stimuli as equivalent when translating them into responses for activating p38 MAPK. In this regard it is also possible that 460 mOsm represents a near-maximal stimulus of p38 MAPK activation and thus levels beyond this would not result in any further increase in p38 MAPK activity.</p><p>Though changes were not detected in localization or steady state mRNA transcript levels of CCM2 following hyperosmotic treatment, our results did reveal a significant increase in CCM2 immunofluorescence in blastocysts treated for 15 minutes in 0.2 M sorbitol (460 mOsm), but not 1.4% glycerol (460 mOsm). These results suggest a solute specificity in the induction of CCM2, which agrees with the induction of p38 MAPK activity and phosphorylation of MAPKAPK2 described above. Uhlik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] demonstrated the specificity of OSM/CCM2 to hyperosmolar stimuli by comparing sorbitol and anisomycin treatment, however alternative means of varying treatment osmolarity (i.e. using cell permeable solutes such as glycerol) were not attempted in this study. Interestingly, the 1.74-fold increase in CCM2 immunofluorescence we observed mirrored the 1.75-fold increase in p38 MAPK activity assessed by MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation. Uhlik et al. reported a 2.01-fold increase in MEKK3 kinase activity in HEK293 cells treated with 0.2 M sorbitol for 15 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The kinetics of hyperosmolarity-induced MAP3K3 activation reported in that study closely mirrored that of endogenous p38 MAPK activation in the HEK293 cells. An increase in detectable CCN2 protein without an increase in mRNA levels suggests that 0.2 M sorbitol treatment increases CCM2 expression at the translational level, requiring de novo protein synthesis. An alternative explanation for this increase in detectable CCM2 protein may be in the regulation of scaffold protein stability. If 0.2 M sorbitol treatment results in the increased binding of CCM2 protein with its scaffolding partners, it could result in decreased proteolysis and degradation of CCM2 protein. This would explain the significantly elevated RSS of CCM2 immunofluorescence detected in the sorbitol-treated blastocysts when compared with glycerol-treated and control blastocysts. Either of these possibilities would require further study, as very little is currently known about the translational regulation of CCM2 protein, nor is it clear how CCM2-p38 MAPK interactions may be regulated in general. While our study has presented a novel discovery in the induction of CCM2 in response to hyperosmotic treatment of preimplantation embryos, much work remains to fully characterize CCM2 activity and regulation during this period of development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that transcripts and polypeptides encoding MAP3K3, MAP2K3, MAP2K6, MAP2K4 and CCM2 are expressed and localized throughout mouse preimplantation development. We have discovered that p38 MAPK activity is regulated by exposure to hyperosmotic stimuli, and that the response to hyperosmotic stress in the early embryo includes increased CCM2 levels. These outcomes provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms controlling osmotic induction of p38 MAPK activity during preimplantation development. The outcomes therefore further our knowledge of the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways within the mammalian embryo and understanding of how culture environments can affect embryo development. The preimplantation embryo is highly sensitive to the environment in which it develops. With the extension of embryo culture to the blastocyst stage emerging as a routine treatment paradigm in human infertility clinics, it becomes even more important that we study the short-term and long-term effects of culture on embryo development. Our results may therefore contribute to advancements in the development of improved embryo culture systems with the ultimate goal of increasing our ability to produce healthy embryos for embryo transfer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Superovulation and mouse embryo collection</title><p>Female CD-1 (6&#x02013;8 weeks of age, Charles River Laboratories, Saint-Constant, QC, Canada) or MF-1 mice (4&#x02013;5 weeks of age, Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were superovulated by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 10 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG; Intervet Canada Ltd., Whitby, ON, Canada) followed 48 hours later by 10 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Intervet Canada Ltd., Whitby, ON, Canada) prior to mating with CD-1 males (Charles River Laboratories, Canada) as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

The quantification was normalized to the control luciferase RNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Within the log linear phase region of the amplification curve, the difference between each cycle was equivalent to a doubling of the amplified product of the PCR. The &#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>value was determined by subtracting the control C<sub>T </sub>value for each sample from the target gene C<sub>T </sub>value of the sample. Calculation of &#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>used either the 1-cell or control sample as a standard.

The anti-MEKK3 antiserum used was a mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). The rabbit polyclonal anti-OSM/CCM2 antiserum was a gift generously donated by Dr. Gary L. Johnson (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. All primary antisera were used at a dilution of 1:100, with the exception of anti-OSM/CCM2 at a dilution of 1:200, from the commercial or provided stock concentration. Primary antibodies were labeled using fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antisera (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antisera (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Whole-mount indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy</title><p>Mouse preimplantation stage embryos were collected and processed for application of whole-mount immunofluorescence as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Embryo pools were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed in PBS and then either processed immediately for whole-mount indirect immunofluorescence or stored at 4&#x000b0;C in Embryo Storage Buffer (1X PBS + 0.9% sodium azide) for up to 3 weeks. Fixed embryos were permeabilized and blocked concurrently by room temperature incubation in Embryo Blocking Buffer (0.01% Triton X-100 + 5% Normal Donkey Serum in 1X PBS) for 1 hour followed by one wash in fresh 1X PBS for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C.

To visualize F-actin localization and to stain nuclear DNA, the first 30 minute wash in ADB following secondary antibody incubation included rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd., Oakville, ON, Canada), diluted to 1:200 from 5 &#x003bc;g/mL stock solution, and DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd., Oakville, ON, Canada), diluted to 1:2000 from 1 mg/mL stock solution. Fully processed embryos were mounted onto glass slides in a drop of FluoroGuard&#x02122; Anti-Fade Reagent (BioRad Laboratories Canada Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada). Immunofluorescence imaging employed a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss LSM 410 laser-scanning module and computer system equipped with Zeiss LSM software (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Image analysis and quantification of immunofluorescence intensity</title><p>To quantify immunofluorescence results we employed the method developed and reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. All microscope and image capture settings remained constant during the digital capture of confocal micrographs between embryos and between treatment groups. Acquired micrographs were saved in TIFF image format and processed using Adobe Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA), for recognition, selection and separation of the desired chromogen signal. Quantitative analysis began by separation of the green image channel representing FITC fluorescence of phospho-MAPKAPK2 from the red (representing rhodamine-phalloidin-labelled F-actin) and blue (representing DAPI-stained nuclei) channels. The green channel image was converted to "Grayscale", discarding the other two color channels to ensure the signal remaining represented only FITC fluorescence. The overall luminance of each pixel in the converted image corresponded to the intensity of FITC fluorescence. Each converted micrograph was then inverted so that gray and black pixels represented areas of FITC immunofluorescence on a white background and saved as a new TIFF image file for Scion Image analysis.</p><p>The Scion Image program, Version 4.0.3.2 (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA), is a freely distributed commercial software program that mimics the performance of NIH Image program for quantification of the chromogen signal strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The grayscale inverted micrographs were opened in Scion Image and following the methods of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], the mean density of the chromogen signal strength (SS) of each image was measured and recorded. The average SS from at least three micrographs representing no primary antibody controls was subtracted from the SS values of the measured images from each treatment group to produce an adjusted relative SS value. Relative signal strength (RSS) values were obtained by a ratio comparing the adjusted SS values of each treatment to the average adjusted SS of the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Hyperosmotic treatment of cultured blastocyst stage mouse embryos</title><p>Eight cell stage mouse embryos were flushed from the oviducts of timed-pregnant female mice, washed, pooled in groups of 20, and cultured in 20 &#x003bc;L drops of KSOMaa until the blastocyst stage (approximately 90&#x02013;95 hours post-hCG for cultured embryos) prior to hyperosmotic treatment. Culture medium osmolarity was adjusted by the addition of glycerol, sucrose, or sorbitol to KSOMaa embryo culture.

The osmolarity of the embryo culture medium was tested by freezing-point depression using the Advanced<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Model 3320 Micro-Osmometer (Advanced Instruments Inc., Norwood, MA, USA). For Real-Time PCR analysis, embryos were treated for 3, 6, 9, 12, or 24 hours prior to determination of transcript levels by real-time RT-PCR as described above. For whole-mount indirect immunofluorescence assays, embryos were treated for times ranging from 10 to 30 minutes and then were processed for whole-immunofluorescence methods as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Version 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) or SigmaStat<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>2.0 (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA, USA) software packages. Real-Time PCR results are presented as the mean &#x000b1; s.e.m. for relative mRNA transcript levels from three independent replicates. Real-time RT-PCR data were square-root transformed, subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and followed by Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test. Results from Scion Image analysis are presented as the mean &#x000b1; s.e.m. for relative signal strength (RSS) from three independent replicates with the number of embryos in each treatment group indicated. All data was tested for homogeneity of variances by Levene's Test for Equality of Variances. In instances of equal variance, data was subjected to one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's Least Significant Different (LSD) test for comparing three means of unequal group size. When equal variances were not observed, data was subjected to Welch's variance-weighted ANOVA followed by the Games-Howell (GH) Post-hoc Test for Multiple Comparisons, appropriate for situations of unequal (or equal) sample sizes and unequal or unknown variances.
