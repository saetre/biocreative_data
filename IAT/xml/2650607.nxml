They are accepted to be implicated in normal physiological tissue remodeling, inflammation, and tumor spread. It is widely recognized that many MMPs are expressed in the human lungs, and there is compelling evidence linking MMPs to small airway tissue remodeling, which is the most important histological finding of COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-copd-3-781">Ohnishi et al 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-copd-3-781">Demedts et al 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-3-781">Lagente et al 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-copd-3-781">Baraldo et al 2007</xref>). It is also reported that levels of MMPs in both lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, including sputum, increase as lung function worsens and the degree of airway remodeling increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-copd-3-781">Cataldo et al 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-copd-3-781">Kang et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-3-781">Babusyte et al 2007</xref>). Although these reports may suggest that MMPs seem to be good candidates for possible therapeutic targets in the COPD treatment, there is little evidence showing the influence of the agents that used for COPD treatment on MMPs.</p><p>Tiotropium bromide hydrate (TBH), the first choice agent in the treatment of COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-copd-3-781">Rodrigo et al 2007</xref>), is a once-daily inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilator, which binds to muscarinic receptor subtypes (M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, and M<sub>3</sub>), and exhibits a long duration of action due to prolonged M<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-3-781">Disse 2001</xref>).

In addition, this inhibitory action of TBH on MMP production is due, in part, to its suppressive effect on MMP mRNA expression through the inhibition of transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B activation by TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation. After oral inhalation of TBH, plasma drug levels was gradually increased, plateued at 16 ng/ml when COPD patient was treated with 18.0 &#x003bc;g TBH for 2&#x02013;3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-copd-3-781">Keam et al 2004</xref>), suggesting that suppression of MMP-2 production may be occurred in both airways and peripheral lung tissues of TBH-treated COPD patients.</p><p>COPD is a chronic lung disease, which is mainly induced by inhalation of cigarette smoke, resulting in irreversible airway limitation. A common feature of the disease is the chronic inflammation with intense infiltration of inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils, macrophages and T cells in the airways and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-copd-3-781">Hamid et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-3-781">Hogg et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-3-781">Jeffery 2004</xref>). Histological observation also revealed structural abnormalities, including thickening of the basement membrane, structural fibrosis and mucous gland hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-copd-3-781">Hamid et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-3-781">Hogg et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-3-781">Jeffery 2004</xref>). These cellular events are now called tissue remodeling, and are involved in an extensive alteration of ECM, which is essential for supporting normal lung functions (Elkington et al 2006). It is also reported that, in some cases of COPD, this tissue remodeling causes destruction of healthy lung tissue, leading to emphysema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-copd-3-781">Demedts et al 2005</xref>). Consideration of the biochemistry of the lung matrix predicts that the MMP family of enzymes is likely to be involved in this pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-copd-3-781">Demedts et al 2005</xref>; Elkington et al 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-3-781">Lagente et al 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-3-781">Babusyte et al 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-copd-3-781">Lowrey et al 2008</xref>). MMPs are a family of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated, Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent proteases that can degrade various components of the ECM and basement membrane. MMPs are classified on the basis of substrate specificity into collagens (MMP-1, and -8), gelatinase (MMP-2 and -9), and elastases (MMP-7 and -12), among others (Elkington et al 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-3-781">Lagente et al 2005</xref>). In an analysis of MMPs expression in COPD, MMP-1, -2, -8, and -9 were found to be upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-copd-3-781">Segura-Valdez et al 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-copd-3-781">Baraldo et al 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-copd-3-781">Lowrey et al 2008</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis has also demonstrated increased MMP-14 expression in emphysematous lung tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-copd-3-781">Ohnishi et al 1998</xref>). Furthermore, the studies combining ELISA, immunocytochemistry and a collagen degradation assay revealed the increased levels of MMP-1 and -12 in patients with COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-copd-3-781">Imai et al 2001</xref>). From these reports, it is possible that the attenuating effect of TBH on MMP-2 production from LFs induced by TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation may be additional beneficial therapeutic effects not directly relating to its bronchodilatory effects. The extracellular activity of MMPs is regulated by TIMPs that form an 1:1 complex with MMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-copd-3-781">Nagase 1997</xref>). The present results clearly showed that TBH could not inhibit the TIMP-1 and -2 production from LFs after TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation, suggesting that MMP-2 secreted in small amounts from LFs during TBH treatment are inactivated by TIMPs, and resulting in modification of clinical symptoms derived from ECM remodeling and accumulation of inflammatory cells in COPD.</p><p>Although the present results clearly showed the suppressive effect of TBH on MMP production from LFs induced by TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation, the mechanisms by which TBH could suppress MMP production are not well understood. TNF-&#x003b1; is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a role in inflammation, immunity and a variety of diseases. It is also reported that binding of TNF-&#x003b1; to the type-1 TNF receptor causes an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration through calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-copd-3-781">Lazaar et al 1998</xref>), and results in activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, which are essential transcription factors for MMP-2 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-copd-3-781">Wasylyk et al 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-copd-3-781">Sato et al 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-copd-3-781">Okamoto et al 1994</xref>). Solifenacin succinate, a newly developed muscarinic receptor antagonist, could inhibit carbachol-induced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in guinea pig smooth muscle cells and murine submandibular gland cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-3-781">Ikeda et al 2002</xref>). Soliferan succinate and the other antimuscarinic drugs, such as darifenacin and oxybutynin chloride, which receptor, are also have higher affinity for muscarinic M<sub>3</sub> reported to inhibit increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in rat salivary gland cells induced by carbachol stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-copd-3-781">Ohtake et al 2004</xref>). Furthermore, otilonium bromide, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, could inhibit the increase in intracellular calcium levels in cells from rat colon by blocking L-type calcium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-copd-3-781">Martin et al 2004</xref>). Judging from these reports, it is possible that addition of TBH into LFs cultures caused inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>mobilization induced by TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation, and resulted in suppression of MMP-2 production through the inhibition of transcription factor, especially NF-&#x003ba;B, activation. On the other hand, TNF-&#x003b1;-induced gene transcription in many cell types is mediated by a number of signal transduction pathways, including those involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), mitogen activated protein-kinase (MAPK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JUN), NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-copd-3-781">Turner et al 2005</xref>). In these pathways, activation of ERK and MAPK is essential for TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated MMP gene expression in fibroblasts after TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-copd-3-781">Barchowsky et al 2000</xref>; Domeij et al 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-copd-3-781">Nee et al 2007</xref>). From these reports and the present results showing that the inhibitory action of TBH on the NF-&#x003ba;B activation may suggest that TBH inhibits ERK and MPK activation and results in suppression of MMP production in LFs after TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation. This speculation may be supported, in part, by the observation that muscarinic receptor antagonists could prevent inflammatory protein production induced by acetylcholine stimulation through the inhibition of ERK-NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-copd-3-781">Profita et al 2008</xref>). In addition to the above mentioned signal transduction pathways, TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation causes RhoA/Rho kinase activation, which is responsible for the production of MMP-9 and transmembrane metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-copd-3-781">Meriane et al 2006</xref>), through enhancement of JNK activation in endothelial cells after TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-3-781">Hunter et al 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-copd-3-781">Mong et al 2008</xref>). It is also reported that AP-1 up-regulation induced by TNF-&#x003b1; simulation requires JNK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-copd-3-781">Ventura et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-copd-3-781">Mong et al 2008</xref>). From these reports, there is a possibility that TBH may directly inhibit up-regulation of RhoA/Rho kinase induced by TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation in LFs and results in suppression of MMP-2 production, since TBH could not suppress AP-1 activation by TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation in LFs. Anyway, further experiments are required to clarify the mechanisms by which TBH inhibits MMP-2 production from LFs in response to TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation.</p><p>Different from MMPs, PEA3, a protooncogene-related transcriptional factor, is involved in the regulation of TIMP transcription (De Clerk et al 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-copd-3-781">Sato et al 2002</xref>). From these reports, the present results may be interpreted that TBH could not inhibit PEA3 activation by TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation and results in negative suppressive effects on TIMP production from LFs.</p><p>MMPs are produced by numerous cell types, including fibroblast, macrophages and neutrophils in response to inflammatory stimulation, and mediated transmigration of the inflammatory cells through the basement membrane to propagate inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-3-781">Hoshino et al 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-copd-3-781">Herouy et al 2001</xref>). MMPs are also responsible for microvascular permeability leading to oedema and enhanced inflammatory cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-3-781">Hoshino et al 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-copd-3-781">Herouy et al 2001</xref>), suggesting that administration of TBH into COPD patients attenuates inflammatory responses in the airways and lungs, and may result in favorable modification of clinical status of COPD, including exacerbation frequency. However, a recent report showed that TBH therapy for one year could not reduce the levels of inflammatory makers, such as IL-6, IL-8, and myeloperoxidase in sputum from COPD patient as compared with placebo-treated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-copd-3-781">Powrie et al 2007</xref>). The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear at present. TBH is well accepted to be able to potentially inhibit cholinergic stimulation of mucus-secreting goblet cells in the airways to cause reduction in total volume of sputum, resulting in increase in protein levels in sputum. This may be responsible for negative suppressive effect of TBH on inflammatory marker levels in sputum.</p><p>Finally, this is the first report showing that TBH exerts suppressive effect on MMP production from lung fibroblasts induced by an inflammatory stimulation, and this suppressive activity of TBH may be additional beneficial effects not directly relating to its bronchodilatory effects in COPD patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-copd-3-781"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
