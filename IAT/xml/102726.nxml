There are many reports of an association between <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> infection and atherosclerosis. We determined the whole genome sequence of <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> strain J138 isolated in Japan in 1994 and compared it with the sequence of strain CWL029 isolated in the USA before 1987. The J138 circular chromosome consists of 1 226 565 nt (40.7&#x00025; G&#x0002b;C) with 1072 likely protein-coding genes that is 3665 nt shorter than the CWL029 genome. Plasmids, phage- or transposon-like sequences were not identified. The overall genomic organization, gene order and predicted proteomes of the two strains are very similar, suggesting a high level of structural and functional conservation between the two unrelated isolates. The most conspicuous differences in the J138 genome relative to the CWL029 genome are the absence of five DNA segments, ranging in size from 89 to 1649 nt, and the presence of three DNA segments, ranging from 27 to 84 nt. The complex organization of these &#x02018;different zones&#x02019; may be attributable to a unique system of recombination.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x985cbb0.0x953ec58" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession nos AB036071&#x02013;AB036089</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>Chlamydia</italic> are obligate intracellular eubacteria. <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic>, a causative agent of acute respiratory diseases, is frequently associated with complex chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd371c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd371c4">4</xref>), asthma and multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd371c5">5</xref>).

The whole genome was sequenced and compared with the previously sequenced <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> CWL029 genome. The identity in restriction sites in physical maps of the two strains has been interpreted to mean that <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> strains are highly conserved in their genomic organization and gene order (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd371f1">1</xref>). The sequence comparison showed that three DNA segments, ranging in size from 27 to 84 nt, are unique to the J138 genome (G2, G4 and G6), while five DNA segments, ranging in size from 89 to 1649 nt, are unique to the CWL029 genome (G1, G3, G5, G7 and G8) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd371f2">2</xref>). With the exception of these eight regions, the nucleotide sequences throughout the genomes are almost identical (identity, 99.9&#x00025;), and the orders of the homologous sets of genes are the same. To our surprise, each of the sequences in region G2 of J138 and regions G1, G3, G5 and G7 of CWL029 has an almost identical counterpart in the adjacent region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd371f2">2</xref>). Thus, these elements might have a role in generating the organizational differences by deletion or duplication. In contrast to the regions described above, regions G4, G6 and G8 have no such elements. The assembled sequence of the J138 genome in these regions was further confirmed by re-sequencing the PCR products from the genome.</p><p>Repeat sequences may be responsible for integration of new DNA segments into the chromosome and for transfer of these segments between strains. The direct repeats in regions G1, G2, G3, G5 and G7 are not found in other regions throughout the chromosome. Clustering of DNA with a lower or higher (G&#x0002b;C) percentage suggestive of horizontal DNA transfer was not found in these regions, thus the strain-specific differences are not consistent with different origins for these DNA segments. The distribution of genomic reorganizations or rearrangements is not even on the chromosomes, as the region between <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> J138 genome encoding CPn0911&#x02013;CPn0979 (region G6&#x02013;G8) contains substantially more reorganizations than the other areas of the genome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd371f1">1</xref>). This region does not coincide with any important regions, such as the predicted chromosome replication terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd371c6">6</xref>).</p><p>Six coding genes in the CWL029 genome are different in J138 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd371f2">2</xref>). Thus, CPn0007 for a hypothetical protein (G1) and <italic>pmp-6</italic> for Chlamydia-specific polymorphic outer membrane protein (G5) encode truncated proteins lacking 110 and 131 amino acids in the middle region of the homologs in CWL029, respectively, <italic>pfkA</italic> for fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase lacks the C-terminal 14 amino acids of the CWL029 homolog (G3), and <italic>htrB</italic> for lauroyl acyltransferase is separated into CPn0098.1 and <italic>htrB</italic> (G2) in J138. In addition, the J138 genome lacks CPn0979 for a hypothetical protein (G8) and one of the two copies of <italic>tyrP</italic> for tyrosine transporter as well as <italic>yccA</italic> for a transport permease (G7).</p><p>The low proportion of strain-specific ORFs that may be attributed to the absence of insertion sequence, phage or transposon-like homologs indicates that the <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> genome may be limited in its flexibility. Striking similarity between the <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> genome sequences of the two unrelated strains might be linked to the unique intracellular biology of this organism.</p><p>Recent analysis of the genomic polymorphism of chlamydial species revealed that the genome of <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> is highly conserved, whereas that of <italic>C.trachomatis</italic> is diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd371c10">10</xref>). Identification of the minimal genetic diversity in the whole genome will facilitate understanding of the biology of <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic>. The high genomic conservation of <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> is in contrast to the strain-specific genetic diversity of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, the human gastric pathogen, that has been proposed to be involved in the organism&#x02019;s ability to cause different diseases and to participate in the lifelong chronicity of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd371c11">11</xref>). The genome sequence of <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> AR39, which has just been published and found to be identical to the sequence of CWL029 except a truncated ORF (~300 bp shorter in AR39) and a bacteriophage (T.Read, personal communication), provides additional information on the genomic stability of this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd371c12">12</xref>).</p><p>Previous genomic-sequence comparison of the two chlamydial species revealed that the <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> CWL029 genome contains 187 711 additional nucleotides including 214 coding sequences compared with the <italic>C.trachomatis</italic> serovar D genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd371c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd371c13">13</xref>). In addition, there is a substantially low level of similarity for individual encoded proteins between the orthologs from the two species. These results are consistent with the recent reclassification of genus <italic>Chlamydia</italic> based on the phylogenetic analysis. A new genus, genus <italic>Chlamydophila</italic> was proposed to assimilate the current species, <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Chlamydia pecorum</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd371c14">14</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd371f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Comparison of the two <italic>C.pneumoniae</italic> genomes based on the chromosomal organization of strain CWL029.
