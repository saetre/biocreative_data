The phenotype correlated with increased activity of the I&#x003ba;B kinase axis as well as p38, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase or c-Jun N-terminal kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. The trait was mapped to the <italic>Why1</italic> locus, which contains <italic>Irak2</italic>, a gene previously implicated as sustaining the late phase of TLR responses. In the MOLF/Ei TLR signaling network, IRAK-2 promotes early nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) activity and is essential for the activation of p38 MAPK. We identify a deletion in the MOLF/Ei promoter of the inhibitory <italic>Irak2c</italic> gene, leading to an increased ratio of pro- to antiinflammatory IRAK-2 isoforms. These findings demonstrate that IRAK-2 is an essential component of the early TLR response in MOLF/Ei mice and show a distinct pathway of p38 and NF-&#x003ba;B activation in this model organism. In addition, they demonstrate that studies in evolutionarily divergent model organisms are essential to complete dissection of signal transduction pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In vertebrates, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) respond to an array of pathogen-expressed molecules by initiating a series of intracellular signaling events that activate innate immunity and, thus, play a crucial role in the response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leulier and Lemaitre, 2008</xref>). Although this system is capable of providing a fast and vigorous response, it has to be kept under tight control to avoid hyperresponsiveness that would be detrimental to the host by initiating such pathologies as sepsis, chronic inflammation, and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nathan, 2002</xref>). Key upstream processes in TLR signal transduction include MyD88 and MAL adaptor binding and phosphorylation of the IRAK family kinases. Subsequent ubiquitination of the TRAF6 complex leads to activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins, which ultimately induce the transcription of inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doyle and O'Neill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawai and Akira, 2006</xref>). The remaining innate and adaptive immune responses are highly dependent on the time course and composition of this early inflammatory milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoebe et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, a detailed understanding of the initial events in TLR signaling is critical to predicting the entire nature of a response to pathogen invasion as well as identifying the safest and most effective substrates for targeted antiinflammatory therapies.</p><p>IRAK family kinases are centrally positioned in the TLR signaling cascade, and, as such, they have been implicated as key positive and negative inflammatory regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janssens and Beyaert, 2003</xref>). Two family members, IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 have been shown to promote inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swantek et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>), whereas IRAK-M has a demonstrated inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>). Recently reported gene targeting of IRAK-2 firmly established its importance in sustaining high levels of inflammation at late time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawagoe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wan et al., 2009</xref>). However, the exact role of IRAK-2 in TLR-mediated signaling remains less clear because other studies imply its involvement in early signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muzio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keating et al., 2007</xref>). Further elucidation of IRAK-2's role in inflammatory signaling is critical to complete our understanding of the role of all members of the IRAK family. Experimentation is complicated by the fact that there are four isoforms of IRAK-2 in mice, with at least one of them, IRAK-2C, being inhibitory, whereas there is only one human IRAK-2 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardy and O'Neill, 2004</xref>). Thus, the model system in which the function of IRAK-2 is interrogated may be a critical determinant of the conclusions that are reached.</p><p>Classical inbred strains of mice have been instrumental in the genetic analysis of innate immunity. Observations on the molecular nature of the immune response in laboratory mice are highly reproducible because of their genetic homogeneity. Many, though not all, of these features have been shown to recapitulate parallel human processes, an expected outcome given the high level of homology between the genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Waterston et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mestas and Hughes, 2004</xref>). However, because most of the classical inbred mouse strains descend from a relatively restricted number of founder animals largely within the <italic>Mus mus domesticus</italic> subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frazer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), their genetic diversity is limited, thereby restricting their utility for phenotypic screening. It is therefore not surprising that the genetics of innate immunity has been increasingly studied by other means, such as genome-wide ENU mutagenesis, which has resulted in numerous remarkable discoveries of gene functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beutler et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Wild-derived mice, which diverged from the common ancestor of classical strains more than one million years ago, provide an additional reservoir of genetic diversity, which, unlike that resulting from laboratory mutagenesis, has arisen in an evolutionary context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guenet and Bonhomme, 2003</xref>). As a result of their early divergence, many of the wild-derived strains have large genomic regions originating from the subspecies <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> and <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frazer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). When compared with commonly used inbred strains, they exhibit polymorphisms every 100&#x02013;200 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ideraabdullah et al., 2004</xref>). This genetic diversity is a rich substrate for experimental interrogation. The likelihood of phenotypic variation in these strains is increased compared with that observed between classical strains. Furthermore, novel phenotypes that are revealed likely have important biological consequences because they have been selected naturally over the course of subspeciation. Wild-derived mice are an emerging, though still largely unexplored, model for the identification and study of novel immunological genes. Their usefulness as genetic models is exemplified by studies exploring response to pathogen infections as well as lethality mediated by TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Urosevic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Staelens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sancho-Shimizu and Malo, 2006</xref>).</p><p>To identify novel factors that regulate TLR signaling, we initiated a genetic screen in wild-derived and classical inbred mice and identified a novel dominant phenotype of hyperresponse to LPS, peptidoglycan, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) in several wild-derived strains. We have focused on two loci, termed <italic>Why1</italic> and <italic>Why2</italic> (wild-derived hyperresponse 1 and 2), with opposite effects on the trait. Our previous study identified a novel antiinflammatory role for IRAK-1BP1 (IRAK-1 binding protein or SIMPL) that is encoded by <italic>Why2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conner et al., 2008</xref>). In this paper, we provide evidence that IRAK-2 is the product of <italic>Why1</italic>. The effect is caused by a 10-bp deletion in the promoter area of the inhibitory isoform IRAK-2C, thus resulting in relatively higher levels of expression of the proinflammatory isoform of IRAK-2 in MOLF/Ei as compared with C57BL/6. These findings extend our knowledge of the role and importance of IRAK-2 in TLR-mediated signaling. Furthermore, they emphasize the versatile nature of the innate immune system, which is able to undergo substantial changes in the utilization of core signaling factors even within the course of evolution of a single species.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Hyperresponsiveness to TLR/IL-1R activation in MOLF/Ei mice</title><p>Macrophages from the wild-derived mouse strain MOLF/Ei induce transcription of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 faster and in higher quantities upon TLR stimulation when compared with the classical inbred strain C57BL/6J (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conner et al., 2008</xref>). In an attempt to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular events underlying this hyperresponsive phenotype, we examined the transcriptional response of additional cytokine genes early after stimulation with the TLR2 agonist LTA. Although MOLF/Ei macrophages displayed an increased amount of IL-6 transcript, two other proinflammatory genes, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-12p40, were induced to similar levels in MOLF/Ei and C57BL/6J cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Hyperactivation of cytokines and intracellular mediators in TLR2-stimulated MOLF/Ei macrophages.</bold> (A) Peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6J and MOLF/Ei mice were stimulated with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml LTA for the indicated times.

(B) MEFs were prepared from MOLF/Ei and C57BL/6J mice and stimulated with 100 ng/ml human IL-1&#x003b2; or TNF-&#x003b1; for the indicated times. IL-6 mRNA was quantified using real-time PCR. Data are shown as mean &#x000b1; range from duplicate wells, representative of two independent experiments. (C&#x02013;E) BMDMs from each strain were stimulated with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml LTA for the indicated times.

To gain insight into which signaling components are hyperresponsive in MOLF/Ei mice, we tested mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from MOLF/Ei and C57BL/6J strains for their response to IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation. Whereas MOLF/Ei MEFs displayed increased IL-6 production relative to C57BL/6J in response to IL-1&#x003b2;, equivalent levels of IL-6 were produced upon TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). These findings suggest that the factor promoting increased IL-6 production in MOLF/Ei cells is shared between the MyD88-dependent TLR and IL-1R pathways but is not common to the TNFR pathway.</p><p>Complete induction of responsive genes upon TLR stimulation requires a combination of downstream signaling events, including transcriptional activation through the NF-&#x003ba;B family factors, chromatin remodeling, and activity of the MAPK proteins p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawai and Akira, 2006</xref>). Individual inflammatory genes exhibit different requirements for each of these activities, a feature which aids in conferring specificity to immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saccani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sanjabi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foster et al., 2007</xref>). To assess the activation status of upstream molecular mediators in MOLF/Ei and C57BL/6J macrophages, Western blot analysis was performed. Examination of phosphorylation status for all three MAPK family members revealed that p38, but not ERK or JNK, was activated faster and at higher levels in MOLF/Ei cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Furthermore, assessment of the I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) axis of TLR signaling was performed by observing the direct phosphorylation of the I&#x003ba;B family member p105 as well as the IKK-dependent process of proteasome-mediated degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b2;. Each of these processes was enhanced in MOLF/Ei macrophages relative to C57BL/6J (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Thus, MOLF/Ei mice exhibit a specific enhancement in p38 and IKK activity after TLR2 stimulation.</p><p>We next asked if more receptor proximal and regulatory signaling events also displayed increased activity in the MOLF/Ei TLR response. Stimulus-induced degradation of IRAK-1 is a well characterized outcome of IL-1R/TLR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamin and Miller, 1997</xref>), which is believed to be an important inhibitory event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Siedlar et al., 2004</xref>). An examination of IRAK-1 protein concentration after TLR2 stimulation revealed that MOLF/Ei macrophages did not degrade IRAK-1 more quickly than C57BL/6J but, rather, exhibited a slightly more prolonged IRAK-1 half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Together, these findings imply that the hyperresponsiveness in MOLF/Ei TLR signaling is biased toward specific proinflammatory outcomes, with regulatory functions such as IRAK-1 protein degradation showing equivalent or decreased activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic mapping of high IL-6 production in MOLF/Ei</title><p>We next sought to elucidate the genetic basis for the difference in TLR-stimulated MOLF/Ei and C57BL/6J macrophages. We previously reported that genome-wide linkage analysis in a panel of N2(C57BL/6Jx(C57BL/6JxMOLF/Ei)) mice identified two loci associated with LTA-stimulated IL-6 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conner et al., 2008</xref>). The MOLF/Ei allele at one of these loci, <italic>Why2</italic>, was negatively associated with IL-6 production, which was the result of a cis-acting gene regulatory element allowing TLR-inducible expression of the negative regulator IRAK-1BP1. We therefore focused on the <italic>Why1</italic> locus, a 21-Mb region on chromosome 6 between markers D6MIT36 and TNFRSF1a. Using secreted IL-6 protein 6 h after activation with LTA, a codominant mode of inheritance was observed as indicated by the intermediate phenotype of F1(B6xMOLF) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Evaluation of 82 N2 backcross mice by this assay revealed a significantly increased amount of IL-6 secretion associated with a copy of the MOLF <italic>Why1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), indicating that a factor promoting TLR-stimulated IL-6 production in MOLF/Ei mice is contained within this genomic interval.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>TLR2-stimulated IL-6 production is associated with the <italic>Why1</italic> locus.</bold> (A) Codominant inheritance of IL-6 protein secretion.

However, the possibility remained that late-acting effects, such as differences in protein translation, stability, or secretion, were playing a significant role in the phenotypic outcome. We therefore assessed IL-6 transcript 1 h after stimulation to confirm that the underlying polymorphism at <italic>Why1</italic> was functioning within the initial pathway leading to TLR-induced gene transcription. Increased IL-6 messenger RNA (mRNA) accumulation 1 h after stimulation was significantly associated with the MOLF <italic>Why1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Thus, the <italic>Why1</italic> locus interacts with TLR pathways within the first hour after activation.</p><p>In both association studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>), all mice that were homozygous for the C57BL/6J allele of <italic>Why1</italic> were low producers of IL-6, indicating that the MOLF/Ei <italic>Why1</italic> allele is necessary for N2 mice to generate a heightened response. In contrast, mice with a heterozygous genotype for <italic>Why1</italic> exhibited a wide range of secreted IL-6. These data indicate that heterozygosity for <italic>Why1</italic> alone is not sufficient to confer high levels of IL-6 but probably acts in combination with additional MOLF/Ei alleles.</p><p>To confirm that the <italic>Why1</italic> locus is a critical heritable determinant of IL-6 production in TLR-stimulated macrophages, we assessed its inheritance through five generations of mice chosen for serial backcrossing to C57BL/6J on a phenotypic basis. At each generation, peritoneal macrophages were isolated from each mouse using a nonlethal method and high-responding mice were identified for continued backcrossing.

In contrast to pure MOLF/Ei cells, <italic>Why1</italic> congenic macrophages did not display an increase in p38 activation. A slightly more rapid degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; was observed in peritoneal macrophages, which is consistent with increased IKK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). The observed rate of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation by Western blot analysis was only incrementally increased in peritoneal macrophages and was not observed in BM-derived macrophages (BMDMs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref> and not depicted). We reasoned that this may be caused by the low sensitivity of Western blot analysis in detecting slight differences in NF-&#x003ba;B pathway activity. To assess more subtle effects on NF-&#x003ba;B in <italic>Why1</italic> congenic macrophages, we examined TLR-induced transcription of CCL3 (MIP-1&#x003b1;). The CCL3 promoter has been shown to be predominantly dependent on NF-&#x003ba;B activity and to contain fewer additional elements than the IL-6 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grove and Plumb, 1993</xref>).

Consistent with these findings, IRAK-2 knockdown in BMDMs using two effective short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting constructs had no effect on the relatively small amount of IL-6 produced by C57BL/6J mice. In contrast, knockdown of IRAK-2 in MOLF/Ei BMDMs severely attenuated TLR2-induced IL-6 mRNA and protein accumulation 4 and 6 h after stimulation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A&#x02013;C</xref>).

IRAK-2 knockdown impaired the IKK-dependent processes of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation and p105 phosphorylation. To more directly assay the activation status of IKK, we measured TLR2-induced phosphorylation of the IKK-&#x003b2; subunit, which is the major IKK component targeted by TLR signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonizzi and Karin, 2004</xref>). IKK-&#x003b2; phosphorylation was impaired in IRAK-2 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>), suggesting that in MOLF/Ei mice, IRAK-2 affects the IKK&#x02013;NF-&#x003ba;B axis above the level of IKK activation. We next examined the phosphorylation status of the MAPK proteins JNK, p38, and ERK. LTA-induced p38 activity was severely impaired by IRAK2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). This effect was specific for IRAK-dependent pathways, as osmotically stressed macrophages activated p38 to equal levels in control and IRAK-2&#x02013;targeted knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). In comparison with p38 status, JNK was more marginally affected and a slightly delayed onset of ERK phosphorylation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Thus, IRAK-2 knockdown in MOLF/Ei macrophages affects IKK activity, as well as all three MAPKs with the largest effect on p38.</p><p>The data depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> imply that IRAK-2 occupies a critical position in MOLF/Ei TLR signal transduction. However, they do not address the question of whether allelic variation in IRAK-2 itself is responsible for the increased dependence on this gene or, alternatively, whether other MOLF/Ei gene products function to promote hyperresponsiveness through a requisite interaction with IRAK-2. To address this question, we assayed the effect of IRAK-2 shRNA knockdown in C57BL/6J-<italic>Why1</italic> congenic macrophages, which contain the MOLF/Ei allele of <italic>Irak2</italic> on a &#x0003e;98% C57BL/6J background. <italic>Why1</italic> congenic BMDMs transduced with a control shRNA hairpin construct secreted an increased amount of IL-6 protein relative to C57BL/6J BMDMs 6 h after LTA stimulation. In contrast, IL-6 accumulation was similar between cells from both strains that were transduced with an IRAK-2&#x02013;targeting hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). We next examined the effect of IRAK2 knockdown on IL-6 transcription at various time points after TLR2 activation. The largest difference between strains in the response to IRAK-2 knockdown was at the earliest time points tested, whereas by later times both strains showed a similar decrease in IL-6 mRNA levels. Surprisingly, IRAK-2 knockdown was associated with increased IL-6 accumulation in C57BL/6J cells at 30 and 60 min after LTA stimulation, whereas a notable decrease was occurring in <italic>Why1</italic> congenic macrophages at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>).

Although the genetic diversity of these mouse strains has been appreciated previously, it has also limited their use in forward genetic analyses because of the often polygenic nature underlying observed traits. In addition, high levels of polymorphism in these mice, as compared with classical inbred strains, have made it difficult to establish a causative link between a candidate-gene and a phenotype. In our mapping of <italic>Why1</italic>, we were able to overcome these problems by performing knockdown of the candidate gene directly on a panel of backcross mice and showing an allele-specific effect of silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). This method, which was previously applied in describing the product of the <italic>Why2</italic> locus, IRAK-1BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conner et al., 2008</xref>), greatly facilitated our ability to assess gene candidates in the context of genetic assortment.</p><p>IRAK-2 emerged as the likely candidate in our mapping studies because of the known role of IRAK family kinases in TLR-mediated signaling pathways. Its candidacy was further supported by the strain-specific effect of IRAK-2 silencing, which preferentially inhibited the signaling pathways that were hyperresponsive in MOLF/Ei and C57BL/6J-<italic>Why1</italic> congenic mice. The mutation identified in the promoter of the IRAK-2C isoform is a 10-bp deletion covering a CACC consensus element that lies in the 5&#x02032; untranslated region. This element has a predicted ability to bind Kruppel-like and Sp1 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Philipsen and Suske, 1999</xref>). Together with a GATA-specific site that is present in C57BL/6J but not MOLF/Ei mice and located 5&#x02032; to the deletion, the CACC site is able to provide constitutively high as well as stimulus-dependent expression of IRAK-2C in C57BL/6J but not MOLF/Ei mice. The presence of both sites within the C57BL/6J promoter is especially pertinent, given previous studies on synergistic gene transactivation by elements binding each of these sites independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Merika and Orkin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gregory et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The outcome of this differential expression of IRAK-2 isoforms is a higher ratio of proinflammatory IRAK-2A relative to the inhibitory IRAK-2C in MOLF/Ei macrophages, which, in turn, allows IRAK-2A to assume a more central role in TLR activation early after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). Our model considers a critical function for IRAK-2A in MOLF/Ei mice, which provides additional stimulation for NF-&#x003ba;B and p38-mediated signaling. In contrast, the highly expressed IRAK-2C isoform in classical inbred mice potentially offsets the proinflammatory effect of IRAK-2A during the early phase of activation. Our data show that IRAK-2A is required but not sufficient for signaling in MOLF/Ei, suggesting that other gene products are almost certainly involved. In addition to the data presented here, our initial mapping revealed strong epistatic interactions between <italic>Why1</italic> and other loci in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conner et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, there may be additional recessively inherited loci that promote inflammation but that would only be revealed using a reciprocal (MOLF/Eix[MOLFEixC57BL/6J]) backcross.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of IRAK-2 usage in MOLF/Ei compared with C57BL/6J TLR signal transduction.</bold> In MOLF/Ei macrophages, knockdown experiments reveal that IRAK-2 plays a central role in activation of p38 and IKK, two pathways which show increased activity relative to C57BL/6J mice. Neither of these phenotypes can be completely recapitulated with the MOLF/Ei allele on a classical inbred background, suggesting that additional MOLF/Ei alleles are important for the complete levels of hyperresponsiveness observed in comparing parental strains. The MOLF/Ei allele of <italic>Irak2</italic> expresses less of the IRAK-2C isoform, which may underlie the phenotype by decreasing interference with IRAK-2A activity. In C57BL/6J macrophages, which express an increased amount of IRAK-2C, previous studies have demonstrated that early TLR signaling events are not controlled by IRAK-2, although it is important for late activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B axis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20090490_GS_Fig9"/></fig><p>Previous analysis of mice with a targeted null mutation in IRAK-2 revealed its role in sustained levels of NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawagoe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wan et al., 2009</xref>). Our analysis extends these findings by showing that in a wild-derived mouse model, IRAK-2 is indispensable for the early response. Silencing of IRAK-2 dramatically down-regulates IL-6 production in these mice, bringing it to levels even lower than those in C57BL/6J macrophages. In addition, the mechanistic basis for the phenotype provides a potential explanation for why targeting IRAK-2 in classical inbred strains does not provide an immediate effect on signaling: the balance between pro- and antiinflammatory isoforms of IRAK-2 in these strains is such that IRAK-2C may be capable of effectively inhibiting IRAK-2A. As the peak of IRAK-2C mRNA accumulation occurs at 1.5 h after stimulation, the proinflammatory nature of IRAK-2A may only become apparent at later time points. For the same reason, we observed that silencing of IRAK-2 in C57BL/6J macrophages does not alter signaling in the first hours after activation because the proinflammatory isoform is checked by high levels of IRAK-2C at these times. This model is further supported by our findings that at very early time points (30 and 60 min) after TLR stimulation, IRAK-2 knockdown is associated with a slight increase in IL-6 production in C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>).</p><p>Several negative regulators of TLR-mediated signaling have been described, which exert their inhibitory effect at different positions within the pathway. Some of these inhibitors are products of alternative splicing, such as MyD88s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Janssens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burns et al., 2003</xref>), soluble TLR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LeBouder et al., 2003</xref>), and soluble TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iwami et al., 2000</xref>); others, like IRAK-M, are sole gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>). In this paper, we propose that the previously described inhibitory molecule IRAK-2C, which originates from a unique promoter within the <italic>Irak2</italic> gene, plays a role in the regulation of the TLR response of classical inbred mouse strains. The mechanism by which IRAK-2C inhibits TLR signaling remains to be elucidated. However, the domain structure of IRAK-2 offers some important clues. The death domain, positioned at the N terminus of full-length IRAK-2 is required for its interaction with MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muzio et al., 1997</xref>) and likely with the MyD88 like adaptor MAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fitzgerald et al., 2001</xref>). The complete absence of the death domain in IRAK-2C suggests that it would not interact with these signaling components at the membrane. In contrast, IRAK-2 is proposed to interact with the key cytoplasmic adaptor molecule TRAF6 through its C terminus, leading to ubiquitination and activation of TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keating et al., 2007</xref>). Because the C terminus of IRAK-2C is identical to full-length IRAK-2, it may still interact with TRAF6 and potentially sequester this molecule away from IRAK-2A and other critical membrane signaling components. Our results demonstrate that knockdown of all IRAK-2 isoforms in the low IRAK-2C&#x02013;expressing MOLF/Ei strain has an overall inhibitory effect, whereas no major effect is seen in the high IRAK-2C&#x02013;expressing C57BL/6J strain. These findings suggest that direct inhibition of IRAK-2A will be an essential aspect IRAK-2C's mechanism.</p><p>One of the most surprising findings that emerged from our studies of the TLR response in MOLF/Ei mice was the observed specificity in affected early upstream signaling mediators. In addition to activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, MOLF/Ei mice displayed specific hyperactivity in p38, but not ERK or JNK, MAPK phosphorylation. These data are consistent with our observation that not all cytokines are increased in MOLF/Ei TLR responses relative to classical inbred mouse strains. The largest effect was observed for IL-6 mRNA produced at early time points after stimulation. C57BL/6J and MOLF/Ei macrophages displayed similar levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-12p40 transcription, which, like IL-6 are known to be NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shakhov et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sanjabi et al., 2005</xref>). The underlying mechanism for this specificity remains incompletely characterized. p38 has been shown to play a critical role in IL-6 transcription through histone H3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saccani et al., 2002</xref>), as well as through activation of the transcription factor CREB, whereas it has a smaller effect on TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-12p40 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2005</xref>). Other signaling mediators may also be hyperresponsive in MOLF/Ei macrophages, which could synergize with p38-dependent pathways to specifically enhance the transcription of IL-6.</p><p>Remarkably, IRAK-2 knockdown on a MOLF/Ei background had its largest effects on the same signaling molecules that were hyperresponsive relative to C57BL/6J. Furthermore, IRAK-2A and IRAK-2C overexpression in a macrophage cell line vastly affected IL-6 mRNA accumulation, whereas effects on TNF-&#x003b1; were less substantial. These results imply that IRAK-2 not only amplifies the signal from TIR domain&#x02013;containing molecules but also provides specificity for such amplification. Such discrimination between different targeted MAPKs has not yet been reported for any of the upstream components of the TLR-mediated pathway. This effect of IRAK-2 will be important to investigate further.</p><p>Although ubiquitously expressed pathogen-associated molecules activate a relatively small number of TLRs, the effects of TLR-responsive genes are quite specific. Their individual actions can heavily bias the remaining immune response by, for example, promoting the development of T effector subsets toward a Th1, Th2, Th17, or T reg phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004</xref>). In considering the effect of the early innate immune system on subsequent processes, the evolutionary context under which wild-derived mice have recently existed is critical. It is remarkable that incorporation of such TLR-proximal factors as IRAK-2 has arisen to shape differential expression of specific cytokine genes.</p><p>Whereas the MOLF/Ei allele of <italic>Why2</italic> was associated with an inhibitory effect on TLR-induced IL-6 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conner et al., 2008</xref>), the findings reported in this paper show that MOLF/Ei <italic>Why1</italic> promotes a faster and more robust IL-6 response. The coevolution of these two opposing loci may have been critical, allowing ancestral wild-derived species to develop uniquely potent yet, at the same time, highly regulated innate immune functions. Previous studies have described both increased susceptibility and resistance of wild-derived strains in various infectious models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Urosevic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sebastiani et al., 2002</xref>). Although neither of these phenotypes has been genetically mapped to the <italic>Why1</italic> or <italic>Why2</italic> loci from our studies, the unique cytokine response profile that we observe in vitro will likely have corresponding outcomes in the context of a live infection. Under the circumstances of persistent pathogen replication and the formation of an adaptive response, the <italic>Why1</italic> and <italic>Why2</italic> loci may help to identify important effects of the time course and specificity of cytokines produced by the innate immune system on the development of infectious or host mediated pathology.</p><p>The scientific approach of studying individual genes in isolation is increasingly giving way to the appreciation of networked genes working together to determine complex phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oda and Kitano, 2006</xref>). Wild-derived mice are ideal models for comparison of different gene networks. Our data so far support the hypothesis that innate immune networks in classical and wild-derived inbred mice are organized differently and will be rich in unique gene&#x02013;gene interactions. In addition to identifying single components of these interactions (which could themselves be novel), the biggest potential of this work is the ability to establish new signaling pathways, which would otherwise be difficult to predict. Our data demonstrate that IRAK-2A is positioned in the center of the TLR scaffold in MOLF/Ei and that it is likely much less affected by the inhibitory isoform IRAK-2C. Interestingly, there is only one proinflammatory human homologue of IRAK-2, which suggests a greater similarity between organization of TLR signaling elements in humans and wild-derived mice compared with classically used strains. This possibility strongly supports further characterization of immunological responses in wild-derived mice for their potential to model critical elements of human biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice and isolation of MEFs.</title><p>C57BL/6J and MOLF/Ei parental strains were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.
