The spectrum is defined on the basis of specific eye anomalies that include prominent annular white line near the limbus at the level of Descemet membrane (posterior embryotoxon), hypoplastic iris, irido-corneal adhesions and glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Diagnosis of ARS is established when the above-described ocular features are accompanied by other systemic abnormalities, most commonly craniofacial, dental and umbilical defects. Craniofacial anomalies usually consist of maxillary hypoplasia, thin lip and dysplastic ears. Dental defects vary from small teeth to complete anodontia with missing lateral mandibular incisors being the most common feature. Umbilical anomalies may range from isolated redundant skin at the site of the umbilicus to severe hernias or omphalocele. Among other associated anomalies, pituitary and cardiac defects, hearing loss, hydrocephalus and hypospadius have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Axenfeld-Rieger spectrum is a heterogeneous condition. Mutations in <italic>PITX2 </italic>(4q25), <italic>FOXC1 </italic>(6p25), <italic>PAX6 </italic>(11p12), and a yet to be identified gene at 13q14 have been shown to result in Axenfeld-Rieger isolated eye anomalies as well as the complete syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Ocular manifestations of <italic>PITX2 </italic>mutations show broad variability, both between and within families. To date, the reported phenotypes include Rieger and Axenfeld anomaly, iris hypoplasia, iridogoniodysgenesis, Peters' anomaly, aniridia and ring dermoid of cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The <italic>PITX2 </italic>gene encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor and spans about 20 kb of genomic sequence and includes six exons that encode four alternative transcripts that arise by alternative splicing and the differential use of three promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Although gain-of-function mutations have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], a deficiency in normal PITX2 protein (haploinsufficiency) is suggested to be the major mechanism of ARS. This is supported by the presence of large deletions that include <italic>PITX2 </italic>in some Axenfeld-Rieger patients and functional studies of proteins derived from mutant alleles. A correlation between the dosage of normal PITX2 protein and the severity of the phenotype was noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Most of the human <italic>PITX2 </italic>mutations described thus far affect regions encoding the homeodomain- or C-terminal domains, although a few intronic mutations have been reported (see references above).</p><p>Pre-mRNA splicing is the process whereby introns are removed and exons are joined to produce mature mRNA. RNA splicing is facilitated by a large macromolecular machine, the spliceosome, which recognizes conserved sequences at intron/exon borders, including the 5' and 3' splice sites and branchpoint sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In a few instances, <italic>PITX2 </italic>mutations have been identified in introns either at or in close proximity to splice sites (ss) associated with the last two exons. These observations suggest that splicing defects might explain the syndrome in these individuals. To date, only coding region mutations in <italic>PITX2 </italic>have been investigated. Here, we report the identification of two new human families with intronic <italic>PITX2 </italic>mutations and present an analysis of the effects of intronic mutations on <italic>PITX2 </italic>mRNA splicing. The data suggest that aberrant RNA splicing underlies the disorder in six families and that the degree of aberrant splicing may contribute to the variability of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome phenotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Identification of PITX2 mutations</title><p>DNA samples obtained from new patients with ARS and anomaly were screened for PITX2 gene mutations in exons and at least 100-bp into adjacent intron regions as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. DNA was isolated from blood spots using the QIAGEN QIamp<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>DNA mini kit following the dried blood spot protocol. PCR was conducted in a GeneAmp<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>PCR system 9700 in 30 &#x003bc;l reactions containing 1.5 mmol/l Mg 2+, 40&#x02013;100 ng DNA, Biolase Reaction Buffer (Bioline), 0.25 mM each dNTP, 1.5 units Biolase DNA polymerase (Bioline) and 0.2 &#x003bc;M of each oligodeoxynucleotide primer. Cycling profile was one cycle of 94&#x000b0;C for five minutes, 30 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, 56&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, and 72&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, and one cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for ten minutes.

Products were sequenced bidirectionally with an ABI Prism<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>3700 DNA sequencer using ABI Prism<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>BigDye&#x02122; Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kits. The 20 &#x003bc;l reactions contained 5% DMSO, 1 &#x003bc;l of PCR product DNA, and 0.32 &#x003bc;M oligodeoxynucleotide primer. Cycling profile was conducted in a GeneAmp<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>PCR System 9700. Cycling profile was one cycle of 96&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 35 cycles of 96&#x000b0;C for ten seconds, 50&#x000b0;C for 5 seconds and 60&#x000b0;C for four minutes. Extension products were purified using Agencourt CleanSEQ<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Reaction Clean up. PCR products were then sent to Agencourt, Inc to be sequenced. Sequences were manually examined for mutations and confirmed by additional independent amplification and sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>PITX2 DNA constructs</title><p>A primer positioned at g.16944 of the <italic>PITX2 </italic>genomic sequence (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF238048">AF238048</ext-link>) and a downstream primer at g.17393 were used to PCR-amplify a 473 bp fragment that included part of exon 1b and the downstream intron using human genomic DNA as a PCR template; EcoRI and BamHI sites were appended to the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. Primers are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. A 653 bp fragment containing exon 4 and surrounding intron was amplified using an upstream primer at position g.17812 (with a 5' BamHI site appended) and a downstream primer at g.18439 containing a 3' KpnI site. A 713 bp fragment containing a portion of exon 5 and the upstream intron was generated using an upstream primer positioned at g.20001 and a downstream primer at g.21147; 5' KpnI and 3' HindIII sites were added to primers. Cycling profile was one cycle of 94&#x000b0;C for 45 s, 30 cycles at 94&#x000b0;C for 45 s, 60&#x000b0;C (55&#x000b0;C for exon 1b) for 45 s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 45 s, and one cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Fragments were inserted individually into pGEM-3Z (Promega) using the same restriction sites, and plasmids were sequenced using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Using the appended restriction sites, exon/intron fragments were excised from pGEM-3Z and shuttled sequentially into the same sites of pcDNA3.1/myc-His(-)A (Invitrogen) to create the PITX2c minigene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Mutant minigenes were constructed by overlap PCR using the above pGEM-3Z constructs as template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Sense and antisense primers containing the desired mutations were used with the appropriate outside primer for PCR to synthesize half-substrates. Mutant exon fragments were inserted into pGEM-3Z and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The mutant fragments were then used to replace the WT fragment in the minigene construct as described above. N-terminal FLAG-epitope tagged minigenes were constructed by excising the entire minigene from the pcDNA constructs using SalI and a partial EcoRI digestion, and shuttling the fragments into the same sites of p3X-FLAG CMV 7.1 (Sigma).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Oligonucleotides used in this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Name</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Sequence*</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Purpose</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Ex-1b-f</td><td align="left">GCGAATTCCAGTAGCCAAGGACTAGTAG</td><td align="left">Forward and reverse primers to make exon 1b fragment</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Int-1b-r</td><td align="left">GCGGATCCAGAATTGCTCGCGCCCTTAG</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Int-1b-f</td><td align="left">GCGGATCCAGTGAATGTGCCGCTGCAGT</td><td align="left">Forward and reverse primers to make exon 4 fragment</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Int-4-r</td><td align="left">GCGGTACCTCGGAGAGGGAACTGTAATC</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Int-4-s</td><td align="left">GCGGTACCTGGCTGAGTGATCAAACCGT</td><td align="left">Forward and reverse primers to make exon 5 fragment</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ex-5-r</td><td align="left">CGAAGCTTGGCGGCGCGTAAGGACAGG</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C-f</td><td align="left">GAGTCCGGGTAGcAGCCAGCACGGAG</td><td align="left">Forward and reverse overlap PCR primers to make IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C mutant</td></tr><tr><td align="left">IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C-r</td><td align="left">CTCCGTGCTGGCTgCTACCCGGACTC</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">IVS5-11A&#x0003e;G-f</td><td align="left">CTCCCTTGCCCCAgCCGCCCCCAGG</td><td align="left">Forward and reverse overlap PCR primers to make IVS5-11A&#x0003e;G mutant</td></tr><tr><td align="left">IVS5-11A&#x0003e;G-f</td><td align="left">CCTGGGGGCGGcTGGGGCAAGGGAG</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">IVS4-1G&#x0003e;T-f</td><td align="left">CGTTTTCAtAGAAAGAT</td><td align="left">Forward and reverse overlap PCR primers to make IVS4-1G&#x0003e;T mutant</td></tr><tr><td align="left">IVS4-1G&#x0003e;T-f</td><td align="left">ATCTTTCTaTGAAAACG</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">T7 promoter</td><td align="left">TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG</td><td align="left">Forward primer to pcDNA T7 promoter to detect minigene mRNA</td></tr><tr><td align="left">PCREx-1b-f</td><td align="left">TGTCGGCCGTCTCCTCATCTTCC</td><td align="left">Forward and reverse primers to detect endogenous and minigene mRNA</td></tr><tr><td align="left">PCREx-5-r</td><td align="left">TTGCGCTCCCTCTTTCTCCATTTG</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">GFP-f</td><td align="left">GACGGCAACATCCTGGGGCACAAG</td><td align="left">Forward and reverse primers to GFP</td></tr><tr><td align="left">GFP-r</td><td align="left">CGGCGGCGGTCACGAACTCC</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">GAPDH-f</td><td align="left">TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG</td><td align="left">Forward and reverse primers to GAPDH</td></tr><tr><td align="left">GAPDH-r</td><td align="left">TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTGGGCCAT</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Primers are 5' to 3', mutations are in lowercase</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Axenfeld-Rieger pedigrees with intronic mutations in <italic>PITX2</italic></bold>.

Human cornea stromal cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were grown to about 60% confluence in 6 cm dishes (HEK293 and HeLa) or 6 well plates (cornea stromal cells) and transfected with 2 &#x003bc;g of minigene DNA and 0.5 &#x003bc;g GFP using the calcium phosphate method (Amersham Biosciences) for HEK293 and HeLa cells, or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) for cornea stromal cells. Total RNA was harvested 48 h later using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. For RT-PCR, reverse transcription was performed on 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA using oligo dT in a volume of 25 &#x003bc;l. For PCR, 2.5 &#x003bc;l of the reverse transcription mixture was used in a 25 &#x003bc;l PCR reaction using the T7 primer to pcDNA3.1/myc-His(-)A vector and to exon 5 (for minigene mRNA) or to exon 1b and exon 5 (for endogenous plus minigene mRNA), and primers to GFP or cellular GAPDH. Cycling conditions were one cycle of 94&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, 30 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, 60&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, and 72&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, and one cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds. To evaluate the accuracy of splicing of WT and mutant mRNA, RT-PCR products were cloned and sequenced. RT-PCR products were blunted with Klenow fragment and then digested with EcoRI, which cuts at a site located upstream of exon 1b. The products were inserted into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pGEM-3Z and individual clones were sequenced. To assess minigene splicing by RNase protection assay, a 700 bp riboprobe was made by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase and HindIII-linearized pGEM-3Z containing the exon/intron 4 fragment. This includes 264 nt and 183 nts of upstream and downstream intron, respectively, that flank the 206 nt exon 4.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] reported a G&#x0003e;C mutation at the same position and affected individuals from this family demonstrated severe ARS phenotypes: severe iris hypoplasia emulating aniridia in one patient and joint hypermobility and an anteriorly placed anus in another individual were reported.</p><p>The second mutation was found in patient 689, who displayed Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly in one eye only and no craniofacial, dental or umbilical abnormalities. The patient had normal ocular pressure and vision, the right eye had a posterior embryotoxon visible on slit lamp exam with iris sheets sweeping up to the embryotoxon inferiorly, and no iris hypoplasia was noted. Slit lamp exam of the left eye demonstrated normal development. Clinical family history of this patient contains records of developmental ocular defects but dental or umbilical anomalies were never noted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The mutation was identified as a G&#x0003e;C substitution at the +5 position of the 5' ss of <italic>PITX2 </italic>exon 4 (IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C)(g.18283G&#x0003e;C as seen in <italic>PITX2 </italic>sequence GenBank # <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF238048">AF238048</ext-link>; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

Previous work and the data above brings to eight the number of families with mutations that do not affect the protein coding potential of the gene, and the number of different mutations is now five [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We set out to examine three recurrent intronic mutations, each of which was described in two unrelated families of Axenfeld-Rieger spectrum, and to correlate the phenotypes with potential molecular defects in pre-mRNA splicing. The IVS4-1G&#x0003e;T and IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C mutations were described above. A third mutation studied was an A&#x0003e;G change 11 nt upstream of the 3'ss of exon 5 (IVS5-11A&#x0003e;G) that was originally described in family 4 by Semina et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and later by Borges et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] who reported the same change in another family (family 5); both families displayed classic features of ARS.</p><p>The <italic>PITX2 </italic>gene is located at 4q25 and numerous isoforms are produced through the use of alternative promoters and extensive alternative splicing of the six exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. <italic>PITX2 </italic>is expressed developmentally and in some adult tissues but not blood (EVS, unpublished) and thus patient samples to analyze splicing directly are not readily available. To overcome this limitation, a minigene for expression in tissue culture cells was designed that included the exons that comprise one of the common <italic>PITX2 </italic>isoforms, <italic>PITX2c</italic>, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Since the signals required for constitutive splicing are usually within ~100 nucleotides of splice junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], the introns were truncated to facilitate DNA cloning. Because there is no evidence that the extensive 5' and 3' untranslated regions are needed for constitutive splicing, exons 1b and 5 were also truncated; exon 1b starts 40 nt upstream of the translation start codon and the exon 5 fragment ends with the last amino acid codon. Minigene splicing was analyzed in HeLa and HEK293 cells since they have been used extensively to study constitutive RNA splicing. Additionally, cornea stromal cells (generously provided by Dr. Watsky, University of Tennessee) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] were used since <italic>PITX2 </italic>is expressed during corneal development and this cell line endogenously expresses <italic>PITX2</italic>, and thus may more faithfully reproduce <italic>PITX2 </italic>splicing that occurs in patients.</p><p>HeLa and HEK293 cells were mock transfected or transfected with 2 &#x003bc;g of minigene DNA and/or a GFP-expressing transfection control plasmid and RT-PCR was performed on RNA isolated 40&#x02013;48 h later. While <italic>PITX2c </italic>is not expressed in these cell types (data not shown), to ensure that only minigene RNA was detected, an upstream primer complementary to vector sequence was used in combination with a primer specific to <italic>PITX2 </italic>exon 5. Correct splicing would result in a 585 bp RT-PCR product whereas unspliced RNA would produce a 1564 bp product. The 585 bp band was observed only from transfected HEK293 cells and analysis of GFP expression demonstrated equivalent transfection efficiency and gel loading (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Similar results were obtained with HeLa cell RNA (data not shown). These results suggest that the HeLa and HEK293 cells faithfully express correctly spliced minigene RNA. As an additional test to verify the utility of the minigene, human cornea stromal cells were similarly examined. The primer pair specific for the minigene resulted in the 585 bp spliced product only in transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3, top) whereas a primer pair that does not distinguish between transfected and endogenous <italic>PITX2c </italic>mRNA produced a 404 bp product that was present in both but more abundant in transfected cells, consistent with correct splicing of endogenous and transfected <italic>PITX2 </italic>mRNA in corneal cells (lanes 2 and 3, middle).

The IVS4-1G&#x0003e;T minigene produced a much smaller protein (~12 kDa, lane 4), but this was expected since this protein would terminate at a single frame-shifted amino acid after PITX2 position 70. It appears that the IVS4-1G&#x0003e;T protein is unstable since it was present at only ~5% of WT levels, despite its mRNA being at least as abundant as WT. The IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C mRNA generated a normal sized protein and a second product of the size (~29 kDa) appropriate for truncated protein derived from intron-containing mRNA (lane 2); when corrected for mRNA levels, the truncated protein was about one tenth the abundance of normal protein. It was also evident that the level of normal protein expressed from the IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C minigene was roughly proportional to correctly spliced mRNA levels, which was about 30% of that produced from the WT minigene. Conversely, the level of truncated protein generated from the intron-retaining mRNA (~71% of minigene RNA produced) was considerably less than expected if protein expression was proportional to mRNA. These data are consistent with inefficient export of the intron-containing IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C mRNA from the nucleus. However, the possibility that the mRNA is exported but not translated, or exported but produces an unstable protein, cannot be excluded. Finally, the IVS5-11A&#x0003e;G mRNA would direct synthesis of a protein containing 138 residues of PITX2 followed by 117 frame-shifted amino acids and again, an expected ~33 kDa protein was expressed (lane 3) at a level similar to WT.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We report two new families with intronic mutations in the <italic>PITX2 </italic>gene and give insights into the mechanisms by which these and a previously described intronic mutation may affect PITX2 protein expression and influence development of ARS. A deficiency in normal PITX2 protein was proposed as the major cause of ARS and each of the mutations examined caused RNA splicing defects that would affect PITX2 protein levels or function, consistent with a gene dosage model for development of the syndrome.</p><p>Mutation IVS4-1G&#x0003e;T is the most 5' positioned <italic>PITX2 </italic>mutation identified to date ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], this report). This mutation changes the 3' intron-terminal G to a T and mutates the terminal "AG" intron junction dinucleotide. The terminal AG dinucleotide is critical for splicing catalysis and it was expected that splicing at the correct site would be abolished. A number of mechanisms for specifying the 3' ss AG have been proposed, including scanning from the branchpoint to the first AG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], measurement from the branchpoint to the AG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], or a combination of the AG being in the correct context and an optimal distance from the branchpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The next available AG was located immediately 3' to the mutated junction and splicing was completely shifted to this site. Because of aberrant splicing, the resulting protein is predicted to contain only the N-terminal 70 amino acids of PITX2 and lack the entire homeodomain and C-terminal region. Extrapolation of our analysis in tissue culture cells to the patient suggests that the mutant protein would be present at negligible amounts and therefore, the patient's phenotype is most easily explained by haploinsufficiency of wild-type PITX2 protein (50% of normal). Interestingly, two unrelated patients with mutations at this nucleotide manifest ARS with one extra feature not commonly reported in ARS pedigrees &#x02013; an anteriorly placed anus (this report; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). Also, two previously reported families with IVS4-1G&#x0003e;T and -1G&#x0003e;C substitutions were noted to display a severe form of Axenfeld-Rieger ocular anomaly including aniridia (unfortunately, detailed records were not available for patient 0175 reported here). Whether these features might be truly associated with this type of mutation and are caused by expression of only the N-terminal end of PITX2 remains to be seen.</p><p>The second mutation studied was identified in an individual (689) from a family with Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly and normal dental and umbilical development. The mutation is a change at position +5 of the 5'ss at the downstream border of exon 4 that led to predominant intron retention. This was surprising since exon skipping was the expected outcome. It is possible that our minigene/transfection system does not reflect the outcome in patients, but splice site mutations do result in intron retention at reasonable frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Curiously, the same mutation was previously reported in a family affected with complete ARS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Little protein was generated from the aberrant mRNA and that which is made would be nonfunctional since it is truncated in the homeodomain. Since expression of the mutant allele in transfected cells resulted in 30% correctly spliced mRNA, the patient might be expected to have a milder phenotype since PITX2 protein would be ~65% of normal rather than the 50% expected of haploinsufficiency.</p><p>While our study demonstrates that the IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C mutation causes a similar level of intron retention in three tissue culture cell systems, it is curious that two individuals with the same mutation (families 689 and 2) exhibited different phenotypes and have corresponding clinical family histories (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Unfortunately, patient samples cannot be examined directly, but it is possible that the degree of aberrant splicing differs in these individuals, with a greater amount of aberrant splicing associated with a more severe phenotype. The mutation should alter recognition of the 5'ss by the core splicing machine, an event that is influenced by numerous positive and negative auxiliary factors whose expression patterns often show cell-type specific and temporal variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. For example, trans-acting splicing activators often promote recognition of exons and correct splicing through interactions with splicing enhancer sequences located in exons. Indeed, purine-rich sequences upstream of the affected <italic>PITX2 </italic>5'ss resemble splicing enhancer elements that bind the SR protein family of splicing activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is possible that genetic background differences influence the levels of one or more of these factors, resulting in differential effects of the IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C mutation on splicing in the two patients. The mutation would manifest as a less severe splicing defect, and thus higher levels of wild-type protein in the patient with the milder phenotype. It is also possible that the putative splicing enhancer elements in exon 4 explain the intron retention outcome by promoting recognition of the exon such that splicing of the upstream intron occurs, but the mutation in the 5' ss abolishes downstream intron splicing. Another possibility is genetic variation in the promoters of <italic>PITX2 </italic>target genes such that lower levels of PITX2 protein activate them.</p><p>The IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C <italic>PITX2 </italic>mutation represents another demonstration of affected phenotypes associated with a more than 50% level of normal PITX2 protein. In previous reports, it was argued that some of the PITX2 mutant proteins retain partial function and this fact explains milder ARS phenotypes seen in affected families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Another observation emerging from these studies is that human ocular development appears to be the most sensitive to the amounts of PITX2 protein as "mild" mutations allow dental and umbilical development to proceed normally but still have a profound effect on ocular structures, while "severe" mutations result in more complex ocular defects (this report; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]).</p><p>The third mutation (IVS5-11A&#x0003e;G) reported in two families with classic ARS is an A&#x0003e;G mutation located eleven nucleotides upstream of the 3' ss associated with exon 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. An important determinant of 3'ss strength is the polypyrimidine tract that lies between the branch point and the splice junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; purine interruptions decrease 3'ss quality. The IVS5-11A&#x0003e;G mutation would not be expected to alter the strength of the 3' ss but the mutation does create a new "AG" dinucleotide and that could compete with the authentic one 11 nt downstream. As discussed above, this new AG could be recognized by scanning due to the fact that a pyrimidine tract is located upstream or by a mechanism similar to that described in Coffin-Lowry syndrome whereby the authentic AG in the <italic>RSK2 </italic>gene is involved in the first steps of splicing but the new AG is utilized in the second step as the splice junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Regardless, a complete shift in IVS5-11A&#x0003e;G minigene RNA splicing to the new site was observed and resulted in expression of a truncated protein that lacks a functional homeodomain. ARS phenotype in these families included classic ocular, dental and umbilical features (this report; Dr. Nishimura, personal communication) and can be explained by haploinsufficiency although the possibility that the mutant protein provides an additional effect cannot be excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we provide the first direct evidence that <italic>PITX2 </italic>intronic mutations cause splicing defects. We propose that the molecular defect in patients harboring these mutations is at the level of mRNA splicing such that the level of functional protein is reduced. Furthermore, the extent of the splicing defect observed in our system generally correlates with phenotypic severity, which supports the <italic>PITX2 </italic>gene dosage model for Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. Because the mutations described here affect splicing of the last two exons that are common to all isoforms, similar splicing defects would be expected for all <italic>PITX2 </italic>transcripts. The gene dosage model was initially proposed based on in vitro studies that demonstrated an association between partial function for some mutant PITX2 proteins and milder phenotypes. Here, we report a splicing mutation (IVS4+5G&#x0003e;C) that results in production of some normal mRNA/protein from a minigene, which suggests an association between elevated levels of normal PITX2 (~65% vs. 50%) and milder human phenotypes. We also suggest that the phenotypic outcome may be dependent on secondary factors/genetic background of mutation carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NLM carried out the molecular studies in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and participated in drafting the manuscript.</p><p>WLMA was involved in clinical evaluation of the ARS patients and provided human samples and clinical material for the study.</p><p>JCM provided collection of human patient and control samples and participated in genetic analyses.</p><p>EVS identified human mutations reported in the study, conceived and participated in the design of the study and helped draft the manuscript.</p><p>MTM conceived and participated in the design of the study, coordinated the molecular studies, helped draft the manuscript, and obtained study funding.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-publication history</title><p>The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/7/59/prepub"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to members of the McNally and Semina labs for helpful comments on the manuscript, Dr. Watsky for generously providing corneal cell lines and Dr. Sakazume for help with their culture and transfection experiments.
