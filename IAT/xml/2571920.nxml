Death Receptor 3 (DR3), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member, has recently been associated with the pathogenesis of RA. We demonstrate that absence of DR3 confers resistance to the development of adverse bone pathology in experimental antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice exhibited a reduction in all histopathological hallmarks of AIA but, in particular, failed to develop subchondral bone erosions and were completely protected from this characteristic of AIA. In contrast, TNF-like protein 1A (TL1A), the ligand for DR3, exacerbated disease in a dose- and DR3-dependent fashion. Analysis of osteoclast number within AIA joint revealed a reduction in areas susceptible to bone erosion in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice, whereas in vitro osteoclastogenesis assays showed that TL1A could directly promote osteoclastogenesis in mouse and man. Treatment with antagonistic anti-TL1A mAb protected animals in a systemic model of RA disease collagen-induced arthritis. We therefore conclude that the DR3&#x02013;TL1A pathway regulates joint destruction in two murine models of arthritis and represents a potential novel target for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory joint disease.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>M.J.

RA is characterized by infiltration of synovial joints by immune cells, principally macrophages, T cells, plasma cells, and hyperplasia of the synovial lining. This eventually results in the destructive phase of disease causing damage to cartilage and bone. It is widely accepted that cytokines and their receptors play a central role in the pathogenesis of RA, thus TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1, and IL-6 have been identified as key mediators of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). The role played by members of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) in pathological bone resorption has also become widely accepted, with RANK and RANKL acting as crucial factors in differentiation of osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), the primary cell type involved in bone degradation.</p><p>DR3 (TRAMP, LARD, Apo3, Wsl1, and TNFRSF25) is a member of the TNFRSF and shows closest homology to TNFR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Like TNFR1, DR3 contains four extracellular cysteine-rich repeats and is capable of signaling both apoptosis via caspase 8 activation and cell survival via the activation of NF&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). The biological function of DR3 is an area of growing interest. In the immune system, DR3 has been shown to affect negative selection during thymocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) and can modulate T cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) and NKT cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). It has also been associated with inflammatory diseases such as irritable bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Interestingly, DR3, along with its only known ligand, TNF-like protein 1A (TL1A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), has been linked with RA. Duplication of the DR3 gene is more prevalent in RA patients compared with controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), whereas TL1A<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mononuclear phagocytes have been identified in rheumatoid synovium and soluble TL1A has been detected in synovial fluid of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). However, functional analysis of the in vivo role of the DR3&#x02013;TL1A pathway in RA has not yet been reported.</p><p>To address this, we have generated mice lacking the DR3 gene (DR3<sup>ko</sup>) on a C57BL/6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) and used a salient model of experimental arthritis to elucidate functional aspects of DR3 activity. Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) is a local model of disease which displays many pathological features of RA including cellular infiltration, synovial hyperplasia, pannus formation, cartilage depletion, and bone destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). We show that DR3 is essential for the development of adverse joint pathology in AIA and that anti-TL1A treatment can protect from the systemic model of disease, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). These results imply an important in vivo function for DR3 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis and provide proof of principle that countering this pathway may represent a novel therapy for RA.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice show reduced inflammatory response to AIA compared with DR3<sup>wt</sup> controls</title><p>To investigate the in vivo role of DR3 in inflammatory arthritis, we induced AIA in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice and DR3<sup>wt</sup> controls. All mice developed an inflammatory reaction in response to intraarticular injection of methylated BSA, with both DR3<sup>ko</sup> and DR3<sup>wt</sup> mice exhibiting a similar pattern of joint swelling over a 21-d time course. Comparable knee joint swelling measurements were noted in DR3<sup>ko</sup> and DR3<sup>wt</sup> mice at the peak of response, 1 d after mBSA injection. Thereafter, swelling resolved in both but faster in the absence of DR3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Protection against AIA in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice.</bold> (A) Joint swelling after intraarticular injection of mBSA.

Examination of histopathological severity was performed on joint sections taken during the acute inflammatory phase when TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 reach a peak and destructive pathology first becomes detectable (3 d after induction) and when there is maximal evidence of structural damage within the joint (21 d after induction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). The severity of arthritis (arthritis index [AI]) was quantified in hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E)&#x02013;stained sections by grading parameters as described in Materials and methods. On day 3 after arthritis induction, DR3<sup>wt</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) did not differ histopathologically. By day 21, DR3<sup>wt</sup> mice had developed arthritis characterized by extensive cellular infiltration, synovial hyperplasia, formation of a thick pannus, and bone erosions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). In contrast, DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice displayed mild pathological features of arthritis, showing general absence of synovial hyperplasia, lack of pannus formation, and no evidence of bone erosion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Indeed, all scoring parameters were either absent or significantly milder in DR3<sup>ko</sup> compared with DR3<sup>wt</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). This translated into a significant reduction in the AI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>).</p><p>As a second outcome measure of structural damage to the joint, we assessed proteoglycan depletion from articular cartilage on the femoral head using Safranin O/Fast Green staining 21 d after arthritis induction. In DR3<sup>wt</sup> mice, cartilage was severely depleted, as illustrated by lack of red Safranin O staining resulting in an obvious tidemark (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice did not display much cartilage depletion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>), retaining similar levels of Safranin O staining as nonarthritic control left knees (not depicted). Collectively, this data indicate that there is considerable protection against degenerative AIA disease pathology in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>TL1A exacerbates disease in a DR3-dependent fashion</title><p>To confirm that resistance to AIA was DR3 specific, TL1A was injected with mBSA on day 0 of the AIA model at escalating quantities up to 100 ng. DR3<sup>het</sup> mice were chosen as they showed intermediate AI scores compared with DR3<sup>wt</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2 A</xref>). Consequently, exacerbation or amelioration of disease after TL1A injection could be quantified, irrespective of the inherent variability in the model. Coadministration of TL1A resulted in significant dose-dependent exacerbation of disease in DR3<sup>het</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). This was strikingly illustrated by the effect on size of bone erosions and severity of bone destruction, which increased in a dose-dependent fashion after TL1A injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). In contrast, TL1A had no significant effect on arthritis progression in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice over the concentration range studied (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Representative images of DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice receiving 1 and 100 ng TL1A show the continued absence of bone erosions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>). TL1A therefore exacerbates AIA and, in particular, adverse bone pathology in a DR3-dependent manner.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>TL1A promotes adverse bone pathology of AIA in a DR3-dependent manner.</bold> (A) AI with increasing administration of TL1A in DR3<sup>het</sup> mice.

Osteoclasts are clearly visualized as large red multinucleated cells with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). TRAP expression in DR3<sup>wt</sup> and DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice was comparable in the femoral head (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;C</xref>) and growth plate (not depicted). However, in the periosteum at areas adjacent to pannus formation, where focal bone erosions could be visualized at high magnification, TRAP staining was significantly greater in DR3<sup>wt</sup> mice than at equivalent areas in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, D&#x02013;F</xref>). These data implicate a role for DR3 in generation of osteoclasts at sites of bone pathology but not in influencing osteoclastogenesis in areas away from the pannus.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>TRAP and F4/80 expression in joints of DR3<sup>wt</sup> and DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice.</bold> Sections were stained for TRAP or F4/80 as described in Materials and methods.

Indeed, the degree of macrophage (osteoclast precursor) infiltration within rheumatoid joint has been correlated with severity of structural damage in human disease. To assess whether reduction in osteoclast number was caused by impaired recruitment of these cells to the joint, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of F4/80 expression in sections from DR3<sup>ko</sup> and DR3<sup>wt</sup> mice on days 3 and 21 after arthritis induction. On day 3, some F4/80 expression was detected in the periarticular adipose tissue, which did not differ significantly between DR3<sup>wt</sup> and DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, G&#x02013;I</xref>). By day 21, F4/80 staining was markedly increased with strong F4/80 expression visualized microscopically in both DR3<sup>ko</sup> and DR3<sup>wt</sup> mice. Quantification of F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells again revealed no significant difference in expression between DR3<sup>wt</sup> and DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, J&#x02013;L</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that absence of DR3 does not impair recruitment of myeloid cells to the joint, nor does it affect overall numbers of basal mature osteoclasts in the femoral head. Neither hypothesis can explain the reduction in osteoclast numbers in areas of bone pathology in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>TL1A promotes osteoclastogenesis in vitro in a DR3-dependent fashion</title><p>We therefore tested the possibility that TL1A could directly promote differentiation of osteoclasts. To achieve this, we used an in vitro system of osteoclastogenesis from adherent BM-derived cells (BMC). BM macrophages (BMM) from DR3<sup>wt</sup> mice were confirmed to express DR3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). BMC from DR3<sup>wt</sup> and DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice did not differ in their ability to generate osteoclasts in the presence of soluble RANK-L and M-CSF as measured by the formation of multinucleated TRAP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). However, TL1A addition significantly enhanced development of osteoclasts from DR3<sup>wt</sup> but not DR3<sup>ko</sup> BMC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B&#x02013;D</xref>). TL1A in the absence of RANK-L and M-CSF could not generate osteoclasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). The functional capacity of in vitro&#x02013;generated osteoclasts to destroy bone was visualized by toluidine blue staining of pits in the ivory discs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). This data indicates that TL1A is not necessary for osteoclastogenesis per se, but promotes it in the presence of RANK-L and M-CSF and in a DR3-dependent fashion. In support of our murine data and highlighting the significance of these results for humans, TL1A significantly promoted osteoclastogenesis from monocytes derived from human peripheral blood (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>TL1A promotes DR3-dependent in vitro osteoclastogenesis.</bold> (A) RT-PCR of DR3 in BMM.

CIA is the industry standard for testing potential therapeutic agents against RA. A single treatment of anti-TL1A at the point of arthritic induction in AIA resulted in more rapid resolution of swelling that mirrored our observations in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). In CIA, clinical signs of arthritis became apparent in control mice on day 25 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Disease activity was assessed by assigning scores to each paw according to degree of redness, swelling, and joint involvement. Paw scores in anti-TL1A&#x02013;treated mice were consistently lower than in control IgG2a-treated mice, reaching significance on days 27 and 28 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>).

DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice elicited an initial inflammatory reaction in response to AIA induction, such that at day 3 after arthritis induction, there was no difference in histopathological scoring or level of inflammatory cell infiltrate between control and DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice. Resolution of inflammation, however, occurred at a faster rate in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice, as indicated by reduction in joint swelling over the course of the study and reduction in all histopathological parameters measured at day 21 after arthritic induction. Of particular note was the absence of bone erosion and marked reduction in cell infiltrate in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice in later stages of disease. Comparable numbers of infiltrating F4/80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> macrophages were present in joints of DR3<sup>wt</sup> and DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice, despite the observed differences in joint pathology. Therefore, the mechanisms involved in initiating the inflammatory reaction and in recruitment of myeloid cells into the joint appear intact in the absence of DR3. Because of this, we chose to investigate differentiation of osteoclasts, discovering that osteoclast differentiation in vitro and bone erosion in vivo was exacerbated by exogenous TL1A in control but not DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice. These DR3-dependent effects confirm that TL1A is a specific functional ligand for DR3 and identifies the control of osteoclasts as a novel function for DR3. The potential of countering the DR3&#x02013;TL1A pathway as a therapy was proven by amelioration of CIA and AIA using a neutralizing anti-TL1A mAb. Interestingly, anti-TL1A therapy was not totally protective. The possibility remains that there may be secondary ligands for DR3 and TL1A as implicated for TL1A by recent data in renal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), but detailed studies have shown no other TNFSF/TNFRSF family members that bind murine DR3 or murine TL1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), whereas human TL1A binds Decoy Receptor 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), a mouse homologue of which has not been found.</p><p>This is the first paper reporting that signaling through DR3 on myeloid cells promotes osteoclastogenesis, although it is clear from our data that it is not a prerequisite for, nor can it induce, this differentiation in the absence of RANK-L and M-CSF. In this respect, it mirrors functions that have been reported for TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). However, a function independent of TNF&#x003b1; is suggested by a recent paper showing that macrophages produce TL1A independent of TNF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). TL1A expression, including release of active soluble forms of the protein, can be induced on human monocytes by Fc&#x003b3;R stimulation through soluble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) and insoluble immune complexes purified from RA synovial fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). The majority of stromal macrophages in RA synovial tissue express TL1A, and in vitro stimulation of monocytes with PEG precipitates from RA samples results in production of nanogram quantities of soluble TL1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). This suggests very high levels in localized RA joint akin to the levels we used to exacerbate AIA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The implication is that in inflammatory arthritis, myeloid cells may exhibit a positive feedback loop whereby TL1A is triggered through ICs and can drive differentiation of bone-destroying cells if the right cytokine milieu is provided. Intriguingly, TL1A also has varied effects on human osteoblast cell lines in vitro, inhibiting differentiation and promoting quiescence at low densities but inducing death at high densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). We therefore propose that the DR3&#x02013;TL1A pathway may act as a switch that is capable of directly activating osteoclast but also inhibiting osteoblast differentiation and, in so doing, disregulate the homeostatic balance of degradation and formation in normal bone into the detrimental situation observed in destructive bone pathologies such as RA. Although our in vitro data supports this proposal, some caution is necessary in interpreting the contribution of direct TL1A-driven osteoclastogenesis to arthritic bone damage in vivo, as inflammation and bone erosion cannot be dissociated in AIA or CIA. The possibility remains that the resistance of DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice to bone erosion is secondary to DR3&#x02013;TL1A-dependent control of other parts of the inflammatory process.</p><p>In this respect, our data also show that cartilage depletion is significantly reduced in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Cartilage depletion is attributed to the effects of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), levels of which are raised in RA joint. In vitro experiments on human cell lines have shown that DR3 activation can induce the production of MMP-1, -9, and -13 in THP-1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). These MMPs have all been associated with RA joint pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). In addition, it is also established that TL1A plays an important role in T cell function. TL1A has been shown to costimulate IL-2 responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) and synergize with the TCR and IL-12/IL-18 pathways to induce IFN&#x003b3; release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). TL1A also amplifies cytokine release by NKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) and regulates the development of proinflammatory Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), which are reported to aid osteoclastogenesis in autoimmune arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). The action of TL1A on T cells may also be regulated by differential expression of splice variants of DR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). The exact role of TL1A and DR3 on lymphocytes in inflammatory arthritis remains to be elucidated, but it is interesting to note that we find normal anti-mBSA Ab levels in serum, unchanged T cell proliferation to mBSA in draining lymph nodes of DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice after AIA induction, and normal in vitro generation of Th17 cells from DR3<sup>ko</sup> splenocytes (unpublished data).</p><p>In summary, we have induced inflammatory arthritis in DR3<sup>ko</sup> mice and found that they exhibit strong resistance to the adverse pathology observed in AIA. We show DR3-dependent TL1A-driven exacerbation of bone damage in vivo and promotion of osteoclastogenesis in vitro. We also show that anti-TL1A therapy ameliorates disease. Our data suggest that the DR3&#x02013;TL1A pathway is an important component of inflammatory responses in joint disease and, as such, identifies a potential therapeutic target for treatment of diseases like RA but with potential impact in other diseases involving disrupted bone physiology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Animals.</title><p>The DR3 mouse colony was founded from animals supplied by Cancer Research UK, London.

Anti-TL1A mAb was generated by standard hybridoma technology and hybridoma supernatants were screened for binding to recombinant soluble and membrane-expressed TL1A. To generate cells expressing membrane-anchored TL1A, PCR fragments encoding the entire coding sequence of mouse TL1A were cloned into the mammalian expression vectors pEF1/V5-His A and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and plasmids were then transfected into J558L or 293T cells. Stable J558L cell lines expressing membrane-anchored TL1A were selected in Geneticin (400 &#x003bc;g/ml)-containing media. Splenic cDNA or IMAGE clone 30740802 was used as a template for PCR reactions to generate TL1A-encoding DNA fragments.
