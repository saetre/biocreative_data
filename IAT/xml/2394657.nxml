To validate this finding, we generated an independent tetracycline (Tet)-repressible EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS) expressing cell line, UF5. A quantitative measurement of <italic>ENT4</italic> transcripts following the induction of EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS) for 12 hrs in UF5 cells demonstrated a 4-fold increase in endogenous <italic>ENT4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The presence or absence of Tet in the control UV9 cells did not affect the level of <italic>ENT4</italic> expression. To determine whether the induction of <italic>ENT4</italic> was specific to the EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS) isoform, we examined <italic>ENT4</italic> expression in UED5 cells expressing EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS).

Inspection of the 2-kb human <italic>ENT4</italic> promoter sequences revealed three potential EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS) responsive elements (GC-rich) located downstream of the transcriptional start site and a 760-bp stretch of GA-repeats, which contains more than 50 potential &#x0002b;KTS binding sites, E(KTS)RE motif, located upstream of the transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). To test whether these sequences can function as the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, we generated various promoter deletion constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). A deletion of 1700-bp region (&#x02212;1450 to &#x0002b;270) upstream of the GC-rich sequences (promoter P2), which includes the GA-repeat sequences containing more than 50 potential E(KTS)RE elements, resulted in a complete loss of EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS)-mediated transactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). A smaller deletion encompassing mostly the GA-repeat sequences (promoter P3) also completely abrogated the &#x0002b;KTS-mediated transactivation of the <italic>ENT4</italic> promoter, demonstrating that the multiple E(KTS)RE sites in the GA-repeat sequences likely function as the EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS) response element. In contrast, the P2 promoter (330-bp) containing mostly the GC-rich sequences was highly activated (21-fold) by EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS), indicating that the GC-rich sequences likely mediate the transactivation by the &#x02212;KTS isoform. EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS) activated the P3 promoter to a similar level (5-fold) as the 2-kb P1 promoter (6-fold), indicating that the removal of negative elements in the 5&#x02032; upstream region (&#x02212;1450 to &#x02212;915) of the human <italic>ENT4</italic> promoter may be responsible for the augmented activation of the P2 promoter by EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS). Deletion of the GC-rich sequences (P4) resulted in a reduced but not complete absence of transactivation by the &#x02212;KTS, suggesting the presence of additional <italic>cis</italic>-elements for EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS). Interestingly, removal of the GC-rich sequences (P4) also led to a reduction in the EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS)-mediated transactivation, demonstrating that the GC-rich sequences are needed to achieve full transactivation by EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS).</p><p>To precisely define the &#x02212;KTS-specific response elements in the GC-rich region of the <italic>ENT4</italic> promoter, we introduced base substitutions within the three potential EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS) binding sites of the P2 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).

However, mutation of the second binding site M2 at &#x0002b;440 (antisense strand: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GCGG<underline>GGGGG</underline>-3&#x02032;</named-content> to <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GCGG<underline>AAAAA</underline>-3&#x02032;</named-content>) resulted in approximately 60&#x00025; reduction in the activation of the P2 promoter by the &#x02212;KTS isoform.

Consistent with this, mutations at both the M2 and M3 sites (the M2/M3 promoter) in the GC-rich region displayed a similar level of reduction in the reporter assay as the single M2 mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), demonstrating that the M2, but not the M1 or the M3 sites, functions as the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element for EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS). These observations also indicate the existence of other EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS) responsive element(s) within the GC-rich region. EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS) had no discernible activity on any of the base substituted promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>).

UF5 and UED5 cells were induced to express EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS) and EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS), respectively, and formaldehyde-crosslinked DNA was immunoprecipitated using an antibody that recognizes the C-terminal domain of WT1 (C-19) to enrich for the chromatin bound by EWS/WT1. The endogenous WT1 is not detectable in U2OS cells by western blotting (data not shown), and thus, the C-19 antibody should be specific for EWS/WT1. We designed primers flanking the GC-rich sequences to examine the EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS) binding and a primer set near the 5&#x02032; region of the GA-repeat sequences for detecting the EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS) recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).

Thus, JN-DSRCT-1 cells express slightly slower migrating isoforms of EWS/WT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Immunoblot analysis with the C-19 antibody further revealed that JN-DSRCT-1 cells do not express detectable levels of endogenous WT1. To determine whether naturally occurring EWS/WT1 is recruited to the <italic>ENT4</italic> promoter, we performed the ChIP analysis in JN-DSRCT-1 cells. Consistent with our previous ChIP results, EWS/WT1 was physically recruited near the two <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the <italic>ENT4</italic> promoter in JN-DSRCT-1 cells as demonstrated by specific PCR amplifications of both the GA-repeat and the GC-rich regions of the promoter with chromatin immunoprecipitated with antibodies to WT1 (C-19), but not with IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). As expected, the control primers (CONT1, CONT2 and GAPDH) did not yield any PCR products. Since the antibody (C-19) recognizes both isoforms of EWS/WT1, we cannot demonstrate the recruitment of each isoform to the specific regions of the <italic>ENT4</italic> promoter in JN-DSRCT-1 cells. However, based on our previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g003">3B</xref>), it is likely that each isoform is recruited to the respective <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of the <italic>ENT4</italic> promoter in JN-DSRCT-1 cells. Interestingly, we consistently observed a more robust amplification of the GA-repeat region than the GC-rich region in our ChIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g003">Fig. 3B and C</xref>), which may indicate the presence of more EWS/WT1 in the GA-repeat region (which contains more than 50 EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS) binding sites).

However, coexpression of both isoforms did not result in a synergistic activation of the <italic>ENT4</italic> promoter (data not shown). Our findings further suggest that EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS) may play a more prominent role in the activation of <italic>ENT4</italic> transcription than EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS), based on the higher induction level of endogenous <italic>ENT4</italic> transcripts by the &#x0002b;KTS isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), higher transactivation by the &#x0002b;KTS in our promoter-reporter analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), and by our ChIP analysis in which we observed a more robust amplification of the GA-repeat region than the GC-rich region of <italic>ENT4</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002353-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). A likely explanation for this is the presence of more than fifty EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS) binding sites in the GA-repeat region. This may also help to explain the remarkably high level of <italic>ENT4</italic> expression observed in both primary DSRCT specimens and JN-DSRCT-1 cell line, as well as the lack of synergy between the two isoforms in our promoter assay (the &#x0002b;KTS isoform may simply saturate the promoter). A highly abundant expression of ENT4 may be useful as an additional diagnostic marker of DSRCT although more cases need to be evaluated. Our study further suggests that it may be possible to identify additional target genes of EWS/WT1(&#x0002b;KTS) by examining the proximal promoter regions for the GA-repeat sequences.</p><p>ENT4 is a member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) family (SLC29), which contains four isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Baldwin1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. ENT1 and ENT2 transport purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (<italic>e.g.</italic> uridine, adenosine, etc.) and their structural analogs. ENT3 is an intracellular nucleoside transporter, which may play a role in lysosomal transport of nucleosides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Baldwin2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. ENT4 is unique in the ENT family as it is specific towards adenosine and adenosine analogs and does not significantly transport other nucleosides and their congeners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Barnes1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Engel1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Baldwin1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The activity of ENT4 towards adenosine is low at pH 7.4, and recent reports have shown that ENT4 exhibits a maximum adenosine transport activity at pH 6.0 to 6.6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Barnes1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Xia1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of ENT4 in the genesis and progression of DSRCT is unknown, but it may have a role in supporting tumorigenesis by providing growth and survival advantages to the tumor cells in adapting to a tumor microenvironment. In general, the tumor microenvironement becomes hypoxic and acidic due to a limiting blood supply and increased acid production from the upregulation of glycolytic metabolic pathways by the tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Gatenby1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been demonstrated that adenosine can stimulate angiogenesis under hypoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Adair1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is intriguing to speculate that DSRCT-specific expression of ENT4, a pH-dependent (acidic) adenosine transporter, might provide growth and survival advantages to the tumor cells (e.g. by stimulating angiogenesis) under hypoxic/acidic conditions, as well as increasing the nucleoside pool within the rapidly proliferating tumor cells.</p><p>The expression level and pattern of the ENTs are an important determinant for the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer nucleoside analogs since many nucleoside analogs used in cancer chemotherapy depend on nucleoside transporters to enter tumor cells to exert their cytotoxicity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Kong1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>). For example, the expression of ENT1 in leukemia and certain solid tumors is related to the clinical efficacy of a number of nucleoside analogs such as cytarabine (Ara-C) and gemcitabine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Kong1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. In light of this, our results demonstrating the cytotoxic effects of 2-CdA and F-ara-A in JN-DSRCT-1 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> are highly intriguing. Adenosine analogs such as 2-CdA and F-ara-A are an effective chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Hoffman1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Galmarini1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. However, efficacy of these adenosine analogs in solid tumors has not been reported. Our finding of <italic>ENT4</italic> as a transcriptional target of EWS/WT1 highly expressed in DSRCT suggests that this transporter may represent an attractive pathway for targeting chemotherapeutic drugs into DSRCT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines</title><p>UF5, U2OS-derived cell line with tetracycline-repressible EWS/WT1(&#x02212;KTS) expression, was generated as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002353-Lee2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.
