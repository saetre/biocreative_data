The balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic mechanisms is tightly controlled in hematopoietic cells, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HSC/Ps) by intrinsic signals that are subject to regulation by signals emanating from the BM microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Hematopoietic cytokines such as stem cell factor, IL-3, and thrombopoietin provide a survival signal for hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) by inducing the activation of PI3K/AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) and NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) signaling, and by up-regulating antiapoptotic genes, such as members of the Bcl2 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), as well as Fas ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), all mediate dual signals for HSC/P functions. A negative signal induces programmed cell death and/or differentiation, whereas a positive signal promotes proliferation and survival. Disruption of this balance will result in hematopoietic disorders, including BM failure and leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>).</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a key mediator of stress and proinflammatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). The proinflammatory cytokines induce both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signals in their target cells. TAK1 mediates the prosurvival signal of the proinflammatory cytokines by inducing the nuclear localization of NF-&#x003ba;B and the activation of c-Jun <italic>N</italic>-terminal kinases (JNKs)/AP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), whereas the proapoptotic signal is mediated by the activation of the caspase cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Studies have demonstrated that TAK1-transduced signals from TCRs and B cell receptors, as well as antigen stimulation, play a role in T and B cell activation and survival, T regulatory cell development, and B cell&#x02013;mediated innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). The role of TAK1 in hematopoiesis is still not fully understood. Although previous studies suggested that proinflammatory cytokines might play a negative role in hematopoiesis and contribute to some of the BM failure syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), recent studies demonstrate that HSC/Ps are resistant to proinflammatory and stress signal&#x02013;induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). We propose that TAK1 is expressed and activated in hematopoietic cells, including HSC/Ps, thus protecting them from apoptosis.</p><p>The TAK1-null phenotype is lethal early in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), impeding exploration of the role of TAK1 in adult hematopoiesis. To investigate whether TAK1 plays a role in the regulation of normal hematopoietic homeostasis, we generated inducible <italic>TAK1</italic> knockout mice. We found that inducing the deletion of <italic>TAK1</italic> in adult mice results in BM and liver failure due to massive cell-autonomous apoptotic death of hematopoietic cells, including HSC/Ps, and hepatocytes. Further study demonstrated that TAK1 mediates the survival signal in HSC/Ps via activation of JNK/AP1 and NF-&#x003ba;B signal pathways and up-regulation of survival gene expression.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>TAK1 expression and activity in hematopoietic cells</title><p>To study whether TAK1 is involved in normal hematopoiesis, we first examined whether TAK1 is expressed in hematopoietic cells by using quantitative RT-PCR assays. TAK1 knockout BM cells were used as a negative control. We found that TAK1 RNA is expressed in all lineages of hematopoietic cells, including HSCs (lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells [LSKs]), committed hematopoietic progenitors (CPs) (lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells [LKs]), mature myeloid cells (Gr1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), B cells (B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), B cell progenitors (B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), nucleated erythroid cells (Ter119<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), and T cells (CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>). Its level of expression is also increased in progenitors including CPs and B cell progenitors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Furthermore, by using a flow cytometry&#x02013;based intracellular protein detection assay, we found that the expression of TAK1 protein in c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HSC/Ps (including HSCs and CPs) and Gr1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells was higher than that in B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>); yet, TAK1 activity (indicated by p-TAK1 levels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) is higher in c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HSC/Ps than in differentiated Gr1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells and B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D&#x02013;F</xref>). We further separated HSCs and CPs by sca1 and c-kit staining followed by lineage depletion and found that, although TAK1 protein levels were comparable in HSCs and CPs, p-TAK1 levels were higher in CPs than in HSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, G and H</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that among B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, B cell progenitors displayed higher levels of TAK1 activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>TAK1</italic> is expressed and activated in hematopoietic cells, including HSC/Ps.</bold> BM cells were collected into lyse/fix buffer immediately after the mice were killed to fix the BM cells and lyse the RBCs simultaneously.

The livers of the knockout mice were relatively smaller and stiff, and they appeared a pale, jaundiced color. Destruction of normal liver histological structure was evident upon microscopic analysis. The nuclei of &#x0003e;30&#x02013;50% of the hepatocytes were condensed because of apoptosis, which was demonstrated by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end-labeling (TUNEL) staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B&#x02013;E</xref>). Although, &#x0003e;30% of the mice showed intestinal, urinary bladder, and/or gallbladder hemorrhaging (not depicted), we believe that acute liver failure, as a consequence of massive hepatocyte apoptosis, was the major cause of mortality among the <italic>TAK1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In support of this notion, we observed that the <italic>TAK1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipient mice that received normal BM did not show any signs of bleeding but did show evidence of significant hepatocyte apoptosis (not depicted).

It is known to play an important role in early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). <italic>TAK1</italic>-null mice die at embryonic day 11.5 with significant vascular defects, reminiscent of the mouse phenotype in which the TGF-&#x003b2;1 receptors ALK-1 and endoglin have been knocked out. Moreover, <italic>TAK1</italic> overexpression can compensate for the TGF&#x003b2;1 receptor knockout phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). However, in vitro biochemical and in vivo genetic studies suggest that TAK1 is also a significant mediator of inflammatory cytokine signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>Mouse embryonic fibroblasts from <italic>TAK1</italic>-null mice exhibit dramatically impaired NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK activation through TNFR-1, IL-1R, and Toll-like receptors. These cells are also highly sensitive to TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). TAK1 has also been found to be critical for keratinocyte survival. Keratinocytes with <italic>TAK1</italic> deletions are inactivated for NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK, and are sensitive to TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that TAK1 might mediate a general survival signal for many tissue cells, although the sensitivity of different types of cells to <italic>TAK1</italic> deletion varies. In our inducible TAK1 knockout mice, massive apoptotic cell death was observed in hematopoietic cells in the BM, spleen, and thymus, as well as in hepatocytes, where Cre-mediated <italic>TAK1</italic> deletion occurred. We also found that in hematopoietic cells and hepatocytes, TAK1 stimulated a survival signal also mediated by up-regulating the expression of survival genes via the IKK&#x003ba;&#x02013;NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK&#x02013;AP1 signaling pathways (not depicted).</p><p>It has been reported that NF-&#x003ba;B mediates a very important survival signal to protect cells from TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced apoptosis. Inactivation of NF-&#x003ba;B by gene mutation or pharmacological inhibition sensitizes such cells to TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced apoptosis. However, NF-&#x003ba;B knockout mice (Mx1Cre-mediated polyI:C-inducible knockout, the same system we used in our present studies) developed normally under normal husbandry without differences in gross anatomy, histological organization, or hepatic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). In contrast to the acute liver failure of <italic>TAK1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the syndrome of hepatic failure resulting from hepatocyte apoptosis seen in NF-&#x003ba;B knockout mice occurred only when the mice were treated with TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Moreover, as opposed to the BM failure phenotype of our <italic>TAK1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which was secondary to cell-autonomous apoptosis, the mice with IKK&#x003b1;/NF-&#x003ba;B signal inactivation showed stress-related B and T cell depletion, whereas HSC/Ps remained unaffected in this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In fact, the myeloid cells of NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;inactivated mice show a high proliferative index and multiple tissue inflammation reactions due to autocrine secretion of inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-&#x003b1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). This suggests that IKK&#x003b2;/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling is not essential for the survival of HSC/Ps and myeloid cells.</p><p>In <italic>TAK1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HSC/Ps, in addition to the inactivation of NF-&#x003ba;B signals, JNK signals were also inactivated. The role of JNK signaling is cell context dependent. Both proapoptotic and prosurvival effects of JNK signals have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). The role of JNK in HSC/Ps has not yet been addressed. We predict that both JNK and NF-&#x003ba;B signals are required for HSC/P survival in mice.

We speculate that c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> progenitors might possibly rely more on TAK1 for their survival, and that these were not targeted in the B cell&#x02013; and T cell&#x02013;specific knockout mice. In support of this idea, our data showed higher TAK1 activity in HSC/Ps and B cell progenitors than mature myeloid and B cells. But further study will be needed to establish this definitively.
