Monomeric CDK5 does not show any enzymatic activity, requiring association with its regulatory partners p35 or p39. During neuronal migration, p35-activated CDK5 phosphorylates NudEL, the homologous of an Aspergillus nidulans gene involved in nuclear translocation and in cytoskeletal organization of migrating neurons by dynein regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In mouse, Cdk5 modulates PAK kinases and is implicated in actin reorganization, which may be critical for neuron migration along radial glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In mice lacking Cdk5 or p35, abnormal formation of cortical layers occurs: a loss of the Cdk5 pathway appears to affect later migrating neurons as the cortical layers emerge from the cortical plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], leading to severe cortical lamination defects, adult mortality and seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The absence of p39 did not produce aberrant phenotype, indicating a predominant role of p35 in CDK5 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is also known that both Cdk5 and p35 concentrate at the leading edges of axonal growth cones and have been shown to regulate neuritis outgrowth in cortical neuron culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The active CDK5/p35 complex is involved in further processes required for central nervous system development and function, such as axonal regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], cellular differentiation, neuronal apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], learning and memory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], synaptic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and membrane trafficking during the outgrowth of neuronal processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Hyperactivity of CDK5 mediated by p25, a proteolytic fragment of p35, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], Parkinson's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In fact, phosphorylated neurofilaments and their associated kinases, most of which are represented by CDK5, were found in protein aggregates typical of neurodegenerative diseases. Findings on <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>deletion in patients with NF1 microdeletion syndrome showing mental retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the recently reported <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>mutations in non-syndromic mental retardation patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], pinpoint the gene as a candidate for mental retardation susceptibility in NF1 microdeletion syndrome and in a subgroup of non-syndromic mental retarded patients.</p><p>More recently the CDK5/p35 complex has also been reported to regulate several activities such as exocytosis, gene transcription, tissue regeneration, senescence, apoptosis and hormone regulation also in extra-neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Given the key role of <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>in the development, differentiation and physiology of brain and its involvement in extra-neuronal cell activities, it is conceivable that accurate spatio-temporal regulation of its expression is needed. <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>is characterized by an extended 3'-UTR (2725 bp), which accounts for about 75% of the whole transcript and is among the 5% longest annotated 3'-UTRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We recently reported the presence of known regulatory elements in <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR such as a potential GY-box motif (GUCUUCC, nt 1341&#x02013;1347) and three putative AU-Rich Elements (AREs) at the 3' end of the transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; GY-box has been validated as microRNA target in Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; AREs have a well known role in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA stability and degradation through the binding of specific factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These features suggest a role for the 3'-UTR in the control of <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>expression.</p><p>3'-UTRs have been shown to play crucial roles in a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], including modulation of mRNA stability and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], translation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], transport out of the nucleus and sub-cellular localization of mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Expression of several important nervous system genes, including genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors, biosynthetic enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, growth factors and associated proteins, are known to be regulated by functional elements in their 3'-UTRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Indeed, post-transcriptional regulation exerted by the 3'-UTR has been proposed as an effective counterpart to the mechanism of transcription in fine modulation of gene expression, in particular during the development of the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The importance of 3'-UTRs in regulating gene expression is also underlined by the finding that mutations affecting the 3'-UTR can lead to serious pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The role of the 3'-UTR for appropriated gene control has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and it is possible that certain disorders of neuronal plasticity and learning are due to perturbations in 3'-UTR-mediated functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Thus, regulatory elements within the 3'-UTR of <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>are likely to be involved in the tuning of its expression during central nervous system development and neuronal migration, acting on mRNA stability, translation efficiency and/or sub-cellular localization. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, studies on <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR function have not yet been reported.</p><p>In order to explore the role of <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR we have predicted additional regulatory elements and performed functional studies by means of dual luciferase assays and mRNA quantification, observing that the 3'-UTR decreases the reporter activity in different cell lines and that different regulatory elements are present, some with stabilizing and others with destabilizing function. We have identified regulatory regions showing cell-line specificity, in particular we have identified a region showing a destabilizing effect caused by increased mRNA degradation. We have also observed a stabilizing effect of the 3' end region containing a canonical ARE in two neuroblastoma cell lines and have obtained evidence of binding of the neuronal-specific ELAV (nELAV) proteins to <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>mRNA.</p><p>We report the first evidence on the involvement of <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR in the modulation of gene expression. These findings suggest that <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR may contribute to modulate its expression during central nervous system development and functioning. The impairment of this mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of both neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR is highly conserved in mammals and contains several putative regulatory elements</title><p>We previously predicted a potential GY-box and three putative AREs in <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In order to refine the search for potential Class I/II AREs we looked for the AUUUA pentameric motif in the whole <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR sequence: we found eight pentamers, among which two are isolated and six are flanked at one or both sides by AU stretches (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). None of these putative AREs show AUUUA pentamers arranged in tandem, a feature of Class II AREs, which indicates that these motifs might belong to Class I. Nevertheless, only one of the eight potential AREs (nt 2659&#x02013;2671) corresponds perfectly to the consensus sequence (WWWUAUUUAUUUW), according to the ARED 3.0 database definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], while the other possible AREs show at least two mismatches.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Bioinformatic analysis of <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR</bold>.

The comparison, performed with the mVISTA tool (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), indicates that the three sequences show several regions of at least 100 bp with more than 70% identity, notably in their proximal and terminal portions, with an overall sequence identity of 76.8% and of 76.3% for the human-mouse and the human-rat pair, respectively; the most conserved portion of human <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR is the 3'-end, which has about 95% identity with both its mouse and rat counterpart. Based on this analysis, the three most terminal putative AREs (nt 2539&#x02013;2551, nt 2636&#x02013;2645 and nt 2659&#x02013;2671) are completely conserved, while the other five show one or more mismatches. It is worth noting that, though the zebrafish <italic>Cdk5r1 </italic>3'-UTR, assembled by EST analysis, shows a high level of divergence with the sequences of mammals, the portion corresponding to the <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR ARE that matches the ARED consensus is nearly completely conserved, with the exception of only one nucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As far as the GY-box element is concerned, there is only one mismatch between human, mouse and rat, while this element seems to be absent in zebrafish (data not shown).</p><p>As functional AREs are likely to be exposed in loops accessible to AU-rich binding proteins, we predicted the <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR secondary structure by using the Sfold RNA-folding algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]: this analysis indicated that in the most stable predicted structure only three possible AREs are accessible in a single-stranded loop, in particular the ARE that follows the ARED consensus criteria (nt 2659&#x02013;2671) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).

The particular features of <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR and the lack of functional data prompted us to study its role in the control of gene expression by means of bioinformatic analysis and dual luciferase and RealTime PCR assays of chimeric constructs.</p><p>We have shown that the <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR can down-regulate luciferase expression and we assessed the presence of different sub-regions that can independently affect transcript stability and, in a few cases, translational efficiency in different cell lines.</p><p>The high degree of conservation showed by <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR is strongly indicative of a functional role of this region and suggests the presence of different post-transcriptional regulatory elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In particular several AREs were predicted, a feature typical of mRNAs with high turnover rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], among which the nt 2659&#x02013;2671 ARE shows complete identity to the ARE consensus sequence, according to the ARED 3.0 definition. Together with the high phylogenetic conservation in mammals and zebrafish and with the predicted accessibility to the binding of trans-acting factors, the functionality of this element can be hypothesized. It is worth noting that functional AREs are present in the 3'-UTR of many cyclin mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], raising the hypothesis that ARE-mediated post-transcriptional regulation may be a common mechanism for the control of expression in this class of genes, to which <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>belongs.</p><p>The pGL4.71P-UTR construct shows a decreased luciferase activity in all the cell lines according to mRNA level with the exception of SH-SY5Y cells, showing an mRNA level comparable to that of the control, which could be explained by the action of mechanisms controlling the translation. The overall effect of the large <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR may be the result of a complex regulation mechanism mediated by multiple 3'-UTR domains that act independently of each other, as has been already highlighted in <italic>BCL2</italic>, <italic>Cox-2</italic>, <italic>VEGF </italic>and <italic>c-Fos </italic>mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The dissection of 3'-UTR into 6 fragments, each containing at least one predicted regulatory element, allowed us to investigate the potential role of each region. All the chimeric constructs showed, in most of the studied cell lines, a general decrease of luciferase activity. In most cases these effects are likely to involve transcript stability rather than translational repression mechanisms, since reduced reporter activity levels corresponded, as determined by RealTime RT-PCR experiments, to diminished mRNA levels. In some instances the reduction of luciferase activity may be the result of mechanisms affecting both mRNA stability and translational efficiency. This effect is particularly evident for C2 and 3'-UTR constructs in SH-SY5Y cell line, suggesting that some elements influencing the behavior of the entire <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>3'-UTR may be found in the C2 region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>The strong reduction of luciferase activity and RNA induced by C2 fragment in all the transfected cell lines suggests the presence of one or more regulatory elements with a potent destabilizing function supported by the degradation assay results. We found that the C2.3 fragment, containing the only known putative element (nt 992&#x02013;1001 ARE), is not responsible for the low expression of the C2 fragment and thus this ARE, which is not conserved in rodents, is unlikely to be a destabilizing element. On the other hand, the decreased expression of pGL4.71P-C2.1 construct, in which none putative regulatory elements are predicted, prompts us to hypothesize the presence of novel regulatory elements in the C2.1 fragment. Further studies will be necessary to identify the post-transcriptional mechanisms leading to mRNA degradation of the above construct.</p><p>The non-destabilizing effect detected in HEK-293 cells for the C1 fragment and in SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y for C6 allows us to hypothesize that these regions are bound by cell-line specific stabilizing factors. The deletion in the C6 fragment of the canonical nt 2659&#x02013;2671 ARE reduced mRNA levels in all the analyzed cell lines, including SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y. This finding strongly suggests a stabilizing role of the canonical element in neuroblastoma-derived cells through the binding of neuronal-specific stabilizing factors expressed in SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The prediction that this ARE is within a single-stranded loop further supports this hypothesis. Several ARE binding proteins are known, some of which promote the stabilization of their target mRNAs, including cyclin mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Among these proteins, the neuronal specific nELAV RBPs, HuB, HuC and HuD, play a key role in the induction of neuronal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and have a stabilizing effect on several transcripts containing AREs in their 3'-UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The expression of HuB and HuD has been demonstrated in several neuroblastoma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>Our immunoprecipitation assays show that the neuronal-specific nELAV RBPs bind to <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>transcript in SH-SY5Y cells. The UV cross-linking experiments allowed us to observe that C1, C2 and C6 sub-regions show affinity for nELAV proteins <italic>in vitro </italic>while, although C4-5 contains putative AREs, it does not bind to nELAV RBPs. The luciferase activity together with the RealTime PCR results in comparison to UV cross-linking data, suggest that the binding shown by C1 and C2 regions for nELAV may be not so effective <italic>in vivo </italic>as in the case of C6 region. This finding might be explained by possible interactions of these regions with further regulatory destabilizing factors or to possible formation of unfavourable secondary mRNA structures. According to the RNA-operon model, trans-acting factors regulate mRNAs within a coordinated pathway of RNA processing, providing cells of a fast and dynamic tool to respond to environmental cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>Our results on interaction of the nELAV factors with <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>messenger in a neuronal cell line support the hypothesis of a neuron-specific post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>expression.

The 3'-UTR seems to contain some regulatory elements implicated in rapid mRNA turnover which, as a consequence, maintain the steady-state transcript at low levels, and others which have a cell-specific stabilizing effect on the transcript that may contribute to rapidly increase the expression of <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>during specific biological processes. Thus the 3'-UTR may exert a key role in fine tuning of <italic>CDK5R</italic>1 expression that in turn might be crucial during the complex processes underlying correct central nervous system development and neuronal survival in which <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>is involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The active CDK5-p35 complex is strongly involved in neurofilament phosphorylation and its aberrant hyperactivity has been shown to be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. It has recently been demonstrated in mouse that p35 protein level is a rate-limiting factor for the up-regulation of Cdk5 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Thus an up-regulation of <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>expression in neurons may have pathological implications causing neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, the absence of p35 leads to abnormalities in the laminar structure of cerebral cortex, affecting actin-cyotskeletal dynamics and microtubule regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], and severe mental retardation was shown by patients with NF1 microdeletion syndrome with the lack of one copy of <italic>CDK5R1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Passive Lysis Buffer (350 &#x003bc;l of 1&#x000d7; buffer) was added to each well, and plates were placed in a shaking incubator for 30 minutes at room temperature. For additional lysis, two freeze-thaw cycles were performed in which the cells were frozen to -80&#x000b0;C. 50 &#x003bc;l of Dual-Glo Luciferase Reagent were added to 50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;l of lysate and incubated for 30 minutes. Firefly luciferase luminescence (pGL3P vector) was measured. Before measurement of Renilla luciferase (pGL4.71P vector), 50 &#x003bc;l of the Stop &#x00026; Glo reagent were added to each well to quench the firefly luciferase reaction. Renilla luciferase luminescence was measured after an incubation of 30 minutes. Relative Renilla luciferase light output was normalized to Firefly luciferase output. Firefly-normalized luciferase activity for the construct was compared with the insertion-less pGL4.71P vector. The data were expressed as means &#x000b1; s.d.

Total RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin RNA II Columns (Macherey-Nagel, D&#x000fc;ren, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. To eliminate amplification of reporter plasmid DNA and genomic DNA, total RNA was treated with Turbo DNA-free (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes.

The level of luciferase transcripts was determined using RealTime quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR using the TaqMan system (Applied Biosystems Inc.) using specific primers and probes for Renilla luciferase, Firefly luciferase and Glyseraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>GAPDH</italic>). Renilla and Firefly luciferase quantification data were normalized on expression of the housekeeping gene <italic>GAPDH</italic>, and then the Renilla data were normalized on transfection efficiency by using Firelfy mRNA levels.</p><p>In mRNA decay assays SK-N-BE cells were treated with 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribobenzimidazole (DRB) (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) 24 hours post-transfection to suppress the transcription of the luciferase reporter gene.
