The kappa deleting element is flanked by hepta- and nonanucleotide recognition sequences similar to the ones adjacent to the JK gene segments. Complementary recognition sequences with a 30 bp spacer were found in the JK-CK intron. For the first time the two partners of a recombination event in a mammalian immunoglobulin gene system have been linked on a physical map. The orientation of the recombination signals of the intron and the Kde sequences allows a joining by a simple deletion mechanism. Similarities and possible differences to the mechanism of V-J joining are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0213.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4591"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4592"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4593"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4594"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0217.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4595"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0218.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4596"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0219.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4597"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0220.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4598"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0221.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4599"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0222.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4600"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0223.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4601"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0224.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4602"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00280-0225.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4603"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
