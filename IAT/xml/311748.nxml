These enzymes are designated GSTs I, II and III based on size, substrate specificity and responsiveness to safeners. GST III has been shown to act on the herbicide alachlor as well as the commonly used substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). Clones were isolated from a maize cDNA library in lambda gt10. Three clones contained the entire coding region for GST III. The sequences of these clones were consistent with the known amino terminal GST III protein sequence. Moreover, expression of one of these clones in E. coli resulted in a GST activity as measured with both CDNB and alachlor, proving that at least one of the clones encodes an active GST III species. With the enzyme expressed in E. coli it will become possible to study enzyme structure-function relationships ex planta. While a number of different GST proteins are present in maize tissue the GST III gene is present in single or low copy in the genome.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00287-0098-a" xlink:role="7231"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00287-0100-a" xlink:role="7233"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00287-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7227"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00287-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7228"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00287-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7229"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00287-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7230"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00287-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7231"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00287-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7232"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00287-0100.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7233"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00287-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7234"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00287-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7235"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
