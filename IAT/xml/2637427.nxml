Toll signalling culminates in the translocation of the NF-&#x003ba;B homologue Dif to the nucleus following Gram-positive bacterial or fungal challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Rutchmann1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Imd is deployed primarily against Gram-negative bacteria via the NF-&#x003ba;B homologue Relish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Hedengren1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This pathway is modulated in larvae by NO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Foley1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The working hypothesis is that ingestion of bacteria induces NO Synthase (NOS) in the gut. NO released from the gut signals to blood cells, which induce Relish-dependent responses in the fat body (the insect analogue of the liver), the major site of antimicrobial peptide production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Foley1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. According to this model there are two interconnected and sequential phases of the NO-controlled pathway: an NF-&#x003ba;B-independent (blood cells) and an NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent module (fat body). Considering these data, together with the fact that a) NO is a potent antimicrobial agent in a variety of organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Bogdan1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and b) that dietary restriction (DR) activates the endothelial production of NO in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Nisoli1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, we investigated whether we could take advantage of the NF-&#x003ba;B-independent phase of NO function to improve the survival of infected Relish-deficient flies if, prior to bacterial challenge, we controlled their access to nutrients.</p><p>Our rationale stemmed from the hypothesis that DR-mediated NO production may be an evolutionary conserved process and such a diet regime could be used to boost an immuno-compromised immune system (such as one lacking Relish or more generally a TIR-NF-&#x003ba;B component) by elevating NO levels. The intriguing implication if this hypothesis was correct would be that a DR protocol could be used in humans to manipulate natural immunity and boost host defences without the need for a sophisticated clinical setting.</p><p>Our results showed that indeed NO release following a protocol of food restriction is an evolutionary conserved process. Short-term starvation (STS) positively influenced the survival of <italic>relish (rel)</italic> mutant flies following Gram-negative bacterial infection. Bacterial load was markedly decreased in <italic>rel</italic> STS flies compared to their fed counterparts. These phenotypes were reversible when a known NO-inhibitor (L-NAME) was used.</p><p>Our results revealed that in wild type flies there was a Relish-dependent positive feedback loop that enhanced NO production following infection, through NOS upregulation. In the absence of Relish, STS stimulated the Toll pathway where Dif activated Cytochrome Oxidase C (CCO), which in turn elevated NO levels without NOS upregulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>STS improves survival of rel-deficient flies to Gram-negative bacteria</title><p>In order to determine the effect of food restriction upon NO production in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we placed <italic>rel</italic> or <italic>dif</italic> flies in nutrient-free agar vials for twenty-four hours. Throughout this period flies had free access to water. We term this short-term starvation (STS) as opposed to dietary restriction (DR) since there was no dilution of the food medium usually applied in DR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Piper1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 11&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead, flies were subject to a starvation regime. Furthermore, as it has been estimated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> only consumes one to two microlitres of food per 24 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, our protocol was a short-term restriction of nutrients rather than DR feeding. Two groups of <italic>rel</italic> or <italic>dif</italic> flies were used. Prior to bacterial challenge, one was fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> (AL) while the other was subjected to STS for 24 h. They were then infected with Gram-negative (<italic>rel</italic>) or Gram-positive bacteria (<italic>dif</italic>). After infection flies were transferred to fresh food and surviving individuals counted daily (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref>).

Since our results also demonstrated that STS specifically countered Gram-negative bacterial infections we pursued our study with <italic>rel</italic> STS and AL flies to investigate whether our results might also be NO-dependent. When both STS and AL <italic>rel</italic> flies were transferred to food containing L-NAME, an inhibitor of NO Synthase (NOS), the two groups exhibited comparable patterns of survival that reflected the susceptibility of <italic>rel</italic> mutant flies to Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004490-g001">Fig 1D, 1E</xref>).

To formally prove that NO release was induced during STS we measured NO levels in STS and AL animals.

NO is synthesised via overlapping and interconnected pathways. The main component of this mode is achieved through the direct upregulation of NOS mediated by the NF-&#x003ba;B protein Relish after infection by Gram-negative bacteria. NO can then upregulate the IMD pathway in a positive feedback loop. A second (minor) component of this would be the direct (NF-&#x003ba;B-independent) production of NO as an antimicrobial agent against Gram-negative bacteria. Finally, STS-mediated NO expression is catalysed by two-independent means. Principally through the up-regulation of Relish, leading to NOS upregulation as described above, or secondly, in a NOS-independent fashion. In this case starvation-induced NF-&#x003ba;B (either Relish and/or Dif) upregulation leads to CCO upregulation and NOS-independent NO production.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004490.g006"/></fig><p>Mitochondria from yeast, rat liver, and plants are capable of NOS-independent NO synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Kelly1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 16&#x0005d;</xref> when subject to hypoxia and this reaction is catalysed by CCO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Castello1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

This in turn could lead to a positive feedback loop with NO accumulation directing NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated signalling towards CCO upregulation and AMP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004490-g006">Fig 6C</xref>; see below).

Recent studies have shown that in mice, DR acts as a trigger for NO activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Nisoli1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We show here that this procedure is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Moreover, it can be used to ameliorate the outlook of Relish immunodeficient flies following Gram-negative infection. Surprisingly our data show that in the absence of Relish, which is the main mediator of NO effects in wild type flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Foley1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, the Toll-specific NF-&#x003ba;B regulator Dif, is recruited to direct NO synthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first direct <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence of a role for Dif in promoting NO function.</p><p>Experiments presented here as well as those of a recent study, have shown that STS induces the Toll pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Wu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004490-g006">Fig 6B</xref>&#x0005d;, which in turn can activate CCO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Nisoli1">&#x0005b;this study, see also 10&#x0005d;</xref>. In the absence of Relish, STS may be inducing Dif-directed CCO-mediated NO production. This could lead to mitochondrial biogenesis as judged by the up-regulation of several related markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004490-g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Our results suggest that the link between food restriction-mediated production of NO and mitochondrial biogenesis is evolutionary conserved. Finally, in wild type flies infection leads to Relish-mediated enhancement of <italic>NOS</italic> expression, with the NO produced signalling to the IMD pathway to augment AMP expression, that in turn enhances NOS expression and NO production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004490-g006">Fig 6C</xref>).</p><p>In mice, intra-hepatic synthesis of NO through the expression of a NOS-2 transgene, leads to protection from liver inflammatory injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Mojena1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results strongly parallel this and indicate that the protective mechanism in flies is NF-&#x003ba;B dependent. However, NO was not strictly a signalling molecule but acted also directly as an antimicrobial agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004490-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Recent results concerning primary immunodeficiencies in humans indicate overlapping host defences <italic>in natura</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Casanova1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The overlapping action of NO and AMPs observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> underlie the evolutionary implications of such a notion.</p><p>Manipulating NO synthesis through diet may have considerable consequences for developing strategies to protect immunodeficient individuals and future studies with a graded nutritional supply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Magwere1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> should reveal, which parts of the fly diet may be restricted in order to activate NO in <italic>rel</italic> flies. It is highly significant to this study that nutritional status has also been shown to modify immune outcome in humans by preferentially altering the differentiation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> naive T helper (Th) 0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-vandenBrink1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Differentiated Th1 cells primarily stimulate cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens by activating macrophages and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes that leads to the production of gamma interferon (IFN-&#x003b3;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Coffman1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 22&#x0005d;</xref>. Th2 cells, on the other hand, favour the B-cell-dependent humoral immune response against extracellular pathogens and the production of interleukin 4 (IL-4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Cher1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

The mechanism for the differential modification of the Th1-Th2 balance in response to calorific input remains enigmatic, however, it is tempting to speculate it might also involve NO. In mammals NO negatively influences Th1 cell development by limiting IL-12 production from macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004490-Huang1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, which may therefore lead to the preferential differentiation of Th2 cells.

This non-invasive procedure relied on the potential of priming natural elements of the immune system with the ability to respond better to infection. This protocol involved short-term starvation (STS) prior to septic injury. STS mediated the release of NO principally through an NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent mechanism although there was a minor component of NO that was independent of NF-&#x003ba;B.
