The role of membrane TNF, in host resistance against <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> bacille Calmette&#x02013;Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG), was tested in knock-in mice in which the endogenous TNF was replaced by a non-cleavable and regulated allele (&#x00394;1&#x02013;12, TNF<sup>tm/tm</sup>). While 100% of mice with complete TNF deficiency (TNF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) succumbed to infection, 50% of TNF<sup>tm/tm</sup> mice were able to control <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG infection and survived the experimental period. Membrane expressed TNF allowed a substantial recruitment of activated T cells and macrophages with granuloma formation and expression of bactericidal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Using virulent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection we confirm that membrane TNF conferred partial protection. Infection in TNF<sup>tm/tm</sup> double transgenic mice with TNF-R1 or TNF-R2 suggest protection is mediated through TNF-R2 signalling. Therefore, the data suggest that membrane-expressed TNF plays a critical role in host defence to mycobacterial infection and may partially substitute for soluble TNF.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BCG</kwd><kwd>granuloma</kwd><kwd>H37Rv</kwd><kwd>membrane &#x00394;1-12 TNF</kwd><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium</italic></kwd><kwd>T-cell recruitment</kwd><kwd>TNF-deficiency</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Protective immunity to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection, both in humans and experimental animals, is regulated by T cells, macrophages and cytokines, which include interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;), interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> IFN-&#x003b3; derived from T and natural killer (NK) cells has been shown to be essential, as mice with a disruption of the IFN-&#x003b3; system are unable to restrict the growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and succumb to the infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref></p><p>A critical role for TNF in mycobacterial defence is inferred from neutralization and deletion experiments in mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> In addition, the TNF-related cytokine lymphotoxin-&#x003b1;, (LT&#x003b1;, previously known as TNF-&#x003b2;), has also been shown to be required to control mycobacterial infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> Secreted TNF and LT&#x003b1; signal both through the p55 and p75 TNF receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2 respectively, while the cell bound LT&#x003b1;&#x003b2; heterotrimer recognize the LT&#x003b2;R.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> TNFR1 signalling appears to be critical for the control of mycobacterial infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> while a role of TNFR2 is not excluded.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> LT&#x003b2;R signalling was similarly found to protect against mycobacterial infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></p><p>TNF is produced by macrophages, but is expressed by a variety of cells and is a major regulator of inflammation and leucocyte trafficking.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> Although a key role of TNF in controlling intracellular bacterial infections is uncontested, the function of membrane TNF, which is subsequently cleaved by the metalloproteinase-disintegrin TACE (TNF-&#x003b1; converting enzyme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) into the secreted trimeric TNF is, in mycobacterial host resistance, less clear.</p><p>Several biological functions of membrane TNF have been described, such as cytotoxicity, polyclonal activation of B cells, and induction of IL-10 by monocytes and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 expression on endothelial cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> The transgenic expression of membrane TNF demonstrated an <italic>in vivo</italic> role including the control of BCG and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> but this approach is imperfect as the transgenic expression of high levels membrane TNF is artificial and may cause altered immune responses and non-physiological pathology.

Macrophage and lymphocyte recruitment was significantly reduced in TNF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, with a significant reduction of the CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets in the absence of TNF, which might be related to reduced chemokine production in the absence of TNF.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> As the recruitment of the different cell types was partially restored in TNF<sup>tm/tm</sup> mice, membrane TNF on T cells or other cells might provide a partial signal for chemokine induction and hence increased cell trafficking. The contribution of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells in cell-mediated immunity against mycobacteria has been investigated by the use of neutralizing antibodies and gene-deficient mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> In the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> typical granuloma formation in T cells was largely absent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref></p><p>However, in view of the only partial activation and protection, which is likely caused by direct cell&#x02013;cell contact, secreted TNF and hence distal signalling, appears to be required for a full protective host response. This finding concurs with the recent data demonstrating reduced severity of autoimmune encephalomyelitis, but little effect on inflammation in the spinal cord in a similar genetic mouse model.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref></p><p>Lastly, the infection studies in double TNF<sup>tm/tm</sup>&#x000d7; TNFR1 or R2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> transgenic mice rescued protection in TNF<sup>tm/tm</sup> &#x000d7; TNFR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and comparable protection in TNF<sup>tm/tm</sup> &#x000d7; TNFR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice as in TNF<sup>tm/tm</sup> mice suggest that membrane signalling though TNFR2 likely provides host protection. Our data in this infection model using the &#x00394;1-12 TNF mutant mouse shows a reduced protective immune response during mycobacterial infection when compared to previous findings in which a membrane TNF transgenic mutant or the &#x00394;1-9,K11E mutant were used. Our findings indicate that membrane TNF, in the &#x00394;1-12 TNF mutant may preferentially induce protection through TNFR2. Receptor signalling in membrane TNF transgenic mutant or the &#x00394;1-9,K11E mutant may be mediated through both TNFR1 and TNFR2 different, accounting for the differences observed in the degree of protection afforded by membrane TNF in the different mutant strains.</p><p>The data suggest that sparing membrane expressed TNF in therapeutic interventions neutralizing TNF such as in rheumatoid arthritis might reduce infectious complications. In summary, we show that membrane TNF participates in cell-mediated immunity against mycobacterial infection. The protective effect of membrane-bound TNF is likely mediated through TNFR2 signalling.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank UCT personnel M.
