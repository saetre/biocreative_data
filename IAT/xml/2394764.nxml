These so-called isochores correspond to functionally distinct domains that are cytologically visible as R- and G-bands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Functional differences between the two types of regions include higher and lower levels of transcription and meiotic recombination and earlier and later firing of replication origins.</p><p>Isochores in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>range in size from 5-90 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Clear evidence that isochores are correlated with functional domains comes from studies of meiotic phenomena in yeast. Programmed double strand break formation and loading of axial structure proteins are much more prominent in GC-rich isochores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Moreover, when a meiotic recombination hotspot from a GC-rich isochore is inserted into an AT-rich isochore domain, the site adopts the lower recombination activity characteristic of its new environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This important experiment implies that isochores exert domain-wide control over genes and elements located within them.</p><p>GC- and AT-rich isochores differ in chromatin structure, with more open and more compact chromatin in the two types of regions, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Additionally, studies of yeast isochores by 3C (chromosome conformation capture) analysis have revealed important structural differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Chromatin in AT-rich isochores has a longer apparent persistence length than that in GC-rich isochores, suggesting that AT-rich chromatin is less flexible than GC-rich chromatin.</p><p>A key feature that affects conformation and activity of chromatin is the histone modification state. For example, telomeres and sub-telomeric regions are regulated by distinct histone deacetylases, Sir2p and Hda1p, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, very little is known about the underlying features that control isochores. Up to now no factors have been identified that act in an isochore-dependent fashion along chromosome arms.</p><p>Here, we present evidence that suggests that GC-rich chromatin is in a more extended conformation than AT-rich chromatin and that GC-rich genes on average tend to be more active, thereby extending the analogies between yeast and mammalian isochores. Interestingly, we find that GC-rich and AT-rich regions are marked by distinct levels of a subset of histone modifications. We then show that the histone deacetylase Rpd3p has a novel, base composition-dependent effect on chromatin conformation and gene expression. Comparisons between wild-type and <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>mutant cells with respect to chromatin conformation and transcriptional activity, combined with analysis of the Rpd3p binding pattern in the wild type, led to a model that Rpd3p-dependent histone deacetylation of GC-rich genes directly promotes a more compact chromatin conformation, with a corresponding effect on transcription. We propose that Rpd3p activity attenuates more active GC-rich chromatin throughout the genome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>GC-rich isochores have a more extended chromatin conformation than AT-rich isochores</title><p>We analyzed conformation of GC- and AT-rich isochores along yeast chromosome III using the 3C methodology. 3C is used to detect the relative frequencies of interaction for different pairs of genomic loci. 3C data can be used to determine the overall spatial conformation of chromosomes and chromosomal sub-domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This approach, as previously described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], involves three steps. First, formaldehyde cross-linking is used to trap pairs of interacting chromatin segments (via protein/protein/DNA cross-links). Second, cross-linked chromatin is solubilized and then digested and ligated at low concentration so that cross-linked segments will be preferentially joined. Third, ligation products are detected and quantified by PCR using pairs of primers specific to each pair of interacting loci. Relative levels of different PCR products correspond to the relative interaction frequencies of the various locus pairs.</p><p>We chose to analyze isochore domains along chromosome III because of their relatively large size (up to 90 kb), which allows detailed 3C analysis. Our previous analysis of these isochores revealed structural differences but did not address whether these differences in interaction frequencies could reflect differences in chromatin compaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Here we addressed this issue in detail. Nuclei were isolated from alpha-factor arrested (G1) haploid wild-type yeast cells and 3C was performed. Interaction frequencies for pairs of sites located within the GC- and AT-rich domains along the right arm of chromosome III (positions 100-190 kb and 190-280 kb, respectively) were measured. When these frequencies are plotted against the distance between the loci of each pair (the genomic site separation) an inverse relationship between interaction frequency and genomic distance is observed. Moreover, sites located in the GC-rich isochore domain interact less frequently than sites located in the AT-rich isochore domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Isochore domains along chromosome III differ in conformation and activity. <bold>(a) </bold>Interaction frequencies (the average of three measurements) between loci located within the AT-rich isochore (positions 100-190 kb) of chromosome III (filled circles) or within the GC-rich isochore domain on the right arm of chromosome III (positions 190-280 kb; open circles) were determined in G1-arrested wild-type cells and plotted against genomic distance that separates each pair of loci.

Dotted and solid lines indicate fits of the data to equation 1 (Table 1). <bold>(b) </bold>Yeast genes were grouped in six groups dependent on the average base composition of the 4 kb region centered on the start site of the gene is (see Materials and methods). For each group the average steady state transcript level in wild-type cells was determined using data obtained by Bernstein <italic>et al</italic>. [30]. The genome-wide average transcript level was set at zero. The difference between the most GC-rich group and the most AT-rich group is statistically significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). Error bars indicate SEM.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2007-8-6-r116-1"/></fig><p>We next determined whether the difference in interaction frequencies was simply due to lower levels of formaldehyde cross-linking in the GC-rich isochore compared to the AT-rich isochore. We reasoned that formaldehyde cross-linking during the 3C procedure would reduce restriction enzyme digestion efficiency due to cross-linking of proteins to restriction sites and that any differences in cross-linking in GC- and AT-rich domains should be detectable as differences in their susceptibilities to restriction enzyme digestion. We first used a PCR based method that detects partially digested chromatin to confirm that digestion efficiency is inversely proportional to the level of cross-linking (Additional data file 2). We then assessed the digestion efficiencies for several sites located in the GC-rich and AT-rich regions. The fraction of protected restriction sites, and thus the level of cross-linking, in the GC-rich regions was slightly higher than, but not significantly different from, that observed in the AT-rich domain (Additional data file 1 and 2). Similar previous 3C analyses have also shown that digestion and cross-linking efficiency is relatively constant throughout large chromosomal regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These results imply that the two types of domains have undergone very similar levels of cross-linking and thus that the difference in interaction frequencies in GC- and AT-rich domains as detected by 3C reflects a difference in spatial conformation.</p><p>Interaction frequencies are proportional to the local concentration of the loci and, therefore, differences in interaction frequencies within the GC-rich and AT-rich domains are most straightforwardly attributable to a difference in effective volume between these domains, with the GC-rich isochore occupying a larger volume per kb of DNA (that is, being less compact).</p><p>Further details of differences in compaction between GC- and AT-rich domains are provided by analysis of 3C data using a suitable polymer model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

The parameter <italic>s </italic>is the genomic site separation between two loci (in kb) and <italic>X</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) is the interaction frequency. The parameter <italic>S </italic>is the length of the Kuhn's statistical segment in kb, which corresponds to two times the persistence length and is a measure for the flexibility of the chromatin fiber. The parameter <italic>c </italic>is the apparent circle size of the fiber (in kb). In the case of a fiber engaged in an unconstrained random walk, <italic>c </italic>will be infinitely large, in which case <italic>&#x003b2; </italic>equals <italic>s/S</italic>; any other value of <italic>c </italic>implies the presence of constraints on the path of the chromatin fiber. The parameter <italic>k </italic>is the efficiency of cross-linking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Finally, <italic>L </italic>is the contour length (in nm) of 1 kb of chromatin, referred to as the mass density, and is a measure for the level of compaction of the chromatin fiber. Fitting interaction frequencies to equation 1 yields values for <italic>S</italic>, <italic>c </italic>and for [<italic>k </italic>&#x000d7; <italic>L</italic><sup>-3</sup>]. Values for the individual parameters <italic>k </italic>and <italic>L </italic>cannot be directly obtained from this analysis and the combined parameter [<italic>k </italic>&#x000d7; <italic>L</italic><sup>-3</sup>] will be referred to as the apparent compaction factor. However, if <italic>k </italic>is known to be constant, as appears to be the case in the present study (above), variations in this combined parameter can be interpreted as differences in the value of <italic>L</italic>.</p><p>When interaction frequencies for the GC- and AT-rich domains, from three independent cultures were fitted to equation 1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), significant differences between the two types of domains become apparent. First, chromatin in the GC-rich domain is significantly more flexible than chromatin in the AT-rich domain (that is, <italic>S </italic>is smaller, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Second, the GC-rich domain appears to be in a circular conformation, with an apparent circle size of around 200 kb reflecting the presence of constraints on the chromatin path, consistent with our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. For the AT-rich domain, in contrast, we had to assume (for two out of three cultures) that <italic>c </italic>is infinitely large in order to obtain a good fit, implying the apparent lack of such constraints. Third, an approximately three-fold lower value for the apparent compaction factor [<italic>k </italic>&#x000d7; <italic>L</italic><sup>-3</sup>] was obtained for the GC-rich domain than for the AT-rich domain (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c;

For each group we determined the average level of each of 11 histone modifications (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a-d</xref>; Additional data file 3). We found that 4 out of 11 modifications (histone H4 Lys8 (H4K8) and Lys12 (H4K12), and histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9) and Lys18 (H3K18)) are enriched in GC-rich chromatin and depleted in AT-rich chromatin. The levels of the remaining seven modifications were not clearly correlated with base composition (histone H4 Lys16 (H4K16), histone H3 Lys14 (H3K14), LysK23 (H3K23) and Lys27 (H3K27), histone H2A Lys7 (H2AK7), and histone H2B Lys11 (H2BK11) and Lys16 (H2BK16); Additional data file 3). Interestingly, modifications of both H3 and H4 are correlated with base-composition, whereas modifications of H2A and H2B are not. These results demonstrate that GC- and AT-rich chromatin domains display distinct levels of H3 and H4 acetylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>) and provide additional evidence for structural and functional differences of isochore domains in yeast.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>GC-rich and AT-rich genes differ in levels of acetylation of specific histone tail residues in wild-type cells.

In addition, Rpd3p has been shown to affect the global pattern of histone acetylation, over and above its specific effects at target promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This global activity is weak, affecting histone acetylation levels only up to two-fold. The significance of these more global weak effects on chromatin structure and gene expression is not well understood. We were interested in the possibility that the global effects of Rpd3p may modulate structural and functional differences between GC- and AT-rich chromatin.

These observations are important for two reasons. First, they reveal a previously unrecognized base-composition-sensitive effect of this histone deacetylase. Second, they suggest that Rpd3p normally acts to keep the two types of isochore domains from being even more different in conformation than they would otherwise tend to be.</p><p>To more fully characterize chromatin conformation in <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells, interaction frequencies were fitted to equation 1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a-c</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

These observations reveal that Rpd3p mediates transcriptional control via two independent effects. At one level, Rpd3p-mediated inhibition is correlated with steady-state expression levels of genes. At the second level, Rpd3p inhibits transcription in a GC content-dependent manner. The GC content-dependent activity is not correlated with the steady-state expression level of genes.</p><p>These observations suggest that the base composition-dependent activity of Rpd3p is not dependent on local and gene-specific control of promoter activity, but instead may be related to more general features of chromatin conformation in GC-rich regions of the genome. In that case, we predict that the base composition-dependent activity of Rpd3p will be independent of local targeting to specific target genes.

Our results indicate that GC-rich and AT-rich domains are both structurally and functionally distinct. First, interaction frequencies within GC-rich chromatin tend to be lower than those in AT-rich chromatin, which is in agreement with a more extended chromatin conformation, as observed in higher eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Second, similar to mammalian isochores, genes located in the most GC-rich regions of the yeast genome are, on average, more highly expressed (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). Importantly, we found that GC-rich genes display higher levels of H3 and H4 acetylation compared to more AT-rich genes. Finally, we identify Rpd3p as a molecular component involved in base composition-dependent control of chromatin structure and function. This role of Rpd3p may be conserved in higher eukaryotes as it is also associated with less condensed interbands in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This activity appears to be specific for Rpd3p as we did not detect a base composition-dependent activity of another globally acting histone deacetylase, Hda1p.</p><p>Rpd3p has been shown to have two distinct modes of action. First, Rpd3p is recruited to specific target genes to modulate their expression. Second, Rpd3p acts in a global and non-targeted fashion to deacetylate bulk chromatin. We propose that the base composition-dependent effects of Rpd3p are related to its global activities. First, the magnitudes of these GC-content dependent effects are subtle, similar to the previously described effects of Rpd3p on global histone acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Second, deletion of Ume6p, a protein involved in recruitment of Rpd3p to many of its specific target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], does not result in up-regulation of GC-rich genes, indicating that Rpd3p interacts with GC-rich genes in a Ume6p-independent manner. Third, the GC content-dependent effects are not correlated with the steady-state expression of genes, and thus seem unrelated to local promoter controls.</p><p>We favor the model that the global and untargeted activity of Rpd3p acts predominantly and/or has the largest effect on GC-rich chromatin. First, Rpd3p binds GC-rich genes more prominently than AT-rich genes. Second, deletion of <italic>RPD3 </italic>results in increased H4 acetylation, particularly of GC-rich genes. Finally, treatment of wild-type cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA activates GC-rich genes more strongly than AT-rich genes. However, we did observe that TSA induced activation of GC-rich genes requires more time than induction of many direct target Rpd3p genes. This relatively slow effect could be interpreted to mean that the base composition-dependent effects of deletion of <italic>RPD3 </italic>are indirect and are due to altered expression of a specific Rpd3p target gene that, in turn, encodes a protein that acts in a GC content-dependent fashion. Alternatively, and consistent with the Rpd3p localization and acetylation data, Rpd3p does directly affect expression of GC-rich genes, but this more global and non-targeted process occurs at a longer time scale or requires passage through a specific phase of the cell cycle.</p><p>An alternative or additional molecular explanation of the observed phenomena is related to potential base composition-dependent differences in wrapping of DNA around histones. AT-rich DNA may be more flexibly and more easily wrapped around nucleosomes than GC-rich DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This physical model implies intrinsic differences in nucleosome organization dependent on base composition and does not require that histone modifying enzymes act in a base composition-dependent fashion <italic>per se</italic>. In this model, histone modifying enzymes recognize differences in intrinsic conformation of GC- and AT-rich chromatin. Rpd3p may preferentially act on the nucleosome organization of GC-rich chromatin. Similarly, acetyl transferases may preferentially modify GC-rich domains in wild type, resulting in higher levels of histone H3 and H4 acetylation, as we observed here. Based on these considerations, we predict the presence of histone acetyl transferases that act most prefentially on GC-rich chromatin.</p><p>In light of these observations, we can interpret our 3C analysis more precisely. The 3C results show that deletion of <italic>RPD3 </italic>differentially affected the conformation of GC- and AT-rich isochore domains along chromosome III, but did not allow determination of which of the two types of domains, or both, displayed an altered conformation. When Rpd3p activity affects GC-rich genes most prominently, the most parsimonious explanation of our 3C data is that deletion of <italic>RPD3 </italic>most strongly affects the conformation of the GC-rich domain, resulting in a more extended and transcriptionally active chromatin conformation, consistent with predicted relationships between transcription, histone acetylation and chromatin conformation.</p><p>GC-rich chromatin displays lower interaction frequencies, as detected by 3C, than AT-rich chromatin. Analysis of cross-linking efficiency suggests that both types of domains are cross-linked with similar frequencies (Additional data file 2) and, therefore, have similar protein densities. Histones are the most abundant chromatin proteins, and thus our results suggest that GC-rich and AT-rich regions have similar levels of histone binding. Consistent with this hypothesis, Nagy <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] found no correlation between base composition and regions depleted in nucleosomes. Previously, we found a decrease in interaction frequencies upon activation of the <italic>FMR1 </italic>gene in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], similar to the observed changes in <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells described here, suggesting that reduced 3C interaction frequencies may be a general characteristic of active chromatin.</p><p>The base composition-dependent effect of Rpd3p activity affects expression of genes independent of their steady state level of expression. Genes with the same steady state expression level in wild type are more strongly repressed by Rpd3p when they are GC-rich than when they are AT-rich. This implies that GC-rich genes are intrinsically more active, consistent with higher steady state levels of H3 and H4 acetylation, as we observed here, and that Rpd3p acts as an attenuator of these genes. Based on these considerations, we propose that chromatin status is regulated through a homeostatic and highly dynamic mechanism involving counteracting activating and repressing activities. A similar model of dynamic global acetylation and deacetylation has been proposed by Katan-Khaykovich and Struhl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and by Clayton <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings described here uncover novel GC content-dependent differences in chromatin conformation, regulation, histone modification status and transcription. These findings are significant from four perspectives. First, they provide new information about the nature and functional significance of base composition variation along chromosomes. Second, they show that GC-rich chromatin is most acetylated and is attenuated by the histone deacetylase Rpd3p, thus providing a first clue as to how regions with different base-compositions are differentially regulated. Third, they show that the roles of Rpd3p can be separated into independent components, with a GC-content-dependent global activity layered on top of its targeted and gene specific effects. Finally, they suggest that functional and structural differences between GC- and AT-rich regions are determined in part by balances between activating and repressing activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p>Yeast strains were derived from SK1.

A control PCR template was generated by digestion and random ligation of purified yeast genomic DNA (NKY2997). All templates were titrated to determine the linear range of PCR. PCR products were quantified on 1.5% agarose gels in the presence of ethidium bromide. Interaction frequencies were calculated in triplicate by determination of the ratio of the amount of PCR product obtained with the 3C template divided by the amount of PCR product obtained with the control template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Reproducibility was confirmed by analysis of three independent wild-type cultures and three <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cultures. Data from wild-type cells and <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells was normalized so that the average Log of the fold difference in interaction frequencies in <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells compared to wild-type cells for loci in the AT-rich domain of chromosome III was zero.</p></sec><sec><title>Sliding window analysis and generation of isochore groups</title><p>The chromosomal position of each open reading frame was defined as its 5' start site. Base composition was determined using EMBOSS Isochore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] with a window size of 4 kb and a step size of 1 kb. As a result, base composition values are assigned every 1 kb. To determine the regional base composition of each gene, the base composition value determined for the position closest to its 5' start site was chosen.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of microarray data</title><p>For each open reading frame the fold change in transcription in an <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>mutant compared to wild type was obtained from a dataset generated by Fazzio and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and log-transformed. Sliding window analysis was used to plot regional effects of deletion of <italic>RPD3 </italic>along chromosomes III (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). A window of 30 kb was selected. The step size was 1 open reading frame.</p><p>Steady-state transcription levels in exponentially growing wild-type cells were obtained by Bernstein and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Histone acetylation levels in wild-type cells were determined by Kurdistani and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].
