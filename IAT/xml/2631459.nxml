The American Cancer Society's facts and figures shows that 182,460 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in women in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The number of deaths due to breast cancer in 2008 is projected to be 40,480. In addition, 1990 men are expected to get breast cancer and 450 to die of it in 2008. There are several risk factors for breast cancer occurrence such as genetic susceptibility, radiation, obesity, and alcohol use. Pathways activated in breast cancer include Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4E (eIF4E) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase(PI3K)-AKT pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and the Nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkB) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Our research has focused on the role of the eIF4E in human breast cancer.</p><sec><title>Role of eIF4E in human breast cancer</title><p>The eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF4E, is a 25-kD cytosolic cap-binding protein that recognizes and binds to the 7-methylguanosine cap in the 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTR) of mRNAs during the initiation of protein translation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). eIF4E may be considered the rate-limiting component in translation initiation because it is found in much lower amounts than other translation factors and is activated via mitogenic stimuli (serum, phorbol esters, tumor necrosis factor a, and lipopolysaccharide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). Several complex 5'-UTR mRNAs involved in cell division, cell growth, and angiogenesis, are known to be selectively translated via eIF4E, including ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], c-Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], cyclin D1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and <italic>Tousled-like kinase </italic>1B (TLK1B) which mediates radioresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, fibroblast cells transfected with eIF4E develop a malignant phenotype, whereas treatments aimed at inhibiting the level or activity of eIF4E result in inhibition of tumorigenic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. eIF4E is overexpressed in malignant breast cancer tumor lines MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7, but not in non-tumor cells (MCF-10A) or epithelial cells from the milk of a nursing mother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. eIF4E protein expression is also elevated in a variety of human cancers including breast cancer but not in stroma or in benign tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, eIF4E expression is elevated during hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and at the invasive front in head and neck cancer and in invasive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Based on these observations, clinical studies have been conducted to determine the relationship between eIF4E overexpression (quantitated by western blot analysis) and clinical outcome. The results indicated that patients with high eIF4E had a statistically significant higher rate of cancer recurrence (n = 38, p = 0.03 log-rank test) and cancer-related death (n = 38, p = 0.04 log-rank test) compared to those with low eIF4E overexpression in a 40-month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These results were further supported in a prospective trial, in which patients with high eIF4E overexpression had a shorter disease-free survival (p = 0.004, log-rank test) and higher cancer-related deaths (p = 0.002) compared to those with low eIF4E overexpression. Furthermore, eIF4E protein expression correlated with increased VEGF levels and microvessel density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Significantly, eIF4E expression was independent of ER, PR, HER-2/neu, or node status as determined by Cox proportional hazard model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Fresh-frozen vs formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue</title><p>As mentioned above, high eIF4E overexpression has been associated with a worse clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, one of the limiting factors in that study was that it required western blot analysis of fresh-frozen tissue. Fresh-frozen tissue is typically scarce, especially in smaller tumors. Furthermore, in order to conduct a multi-institutional study to analyze enough samples for meaningful results, archived specimens will be essential. In addition, the use of paraffin-embedded archived samples would be useful for long-term follow-up. This will enable researchers and clinicians to establish eIF4E as a standard prognostic or diagnostic factor. Additionally, if eIF4E is determined to be a diagnostic factor, it may be used to personalize therapeutic care of the patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue Microarrays</title><p>Yang and colleagues recently reported that eIF4E levels were moderately correlated with VEGF and cyclin D1 in a breast cancer TMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This TMA was obtained from TARP <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/tarp/"/>. However, although complete histologic data was available for breast, only limited and incomplete clinical information was available. The goal of our present study was to validate our own in-house TMA's by comparing eIF4E expression with known downstream effector molecules, cyclin D1, c-Myc, VEGF, TLK1B, and ODC. We possess complete clinical information on each specimen, which will allow future TMAs to be constructed for further analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Tissue procurement for western blot analysis</title><p>Breast cancer specimens of at least 100 mg were obtained from the tumor core at the time of surgery from each patient per IRB approved protocol. The specimens were verified by the study pathologist to be invasive mammary carcinomas. The specimens were then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at minus 70&#x000b0;C for subsequent assay preparations.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of TMAs</title><p>The archived H&#x00026;E slides used for diagnosis were reviewed by the pathologist on the team for confirmation of diagnosis and selection of appropriate paraffin-embedded tissue blocks for the construction of TMAs. Slides with appropriate tissue of interest were selected and mapped to define representative areas for construction of the TMA blocks using a 1.5 mm punch size. In all, 3 TMA blocks were constructed.</p><p><italic>TMA block 1 </italic>consisted of the following specimens: 5 node positive breast ductal carcinoma, 3 node negative breast ductal carcinoma, 1 ductal carcinoma in-situ, and 1 benign breast tissue. The carcinomas (in-situ carcinoma and the invasive ductal carcinoma cases) were punched in triplicates and the patient-matched controls of corresponding benign breast tissues were punched in duplicates. For slide orientation and as additional tissue control, normal pancreas tissue (punched in duplicate) was also included in each TMA.</p><p><italic>TMA block 2 </italic>consisted of the following specimens: 6 node positive breast ductal carcinoma, 6 node negative breast ductal carcinoma, 2 ductal carcinoma in-situ with matched, 2 benign breast tissues as benign controls from the 2 the patients with ductal carcinoma in-situ, and 1 benign breast tissue from a breast reduction surgery. The invasive carcinomas were punched in triplicates. The in-situ carcinoma cases and the matched benign controls were punched in duplicates.</p><p><italic>TMA block 3 </italic>consisted of the following specimens: 38 invasive ductal carcinoma patients (40 cases punched but 2 had no tumor on the TMA), 3 patients with ductal carcinoma in-situ, and 3 normal breast tissues from breast reduction surgeries.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For the immunohistochemical analysis, 5 &#x003bc;m thick sections were cut, warmed to 60&#x000b0;C, de-paraffinized in xylene, and then rehydrated with graded ethanol. This step was followed by antigen exposure for 20 minutes in heated antigen retrieval solution and then the endogenous peroxide activity was inactivated by treating with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in methanol. The sections were blocked for 20 min in protein block (normal goat serum in PBS, BioGenex), and incubated with primary antibodies against ODC (Sigma #O1136, diluted 1:500); eIF4E (monoclonal, BD Transduction Laboratories, 1:600 dilution), c-Myc (Abcam, ab31426, 1:500 dilution), TLK1B (from De Benedetti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], 1:700 dilution), VEGF (Ab-3, JH121, NeoMarker-Labvision, 1:60 dilution), and cyclin D1 (Cell Signaling #2926, 1:100 dilution) for 1 h using an automated stainer (BioGenex I6000 Automated Staining System, San Ramon, CA). Samples were rinsed 5 times in washing buffer, and incubated in secondary antibody (MultiLink-BioGenex Super Sensitive Link-Label IHC Detection System) for 30 min. Samples were rinsed 3 times in wash buffer, and then incubated in horseradish peroxidase label (BioGenex) for 15 min. Samples were rinsed 3 times in wash buffer and then incubated in diaminobenzidine (Dako Cytomation Liquid DAB Substrate Chromogen System) for 5 min. Samples were rinsed 3 times in wash buffer and counterstained in hematoxylin (Dako Cytomation Automation Hematoxylin) for 2 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Western Blot</title><p>Specimens were analyzed for eIF4E and TLK1B as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Briefly protein lysates from each specimen (5&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;g protein) were separated using 12% denaturing gel Tris-HCL polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The proteins were then electroblotted on a nylon membrane (Immun-Blot PVDF, Bio-Rad Laboratory, Hercules, CA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The membranes were blocked in 3% nonfat milk overnight. Primary incubation of the membranes was carried out using a 1:1000 dilution of monoclonal mouse anti-eIF4E antibody (610270; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or rabbit anti-TLK1B antibody (1:1000 dilution, De Benedetti laboratory). Secondary incubation of the membrane was then carried out using a 1:5000 dilution of goat antimouse or anti-rabbit IgG tagged with horseradish peroxidase. The blot was developed using Opti-4CN substrate kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The blots were scanned using the Biophotonics system (Biophotonics Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). The band intensity was evaluated using the Intelligent Quantifier software (Bio Image, Ann Arbor, MI). The overexpression of eIF4E and TLK1B was quantified as x-fold over the samples of benign tissue from noncancer specimens run concurrently on the gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of TMAs</title><p>The first TMA (TMA1) was constructed to optimize antibody dilutions. The second TMA (TMA2) was designed with triplicate specimens to analyze intra-individual variability. In this regard, three separate plugs from each patient were taken from each original block and re-imbedded into TMA2. Replicate breast tumor specimens were analyzed for plug-to-plug reproducibility by staining the TMAs immunohistochemically and quantitating them using the ARIOL imaging system (described below). The third TMA (TMA3) was designed to compare eIF4E to its downstream effector proteins using a larger set of breast cancer specimens.</p></sec><sec><title>ARIOL Imaging</title><p>The ARIOL imaging system (Genetix, San Jose, CA) was used to quantify antibody staining of the TMAs. The specimens were scanned at a low resolution (1.25&#x000d7;) and high resolution (20&#x000d7;) using Olympus BX 61 microscope with an automated platform (Prior). The slides were loaded in the automated slide loader (Applied Imaging SL 50). The images with high resolution were used for training and quantification purpose. The system was trained to select the stained and unstained cells/nuclei by the color of staining and shape of nuclei such that brown staining was considered positive and blue staining was considered negative. The number of cells/nuclei stained was calculated and represented as percentage of total cells/nuclei stained positively. By measuring both immunostaining intensity and percentage, data obtained are reproducible, objective measurements of immunoreactivity. Because standardizing IHC, from the fixation of tissues to the analysis of IHC results is critical, all immunohistochemistry data were normalized to cytokeratin. To control for the variability in tumor cellularity from one patient to another, and to also control for variations in the number of tumor cells at different TMA spots (intra-tumoral variations), the number of epithelial (tumor) cells present at each TMA spot as highlighted by expression of cytokeratin 7, was used for normalization of each protein expression studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For each protein, a score was generated based on the area with and the intensity of the brown staining reaction. The scores were then exported to an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. A normalized value was calculated for each protein by dividing the recorded score for the protein by the recorded score for cytokeratin 7 at the corresponding spot.</p></sec><sec><title>ER, PR, HER-2/neu analysis</title><p>Immunohistochemical staining for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER-2/neu was performed using automated processing and staining technology (BenchMark XT IHC/ISH, Ventana). Processes included deparaffinization, pretreatment, antibody incubation, counterstaining, and coverslipping. Levels of membranous/cytoplasmic immunostaining for Her-2/neu, were scored using an automated cellular image analysis system (ACIS) (Clarient, San Juan Capistrano). Values less than 1.9 are interpreted as negative and values &#x02265; 2.0 are interpreted as positive for HER-2/neu over-expression. Nuclear ER and PR expression was assessed using the ACIS; both the quantitative intensity of expression and percentage of cells showing positive expression were noted.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Intra-individual coefficient of variations (CV) was calculated as ratio of standard deviation over mean &#x000d7; 100. The mean CV% and SD of CV for each marker was also added. The correlation among the expression levels of eIF4E, c-Myc, cyclin D1, ODC, TLK1B, VEGF, ER, PR, and HER-2/neu were calculated by the Spearman rank correlation method. These correlation coefficients were test against 0. All two-sided p-values &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The strength of correlation among the markers were classified as strong, moderate and weak for the correlation coefficient &#x0003e; 0.8, 0.4&#x02013;0.8, and &#x0003c; 0.4 respectively. The statistical software used for the current study was SAS 9.1.3. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Construction and analysis of TMAs</title><p>The first TMA was constructed in order to optimize the immunohistochemical staining techniques and to train the ARIOL imaging system. The criteria for successful staining included appropriate staining to the subcellular compartment, lack of staining in the absence of primary antibody, increase in staining when higher concentrations of primary antibodies were used, low staining in non-epithelial derived tissue (such as stroma or fat), and low staining in the negative controls (benign tissue). An example of the construction of TMA3 is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The ARIOL system first images the entire slide to show each plug. Higher resolution images can be made by zooming in on each plug. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, the ARIOL system can be trained to distinguish between cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. For example, ODC typically stains in the cytoplasm, leaving the counter-stained nuclei predominantly blue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The computational software can then scan and analyze each plug for positive staining.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Low magnification (100 &#x000d7;) of human breast cancer specimens in TMA3 stained immunohistochemically for ODC</bold>.

The intra-individual coefficients of variances (CV%) for eIF4E, c-Myc, cyclin D1, ODC, TLK1B and VEGF were used as a measure of plug-to-plug reproducibility (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

The downstream effector proteins c-Myc, cyclin D1, ODC, TLK-1B, and VEGF were positively correlated with eIF4E when analyzed by IHC. As shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], western blot analysis of eIF4E correlated with TLK1B protein expression. At the same time, eIF4E expression (determined by both western blot and TMA-IHC) did not correlate with ER, PR or HER-2/neu. Consistent with these results, the lack of correlation of eIF4E (detected by western blot) with ER, PR, and HER-2/neu was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our results confirm and extend the results previously described by Yang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In their study, which utilized a multi-tumor TMA from TARP <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/tarp/"/>, they found eIF4E, VEGF, and cyclin D1 were elevated in breast tumors compared to combined normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The authors also found that eIF4E levels were moderately correlated with VEGF and cyclin D1 expression in breast (Spearman's rank correlation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Among the major differences between the two studies: this study focused solely on breast cancer, and included validation of western blot <italic>and </italic>IHC analysis of the same samples. We also verified coefficients of variance to demonstrate plug-to-plug reproducibility. Furthermore, we examined a broader range of downstream proteins, and included more negative controls. Also, we used the ARIOL imaging system whereas they used ACIS. The strength of these two studies supports the idea that IHC can be used in a TMA format for evaluating critical oncogenic proteins.</p><p>In comparing western blot to IHC, there are advantages and disadvantages to both procedures. One advantage to western blot, traditionally, is that it has provided a greater dynamic range for quantitation than IHC. This is especially true, historically, as IHC has been semi-quantitative and subject to scoring methods. However, with the wider availability of IHC quantitation systems such as ARIOL, IHC has become more quantitative. This also provides potential standardization between different research institutions. The use of TMAs rather than individual IHCs for each specimen also provides institutions the ability to analyze a larger set of specimens at a time using similar staining and quantitation procedures. Another advantage to western blot, however, is that the molecular weights of the proteins can be estimated based on the molecular weight standards that are also resolved on the gel. This is particularly important if the antibodies exhibit non-specific staining. The protein of interest can be isolated from the non-specific staining and quantitated. The best way to overcome the problem of non-specific staining in IHC is to use the most specific antibodies available and to optimize the dilutions of antibodies and other staining conditions. Comparisons of positive and negative controls also help confirm specificity. One disadvantage to western blot is that unless specimens were prepared by isolation of specific cells through differential centrifugation or density gradients, they typically contain a heterogeneous mixture of cells (e.g., stromal component, adipocytes, epithelial cells, necrotic tissue, vascular tissue, etc.) and may not distinguish between the different compartments of the cell. With the ARIOL imaging system, different regions of tissue can be selected and quantitated, so as to avoid sections that contain non-regions of interest. Furthermore, ARIOL also possesses the training capability to select nuclear vs. cytoplasmic staining. Also, large amounts of precious tissue are required for western blots, which may not be readily available. TMAs or IHC require less sample, and archived specimens can be used for a longer follow-up period. An average of 30&#x02013;40 serial sections can be cut from one of our TMAs, such that multiple comparisons can be drawn among different proteins of interest. For these reasons, we believe that TMAs will provide a reasonable method for analyzing large numbers of specimens.</p><p>It has been shown that eIF4E is an independent prognostic factor in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We had selected tumor samples that showed a wide range of eIF4E protein expression by western blot which was significantly higher than the normal tissues. The TMA staining showed that 4E was elevated in breast tissues compared to the normal tissues. Over-expression of eIF4E leads to the translation of structured 5' UTR mRNAs which include c-Myc, cyclin D1, ODC, TLK1B and VEGF. These proteins have been studied individually in breast cancer patients. The results of the current study have shown that when eIF4E was elevated there was a corresponding rise in the protein expression of c-Myc, cyclin D1, ODC, TLK1B and VEGF. Thus eIF4E modulates the expression of the downstream effector proteins that regulate processes up regulated in cancer cells like the cell cycle, survival and cell growth. On the other hand, previous results using western blot analysis of eIF4E demonstrated that it did not correlate with node status, ER, PR, or HER-2/neu expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As a negative control for our current study, we also showed that IHC analysis of eIF4E on TMA3 also did not correlate with ER, PR, or HER-2/neu. Western blot analysis of eIF4E from the corresponding samples showed similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first time that a correlation has been made in a single study between eIF4E, c-Myc, cyclin D1, ODC, TLK1B and VEGF. Since the samples were obtained from a geographical area in which patients typically present with advanced stage breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], this study has shown the major oncoproteins that are upregulated in this population. The hospital also possesses the clinical information as well as the outcome of these patients. This study becomes more relevant when we can correlate the results from the TMA study to the clinical outcome as we follow up with these patients. In conclusion, eIF4E preferentially upregulates gene products that are involved in worse clinical outcome in breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and others. To study each downstream effector protein by western blot using fresh-frozen tissue is cumbersome and simply not feasible for many reasons, including long-term follow-up. There is an urgent need for clinicians to be able to examine a set of biomarkers such as eIF4E and downstream effector molecules in order to set a current standard for prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ER: estrogen receptor; eIF4E: eukaryotic initiation factor 4E; CV: intra-individual coefficients of variance; HER-2/neu: human epidermal growth factor receptor-2; IHC: immunohistochemical analysis; IOD: integrated optical density; ODC: ornithine decarboxylase; PR: progesterone receptor; TLK1B: tousled-like kinase 1B; TMA: tissue microarray; 5'-UTR: 5'-untranslated regions; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; WB: western blot.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>The ARIOL imaging and analyses were done by JT, MS, M L-N, and MU.
