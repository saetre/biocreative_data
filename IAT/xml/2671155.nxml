Both MSP3 and MSP6 share a common characteristic small N-terminal signature amino-acid stretch (NLRNA/G), a feature similar to MSP3-like orthologs identified in other human and primate malaria parasites.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Results</title><p>This signature amino-acid sequence led to the identification of eight ORFs contiguously located on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> chromosome 10. Our subsequent investigations on their expression, localization, sequence conservation, epitope sharing, immunogenicity and the functional role of antibodies in defense are reported here. Six members of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> MSP3-multigene family share similar sequence organization within their C-terminal regions, are simultaneously expressed as merozoite surface proteins and are highly conserved among parasite isolates. Each of these proteins is a target of naturally occurring antibodies effective at parasite killing in ADCI assays. Moreover, both naturally occurring antibodies and those generated by immunization display cross-reactivity with other members of the family and exhibit varied binding avidities.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The unusual characteristics of the MSP3 multi-gene family lead us to hypothesize that the simultaneous expression of targets eliciting cross-reactive antibody responses capable of controlling parasite densities could represent an immune process selected through evolution to maintain homeostasis between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and human hosts; a process that allows the continuous transmission of the parasite without killing the host. Our observations also have practical consequences for vaccine development by suggesting MSP3 vaccine efficacy might be improved when combined with the various C-terminus regions of the MSP3 family members to generate a wider range of antibodies acting and to increase vaccine immunogenicity in varied human genetic backgrounds.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Naturally acquired immunity against the asexual blood stages of human malaria is well-documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-McGregor1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. It is a state of immunity against malaria, whereby immune effector mechanisms maintain low densities of parasites and conversely chronic infection appears necessary for long-term maintenance of effective clinical protection. Hence it has been named &#x0201c;premunition&#x0201d; in order to reflect this incomplete effect and a delicately balanced equilibrium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Sergent1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Passive transfers of immune sera to patients have demonstrated that premunition is mediated by antibodies as IgG from clinically immune individuals can control parasite density and disease symptoms in recipients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Cohen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Sabchareon1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The same effect was obtained against parasites from different geographical settings suggesting conservation of the antigenic targets in different parasite strains.</p><p>A careful study of immune effectors against <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and of the protective versus non-protective antibodies in one such passive transfer experiment, led us to characterize the Antibody Dependent Cellular Inhibition of parasite multiplication (ADCI) as a major mechanism underlying premunition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Khusmith1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed we found that IgG from hyperimmune individuals inhibited <italic>P. falciparum</italic> growth <italic>in vitro</italic> in co-operation with blood monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-BouharounTayoun1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This ADCI effect, validated by a clinical experiment, thereafter served as a functional assay for the identification of the targets of protective IgG. A novel antigen, Merozoite Surface Protein 3 (MSP3) was identified in this manner by screening a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome-wide expression library using ADCI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Oeuvray1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to nearly all other malaria vaccine candidates, the MSP3 C-terminal half showed complete sequence conservation among &#x0003e;100 <italic>P.falciparum</italic> field isolates from different geographical regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Oeuvray1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The choice of MSP3 as a malaria vaccine candidate has been further supported by results from a series of immuno-clinical field studies, immunization of pre-clinical models and of volunteers in clinical trials, with assessment of functional anti-parasite activity. Seven studies in several field settings from Asia and Africa have shown that anti-MSP3 antibodies, particularly belonging to the IgG3 subclass, were strongly associated with acquired clinical protection against malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Roussilhon1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Osier1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. A human recombinant anti-MSP3 antibody was found able to achieve parasite killing in co-operation with monocytes at nanomolar concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Jafarshad1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

A phase-I MSP3 vaccine trial in 36 volunteers elicited antibodies in humans that mediated efficient killing of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Druilhe1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and further Phase Ib studies in African populations have confirmed the safety and immunogenicity of the formulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Sirima1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Lusingu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Subsequently, another Merozoite Surface Protein, called MSP6, was identified with significant sequence similarities with MSP3 within its conserved C-terminal region. Antigenic domains within the related C-terminal regions of MSP3 and MSP6 either shared near complete sequence identity and cross-reactivity or limited diversity with distinct antigenic properties both being targets of naturally occurring antibodies capable of mediating parasite killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Singh2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the C-terminal region of MSP6 is also highly conserved in different parasite isolates.</p><p>Both MSP3 and MSP6 sequences show a small stretch of amino-acids (NLRNA/G) immediately following their predicted N-terminal signal sequence, a feature shared by MSP3 orthologs identified from <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Galinski1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-David1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore used this small stretch of amino acids as &#x02018;signature sequence&#x02019; in the N-terminal region as a selection criterion and identified a series of open reading frames located on chromosome 10 sharing an organization of their C-terminal regions similar to that of MSP3.</p><p>In view of the vaccine potential of MSP3, particularly the encouraging results obtained in the clinical vaccine trials, we decided to investigate in detail the new members of this family with respect to their expression, localization, sequence conservation, epitope sharing, immunogenicity and functional role of antibodies in defense. Results shows that the MSP3-gene family differs from other <italic>P. falciparum</italic> multi-gene families described so far and suggest that the corresponding proteins play an important role in eliciting protective antibody responses in humans. Based on these results we formulate the hypothesis that the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> MSP3-family of proteins could have the role of ensuring both host and parasite survival leading to chronic infection without disease symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>The <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 genome database was searched using GenBank BLAST at NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Malaria/plasmodiumbl.html">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Malaria/plasmodiumbl.html</ext-link>).

Moreover, for several antigen-antibody combinations, the multiple slopes observed indicate a mix of antibody species with distinct binding avidities (an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005410-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The area under the curve (AUC) was used to estimate the overall binding avidity of these heterogeneous populations of naturally occurring antibodies for the different MSP3-family members.

All other <italic>P. falciparum</italic> family members have in each other, &#x02018;unique&#x02019; domains that are very different from one another.</p><p>The <italic>P. falciparum MSP3</italic>-multigene family differs from other known <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gene families expressed during the development of asexual blood stages. Members of the antigenic variation super gene families such as the <italic>var</italic>, <italic>rifin</italic> and <italic>stevor</italic>, which show multi-exon organization, are dispersed mostly in the recombinogenic subtelomeric regions of different chromosomes and, for the most part, display mutually exclusive gene expression patterns. In contrast, MSP3-family genes are structured as a single exon with a contiguous organization on the same chromosome and importantly, all are expressed simultaneously. The MSP3 multi-gene family also differs from other multi-gene families encoding for merozoite secretory organelle proteins such as the <italic>RBL</italic>, <italic>EBL</italic> and <italic>RAP</italic> that have multi-exon gene structure and exhibit considerable variability in gene expression, as well as redundancy in functionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Reed1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Duraisingh1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Though members of other gene families share a gene organization in common, throughout the family they are usually quite diverse in their amino-acid sequences and the resulting epitopes are generally not cross-reactive, except for the rare exceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Chattopadhyay1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, naturally occurring antibodies against the EGF-like domains of different MSPs are not cross-reactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Black1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Black2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, the C-terminal regions of the MSP3 family of proteins, while related in their overall organization, exhibit intergenic diversity, but also contain polypeptide sequences that generate shared or cross-reactive epitopes, which in contrast with other multi-gene families are highly conserved across parasite isolates.</p><p>Gene knockout approaches are currently considered as one means to determine the functional importance of a given gene in parasite biology. This was actually applied to several members of the MSP3-family :<italic>&#x00394;MSP3.1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Mills1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>&#x00394;MSP3.2</italic> (Mills &#x00026; Cowman, <italic>personal communication</italic>), <italic>&#x00394;MSP3.3</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;MSP3.7</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Pearce1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the individual gene disruptions caused little or no effect on the <italic>in vitro</italic> survival of mutant parasites. Perhaps one reason for these apparently paradoxical findings may lie in the fact that all genes of the MSP3 family are transcribed together with the corresponding proteins simultaneously expressed on the surface of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoites. Paralogous structures expressed by the remaining members of the MSP3 family could thus compensate for the loss of either one individually, providing the parasite with functional &#x0201c;spare-wheels&#x0201d;, whatever their as yet, undescribed biological function may be. On the other hand, these paralogs except for their C-terminal regions have radically different domain structures in the remainder of the proteins implying, perhaps, differing functional roles for each. The lack of an evident phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic> upon gene disruption may, alternatively, imply that a phenotype can only be revealed <italic>in vivo</italic> through host-parasite interactions, perhaps that involve the &#x02018;conserved&#x02019; C-terminal domains.</p><p>The related C-terminal regions from each member of the family were found to be targeted by antibodies that inhibit parasite growth in cooperation with monocytes, with a magnitude similar to the inhibition original found to be mediated by native antibodies recognizing the MSP3.1 protein. This broadens the scope of antigens involved in naturally acquired protection and indicates that vaccine constructs based on them would likely be valuable. Detailed analyses of MSP3.1, both on epidemiological and clinical grounds as well as in assays reflecting antibody mediated protection, led to the identification of three regions as targets for protective antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Singh1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The highest regions of homology were found within these related C-terminal parts of the MSP3 proteins, but the various MSP3 genes also showed substantial diversity in sequence from one gene to the other. The detailed antigenic analysis of the MSP3 family members showed that, despite differences among their primary amino-acid sequences, some epitopes and their antigenic properties are sufficiently conserved to generate cross-reactive antibodies. The extent of cross-reactivity is such that when an antibody response in humans is detected against one member of the family these same antibodies could have been elicited by any other member of the multi-gene family. This results in a large network of reactivities for each specific antibody across each of the members of the family; certainly with demonstrable variations in regards to avidity.</p><p>Polymorphism in malaria parasite genes generated by random mutations is a frequent characteristic of many genes coding for antigens. This polymorphism is thought to have emerged under selective immune pressure that frequently favors epitopic regions involved in protection. Therefore, polymorphism selected by immunity is considered a major bottleneck for vaccine development that can lead to strain-specific protection or immune evasion. This widely accepted notion differs markedly in the case of the MSP3 multi-gene family as in this instance the evolutionary drive responsible for sequence diversity cannot result from immune selection of random mutations. Whereas the N-terminal regions of these genes are highly divergent, the C-terminal portions display limited sequence diversity between strains and share high similarity in sequence and general structure as well as antigenic characteristics. In addition, the full sequence conservation of the C-terminal regions of each member of the MSP3 family among distinct isolates, resulting in a conservation of differences between genes, is striking and most unusual. We speculate that <italic>in vivo</italic> the C-terminal parts of the proteins function at the interface of the parasite with the immune responses of the host. The anti-parasite effect of antibodies against each C-terminal region together with the antigenic relatedness shared between all members, suggests a minimal selective advantage to random mutations, as antibodies generated against any one member could still cross-react to other non-mutated member and mediate parasite killing. In the context of a compromise between the immunized host and infecting parasite, the nearly full conservation of both the homology and diversity observed among the C-terminal regions of the MSP3 family of proteins lead us to raise two main hypotheses:</p><p>The first hypothesis is that this diversity generates a wider range of antibody specificities reactive with the related members of an antigenic network than would that of a single antigen. A wider range of diversity in affinity, avidity and fine-specificity in the antibody repertoire would result in reactivity to the wide range of original and related epitopes and lead to greater efficacy of the antibody mediated monocyte-dependent parasite killing.</p><p>The second hypothesis is that the differences in the sequence also provide T-helper cell epitope diversity, resulting in the induction of antibody responses in a wider range of human genetic backgrounds, each gene sequence being better fitted to a given MHC class-II subset. Hence, in this case, the conservation of the diversity could provide T-cell help leading to the generation of the same essential antibodies directed to the conserved cross-reactive B-cell epitopes in most individuals. The results obtained in a MSP3.1 vaccine trial are in support of this hypothesis as not all volunteers immunized with only one member of the family, MSP3.1, developed antibodies reactive with native parasite proteins, whereas in endemic areas most individuals develop antibodies to those main B-cell epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Roussilhon1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Singh1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Druilhe1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005410-Audran1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, as the first one concerns the regions of highest homology, the cross-reactive B-cell epitopes, and the second the regions of greatest divergence among the C-term regions, which were found to define T helper-cell epitopes in MSP3.1. In both cases, the results point to the production of anti-MSP3 cross-reactive antibodies that, by triggering ADCI, have the ability to substantially control parasite multiplication and in the process maintain low to moderate parasite densities in the human host. This conservation of diversity would also generate immune responses that can be thought of as ensuring the &#x0201c;objective&#x0201d; of successful parasites; survival of both the host and the parasite.</p><p>Our observations and findings enlarge the present perspectives on the function of merozoite surface antigens and have fundamental implications for the nature of the host-parasite interaction, as may pertain to maintaining homeostasis between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and human beings. There may also be practical consequences for vaccine development as our results suggest that an improved MSP3 vaccine should combine the other various C-terminus regions in the family in order to generate a wider range of antibodies reacting with each of the various MSP3 family antigens to improve the vaccine immunogenicity in humans across most genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec
