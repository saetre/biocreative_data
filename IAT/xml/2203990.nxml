Moreover, patients with chronic prostatitis have important alterations in several measures of semen quality and it has been proposed that prostatitis may contribute to male infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In spite of this, relatively little is known about innate immune defense mechanisms within the prostate gland. <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>is a pathogen frequently associated with both acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although bacteria have not been definitively shown to cause benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), a relatively common prostate disease, <italic>E. coli </italic>has been implicated in its pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has been speculated that chronic low-grade colonization with <italic>E. coli </italic>can cause prostate pathology via the release of endotoxin over a long period of time and this, in concert with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), can lead to hyperplasia of the prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For decades, it has been known that seminal plasma and prostatic fluid have antimicrobial properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recently, several agents responsible for this activity have been identified and characterized in the male reproductive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a member of the collectin family of proteins which play an important role in innate immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. SP-D can act as an opsonin to increase the phagocytosis of a variety of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. SP-D also promotes the phagocytosis of pathogens via direct interactions with macrophages and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast, SP-D can inhibit the uptake of some pathogens, for example <italic>Candida albicans </italic>and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Recently, SP-D has been shown to interact with the adaptive immune system by enhancing bacterial antigen presentation to dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Finally, SP-D can have direct anti-microbial effects by disrupting bacterial membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>SP-D was originally described in the lung, but recent studies have shown that SP-D is expressed throughout the body, usually at mucosal surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. For example, SP-D has been detected in the digestive tract as well as in the reproductive tract of the mouse, rat and human species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We have recently reported that SP-D is present in the human prostate and that SP-D protects prostate epithelial cells from infection by <italic>Chlamydia in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>SP-D is expressed constitutively in the lung and pulmonary SP-D levels can vary with infection or disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Lung SP-D levels are decreased in cystic fibrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In contrast, lung SP-D gene expression has been shown to be increased 24&#x02013;72 hours after intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Challenge with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, influenza virus, or the overexpression of cytokines such as interleukin-4 can also lead to elevated SP-D levels in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we found that SP-D mRNA and protein are expressed throughout the mouse male reproductive tract. We then showed that castration increases SP-D mRNA levels in the prostate. We also demonstrate that infection of the rat prostate with <italic>E. coli </italic>leads to an increase in SP-D protein levels in the prostate gland 24 to 48 hours post infection. These data are suggestive that SP-D produced in the prostate is regulated by androgens and influenced by infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Swiss Black mice were obtained from Taconic Laboratories (Hudson, NY) and bred at the Animal Research Facility at the University of Iowa following an approved protocol.

The animals were housed for 12 days after surgery to ensure that testosterone was completely cleared. All animals, i.e., sham-castrated and castrated, were then sacrificed and the prostate (ventral and dorsal) and lungs removed. In some cases the epididymis and bladder were removed as well. This experiment was repeated three times with 3 animals per condition (a total of 9 animals per group).</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial prostatitis model</title><p>We wished to determine if SP-D protein expression in the prostate is altered with infection. A prostatitis model, achieved via direct infection with <italic>E. coli</italic>, was used to address this question. We chose to perform these studies in the rat because of the greater size of the rat prostate, which enables easier manipulation, and because the rat prostatitis experimental model has been previously characterized. A strain of uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>(bacteria kindly provided by Dr. Pessah, Department of Microbiology, Cordoba University), isolated from patients with complicated urinary tract infection, was stored at -20&#x000b0;C and grown overnight in tryptic soy broth at 37&#x000b0;C when required for inoculations. Rats were anesthetized with inspired ether and subjected to laparotomy in order to expose the ventral prostate. Prostatitis was induced via injection of <italic>E. coli </italic>diluted in sterile PBS (200 &#x003bc;l total volume, 10<sup>8 </sup>colony forming units per mL) or with the same volume of sterile PBS as a sham-infected control, using a 30 gauge needle inserted directly beneath the capsule of both prostate ventral lobes. The muscle, peritoneum and skin were then closed using a simple continuous pattern with chromic suture material. Three rats were sacrificed at 24, 48, or 72 hours after bacterial inoculation. Control, sham-infected rats were sacrificed 24 and 72 hours post-operation. No morphological differences were observed in the prostates obtained at the different time points in the control groups. The rat prostatitis model is based on a protocol published by Fulmer <italic>et. al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] with modifications as described by Quintar <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This experiment was performed three times with 3 animals per group. Ventral prostates were either harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for light microscopy immunocytochemistry or frozen for biochemical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunostaining of reproductive tissues</title><p>Paraffin-embedded mouse reproductive tissues or rat prostate tissues were sectioned (7 &#x003bc;m thick), deparaffinized and rehydrated serially in 100%, 95%, 75%, and 50% ethanol. For antigen retrieval, the slides were boiled in 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 6.0, for 10 minutes and then cooled for 20 minutes. The slides were then rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and endogenous peroxidase activity quenched by incubating in 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in PBS for 30 minutes. Slides were rinsed with PBS and blocked by incubating in normal serum (1.5%) for 20 minutes. The slides were then incubated with a SP-D polyclonal primary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse SP-D, which cross-reacts with rat SP-D, Chemicon, Temecula, CA, 1:1000) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. For negative controls, slides were incubated overnight with either PBS or with normal rabbit IgG instead of the primary antibody. The slides were rinsed in PBS and incubated in secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to biotin, Cappel, Aurora, OH) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Slides were rinsed, incubated in Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) for one hour at room temperature, rinsed again in PBS and then incubated in diaminobenzidine (0.7 mg/mL), a peroxidase substrate. After a final PBS rinse followed by a H<sub>2</sub>O rinse, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted using Permount. As a positive control for the SP-D staining, adult mouse lung tissue sections were also immunostained using the SP-D antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p>Rat prostate tissues (3 animals for each condition; i.e., sham, 24 hr, 48 hr and 72 hr) were homogenized in 1 mM phenylmethyl-sufonyl fluoride, centrifuged at 600 &#x000d7; g and the supernatant collected. Protein content was determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of rat prostrate homogenate proteins (40 &#x003bc;g) were separated by gel electrophoresis on 15% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically at 100 V to nitrocellulose membranes and then placed in 7% non-fat dry milk diluted in 0.1% TNT (0.02 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight to block non-specific binding. The membranes were subsequently incubated with the rabbit anti-SP-D primary antibody (Chemicon) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 hour at room temperature, then washed in 0.1% TNT, three times, at 15 minutes per wash. The blots were incubated with a secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, 1:10,000 Cappel for 45 minutes at room temperature, then washed in 0.1% TNT, three times at 15 minutes per wash, and finally incubated with enhanced chemi-luminescence solution (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) followed by exposure to X-ray film. Densitometry was then performed on the immunoreactive bands using Scion Image Software (Frederick, MD).</p></sec><sec><title>Real time RT-PCR analysis</title><p>RNA was extracted from the male reproductive tract organs of 5&#x02013;6 mice and also from the prostate and lung tissues of 9 castrated and 9 sham-castrated mice by homogenizing the tissues in Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was extracted using chloroform and precipitated with ice-cold isopropanol. The resulting total RNA pellet was resuspended in water and quantitated by determining the absorbance at 260 nm. Two &#x003bc;g of total RNA from each sample were then reversed transcribed. The resulting cDNAs were diluted (1/50) and replicates for each sample were aliquoted for real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using a Stratogene Mx 3000 P instrument. FAM-labeled primers for mouse SP-D and 18 S ribosomal RNA (the transcriptional product of a housekeeping gene) and Universal Taqman master mix were purchased from Applied Biosystems, Inc. (ABI, Foster City, CA). As a control, the threshold cycle (CT) values obtained from adding increasing amounts of RNA with either SP-D primers or 18 S primers were plotted. The two primer sets produced parallel curves with similar slopes. SP-D mRNA levels were normalized to 18 S rRNA levels and then the relative SP-D mRNA levels were determined by the comparative quantitation method, according to the manufacturer User Bulletin 2 (10/2001, ABI systems). For experiments in which the levels of SP-D mRNA in different mouse male reproductive organs were compared, the levels were expressed relative to the average level of SP-D mRNA in the prostate, which was made equal to one. For experiments in which levels of SP-D were compared in prostate and lung tissue from intact vs. castrated mice, SP-D mRNA levels are expressed relative to levels in intact tissues from sham-castrated control mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>All data were derived from at least three experiments.

More recently, several investigators have demonstrated the importance of the innate immune system in the reproductive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In the male urogenital system, investigations about innate immunity have focused particularly on the epididymis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In contrast, local defense mechanisms protecting the prostate gland are poorly understood.</p><p>SP-D has been proposed as a central player in innate host defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Therefore, we were interested in investigating the presence of SP-D in the murine reproductive tract. In this study, we show that SP-D mRNA and protein are expressed in several organs in the mouse male genital tract, including in the prostate. SP-D is localized to the epithelium of the prostate, epididymis, vas deferens, testes, and is also detected in interstitial cells of the testis. The seminal vesicle was the only male reproductive tract organ that did not contain significant amounts of SP-D. The relative level of SP-D mRNA detected in the male reproductive tract is much lower, ~2,000 fold less, than observed in the lung. However, since the proportion of epithelium in the male reproductive tract organs is substantially less than in the lung, local concentrations of SP-D on the mucosal surfaces of the male reproductive tract may not be as low as the real time RT-PCR data indicate. Because of the lack of SP-D expression in seminal vesicles, which are the major contributors to seminal plasma, it is possible that prostate-secreted SP-D may be an important antimicrobial factor that accompanies spermatozoa in semen.</p><p>Several authors have previously shown that SP-D protein levels can be increased by infection. For instance, SP-D protein was increased in human gastric mucosa during infection with <italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. <italic>Pneumocystis carinii </italic>infection has also been shown to increase SP-D levels in the mouse lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Serum levels of SP-D were increased in mice with acute and chromic inflammation of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. We choose to study the influence of infection using a rat model of prostatitis because the rat prostate is a larger size, which allows for easier manipulation when compared to the mouse prostate (Quintar <italic>et al</italic>., 2006). The ventral prostate of the mouse and rat are anatomically and functionally similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The gross morphology of the prostate glands is essentially identical in the two species, although the rat prostate gland is larger and more complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The morphogenesis of the prostate gland in the two species is also very similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Both the mouse and rat prostates are used as animal models for studying prostatitis and prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In the present study, we demonstrate that <italic>E. coli </italic>infection stimulates SP-D protein production in the rat prostate epithelium. Prostate SP-D protein levels were significantly increased early in the prostate infection, i.e., 24 hours and 48 hours post-infection. However, by 72 hours post-infection, SP-D levels in the infected rat prostate epithelium had declined. This pattern of expression was expected since components of the innate immune system are often the first responders to infection.</p><p>Cytokines have previously been shown to regulate SP-D expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We have recently reported that increased levels of SP-D were correlated with inflammation in the human prostate gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the rat prostatitis model used in the current study, we observed a striking increase in neutrophils within the gland by 48 hours post-infection, which corresponded to the peak of SP-D expression. Since SP-D has anti-inflammatory properties, we hypothesize that SP-D may increase at sites of inflammation in part to dampen the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, SP-D levels could also have been stimulated directly by the presence of a pathogen and this in turn may cause the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection. LPS instillation in the lung has shown to produce an increase in the expression of SP-D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, increased SP-D expression in the rat prostate might have been induced by <italic>E. coli </italic>LPS. Since SP-D agglutinates bacteria, promotes phagocytosis and in some cases has direct anti-microbial affects on certain strains of <italic>E. coli</italic>, it may be beneficial for the host to increase expression of SP-D soon after an infection has begun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Consequently, SP-D modulation within the prostate gland may be a key mechanism to guarantee effective clearing of microorganisms, in this way preventing the progression of infection toward more restricted sites of the male reproductive tract such as the epididymis and the testis. Interestingly, we detected immunoreactive SP-D protein in neutrophils present in the ducts of the infected prostate. Other investigators have shown that SP-D is taken up by neutrophils during inflammation in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>Androgen withdrawal leads to involution of the prostate gland with alterations that include a decrease in secretion and loss of epithelial cells by apoptosis. In the present study, we found that castrated mice have increased SP-D mRNA in their prostates. Interestingly, castration of the male mouse did not change SP-D mRNA levels in the lung or in other tissues in the male reproductive tract of the mouse. Although hormonal regulation of SP-D by growth hormone has been previously reported, this is the first study to suggest that SP-D can be regulated by androgens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In a recent paper by Sorensen <italic>et al</italic>., it was shown that SP-D levels in serum increase with age in humans and that SP-D levels are higher in males than in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. These data are consistent with the concept that hormones may play a role in regulating SP-D levels. It is well established that glucocorticoids stimulate SP-D mRNA expression in the lung; however, the mechanism involved is not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It is also known that glucocorticoids increase the expression of glucocorticoid receptor, whereas androgens decrease glucocorticoid receptor levels in the lung, ovaries, prostate and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that androgens may regulate prostate SP-D expression indirectly through the glucocorticoid receptor pathway.</p><p>SP-D appears to be particularly important in apoptotic cell removal from the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Thus, it is conceivable that the increased SP-D levels in the prostate after castration may be involved in removal of the increased apoptotic cells that follow testosterone deprivation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we detected SP-D mRNA and protein throughout the mouse male genital tract, including in the prostate. We determined that SP-D expression in the prostate is increased in castrated male mice. We also demonstrated that prostate SP-D gene expression increases in response to infection. These data are the first to suggest a role for SP-D in prostatic innate immunity <italic>in vivo </italic>and the first to show that prostatic SP-D may be regulated by androgens, findings that may lead to a better understanding of innate immunity in the prostate gland.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors of this manuscript contributed to the paper by conducting the research directly, writing portions of the manuscript, or contributing to the ideas behind the different projects involved in this manuscript.
