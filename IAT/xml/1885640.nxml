Since the subcellular localization of MMR proteins is essential for proper MMR function, we characterized possible nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in hEXO1. Using fluorescent fusion proteins, we show that the sequence <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup>, which exhibit strong homology to other monopartite NLS sequences, is responsible for correct nuclear localization of hEXO1. This NLS sequence is located in a region that is also required for hEXO1 interaction with hMLH1 and we show that defective nuclear localization of hEXO1 mutant proteins could be rescued by hMLH1 or hMSH2. Both hEXO1 and hMLH1 form complexes with the nuclear import factors importin <bold>&#x003b2;</bold>/<bold>&#x003b1;</bold>1,3,7 whereas hMSH2 specifically recognizes importin <bold>&#x003b2;</bold>/<bold>&#x003b1;</bold>3. Taken together, we infer that hEXO1, hMLH1 and hMSH2 form complexes and are imported to the nucleus together, and that redundant NLS import signals in the proteins may safeguard nuclear import and thereby MMR activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although initial recognition steps of DNA mismatch repair (MMR), carried out by the hMSH2-hMSH6 (hMutS&#x003b1;), hMSH2-hMSH3 (hMutS&#x003b2;) and hMLH1-hPMS2 (hMutL&#x003b1;) complexes, have been relatively well studied, the nature of the downstream steps is less characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). One of these downstream steps is the exonucleolytic removal of the DNA strand containing the mispaired nucleotide by one or more exonucleases. So far only a single exonuclease&#x02014;human exonuclease 1 (hEXO1)&#x02014;has been identified in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Due to endonucleolytic activity of hMLH1 and 5&#x02032;-exonuclease activity of hEXO1 bidirectional MMR can occur in the presence of a single exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). The coordinated activity between proteins in the MMR pathway is supported by the findings that specific interactions exist between hEXO1 and hMutS&#x003b1;, hMutS&#x003b2; as well as hMutL&#x003b1;; and that these interactions control enzymatic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13">3&#x02013;13</xref>). However, whether they are also important for subcellular localization of the MMR proteins remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) patients are characterized by defects in the MMR system. In the majority of the patients, mutations are located in one of the four MMR genes participating in the MutLS complexes&#x02014;<italic>hMLH1, hMSH2, hPMS2</italic>, and <italic>hMSH6&#x02014;</italic>with <italic>hMLH1</italic> and <italic>hMSH2</italic> accounting for the majority of the disease-causing mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In the so-called atypical HNPCC families that fulfill some but not all of the Amsterdam criteria only a small proportion of individuals exhibit mutations in any of the four MMR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Germline variants of <italic>hEXO1</italic> have been detected in some patients with atypical HNPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Exo1</italic> mutant mice are characterized by reduced survival, increased susceptibility towards development of lymphomas and increased mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The phenotype of <italic>Exo1</italic> mutant cells is comparable to <italic>MSH6</italic> mutant cells and mutations in the human homolog of this gene have been identified at a high incidence in patients with atypical HNPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20">18&#x02013;20</xref>). It is, therefore, possible that a similar pathology may explain the relation between <italic>hEXO1</italic> mutations and HNPCC development, resulting in late onset of disease, deviating tumor spectrum and/or incomplete penetrance. Polymorphisms in the <italic>hEXO1</italic> gene may also have relevance for the development of sporadic cancers. Destabilization of MMR complex formation and the resulting onset of cancer will depend on the combination as well as the nature of <italic>hEXO1</italic> and other MMR gene variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Two splice variants <italic>hEXO1a</italic> (<italic>HEX1</italic>) and <italic>hEXO1b</italic> have been identified and the transcripts give rise to proteins with predicted molecular weights of 89 and 94&#x02009;kDa, respectively. For the hEXO1 protein to participate in MMR it needs to enter the nucleus. Molecules smaller than &#x0223c;60&#x02009;kDa can passively diffuse through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) into the nucleus, whereas import of larger molecules requires specific nuclear localization signals (NLSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The classical nuclear translocation pathway is mediated by the importin &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; protein complex. The initial cytoplasmic event is the binding of karyophilic protein, via its NLS, to importin &#x003b1; subunit of the heterodimeric receptor. The importin &#x003b2; subunit mediates docking to the NPC followed by translocation into the nucleus by association of importin &#x003b2; with Ran that triggers dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Presently, no definite NLS consensus sequence has been determined, although NLS sequences are frequently composed of basic amino acids and may be classified as either mono- or bipartite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). It has recently been demonstrated that complex formation between MMR proteins is crucial for nuclear import of some of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>) but it is not clear if complex formation between hEXO1 and hMSH2/hMLH1 influences the subcellular localization of the proteins involved. The hMLH1, hPMS2, hPMS1, hMSH3 and hMSH6 proteins but not hMSH2 contain potential NLS sequences and some of them also contain nuclear export sequences (NESs), which enable them to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>The importance of correct subcellular translocation of MMR proteins is highlighted by the fact that defects in nucleocytoplasmic import of repair protein could confer a MMR-deficient phenotype. Along these lines, a significant number of HNPCC mutant proteins show no apparent biochemical defects but cells containing these proteins are nevertheless MMR deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). One explanation for this phenotype could be that these HNPCC mutant proteins show imperfect subcellular location. In order to investigate the mechanism underlying nucleocytoplasmic import of MMR proteins, we characterized possible NLS targeting signals in <italic>hEXO1</italic>. Using fluorescent fusion proteins, we show that the sequence <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> is responsible for correct nuclear localization of hEXO1.</p><p>So far, only one importin &#x003b2; isoform has been identified whereas six human importin &#x003b1;s (importin &#x003b1;1,3,4,5,6,7) have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). These importin &#x003b1;s seem to be expressed ubiquitously with little tissue-specific variation. They can be grouped into three subfamilies based on sequence homology where importin &#x003b1;1 belongs to subfamily 1, importin &#x003b1;3 to subfamily 2 and importin &#x003b1;7 to subfamily 3. It has been shown that the individual importin &#x003b1;s are able to import the same target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and that two competing substrates can change the import capacity of importin &#x003b1;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Therefore, we found it important to identify the individual importin &#x003b1;s that are responsible for nuclear import of the MMR proteins hMSH2, hMLH1 and hEXO1. We show that both hEXO1 and hMLH1 are able to form complex with importin &#x003b1;1,3,7 whereas hMSH2 specifically recognizes importin &#x003b1;3. Examination of the hEXO1 NLS mutant proteins showed that these mutant proteins were able to form complex with importin &#x003b1;3 despite its cytoplasmic localization and that defective nuclear localization of the NLS mutant proteins could be alleviated by co-expression with either hMLH1 or hMSH2. These results suggest a complex and strictly controlled mechanism for translocation of MMR proteins from cytoplasm to the nucleus. Furthermore, our results suggest a possible mechanism for tissue- or cell-type-specific discrimination of nuclear translocation of MMR proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Plasmid pLJR115 expressing an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal tagged YFP-hEXO1b fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) was used as a template to construct a series of YFP-hEXO1 mutant proteins.

Mutations in hEXO1b were introduced using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The DNA sequences of the entire coding region of hEXO1b in the resulting constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (ABI-Prism&#x000ae; BigDye&#x02122; Terminator Cycle sequencing, Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotide primers (Supplementary data Table 1) used for site-directed mutagenesis were purchased from Invitrogen.

The diffuse nuclear staining is observed in non-S-phase cells as judged by the absence of PCNA foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, data not shown). </p><p>None of the examined amino acid changes in the putative NLS sequences <sup>290</sup>PIKRKLI<sup>296</sup> and <sup>775</sup>KRKH<sup>778</sup> (292KR&#x00394;G and 772KR&#x00394;G) had any effect on nuclear localization of the hEXO1 mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels 2 and 3). In contrast, when the <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> sequence was mutated, three of the mutant proteins were localized in cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels 5&#x02013;10), showing that this region is necessary for correct nuclear localization of hEXO1. It is well documented that the first lysine in the proposed consensus NLS sequence K(K/R)X(K/R) is critical for importin-&#x003b1;-mediated nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34 B35">32&#x02013;35</xref>), and substitution of the basic lysine residue to alanine, threonine or asparagine completely blocks the nuclear import of the specific protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Consistent with these observations, we find that substitutions K418T and K418A in hEXO1 resulted in cytoplasmic localization of the mutant proteins. The same defect in nuclear localization was observed when we changed the basic arginine residue at position 419 of hEXO1 to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel 8). Along these lines, we observed normal nuclear localization and formation of nuclear foci, when we changed the proline at position 420 to alanine (P420A) as well as arginine to alanine at position 421 (R421A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels 9 and 10).</p><p>The <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> sequence of hEXO1 shows similarity with both mono- and bipartite NLS sequences. Bipartite NLS would require a basic cluster of amino acids 10&#x02013;12 amino acids upstream or downstream of the <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> sequence. There is no indication of such a cluster upstream, but a basic cluster <sup>440</sup>KKTKK<sup>444</sup> is located 21 amino acids downstream of the <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> sequence. To determine if the proposed hEXO1 NLS sequence <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> is mono- or bipartite, we changed a single residue upstream (K413T) as well as downstream (K440T) of this sequence. None of the mutations had any effect on nuclear localization of the mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels 4 and 11) demonstrating that the <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> sequence is a monopartite NLS sequence of hEXO1.</p></sec><sec><title>Human MMR proteins recognize specific nuclear import factors</title><p>In order to characterize the basic molecular mechanism underlying import of MMR proteins into the nucleus, we examined which of the importin &#x003b1;s that were able to form a complex with the repair proteins. Using a pull-down assay we show that both hEXO1 and hMLH1, which contain classical NLS sequences, are able to form complexes with importin &#x003b1;s from all three subfamilies (&#x003b1;1,3,7) as well as with importin &#x003b2; alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and C). In contrast, we could not detect any complex formation between hMSH2 and importin &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;7 or &#x003b2;. The MSH2 protein, which does not contain any classical NLS sequences, only formed complex with importin &#x003b1;3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). </p><p>We also used the pull-down assay to clarify if the cytoplasmic localization of the hEXO1 NLS mutant proteins is due to the inability of these proteins to form complexes with the importin &#x003b1;s. We found that the cytoplasmic hEXO1(K418A) NLS mutant protein formed complexes with all importin &#x003b1;s tested as well as with importin &#x003b2; similar to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). This result suggests that the cytoplasmic localization of hEXO1 NLS mutant proteins is not caused by a deficiency of these proteins to recognize the nuclear import factors.</p></sec><sec><title>hEXO1 enhance nuclear foci formations of hMLH1 and hMSH2</title><p>It has been shown that complex formation between hMLH1 and hPMS2/hPMS1 is essential for correct nuclear translocation of the PMS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> results suggest that hEXO1 forms ternary complexes with both hMLH1-hPMS2 and hMSH2-hMSH6 via direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction between hEXO1-hMLH1 and hEXO1-hMSH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). These complex formations are critical for MMR activity, but it is not clear whether they play roles in subcellular localization of the MMR complexes. To investigate if hMSH2 and hMLH1 influence subcellular localization of hEXO1, we examined cells co-transfected with CFP-hMSH2 and YFP-hEXO1 as well as CFP-hMLH1 and YFP-hEXO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels 17 and 18). As shown earlier two different patterns were observed in cells transfected with YFP-hEXO1 (i) distinct nuclear foci or a (ii) diffuse nuclear staining (13, data not shown; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, we did not observe any discrete nuclear punctuates in cells transfected solely with CFP-hMLH1 or CFP-hMSH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels 15 and 16). When cells were co-transfected with either YFP-hEXO1 and CFP-hMSH2 or YFP-hEXO1 and CFP-hMLH1, the formation of nuclear foci was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>); indicating that complex formation between hEXO1 and hMLH1 or hMSH2 affects the distribution of the MMR protein in nucleus. The hEXO1 protein is not critical for nuclear import of hMLH1 and hMSH2. However, since NIH-3T3 cells express MMR proteins and it has been shown that murine homologs can form complexes with the human proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) it is possible that the endogenously expressed MMR proteins in NIH-3T3 cells could affect the distribution of hEXO1. Therefore, we expressed YFP-hEXO1 in the human cell lines HeLa (MMR proficient), HCT116 (deficient in hMLH1) as well as in HCT116&#x02009;+&#x02009;chromosome 3 (proficient in hMLH1). We observe the same localization pattern as in NIH-3T3 cells for all cell lines tested (data not shown). </p><p>To address whether the presence of hMLH1 and hMSH2 in the nucleus promotes the localization of hEXO1 in foci, we repeated the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (panels 17 and 18) using the NLS-deficient hEXO1(K418A) as well as the NLS-proficient hEXO1(K413T) proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The hEXO1(K418A) mutant protein is unable to localize to nucleus as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (panel 6) and, therefore, we did not expect enhanced nuclear foci formation in cells co-expressing YFP-hEXO1(K418A) with either CFP-hMLH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel 20; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) or CFP-hMSH2 (data not shown; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, in contrast to cells transfected with YFP-hEXO1(K418A) alone, a significant portion of this fusion protein was however visible in the nucleus and co-localized with CFP-hMLH1 in discrete nuclear punctuates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel 20; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The same subcellular localization pattern was observed when YFP-hEXO1(K418A) was co-transfected with CFP-hMSH2 although the nuclear foci formation was more pronounced for the CFP-hMLH1 co-transfections (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that the NLS-defective YFP-hEXO1(K418A) mutant proteins only translocated to the nucleus when hMSH2 or hMLH1 formed nuclear foci. In cells showing diffuse nuclear staining of hMSH2 or hMLH1, the hEXO1(K418A) mutant protein remained in cytoplasm (data not shown). Furthermore, we did not observe any hEXO1-N (hEXO1 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal YFP-fusion protein that does not contain the NLS as well as the hMLH1-interacting domain and which localizes to cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>)) in nucleus when this fusion protein was co-expressed with CFP-hMLH1 (data not shown). It has been shown earlier that hEXO1 does not interact with hPMS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). We also found that in cells co-expressing YFP-hEXO1(K418A) and CFP-hPMS2 the NLS-defective hEXO1 mutant protein localized in cytoplasm (data not shown). Our results suggest that the NLS-defective hEXO1 mutant proteins are able to form complexes with hMSH2 and hMLH1 but not hPMS2.</p><p>The hEXO1 NLS sequence is located in the domain required for interaction with hMLH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), thus we further investigated the ability of the hEXO1(K418A) protein to form complex with hMLH1 and hMSH2 in the <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assay. We show that hEXO1(K418A) can form a complex with both hMLH1 as well as hMSH2 in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). These results suggest that either (i) hMSH2 and hMLH1 are able to co-translocate hEXO1(K418A) into nucleus in the lack of a functional hEXO1 NLS sequence or that (ii) YFP-hEXO1(K418A) fusion protein is quickly exported to cytoplasm if is it is not in complex with hMLH1 or hMSH2. A third (iii) possibility would be that the complex formation between hEXO1(K418A) and importin &#x003b1; is less efficient than the similar protein&#x02013;protein interaction between the importin &#x003b1; and the wild-type hEXO1 proteins resulting in cytoplasmic retention of the hEXO1(K418A) mutant protein. In order to test the third possibility, we performed a pull-down assay where we labeled either hEXO1(K418A) or hEXO1 and incubated these proteins with importin &#x003b1;3/&#x003b2; complex. To compare complex formations between importin &#x003b1;3/&#x003b2; and hEXO1(K418A) or hEXO1, we added increasing amounts of unlabeled IVTT-hEXO1 or purified hEXO1 to compete for binding with the labeled proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, Supplementary data Figure 4B) or included the competitor during (rather than after) complex formation (Supplementary data Figure 4A). We did not find any major difference in complex formation between importin &#x003b1;3/&#x003b2; and the hEXO1 proteins suggesting that the hEXO1 NLS mutant proteins do not have lower affinity for the nuclear import factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization of HEX1(hEXO1a)</title><p>The <italic>hEXO1</italic> gene generates two splice variants, <italic>HEX1</italic> (<italic>hEXO1a</italic>) and <italic>hEXO1b</italic>, which encode polypeptides of 803 and 846 amino acids, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Both isoforms contain the exonucleolytic domain and so far no biological or biochemical differences between the two proteins have been reported. We have shown earlier that the COOH-terminal region of hEXO1 is essential for correct nuclear localization as well as for the co-localization of hEXO1b with PCNA during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the two different hEXO1 splice variants differ in subcellular localization pattern. The short splice variant of the human exonuclease 1, HEX1 (hEXO1a), differs from hEXO1b by lacking the last 43 COOH-terminal amino acids. Since subcellular localization of HEX1 and co-localization with PCNA have not been addressed earlier, we examined if there were any differences in the subcellular localization of HEX1 and hEXO1b. Results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> demonstrate that like hEXO1b the subcellular localization of HEX1 is restricted to the nucleus and that HEX1 co-localizes with PCNA. Moreover, we infer that both splice variants of hEXO1 may be involved in processes where interactions with PCNA are required, i.e. DNA replication and/or MMR. Although the COOH-terminal part of hEXO1b is crucial for subcellular localization, the 43 COOH-terminal amino acids have no influence on the subcellular localization of hEXO1. </p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization and protein complex formation of hEXO1 variant proteins</title><p>Deficiency in MMR can be a result of both defective protein&#x02013;protein interaction (complex formation) and defective subcellular localization of MMR proteins. In order to characterize variants of the <italic>hEXO1</italic> gene, we included two variants, V27A and L410R, which have been identified only in HNPCC patients, and could therefore represent pathogenic mutations. The remaining R354H, T439M, K589G, G670E and P757L variants, were identified with same frequency in patients and control individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and may be considered as naturally occurring polymorphisms, although the hEXO1 genotypes T439M and P757 have been shown to be correlated with development of colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). None of the amino acids substituted in the hEXO1 variants are located in the putative NLS sequences. However, L410R is located in the vicinity of the functional NLS sequence <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> and T439M near the basic <sup>440</sup>KKTKK<sup>444</sup> cluster located 21 amino acids downstream of the <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> sequence. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the localization of YFP-hEXO1 variant proteins is restricted to the nucleus and resembles the pattern observed for wild-type YFP-hEXO1.</p><p>We have shown earlier that hEXO1 can form ternary complexes with both hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b1; and that these protein&#x02013;protein interactions control both the biochemical activity of the proteins as well as the subcellular localization of the exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In order to investigate if the hEXO1 variants act differently regarding complex formation with other MMR proteins, we investigated the ability of the variants to interact with hMSH2, hMLH1 as well as hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Our results show that all HEX1 variant proteins interact with GST-hMLH1 as well as with GST-hMSH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). Furthermore, the variants HEX1-L410R and HEX1-T439M interact with hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b1; suggesting that these proteins can form ternary complexes with hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b1; like the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and data not shown). Under the experimental conditions employed, the GST-MMR proteins, which are bound to the beads, are saturated with the first added protein (hMSH6 or hPMS2) before the second protein (hEXO1) is added to the reaction mixture. However, it cannot be completely excluded that some of the pre-incubated protein may dissociate and become exchanged with the second protein. In conclusion, our results indicate that if the described HEX1 variants are pathogenic this can neither be explained by defective hMLH1 or hMSH2 protein interaction nor abnormal subcellular localization. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this article, we examined the nuclear translocation of hEXO1. These types of studies are important for (i) understanding the basic molecular mechanisms underlying MMR as well as for (ii) identification of the multiple ways by which the MMR pathway can be inactivated. The latter may have implications for diagnosis of HNPCC.</p><p>As a first step to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying subcellular movements of MMR proteins, we investigated the function of three putative NLS sequences <sup>290</sup>PIKRKLI<sup>296</sup>, <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> and <sup>775</sup>KRKH<sup>778</sup> in hEXO1. None of these are located in the N and I regions required for exonuclease activity, but they are conserved among hEXO1 proteins of higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) suggesting a biological role of these sequences. Mutations in critical residues of the <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> sequence in hEXO1 resulted in loss of nuclear translocation&#x02014;in particular residues K418 and R419 are essential for nuclear targeting. These lysine and arginine residues are included in a consensus NLS sequence that presumably binds to importin &#x003b1;s 1, 3 and 7. At least two types of NLS sequences have been identified namely the mono- and bipartite NLS. The basic <sup>440</sup>KKTKK<sup>444</sup> cluster located 21 amino acids downstream of the <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> sequence, could be part of a major binding site. This would imply that the K418 residue takes part in a minor binding site of the bipartite NLS sequence. However, mutations in the minor binding site of a bipartite sequence generally do not have great impact on protein translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Furthermore, the distance between the putative major and minor binding site in hEXO1 is larger than the expected 10&#x02013;12 amino acids and the K440T mutant protein localizes similar to wild-type hEXO1. Taken together our results show that the <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> sequence is a monopartite NLS sequence.</p><p>The hMSH2 protein does not contain classical NLS sequences (data not shown) and, therefore, it is possible that this MMR protein translocates into the nucleus in complex with other proteins similar to hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>). The fact that hMSH2 does not contain a classical NLS is surprising since this MMR protein localizes to the nucleus when overexpressed as a CFP-hMSH2 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and it forms a complex with nuclear import factors importin &#x003b1;3/&#x003b2; <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, our results show that unlike hEXO1 and hMLH1, which both recognize several importin &#x003b1;s, hMSH2 specifically forms a complex with importin &#x003b1;3. In order to identify the sequence responsible for nuclear translocation of hMSH2, we identified two mutations P622L and C697F in hMSH2 that result in cytoplasmic localization of the proteins (A. L&#x000fc;tzen <italic>et al</italic>., submitted for publication). However, when these mutant proteins were tested in the pull-down assay for interaction with importin &#x003b1;3/&#x003b2;, they formed complexes with the nuclear import factors similar to the wild-type protein (Supplementary data Figure 2). These results suggest that the mechanisms underlying nuclear import of the individual MMR proteins are different, which could play an important biological role in regulation of MMR activity.</p><p>Protein&#x02013;protein interactions between hEXO1, PCNA, RPA, RFC and hMutS&#x003b1; and hMutL&#x003b1; are important for regulation of overall repair activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). However, it is unclear if these protein&#x02013;protein interactions are also important for subcellular localization of the MMR proteins. We therefore addressed whether the co-expression of hEXO1 and hMLH1 or hMSH2 would alter the subcellular distribution of these proteins. A clear increase in the formation of nuclear foci was observed upon co-transfection indicating that complex formation facilitates proper localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This was even observed with the hEXO1(K418A) mutant protein, which alone is unable to localize to nucleus. It was further demonstrated that hEXO1(K418A) forms complex with hMLH1 and hMSH2. We measured co-localization of PCNA with hEXO1 as well as PCNA with hMLH1 (data not shown) and we did not detect any increase in the percentage of S-phase cells suggesting that co-expression of hEXO1 and hMLH1 does not stimulate cell proliferation. We have shown earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) that not all foci represent replication foci and, therefore, we cannot conclude that the punctuate staining observed in this work represents replication factories. Examples of a similar piggy-back mechanism where NLS-dysfunctional proteins can be translocated to the nucleus through complex formation with proteins containing functional NLS sequences are known from other repair proteins such as for the KU70/80 kinase and MRN (hMRE11-hRAD50-NBS1) complexes, which are involved in double-stranded break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Taken together the results support the idea that hEXO1, hMLH1 and hMSH2 form complexes, which under certain conditions are imported together and that redundant NLS import signals in the proteins may safeguard import and MMR activity.</p><p>Mutations located outside the NLS sequence could alter the protein conformation in a way that makes the NLS sequence inaccessible to importin binding. Therefore, we found it relevant to examine sequence variations in the <italic>hEXO1</italic> gene from cancer patients in or near the <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup> sequence and determine the subcellular localization of these mutant proteins. Our results show that all hEXO1 variant proteins examined localized to the nucleus similar to the wild-type protein. The L410R variation in particular has been found in atypical HNPCC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The mutant is translocated to the nucleus similar to wild-type hEXO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), but it is defective in exonuclease activity despite the fact that the mutation is located within the hEXO1-hMLH1-binding domain and does not seem to have any effect on complex formation between these two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that the hEXO1-L410R mutant protein could act as a potential dominant negative resulting in defective MMR activity in individuals carrying this allele.</p><p>Finally, our results demonstrate no functional difference between HEX1 and hEXO1b with respect to subcellular localization and co-localization with PCNA. It can therefore be concluded that the 43 COOH-terminal amino acids are not involved in nuclear localization signaling. The HEX1 protein is capable of interacting with both hMLH1 and hMSH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) and it has been established that HEX1 is capable of forming a ternary complex with hMutL&#x003b1; and hMutS&#x003b1; (data not shown; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), as demonstrated to apply for hEXO1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The results presented demonstrate that all six HEX1 mutants V27A, R354H, L410R, T439M, K589E and G670E are able to interact with both hMLH1 and hMSH2 and in addition, that amino acid substitutions L410R and T439M do not interfere with the ability of HEX1 to participate in ternary complex formation with hMutL&#x003b1; or hMutS&#x003b1;.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified the sequence <sup>418</sup>KRPR<sup>421</sup>, which exhibit strong homology to other monopartite NLS sequences to be responsible for correct nuclear localization of hEXO1. We have shown that hEXO1 and hMLH1 are recognized by nuclear import factors importin &#x003b1;1,3,7/&#x003b2; whereas hMSH2 is specifically recognized by importin &#x003b1;3/&#x003b2;. These results suggest differences in the mechanisms underlying nuclear translocation of MMR proteins. We also showed that co-expression of hEXO1 NLS mutant proteins with either hMLH1 or hMSH2 restored nuclear localization of hEXO1 NLS mutant proteins. Our results suggest that hEXO1, hMLH1 and hMSH2 form complexes, which are imported to the nucleus together. However, complex formations between these MMR proteins are not essential for nuclear translocation implying that redundant NLS import signals in the proteins may ensure nuclear import and thereby MMR activity. It can be speculated that repair proteins that either lack a functional NLS or do not contain sequences that bind importin &#x003b1;&#x003b2; form complexes in the cytoplasm before nuclear import. Such mechanism would safeguard nuclear import of proteins since karyophilic proteins would increase nuclear localization upon complex formation, instead of individually competing for interaction with the NPC. Therefore, it would be interesting to examine if complex formation between MMR proteins in cytoplasm plays a similar role in subcellular localization. However, it is not clear whether the piggy-back translocation we observed acts as a backup mechanism or if it is essential for the regulation of MMR activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. But the importance of complex formation between MMR proteins has been illustrated by the finding that some single amino acid substitutions in both hMLH1 and hMSH2 found in HNPCC patients disrupt complex formations and show defective nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>; A. L&#x000fc;tzen <italic>et al</italic>., submitted for publication). None of the hMLH1 mutations were located near its functional NLS sequence. Several MMR proteins interact with proteins involved in other repair pathways. Therefore, it could be speculated that proteins involved in other repair systems could be involved in the translocation of MMR proteins, thus, linking nuclear translocation of repair systems.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary data is available at NAR online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to Drs K&#x000f6;hler and Sekimoto for gifting plasmids.
