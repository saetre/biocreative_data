The mutant larvae accumulate high levels of non-neddylated Cul1, suggesting that Int6 is a positive regulator of cullin neddylation. Overexpression in <italic>Int6</italic> in cell culture leads to accumulation of neddylated cullins, further supporting a positive role for Int6 in regulating neddylation.

The CSN has been shown to regulate ubiquitination via the Cullin-Ring ubiquitin Ligases (CRLs). The CSN removes the Nedd8 modification from the cullin subunit of the CRL, resulting both in inactivation of the CRL as a ubiquitin ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002239-Schwechheimer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002239-Cope1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and in stabilization of the cullin subunit in some organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002239-He1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002239-Gusmaroli1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

To elucidate the roles of Int6 in the context of a multi-cellular organism, we analyzed two mutants in <italic>Drosophila Int6</italic>, demonstrating it to be an essential gene for both organism and cell viability. While we did not detect any disruption in CSN assembly or function in <italic>Int6</italic> mutants, we found a decrease in neddylation of both Cul1 and Cul3 in the absence of Int6. Our findings also suggest that Int6 is essential for the degradation of cullin substrates. Consistently, overexpression of Int6 in cell culture resulted in elevated neddylation of these two cullins. We thus show here a novel role for Int6 as a positive regulator of cullin neddylation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> maintenance and hybrid dysgenesis</title><p>Strains were maintained and crosses were conducted on standard cornmeal-molasses medium at 25&#x000b0;C.

The CSN has been shown to de-neddylate cullins, thereby regulating degradation of their substrates by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We show here, for the first time, that Int6 takes part in the regulation of this process by promoting neddylation of Cul1 and Cul3. This was clearly shown in each of the two different <italic>Int6</italic> mutants, which provide internal repeats for all experiments.

Although the mechanism by which Int6 regulates cullin neddylation is as yet to be established, it likely does not involve direct interaction of Int6 with Cullins as we could find no evidence for such an interaction by immunoprecipitation (not shown). This novel role of Int6 might shed some more light on the roles Int6 plays in cancer development. As we show here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002239-g003">Figures 3</xref>), the absence of Int6 results in reduced cullin neddylation, as well as in the accumulation of CSN5. The levels of CSN5 are also increased in the absence of Cul3 in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002239-Gusmaroli1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002239-g003">Figure 3</xref>), which may suggest it to be a substrate of Cul3 in both organisms. We therefore propose that Int6 regulates the degradation of at least certain cullin substrates via regulation of cullin neddylation. The abrogated degradation of various cullin substrates in the absence of Int6 may play a key role in the development of cancer. To test this hypothesis, the levels of <italic>bona fide</italic> CRL substrates should be examined in <italic>Int6</italic> mutants. In addition, over-expression of a C-terminally truncated version of Int6 was shown to result in tumorigenic transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002239-Mayeur1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002239-Mack1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. It will therefore be interesting to examine the effect of over-expression of this truncated Int6 on neddylation of Cul1 and Cul3.</p><p>It should be noted that there are several differences between Cul1 and Cul3 with respect to regulation of their neddylation by Int6. The reduced neddylation of Cul1 leads to high accumulation of non-neddylated Cul1 in both <italic>Int6</italic> mutants and is rescued by a mutation in <italic>csn5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002239-g002">Figure 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002239-g003">3</xref>). However, reduced neddylation of Cul3 is detected later than that of Cul1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002239-g003">Figure 3</xref>), and therefore non-neddylated Cul3 does not accumulate prior to the larvae death. In addition, the reduced neddylation of Cul3 is not rescued by a <italic>csn5</italic> mutation. Consistently, unlike Cul1, neddylation of Cul3 is promoted in cell culture only in the presence of high levels of over-expressed Int6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002239-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We also found a difference in deneddylation of Cul1 and Cul3 by CSN5, since deneddylation of Cul1 is decreased earlier than that of Cul3 in <italic>csn5<sup>null</sup></italic> mutants. These differences may imply that the regulation of neddylation of Cul1 and Cul3 is not identical. It is possible that neddylation of Cul3 is regulated by other factors, in addition to Int6 and CSN5, and therefore the effect of the latter two on the status of Cul3 neddylation is smaller than their effect on Cul1.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Int6 is not essential for proteasome function in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Int6 regulates the function of the proteasome by promoting the entry of the proteasome regulatory subunit Rpn5 into the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002239-Yen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.
