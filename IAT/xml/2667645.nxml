Import of the precursor proteins into chloroplasts is mediated by the protein translocon complex, composed of the Toc (translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts) and Tic (translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts) proteins and stromal chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Inaba and Schnell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Soll and Schleiff, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Chloroplasts have a complicated structure with three membrane systems: the outer and inner membranes of the envelope, and the thylakoid membrane. Correct and efficient insertion of chloroplast membrane proteins into these membranes is essential for chloroplast biogenesis. There are many studies analyzing protein insertion into the outer envelope and the thylakoid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Hofmann and Theg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Jarvis and Robinson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Tu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), but only a limited number of studies have addressed the molecular mechanism of insertion of protein into the inner envelope membrane.</p><p>The chloroplast inner envelope membrane contains many important proteins, including metabolite transporters, protein translocon components and enzymes for lipid biosynthesis. Targeting and insertion for only a few of these inner-membrane proteins have been studied. The transit peptide of phosphate translocator (PHT) has been shown to function as a stroma-targeting signal, with an inner-membrane insertion signal contained within the N-terminal hydrophobic region of the mature protein. No soluble targeting intermediate has been observed, suggesting that PHT probably directly diffuses laterally into the inner membrane from the inner-membrane protein-translocation channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Brink <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Knight and Gray, 1995</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to PHT, Tic40 and Tic110 have been shown to follow a &#x02018;post-import&#x02019; pathway, in which they are first imported into the stroma, producing soluble intermediates, which then insert into the inner membrane from the stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Li and Schnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">L&#x000fc;beck <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Tic110, the major Tic protein identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kessler and Blobel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">L&#x000fc;beck <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), most likely functions as the stroma-side receptor for transit peptides and the scaffold for translocation of precursors across the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Inaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2005</xref>). Tic40 is a co-chaperone that coordinates Tic110 and the stromal chaperone Hsp93 during protein translocation across the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Chou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The transit peptide of Tic40 is processed in two steps. The first part of the transit peptide is cleaved in the stroma to produce the stromal intermediate iTic40, which is intermediate in size between the precursor and the mature protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Li and Schnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Tripp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The second part of the transit peptide is cleaved during or after the reinsertion. However, the signal for reinsertion is contained within the N-terminal serine/proline-rich region of the mature protein, not in the second part of the transit peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Li and Schnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Tripp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The transit peptide of Tic110 is processed only once, and therefore the stromal intermediate is the same size as the mature protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Li and Schnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">L&#x000fc;beck <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). It is not clear how these stromal intermediates are inserted into the inner membrane. It has been shown that proteinaceous components of the inner membrane, but not those of the stroma, are required for the reinsertion, and that exogenous ATP and GTP are not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Li and Schnell, 2006</xref>). However, another report has shown that ATP is required and has also suggested that stromal Hsp93 may be involved in the reinsertion of Tic110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Vojta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Reinsertion of Tic110 from the stroma seems to be defective in transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing a C-terminal fragment of Tic110 (Tic110C), because more stromal Tic110 accumulated in the Tic110C overexpressing plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Inaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Recently, we have shown that Tic40 interacts with the C-terminal portion of Tic110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Chou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that part of the effect of Tic110C overexpression may be due to high levels of Tic110C interfering with the function of Tic40. In this paper we investigate the possible involvement of Tic40 in inner-membrane-protein reinsertion by studying the reinsertion in <italic>tic40</italic>-null mutant chloroplasts. Our data suggest that Tic40 is important for the reinsertion of Tic40 and Tic110 from the stroma. In addition, in the light of additional analyses of the import of Tic21 and PHT, we suggest that multiple pathways exist for insertion of chloroplast inner-membrane proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Larger amounts of in vitro imported soluble iTic40 and Tic110N accumulated in tic40-mutant chloroplasts</title><p>To investigate if Tic40 was involved in the reinsertion of Tic40 and Tic110, [<sup>35</sup>S]-prTic40 and [<sup>35</sup>S]-tpTic110-Tic110N (identical to tp110-110N in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">L&#x000fc;beck <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>) were imported into chloroplasts isolated from <italic>tic40-1</italic>, a <italic>tic40</italic>-null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and from wild-type seedlings. The import of precursors of the stromal RuBP carboxylase small subunit (prRBCS) and the thylakoid chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> binding protein (prCAB) served as controls. tpTic110-Tic110N is a pea Tic110 precursor truncate consisting of only the first 269 residues of the 997-residue full-length precursor. tpTic110-Tic110N contains all the information required for correct targeting and insertion into the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">L&#x000fc;beck <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Because of its smaller size its import efficiency is higher, and the two forms (before and after removal of the transit peptide) are easier to distinguish on gels.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>, less mature CAB and RBCS were imported into <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1a</xref>, lane 2), confirming the general nature of the <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplast defect in protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). When chloroplasts were hypotonically lysed in 0.2 <sc>m</sc> NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Li and Schnell, 2006</xref>) and separated into soluble and membrane fractions by centrifugation, mature CAB was found exclusively in the membrane fraction and most of the mature RBCS was in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>More <italic>in vitro</italic> imported iTic40 and Tic110N accumulated in the soluble fraction of <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplasts.</p><p>(a, c) [<sup>35</sup>S]-prCAB, prRBCS, prTic40 and tpTic110-Tic110N were imported into wild-type (WT) and <italic>tic40</italic>-null mutant chloroplasts for 20 min.

The ratio of soluble to membrane-inserted iTic40 and Tic110N was greatly increased in <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1b</xref>). This result suggested that the <italic>tic40</italic> mutation resulted in the accumulation of soluble iTic40 and Tic110N.

Since iTic40 is thought to be the pathway intermediate for Tic40 reinsertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Li and Schnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Tripp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), only iTic40 was quantified.</p><p>Alkaline extraction is a more stringent test of membrane insertion than high-salt wash, and has also been used to separate the soluble intermediate from the membrane-inserted Tic40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Tripp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). To reveal the true extent of reduction of iTic40 and Tic110N insertion by <italic>tic40</italic>, we performed the same import experiments but separated the membrane from the soluble fractions by alkaline extraction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1(c)</xref>, a small amount of mature CAB was released to the soluble fraction by alkaline extraction and could therefore be quantified. The ratio of soluble to membrane-bound CAB was similar in the mutant and in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1d</xref>), indicating that <italic>tic40</italic> mutation did not affect insertion of CAB into the thylakoid. In comparison, a much greater amount of soluble iTic40 and Tic110N was again observed in the <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplasts.

Chloroplasts were re-isolated after import of [<sup>35</sup>S]-prTic40 and [<sup>35</sup>S]-tpTic110-Tic110N, treated with an increasing concentration of trypsin, lysed in 0.2 <sc>m</sc> NaCl and the soluble fraction was then collected by centrifugation. As trypsin can only penetrate the outer membrane and not the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Jackson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), we were able to distinguish whether the soluble iTic40 and Tic110N were outside the inner membrane or in the stroma. As a control, Toc75, an integral outer-membrane protein from the membrane fraction, was also analyzed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2(a,b)</xref>, Toc75 was nearly completely degraded by the trypsin treatment. In contrast, both iTic40 and Tic110N in the soluble fraction were resistant to trypsin digestion, indicating that they were localized in the stroma of <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplasts. Similar results were obtained when the soluble fraction was collected by alkaline extraction and centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2c,d</xref>), indicating that soluble iTic40 and Tic110N released by alkaline extraction were also located in the stroma.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><italic>In vitro</italic> imported iTic40 and Tic110N accumulated in the stroma of <italic>tic4</italic>0-mutant chloroplasts.</p><p>[<sup>35</sup>S]-prTic40 and [<sup>35</sup>S]-tpTic110-Tic110N were imported into <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplasts for 20 min.

It is also possible that, in the absence of Tic40, some intermediates could not be properly transferred to the reinsertion machinery and thus accumulated in the stroma. To investigate these possibilities, we tested whether the iTic40 and Tic110 that accumulated in the stroma of <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplasts were still competent in inserting into the inner membrane. We analyzed the accumulation kinetics of stromal iTic40 in wild-type and <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplasts using a two-step import reaction consisting of a pre-import step and a chase step. In the pre-import step, [<sup>35</sup>S]-prTic40 was incubated with isolated chloroplasts for 2 min under normal import conditions with 3 m<sc>m</sc> ATP. Chloroplasts at this stage should contain active early import intermediates of various stages <italic>en route</italic> to their final destination. Due to the slower import rate and low import efficiency of Arabidopsis chloroplasts compared with pea chloroplasts, we found that this condition was more effective in accumulating greater amounts of active import intermediates than arresting import at the binding stage using low (&#x0003c;100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) ATP (data not shown). After the 2-min pre-import, chloroplasts were washed and resuspended in import buffer with 3 m<sc>m</sc> ATP to initiate the chase. At each time point during the chase, a proportion of the chloroplasts were withdrawn and treated with thermolysin to remove surface-bound non-imported molecules. Intact chloroplasts were re-isolated and separated into membrane and supernatant fractions by alkaline extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3a</xref>). Alkaline extraction was used because it is better at revealing truly membrane-inserted protein, and it released a greater quantity of soluble intermediates which made detection easier. To facilitate direct comparison, the amount of membrane-inserted mature Tic40 at the end of the 20-min chase in the wild type was set as 100%. In wild-type chloroplasts, the amount of stromal iTic40 was only about 5% of this level at the beginning of the chase and decreased rapidly thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3c</xref>, filled circles). On the other hand, the membrane-inserted Tic40 increased from 36% to 98% during the first 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3b</xref>, filled circles). These results indicated that reinsertion under normal conditions was an extremely rapid process, and in most experiments, stromal intermediate could not be observed by our method of stopping the import.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Accumulation kinetics of membrane-inserted Tic40 and soluble iTic40 in wild-type (WT) and <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplasts.</p><p>(a) [<sup>35</sup>S]-prTic40 was pre-imported into WT and <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplasts for 2 min, re-isolated and then chased for the length of time indicated.

A larger quantity of soluble intermediates of these proteins was detected during <italic>in vitro</italic> import assays using isolated <italic>tic40</italic>-mutant chloroplasts. In comparison, PHT appeared to insert into the inner membrane through a Tic40-independent pathway. No soluble PHT was detected, which is consistent with a previous suggestion that PHT inserts into the inner membrane through a stop-transfer pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Brink <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Knight and Gray, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>).</p><p>In mitochondria, inner-membrane protein insertion has been shown to occur through at least three pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>). First, carrier proteins with internal targeting signals insert into the inner membrane through the Tim22 complex by lateral diffusion. Second, some pre-sequence-containing inner-membrane proteins diffuse laterally into the inner membrane through the Tim23 complex. Third, other pre-sequence-containing inner-membrane proteins go through the conservative sorting, or post-import, pathway. They are first fully translocated into the matrix through the Tim23 complex, and then reinsert into the inner membrane from the matrix. Proline residues in the transmembrane domain seem to be the determinant for pathway selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Meier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Proline residues are present in the transmembrane domains of most inner-membrane proteins that go through the conservative sorting pathway, but are almost entirely absent in transmembrane domains of proteins that go through the stop-transfer pathway. Accordingly, insertion or deletion of proline residues causes switching of the sorting pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Meier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>A serine/proline-rich domain located at the N-terminal portion, in front of the transmembrane domain of mature Arabidopsis Tic40, has been shown to be required for stromal reinsertion of Tic40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Tripp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). A serine/proline-rich-like domain was also observed in the same region of pea Tic110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Tripp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). We therefore analyzed the region in front of the first transmembrane domain of Tic40, Tic110, Tic21 and PHT from four representative species (pea or red clover, Arabidopsis, rice and one plant from the Solanaceae family). Because Tic21 seems to insert as the intermediate form iTic21, but the cleavage site that produces iTic21 is still not known, the transit peptide of prTic21 was also included. Accumulation and replication of chloroplasts 6 (ARC6), which has been suggested to use a stop-transfer pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Tripp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), was also analyzed. This protein is a tail-anchored protein, so the region around the transmembrane domain at the C-terminus of the protein was analyzed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7</xref>, conserved proline residues in front of the first transmembrane domain are present in the Tic40 and Tic110 analyzed but are absent in PHT and ARC6. Serines are usually, but not always, present in the vicinity of these conserved proline residues. Because deletion of a segment containing these proline residues in Arabidopsis Ti40 resulted in accumulation of Tic40 in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Tripp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), we hypothesize that these proline residues may be important for recognition by the sorting/reinsertion machinery in the stroma. The conserved proline residues in iTic21 do not immediately precede the transmembrane domain but are found around the transit-peptide processing site. This may be the reason why the transit peptide of prTic21 is initially only partly processed &#x02013; so that the conserved proline residues in iTic21 are available for recognition by the sorting/reinsertion machinery. Further experiments are required to verify the importance of these proline residues in inner-membrane reinsertion.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Conserved proline residues are present in Tic40, Tic110 and iTic21 but not in phosphate translocator (PHT) and accumulation and replication of chloroplasts 6 (ARC6).</p><p>Sequence alignment of the N-terminal portion of prTic21 and mature Tic40, Tic110 and PHT, and the C-terminal portion of ARC6.

Two previous studies have investigated possible components required for reinsertion. Using inside-out inner-membrane vesicles, it has been shown that proteinaceous components at the inner membrane, but not stromal proteins or exogenous nucleoside triphosphate, are required for the reinsertion of Tic40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Li and Schnell, 2006</xref>). However, another report has suggested that ATP hydrolysis and the stromal chaperone Hsp93 are required for Tic110 reinsertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Vojta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). It is possible that Tic40 and Tic110 have different energy requirements for their reinsertion. It would be interesting to analyze whether more soluble Tic110 and iTic40 accumulate in the stroma of <italic>hsp93</italic>-mutant chloroplasts.</p><p>It is most likely that Tic40 plays an accessory role to other central components of the reinsertion machinery since its absence slows down but does not block the reinsertion. Tic40 has been shown to function as a co-chaperone that coordinates Tic110 and Hsp93 during translocation of precursor across the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bedard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">2006</xref>). In this study, we showed that Tic40 is also involved in the reinsertion of inner-membrane proteins from the stroma. It is possible that Tic40 is a member of two different complexes, the Tic complex and an unidentified reinsertion complex. If a separate complex for reinsertion does exist, results from previous studies suggest that Hsp93 and Tic110 are also likely to be components of such a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Li and Schnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Vojta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). It is also possible that the complex formed by Tic40/Tic110/Hsp93 plays a dual role: in the general translocation of precursor proteins into the stroma, and in the reinsertion of inner-membrane proteins from the stroma. Furthermore, it is likely that Tic110 plays a more central role than Tic40, since endogenous Tic110 accumulated in the stroma of Tic110C-overexpressing plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Inaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) suggesting that insertion of some Tic110 was fully blocked. In the <italic>tic40</italic> mutant we could only detect accumulation of soluble intermediates from newly <italic>in vitro</italic> imported proteins but not a consistent accumulation of endogenous Tic110 or Tic40 (data not shown). This suggests that, although at a slower rate, most imported Tic110, Tic40 and Tic21 was eventually inserted into the inner membrane. Further experiments are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism of inner-membrane protein reinsertion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Plant materials, growth conditions and chloroplast isolation</title><p>Arabidopsis plants (Ws ecotype) were grown on MS synthetic agar medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Murashige and Skoog, 1962</xref>) with 2% sucrose as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), except that plants were grown for 21&#x02013;24 days.
