The <italic>mce4A </italic>(Rv3499c) gene within this operon is homologous to <italic>mce1A </italic>(Rv0169), that has a role in host cell invasion by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Our earlier reports show that <italic>mce4 </italic>operon is expressed during the stationary phase of growth of the bacillus in culture and during the course of infection in mammalian hosts. <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>carrying mutation in <italic>mce4 </italic>operon shows growth defect and reduced survival in infected mice. However, the intracellular localization of Mce4A protein and its direct role in cell entry or survival of the bacillus has not been demonstrated so far.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>By transmission electron microscopy we have demonstrated that recombinant Mce4A protein facilitates the invasion of non-pathogenic strain of <italic>E. coli </italic>into non-phagocytic HeLa cells. We observe that <italic>mce4A </italic>gene has a role comparable to <italic>mce1A </italic>in the survival of recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>in human macrophages. Using antibodies raised against Mce4A protein, we show that the protein is localized in the cell wall fraction of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv stationary phase culture only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Mce4A protein is expressed during the stationary phase of broth culture and localizes in the cell wall fraction of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Mce4A protein expressed in non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli </italic>enables it to enter and survive within HeLa cells and the macrophages. As Mce4A protein is expressed during later phase of mycobacterial growth, our results raise the possibility of it playing a role in maintenance of persistent tubercular infection.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The World Health Organization has estimated that nearly one-third of the world's population is now latently infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>and 8&#x02013;10 million people develop active disease resulting in 2 million deaths each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of this infection is largely due to the extended dormancy of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>in the host and its ability to cause disease even in the face of a highly orchestrated host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p><italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>is believed to primarily invade and replicate within alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It has the ability to enter A549 cells of alveolar epithelial origin in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and also invade other non-phagocytic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Role of Mce1A protein in the entry and survival of the pathogen is demonstrated using recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>carrying cloned copy of the gene as well as latex microspheres coated with recombinant Mce1A protein, both of which were able to enter HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>expressing Mce1A can survive longer in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The continued analysis of the four <italic>mce </italic>operons of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv genome has shown significant conservation of the protein sequences in the four operons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The redundancy of these operons is explained by functional significance of the different <italic>mce </italic>operons of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv by various studies including ours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Earlier we reported the expression of <italic>mce4 </italic>and absence of <italic>mce1 </italic>transcripts in the specific tissues of both infected rabbits and guinea pigs during advanced disease conditions, which suggested that <italic>mce4 </italic>operon, may have a role in the long term survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>in host's tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The survival mechanism of dormant tubercle bacilli is still under intense research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is suggested that mycobacterial persistence may rise as a response to environmental stress, such as reduced oxygen concentration within a host tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It is demonstrated that deletion mutants of <italic>mce3 </italic>and <italic>mce4 </italic>operons of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv are attenuated in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. By deleting eight genes and the first 250 bp of the ninth gene from <italic>mce4 </italic>operon it was shown that survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>was significantly reduced in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, direct involvement of individual proteins from <italic>mce4 </italic>operon in the survival or uptake of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>into the mammalian cells was not demonstrated.</p><p>In the present study we validate the role of Mce4A protein of <italic>mce4 </italic>operon not only in cell invasion but also in survival of the pathogen in human macrophages using recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>expressing cloned <italic>mce4A </italic>gene.

In case of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, Mce1A protein of <italic>mce1 </italic>operon was the first protein of the pathogen to be implicated in invasion and survival inside macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although Mce2A protein of <italic>mce2 </italic>operon exhibits 67% amino acid identity with Mce1A, latex beads coated with Mce2A are not internalized by HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the present study we have demonstrated that recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>expressing Mce4A protein can enter non-phagocytic HeLa cells. Further, Mce4A protein also enables the recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>to survive inside THP-1 macrophages. The estimation of CFU demonstrates that the rate of intracellular survival of recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>expressing <italic>mce4A </italic>was comparable to that of <italic>mce1A </italic>indicating thereby that <italic>mce4A </italic>may have a role similar to <italic>mce1A </italic>in invasion and survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>inside the host cells.</p><p>Molecular modeling studies using bioinformatics tools have shown that cell entry epitope is exposed on the surface of Mce1A, Mce3A and Mce4A proteins but not on the Mce2A protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This suggests that the cell entry epitope of Mce1A, Mce3A and Mce4A, but not of Mce2A, may be available for interaction with mammalian cells. Subsequently a report appeared confirming the role of Mce3A and Mce3E in mammalian cell entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The recently emerging reports on the role of <italic>mce4 </italic>operon in survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>in host tissue indicates that Mce4 proteins may be involved in maintaining the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>in a nutrient deficient environment for long term survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It has been suggested that the proteins of the <italic>mce4 </italic>operon may operate as a major cholesterol import system of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>because strains lacking <italic>mce4 </italic>operon exhibit drastically reduced ability to take up and metabolize cholesterol <italic>in vitro </italic>and hence grow poorly when cholesterol is the primary source of carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It was reported earlier that mutation in <italic>mce1 </italic>operon produces growth defect in early phase of infection in mice and mutation in <italic>mce4 </italic>operon produces growth defect after 3&#x02013;4 weeks post infection, indicating thereby that <italic>mce4 </italic>operon is required in later phase of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The localization study showed that the Mce4A protein was present in the cell wall fraction of the stationary phase culture of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv further strengthening our results of transmission electron microscopy and cell invasion studies.</p><p>We conclude that the results of the present study strongly support the role of Mce4A protein in invasion and the intracellular survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and suggest that it may have a role in persistence of mycobacterial infection in the host tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There are many studies reported in the literature to elucidate dormancy in <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and the survival mechanism of dormant tubercle bacilli is not fully understood. It is suggested that mycobacterial persistence might arise as a response to environmental stress, such as reduced oxygen concentration within host tissue. Our earlier observation of preferential expression of <italic>mce4 </italic>operon in the internal organs of rabbit and guinea pig and also during the stationary phase in culture in conjunction with the results presented here strongly support a role for Mce4A protein in the long term survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>inside its host.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MB conceived the study.
