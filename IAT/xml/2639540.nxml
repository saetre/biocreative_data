MNPs originate as monoblasts in the bone marrow, reside as monocytes (MOs) in blood and become, e.g., tissue macrophages (M&#x003d5;s) or dendritic cells (DCs) upon extravasation into tissues. The innate immune system is presumably involved when biological response modifiers (BRMs) are utilized in the treatment of diseases such as cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and lymphangiomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Killed bacterial toxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] along with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], &#x003b2;-glucan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], interferons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and monoclonal antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] are examples of BRMs used in cancer treatment.</p><p>Japan has a long standing tradition in using penicillin-killed lyophilized <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, denominated OK-432 or picibanil, as a biological response modifier (BRM) for treatment of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sakamoto <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] published in 2001 a meta-analysis showing a 20% 5-year survival improvement with immunochemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy alone, following OK-432 treatment in patients diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer. This meta-analysis was based on 1,520 patients enrolled in 11 randomized clinical phase III trials. Furthermore, Oba et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] published in 2007 a meta-analysis including 8009 gastric carcinoma patients from 8 randomized clinical phase III trials and concluded that compared to control conditions, addition of OK-432 treatment increased survival. There are also reports suggesting that patients with other cancers, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], may benefit from OK-432 treatment. OK-432 has also been used as a maturation factor for DCs cells as part of vaccination therapy of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Lymphangiomas are benign neoplasias of lymphatic origin, often congenital, that may extend around vital structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Surgical removal of lymphangiomas has been the standard treatment, but may be technically difficult. Injection of OK-432 into cystic lymphangioma lesions may lead to shrinkage and subsequent cure as first reported by Ogita [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Today, injection with OK-432 is established as a major treatment option for lymphangiomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and is an important example of the use of BRMs in medicine.</p><p>OK-432 presumably exerts its effect by activating the immune system to secrete toxic substances, which in turn eliminate tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is, however, relatively little known about the mechanisms of action of OK-432. The principal cells responding to the drug, the engaged receptors or signal transduction pathways, are to a surprisingly large extent unknown. This should be an important area of study. The efficiency of OK-432 treatment needs to be improved in order to make OK-432 a better cancer treatment drug. Additional drugs, which could improve OK-432's response, as well as studying to what extent other (cancer) drugs potentially interfere with the receptors and signal transduction pathways driving the OK-432 response, should therefore be determined as to optimize and improve treatment.</p><p>Furthermore,<italic>S. pyogenes </italic>is an important pathogen causing human disease. The diseases caused by <italic>S. pyogenes </italic>range from tonsillitis, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis, and scarlet fever to lethal toxic shock syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, studying the interactions of OK-432 with the immune system may shed light into the biology of these diseases as well.</p><p>One major MNP function is secretion of chemokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) -1 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) -1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Chemokines have been shown to be secreted in response to OK-432 stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and have the main effect of attracting new leucocytes to the site from where they are secreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It should be of interest, to determine the modality of chemokine secretion from MOs and M&#x003d5;s upon OK-432 stimulation. We have therefore found it pertinent to address this issue in the present investigation.</p><p>Priming provided by adherence, presumably associated with MNP differentiation from MO to M&#x003d5;, contributes to interleukin secretion following OK-432 MNP stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, it is of interest to study to what extent the MNP chemokine response to OK-432 depends on adherence. Molecularly, we have found it relevant to investigate the role of &#x003b2;-integrin receptors, as these receptors participate during differentiation of MNP from MO to M&#x003d5;. Furthermore, these receptors may be functionally blocked by addition of piceatannol (Syk kinase inhibitor) and/or LY294002 (phosphoinositide (PI)-3 kinase inhibitor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. OK-432 may stimulate TLR receptors. In addition to OK-432, we have studied chemokine secretion upon stimulation with the known TLR2 agonist LTA and TLR4 agonist LPS. Moreover, we explored the role of the TLR2 co-receptor CD36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] in OK-432 stimulation.</p><p>We have determined that <italic>in vitro </italic>purified adherent MNPs may secrete chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1&#x003b1; and MIP-1&#x003b2; following OK-432 stimulation. MOs deprived of adherence did not respond to OK-432 stimulation as assessed by chemokine secretion. Inhibition of Syk and PI-3 kinase did not block the stimulatory effect of OK-432. MIP-1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; production in WB and MOs was higher upon stimulation with LTA or LPS while OK-432 stimulation gave a higher MCP-1 secretion in WB and MOs in comparison with LTA or LPS. CD36, and to some extent CD18, participate in the OK-432-modulated MNP chemokine response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>In vitro chemokine production in unstimulated cultures</title><p>Upon adherence, only MCP-1 was to some extent secreted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Western blot (Wb) analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) shows that Syk kinase becomes phosphorylated following adherence of MOs and is further phosphorylated following OK-432 stimulation but this phosphorylation is substantially reduced in MOs exposed to piceatannol (30 &#x003bc;M) for 30 min before stimulation with OK-432 for an additional 15 min. Addition of piceatannol had no effect on chemokine production, as measured by MCP-1, in human MOs unless it was used at high, unspecific concentrations (120 &#x003bc;M) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, top).

Thus, piceatannol, at high, likely unspecific, concentrations (120 &#x003bc;M) lowers MCP-1 secretion while at low, specific, concentrations (0.5, 1 or 30 &#x003bc;M), has no effect on the tested chemokines, despite exhibiting efficacy in lowering Syk kinase phosphorylation.</p><p>The role of PI-3 kinase in OK-432's ability to stimulate MOs was tested where LY294002 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) or Wortmannin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) was added for 30 min to freshly isolated MOs followed by incubation with OK-432 for 24 hours. Western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) shows that PI-3 kinase is not phosphorylated following adherence of MOs but becomes phosphorylated following OK-432 stimulation. This OK-432-dependent PI-3 kinase phosphorylation is decreased when MOs are exposed to LY294002 for 30 min before stimulation with OK-432 for 15 min.

CD36 addition decreased MIP-1&#x003b2; and MCP-1 (both p = 0.028) but not MIP-1&#x003b1; secretion.

Purified MOs, PBMCs or WB secreted MCP-1, MIP-1&#x003b1;, and MIP-1&#x003b2; following OK-432 stimulation at a similar rate, except for a substantially lower MIP-1&#x003b1; secretion from WB. This is in line with other investigators, e.g., showing that <italic>S. pyogenes </italic>directly activates M&#x003d5;s to secrete chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Cytokine mRNA quantification of MCP-1 transcripts showed that OK-432 stimulation was followed by cytokine mRNA synthesis within hours. There was a correlation between measured cytokine mRNA levels and cytokine-secreted levels suggesting that OK-432 mainly exerts its effects at the pre-transcriptional level. We furthermore separated by adherence most of the MOs from a sample of PBMCs. Upon OK-432 stimulation both these cell fractions secreted MCP-1 at about twice the level of the MO-depleted fraction. These findings support that MNPs are the main source for MCP-1 within PBMCs. OK-432 also elicited a chemokine response in purified MOs from HNSCC patients.</p><p>All studied chemokines were secreted without particular stimulation factors at low adherence conditions, whereas MIP-1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; secretion was completely inhibited by adherence. At low adherence conditions, the secretion response of MIP-1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and MCP-1 from PBMCs and MOs was abolished upon OK-432 stimulation. This might indicate that MNPs undergoing adherence fundamentally alter their chemokine secretion responses and supports that MO to M&#x003d5; differentiation interferes with the regulation of chemokine secretion. This is also supported by our observations of MIP-1&#x003b1;-derived OK-432 stimulated secretion being lower in WB compared to PBMCs and MOs. Diapedesis depends on, e.g., integrin receptor engagement co-triggering differentiation of MOs to M&#x003d5;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Such stimulation may be provided when MOs are isolated by <italic>in vitro </italic>adherence. Syk phosphorylation is a necessary part of &#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;3 </sub>integrin-generated activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], whereas PI-3 kinase phosphorylation is required in &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin-generated activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We have presently shown that adherence of MOs stimulated phosphorylation of Syk but not PI-3 kinase, as determined by Western blots. Thus, it appears that possibly both &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrins, but not &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin, play a role in mediating MO adhesion. Based on Western blots, binding of OK-432 to MOs elicited a higher Syk phosphorylation compared to unstimulated MOs, possibly suggesting an adherence-mediated priming effect. PI-3 kinase phosphorylation occurred only upon stimulation with OK-432. We have shown that addition of either one of these inhibitors to OK-432-stimulated MOs did not change chemokine secretion. On the contrary, with addition of both of these inhibitors, MCP-1 secretion was increased, pointing to the existence of other possible signaling pathways. In addition, presence of both inhibitors throughout the isolation and separation of monocytes blocked the unstimulated secretion of chemokines supporting that &#x003b2; integrins are important for chemokine secretion during the adhesion process. Our observed Syk phosphorylation upon OK-432 binding pointed towards an integrin dependence and resonated with Cuzzola et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], who have shown that the MO interleukin response to Group A Streptococci (GAS) was dependent on the &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin. We explored whether this applied to the OK-432-mediated activation of MOs by adding a blocking anti-CD18 antibody. MCP-1 production appears to be partially inhibited by the anti-CD18 antibody. Thus, the &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin may play a role in mediating the effects of OK-432 on MOs. Nevertheless, other receptors may phosphorylate either Syk or PI-3 kinase or both and their nature has yet to be established.</p><p>OK-432 probably stimulates MOs via TLR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and/or TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In order to study the role of these receptors, MOs were stimulated in parallel with OK-432, and the known TLR2 or TLR4 agonists, LTA and LPS, respectively. Results showed that MOs respond to OK-432 in a similar fashion to LTA stimulation, thus, arguing for primary TLR2-dependent stimulation of MOs by OK-432.</p><p>A potential candidate for co-stimulation of MOs is CD36. This receptor has been found to function as a co-receptor for TLR2 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We determined a reduced MIP-1&#x003b2; and MCP-1, but an unchanged MIP-1&#x003b1; response upon employing blocking anti-CD36 antibodies. Thus, CD36 may function as an important receptor in the OK-432 stimulation of MOs with respect to chemokine secretion.</p><p>Other co-stimulating receptors than the presently shown ones may be important for chemokine production following OK-432 stimulation of MNPs. Examples include CD62L (L-selectin receptor), a mediator of MOs rolling on and interacting with endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and CD162 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1), a promoter in the interaction between MOs and platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Future studies are needed to establish their roles in OK-432 stimulation in MOs.</p><p>The shown MNP stage-dependence for MIP-1&#x003b1; secretion and adherence-dependent chemokine response to OK-432 supports the hypothesis that chemokine secretion is less favoured when MOs are stimulated by OK-432 in pb compared to extravasal stimulation. This is in line with our previous observation that TNF-&#x003b1; is primarily secreted upon OK-432 stimulation after initiation of MO differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The present report thus adds more support to the notion that OK-432 is a target-seeking substance. Only when MNPs are stimulated by, e.g., tumor cells or intercellular substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], one observes a chemokine response. The present results argue in favor of chemokine secretion being an important effector function of MNPs during OK-432 stimulation. This is important as to designing future BRM treatments with OK-432. Platinum-based drugs, e.g., negatively interfere more with monocyte than lymphocyte function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and should thus be avoided in combination with OK-432 treatment.</p><p>MIP-1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and MCP-1 secretion is induced by stimulation of MOs with OK-432. These chemokines are ligands of the receptors CXCR1, CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, present on polymorphonuclear granulocytes, basophiles, granulocytes, MOs, M&#x003d5;s, DCs, NK cells, T, and B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus, the shown chemokine secretion after OK-432 stimulation of MOs may co-explain the systemic effects of OK-432 on the immune system. Similar findings were made by Veckman et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] upon stimulating M&#x003d5;s with pathogenic live bacteria (serotype T1M1 (IH32030)) isolated from a child with bacteremia. In contrast, we have stimulated monocytes with a heat- and penicillin G-killed, low-virulence SU strain of <italic>S. pyogenes </italic>and found very low levels of RANTES (CCL5). Therefore, it is plausible that virulence status/degree, strain, and preparation of bacteria influence chemokine production and MOs may have a different chemokine profile compared to M&#x003d5;s. This becomes especially interesting when the emphasis is on OK-432 being a lyophilized, killed <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>. <italic>S. pyogenes </italic>is an important pathogen causing human disease. The diseases caused by <italic>S. pyogenes </italic>range from tonsillitis, impetigo, and scarlet fever to lethal toxic shock syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The shown mechanisms of MNP activation by OK-432 thus shed light on these diseases as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found that MCP-1 and MIP-1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; production by OK-432-stimulated human purified adherent MOs occurs in most healthy individuals. MIP-1&#x003b1; secretion is mostly found following differentiation stimuli of MOs to become M&#x003d5;s. Furthermore, MOs stimulated with OK-432 respond with chemokine secretion dependent on adherent growth conditions. OK-432 may rely on &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin stimulation. CD36 modulates the MIP-1&#x003b2; and MCP-1 response to OK-432. To some extent OK-432 may act as a target-seeking substance whereby only MOs adhered, e.g., to a target, secrete substantial amounts of chemokines in part explaining why OK-432 is suited as a BRM drug.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>OK-432 (Picibanil) (Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.

Tetra-methyl-benzidine (TMB) (Sigma) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>were used as substrate. Absorbency values were measured at 450 nm using Softmax Pro version 4.0 on an Emax Precision microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The lower detection level was 15.62 pg/ml. Chemokine levels obtained with media controls (after 24 h) were substracted from those obtained with OK-432-, LTA-, LPS-stimulation. All media controls tested directly after monocyte purification had nondetectable chemokine levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The statistical program package Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (Ver. 16 SPSS, Chicago, Ill., USA) was used.
