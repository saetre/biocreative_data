PRPs are highly expressed in binucleate cells of bovine trophoblasts, although their function is still obscure. No new member had been identified between early 1990 and this year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We recently found a new <italic>PRP </italic>member through a comprehensive analysis using a bovine utero-placental cDNA microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Seven bovine <italic>PRP </italic>(<italic>bPRP</italic>) genes have been identified in placentomal tissues, whereas only two of those genes have been shown to be translated. The expression pattern of these genes is spatially and temporally different. <italic>bPRP-I </italic>indicates the considerable importance of regulation of implantation and formation of the placentome in bovines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, <italic>bPRP-VII </italic>was expressed in intercotyledon and cotyledon with rather weak compare to those of <italic>bPRP-I </italic>during the gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Placental lactogens (PLs) are known as classical members and PRPs are categorized as the non-classical members of the GH/PRL family in bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Various non-classical members are common in rodents, such as mice and rats, and some of them exhibit known biological functions, such as proliferin and prolactin-like protein-A (PLP-A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, as a whole the biological function of Prolactin-related genes is still not known in various species including bovine. Two research groups identified bovine <italic>PRPs </italic>mRNA individually; <italic>bPRP-I </italic>to -<italic>III </italic>were identified by the Schuler group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and <italic>bPRP-IV </italic>to -<italic>VI </italic>were identified by the Nakashima group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We recently identified another one named as <italic>bPRP-VII </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Our previous study suggested our bovine placental cDNA library contained other <italic>bPRP </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We reveal here the full-length sequences of two new members of <italic>bPRPs, bPRP-VIII and -IX</italic>, and their localization and quantitative expression. We confirmed the possibility of translation of them and the accuracy of these gene sequences to produce a recombinant protein using the HEK293 cell-transfecting system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals and tissues</title><p>Placental tissues for cDNA cloning and mRNA expression were collected from Japanese Black cows. The extra-embryonic tissues, placenta, and endometrium were collected at a local slaughterhouse on days 27 to 28, 56 to 64, 144 to 149, and 245 to 258 after artificial insemination (day 1). The tissues were separated into four portions: the cotyledon (COT); intercotyledon (the area between the cotyledonary villous (ICOT)); the caruncle area, including the maternal placentomal septa in the endometrium (CAR); and the intercaruncle area (ICAR). It was difficult to divide the COT and ICOT on days 27 to 28, and thus the COT contained very few villi. Tissues from two different cows on day 27 and one cow on day 28 of gestation (n = 3) were used as Day 27 extra-embryonic membrane (Day 27EEM), Day 27 caruncle (Day 27CAR), and Day 27 intercaruncular endometrium (Day 27ICAR). Placentomal tissues were collected on days 56, 58, and 64 (in total, n = 3) and designated as Day 60COT, CAR, ICOT, and ICAR. Sample materials from days 144, 148, and 149 (n = 3) and days 245 (two samples) and 252 (one sample) were marked as Day 150COT, CAR, ICOT, ICAR, Day 250COT, CAR, ICOT, and ICAR. The cotyledonary and caruncular part was separated mechanically, and each part may contained a counter part of tissue. The collected samples were stored at -80&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction. The placentomes of day 60 were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde PBS at pH 7.4 and then embedded in paraffin wax and stored at 4&#x000b0;C until <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization. All procedures for these animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines and ethics approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences for the use of animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning of full-length bPRP-VIII and -IX cDNA</title><p>The new full-length <italic>bPRP-VIII and -IX </italic>cDNA were isolated from bovine cotyledonary tissue by the 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. In brief, a complete RNA was isolated from a bovine placentome on day 60 of gestation using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). We performed 3'-RACE using a 3'-full RACE core set (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) with <italic>bPRP-VIII</italic>-specific forward primer (5'-CCACAGTCAACAGGAGTCCTCA-3') and <italic>bPRP-IX</italic>-specific forward primer (5'-CCAACAGAGAGTCCTCACCCTGCGA-3'). The <italic>bPRP-VIII and -IX </italic>primer was designed from bovine EST accession number AW464912 and BP108069, respectively. The 3'-RACE products were sequenced using an ABI Prism 370 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) after cloning into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Alignments of deduced protein sequences were performed with the multiple alignment software Clustal W 1.83 on the DDBJ web site.

The total RNA in a total reaction mixture was used for reverse transcription and template cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 42&#x000b0;C for 50 min. Each PCR contained the cDNA template, primers, deoxynucleotide triphosphate mixture (dNTP), MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 &#x000d7; PCR buffer II, autoclaved milliQ water, and AmpliTaq gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Amplification conditions included denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 30 sec and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min. Twenty-seven cycles were performed for all samples. The annealing temperature was set at 60&#x000b0;C for 30 sec. A single denaturation step at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min before the first PCR cycle and a final extension step at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min after the last PCR cycle were also performed.

The protein sequence regions (CDSs) were composed of 711 nucleotides in <italic>bPRP-VIII </italic>and 717 nucleotides in <italic>bPRP-IX</italic>. The 3'-untranslated region contains one AATAAA polyadenylation signal start 20 and 26 bases upstream from the poly (A) addition site in <italic>bPRP-VIII and -IX</italic>, respectively. The amino acid sequences deduced from full-length <italic>bPRP-VIII </italic>and <italic>bPRP-IX </italic>cDNA are amino acids 236 and 238. The homology of predicted amino acid sequences of bPRP-VIII and -IX protein were shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The predicted sequence of bPRP-VIII protein was 69% homologous to that of bPRP-VI, 66% homologous to that of bPRP-VII, 61% homologous to that of bPRP-I and -III, 58% homologous to that of bPRP-IV and -V, 57% homologous to that of bPRP-IX, 42% homologous to that of bPRP-II, and 39% homologous to that of bPL-Ala (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The predicted sequence of bPRP-IX protein was 81% homologous to that of bPRP-IV, 76% homologous to that of bPRP-I, 70% homologous to that of bPRP-II, 60% homologous to that of bPRP-VII, 57% homologous to that of bPRP-VI and -VIII, 53% homologous to that of bPRP-III and -V, and 40% homologous to that of bPL-Ala (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In the phylogenetic analysis, it was shown that bPRP-VIII was close to bPRP-III, bPRP-VI, and bPRP-VII sides in the phylogenetic tree and bPRP-IX was close to bPRP-II and bPRP-IV sides in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The <italic>N</italic>-terminal regions of the bPRP-VIII and -IX proteins were rich in hydrophobic amino acid residue, which is characteristic of the signal peptide. bPRP-VIII had two consensus sequences for <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation and Asn-X-Ser/Thr at the positions of 60 to 62 and 233 to 235 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). bPRP-IX also had four consensus sequences for <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation at the positions of 70 to 72, 92 to 94, 146 to 148, and 160 to 162 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Another atypical <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site, Asn-X-Cys was found in only bPRP-IX at the position of 95 to 97, and this region is identified in bPLs. The TAA stop codon was used in both bPRP-VIII and -IX, and appeared after the sequence TGC, which was present in other bPRPs except for bPRP-VI and bPLs that encode C-terminal cysteine residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

Totally nine <italic>bPRP </italic>genes have been identified at this moment in bovine.</p><p><italic>bPRP-VIII and -IX </italic>cDNA sequences had following features, respectively. The position of the polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) in the <italic>bPRP-VIII </italic>started 20 bases upstream from the poly(A) additional site. This configuration is specific to <italic>bPRP-VIII</italic>. The number of bases in <italic>bPRP-VIII </italic>from the polyadenylation signal to poly(A) site are the fewest in known <italic>bPRPs</italic>. The position of the polyadenylation signal in the <italic>bPRP-IX </italic>started 26 bases upstream from the poly(A) additional site. This position coincides with those in <italic>bPRP-II </italic>and <italic>bPRP-IV </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The signal peptide sequences in the <italic>N</italic>-terminal regions of both bPRP-VIII and -IX were conserved similarly to those in other bPRPs/bPLs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The signal cleavage site was predicted to be between the Glu-36 and Arg-37 in bPRP-VIII, and between Glu-36 and Asn-37 in bPRP-IX by homology to the <italic>N</italic>-terminal regions of the bPRPs/bPLs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). As a result, bPRP-VIII is predicted to be a mature protein composed of 200 amino acids, while bPRP-IX has 202 amino acids. bPRP-VIII lacked two amino acids (positions 94 and 183), which is a sequence characteristic, since other known bPRPs have 202 amino acids. bPRP-VIII had two potential <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites (amino acid portions 60 to 62 and 233 to 235, Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The position of 60 to 62 coincided with those of bPRP-III, -VI, and -VII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], however, the second <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site was found at 233 to 235 in amino acids. In contrast, bPRP-IX had four potential typical <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites of Asn-X-Ser/Thr (amino acid portions 70 to 72, 92 to 94, 146 to 148, and 160 to 162, Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). All these configurations of Asn-X-Ser/Thr coincide with those of bPRP-II and -IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, it is characteristic that only the bPRP-IX have atypical <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site of Asn-X-Cys (amino acid portions 95 to 97). The conserved domains (LD1 to LD4, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) were suggested by Yamakawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] in other prolactin-related genes. The bPRP-VIII and -IX sequences also revealed these LD domains. Cysteine residues (PRP-VIII positions 96, 213, and 230, and PRP-IX positions 97, 215, and 232) in the LD1 and LD4 domains were conserved in bPRPs/bPLs, except for bPRP-VI. bPRP-VIII had four more cysteines (positions 38, 41, 42, and 236, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, a total of seven residues in mature protein), and bPRP-IX had three more cysteines (positions 38, 41, and 238, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, a total of six residues in mature protein). These configurations indicate common features in bPRPs/bPLs. In particular, the configuration of the cysteine residue in bPRP-VIII coincided exactly with that of bPRP-III in the mature sequence region. The cysteine residue in bPRP-IX was also the same as that in bPRP-I, -II, and -IV in the mature sequence region. Therefore, both bPRP-VIII and -IX may have three disulfide bonds similar to those of other bPRPs, except for bPRP-VII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The primary mRNA expression of <italic>bPRP-VIII and -IX </italic>was observed in the binucleate cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Both genes could independently produce mature recombinant proteins in the mammalian cell expression system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The binucleate cells may have produced the bPRP-VIII and -IX proteins simultaneously because <italic>bPRP-VIII and -IX </italic>mRNA expressed in the binucleate cells, and HEK293 cells translated these mRNA to each protein individually. Binucleate cells are also primary expression cells for <italic>bPRP-I </italic>and <italic>bPL </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and may have a specific function for implantation in the fetomaternal interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. <italic>bPRP-VIII </italic>mRNA was also expressed in the extra-embryonic membrane just after the implantation period in the present study (Day 27 of gestation) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). bPRP-VIII may also be related to the implantation process like bPRP-I and -VII since <italic>bPRP-I </italic>was expressed during early gestation. Compare to these expression, no <italic>bPRP-IX </italic>was present in the extra-embryonic membrane on Day 27 of gestation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This mRNA expression pattern implies that bPRP-IX has a different role from <italic>bPRP-I </italic>and <italic>bPL </italic>in placental formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. <italic>bPRP-IX </italic>mRNA was also detected in the trinucleate cells. A trinucleate cell is generated by migration of a binucleate cell to an endometrial epithelial cell with the progress of the pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. bPRP-IX may be a necessary molecule during middle to late gestation. Although both bPRP-VIII and -IX may be necessary molecules for gestation, <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization demonstrated that both genes were primarily expressed in binucleate and trinucleate cells. This means both genes derive from fetal side origin, but both were stably contained in the caruncular area throughout gestation, except bPRP-IX in early gestation. There are two potential causes of this result. One is contamination after separation. A second possibility is cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The present study and our previous study suggest that binucleate and trinucleate cells may migrate deeply into the endometrium after implantation and maintain their functions, which may be related to immunomodulation or stress during bovine gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The molecular size of the recombinant proteins completely differed between bPRP-VIII and -IX. Transcripted bPRP-VIII protein is of relatively smaller size in the known bPRP family members, and the bPRP-IX protein is among the largest members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The sugar chain addition in post-translational modification will give large effect in the difference of both molecular weights. It was found that the predicted 3D structure differed clearly in both molecules, because configuration of disulfide bonds and sugar chain addition dynamics are different. The tertiary structure of bPRP-VIII and -IX are similar to that of hPRL, so they may share the same receptor. However there is no information and the other evidence may not support this speculation. Only the <italic>bPRP-I </italic>gene has been known to produce protein in the placenta, however, the protein bound to the alpha2-macroglobulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], so it might have a biological function in paracrine status. Since all other bPRPs have a similar characteristic, it is difficult to say bPRPs are hormones secreted into circulation from the placenta, such as bPRL and bPL. It was possible to predict a part of their functions from the molecular weight, 3D structure, and post-translational modification. bPRP-VIII and -IX proteins may have different functions, since their temporal and special expressions were different. Various difficulties remain for understanding PRP functions, however, many of the same genes and molecules are expressed in bovine placenta as in rodent placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Recently, bovine genome projects have addressed various shotgun sequence data and five known <italic>bPRPs</italic>, <italic>bPL</italic>, and <italic>bPRL</italic>, a total of seven prolactin related genes, hit in the NCBI genome database. They are located in Bos taurus chromosomes 12 and/or 23. <italic>bPRP-III</italic>, -<italic>VII </italic>and <italic>bPL </italic>were detected on chromosome 23 with <italic>bPRL</italic>. On the other hand, <italic>bPRP-I</italic>, -<italic>V</italic>, and -<italic>VI </italic>are placed on chromosome 12. Rodents such as mice and rats also have various <italic>PLPs </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and they have been clustered on one chromosome, number 13 in mice and number 17 in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. bPRP-III and -VII were in comparatively close positions on the phylogenetic tree in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and they are clustered in the same chromosome 23. <italic>bPRP-VIII </italic>may be placed on chromosome 23 because bPRP-VIII was close to bPRP-III or -VII on the phylogenetic tree, although the bootstrap value is low between bPRP-VIII and bPRP-III/-VII. bPRP-I, -V, and -VI, however, were comparatively close on the phylogenetic tree in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; these genes were clustered on chromosome 12. <italic>bPRP-IX </italic>may be placed on chromosome 12 because bPRP-IX was close to bPRP-I on the phylogenetic tree. The actual configuration of the bPRP-VIII and -IX genome will be addressed in the future. Therefore, prolactin-related genes in mammals may have similar roles for placental function, but they may evolve through different phylogenetic processes, may be two separate pathways. For example, GH and PRL functions are different in various species, namely, GH uses the PRL receptor in some species, but not in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we identified two new members of <italic>bPRPs, bPRP-VIII and -IX</italic>. <italic>bPRP-VIII </italic>was expressed in binucleate cells in bovine trophoblast tissue and placentome. The expression appeared as well in <italic>bPRP-I, -VII</italic>, and <italic>bPL</italic>, and it expressed from the implantation period to late in gestation. <italic>bPRP-IX </italic>was expressed in binucleate cells and trinucleate cells, and was expressed somewhat late in gestation compared to other PRPs. These data indicate that various <italic>PRP </italic>genes in bovine placenta have coordination roles for gestation as evidenced in rodents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Prof. Yukio Tsunoda of Kinki University and Dr. Tomoyuki Tokunaga of the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences for their help.
