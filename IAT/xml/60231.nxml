In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>HHO1</italic> encodes a putative linker histone with very significant homology to histone H1.

Here we report that while disruption of <italic>HHO1</italic> has little affect on RNA levels of most cellular transcripts, there are numerous exceptions. Measurement of HHO1p concentration in the wild-type cell showed a stoichiometry of about one HHO1p molecule per 37 nucleosomes. Localization of HHO1p in the chromatin, using an immunoprecipitation technique, showed preferential HHO1p binding to rDNA sequences. These results suggest that HHO1p may play a similar role to linker histones, but at restricted locations in the chromatin.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eukaryotic DNA is packaged in the nucleus in a very precise way that enables it to contend with numerous topological and physical constraints. The underlying structure of DNA compaction is extremely well conserved in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to man (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c1">1</xref>). The fundamental packing unit, known as the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c3">3</xref>), consists of two full superhelical turns of DNA wrapped around a core containing two each of the four conserved core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Digestion of the nucleosome with micrococcal nuclease yields a core particle containing 146 bp of DNA. Each nucleosome is separated from the next by a region of linker DNA, which is associated with a single molecule of a fifth, less conserved histone usually referred to as the linker histone or H1. The linker DNA can vary in length from close to 0 to 80 nucleotide pairs, depending on the species.</p><p> The linker histone has been shown to be located in the interior of the folded structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c4">4</xref>) where the DNA enters and leaves the nucleosome. By binding to the DNA at these positions, the linker histones fix the entry&#x0002f;exit angle of the DNA and thus, together with other constraints, such as length and rigidity of the linker DNA, contribute to the formation of higher order chromatin structure. <italic>In vitro</italic> they show a strong preference for binding of superhelical&#x0002f;supercoiled DNA, compared with linear or relaxed circular DNA.</p><p> Curiously, much of the work attempting to identify a function for the nearly ubiquitous histone H1 has not been very rewarding, though the molecule has been extensively studied. It has been proposed that H1 is involved in transcription control (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c5">5</xref>) and in setting the linker distance between nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c8">8</xref>), though conflicting evidence has been presented for both proposed functions. There have been a few successful attempts to disrupt the genes encoding H1 and&#x0002f;or the H1 isoforms. Surprisingly, elimination of all of these gene products in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c9">9</xref>) and of histone H1(zero) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c10">10</xref>) did not result in dramatic phenotypes. In tobacco plants, overexpressing a gene encoding histone H1 from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> caused a decreased level of their own H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c11">11</xref>). The total histone H1 level increased 2.3&#x02013;2.8 times. While the resulting drastic change in H1:DNA stoichiometry had a limited effect on basal cellular functions, it did affect plant morphology and flowering. These results indicate that, at least in plants, the regulatory function of H1 with respect to transcription may be limited to a class of genes responsible for specific developmental programs.</p><p> In <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, linker histone is required for activated expression of at least one gene called CyP (encoding a cysteine protease) that is strongly induced by starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c12">12</xref>). H1 is not required for repression of CyP in growing cells, but it is required for activated expression upon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c13">13</xref>). Another gene, ngoA, also induced by starvation, requires H1 for normal basal repression in growing cells, but does not require H1 for activated expression in starved cells. Importantly, phosphorylation of H1 mimicked its depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c14">14</xref>). Most recently, it was shown that the effect of phosphorylation in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> is due to the overall charge of the small domain where phosphorylation occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c15">15</xref>).</p><p> In <italic>Xenopus</italic> it was shown that different variants of H1 are necessary for selective transcriptional silencing of regulatory genes that are required for mesodermal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c16">16</xref>). In addition, TFIIIA transcription of 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes is regulated by histone H1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. An increase in histone H1 content in the cell specifically restricts 5S rRNA gene transcription, while a decrease in histone H1 within chromatin facilitates activation of the oocyte 5S rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c17">17</xref>). A number of different isoforms of this histone have been described in various cell types &#x0005b;e.g. H5 and H1(zero)&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c18">18</xref>) which appear to be differentially expressed in a number of tissues at varying stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c20">20</xref>).</p><p> In chicken tissue culture cells, deletion of all but one of the H1 genes caused changes in the pattern of proteins analyzed on 2-dimensional gels, though cell growth was unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c21">21</xref>). Overexpression of H1 variants in mouse tissue culture cells specifically increased (rather than repressed) basal and induced expression from the MMTV promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c22">22</xref>). Most recently, it was shown that histone H1 is essential for a long lifespan in the fungus <italic>Ascobolus immersus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c23">23</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that H1 function <italic>in vivo</italic> may be gene specific and that it may not be a general structural component of chromatin.</p><p> In yeast, biochemical efforts to definitively identify histone H1 were unsuccessful. However, as the sequence of the entire yeast genome became known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c24">24</xref>), Landsman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c25">25</xref>) asked whether an H1 homolog exists in yeast. Using the conserved globular domain of histone H1 as a basis for searching the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> database, he identified an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative protein that has very significant homology to the globular domains of many H1 proteins. The yeast putative H1, termed HHO1p, has an N-terminal peptide that is lysine-rich, followed by a well-conserved globular domain, followed by a short peptide with similar composition to the C-terminal H1 tails, followed by another globular domain. No other linker histone molecules are known to contain two globular domains.</p><p> Ushinsky<italic> et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c26">26</xref>) disrupted <italic>HHO1.</italic> They found no observable phenotype, but found that HHO1p tagged with green fluorescence protein and expressed from a plasmid localizes to the nucleus.</p><p> Patterton<italic> et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c27">27</xref>) performed a comprehensive survey of potential phenotypes that might result from an <italic>HHO1</italic> deletion, but they too were unable to detect a phenotype particular to <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>.</italic> They tested basal transcription levels in a minimal <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter and showed no difference between wild-type and <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; cells. They also showed that HHO1p is not required for telomeric repression, nor is it required for efficient sporulation. However, they showed that purified recombinant HHO1p, like histone H1, was able to form a stable ternary complex with a reconstituted core dinucleosome <italic>in vitro</italic> at a molar ratio of one. They also reported that the reconstituted nucleosomes showed a kinetic pause at &#x0223c;168 bp after micrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin, as do nucleosomes associated with histone H1. <italic>In vivo</italic> bulk chromatin structure was unaffected by deletion of <italic>HHO1</italic>.</p><p> Puig<italic> et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c28">28</xref>) asked whether structural changes could be noted at a specific locus in the chromatin following <italic>HHO1</italic> disruption. They chose a particular locus in the genome which includes <italic>POT1</italic> and <italic>YIL161w</italic> that is located between two strongly micrococcal nuclease hypersensitive sites and is flanked by an array of 13 strictly positioned nucleosomes. They too were unable to detect a difference in the nucleosome spacing between wild-type and <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strains.</p><p> Despite all the above data that could indicate that HHO1p does not have a significant function in the cell, Spellman<italic> et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c29">29</xref>), using gene array technology, reported that the only genes transcribed during S phase in yeast are <italic>HHO1</italic> and those genes encoding the core histones (<italic>HTA1</italic>, <italic>HTA2</italic> encoding H2A, <italic>HTB1</italic>, <italic>HTB2</italic> encoding H2B, <italic>HHT1</italic>, <italic>HHT2</italic>, encoding H3 and <italic>HHF1</italic>, <italic>HHF2</italic> encoding H4). As <italic>HHO1</italic> transcription is coordinately regulated with the core histone genes, it is likely that HHO1p somehow functions in a coordinated fashion with the core histones.</p><p> In this study, we further addressed the assignment of HHO1p as the H1 linker histone in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We show that in wild-type cells, <italic>HHO1</italic> is both transcribed and translated and that the protein co-purifies with the core histones. We measured its relative stoichiometry to the core histones in the cell, finding that it is found in far fewer copies in the cell than nucleosomes. Using a DNA array technique we show that <italic>HHO1</italic> disruption does have a transcription effect on a subset of genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we directly probed where HHO1p might be located in the chromatin and showed that it is preferentially concentrated at the repeated sequences that encode rRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and media</title><p>Strain CY26 (MAT&#x003b1;, <italic>ura3-52</italic>, <italic>leu2-</italic>&#x00394;<italic>1</italic>, <italic>his3-</italic>&#x00394;<italic>200</italic>, <italic>trp1-</italic>&#x00394;<italic>1</italic>, <italic>lys2-801</italic>, <italic>ade2-101</italic>) was considered wild-type with respect to <italic>HHO1</italic>.

Prehybridization was carried out for 5 h at 60&#x000b0;C in 7&#x00025; SDS, 1.5&#x000d7; SSPE, 10&#x00025; PEG (mol wt 10 000), 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml salmon sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c41">41</xref>). Following overnight hybridization in the same buffer, the membrane was washed three times at 60&#x000b0;C with 0.1&#x000d7; SSC, 0.1&#x00025; SDS and applied to film for autoradiography.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title><italic>HHO1</italic> is both transcribed and translated in the cell</title><p>As it had been reported that disruption of <italic>HHO1</italic> had no observable phenotype, we asked whether HHO1p is produced in the wild-type cell.

We then performed a western blot on whole cell extracts using an anti-HA antibody. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f1">1</xref>B, HHO1p is easily detected in these cells. The measured molecular weight is &#x0223c;35 kDa. Though the actual molecular weight is &#x0223c;30 kDa with the two HA tags, this aberrant mobility is in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>HHO1p is located in the nucleus and co-purifies with core histones</title><p>As HHO1p has been described as the putative yeast histone H1, we asked whether HHO1p co-purifies with core histones extracted from isolated nuclei. To that end, we acid extracted nuclei isolated from a strain in which the native HHO1p gene was replaced with a construct that encodes HHO1&#x02013;2HAp fusion protein. As controls, we did the same for nuclei isolated from a wild-type strain and an isogenic strain lacking HHO1p. We then performed SDS&#x02013;PAGE on samples isolated from all phases of the purification process. The gel was western blotted and probed using an anti-HA antibody. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f1">1</xref>, the HHO1&#x02013;2HAp protein was quantitatively recovered in the acid-soluble fraction that had been extracted from nuclei.</p><p> Coomassie staining of the acid-soluble proteins extracted from the wild-type strain run on SDS&#x02013;PAGE showed a band (marked in the figure) migrating slightly faster than the 2HA-tagged band identified in the western blot. The band was absent in extracts made from the <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strain. We concluded, therefore, that the band represents HHO1p. It is evident from the gel that the HHO1p levels in the cell are considerably lower than the core histone levels (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Disruption of <italic>HHO1</italic> results in increased transcription from its promoter</title><p>Previous investigators have shown that disruption of <italic>HHO1</italic> had no observable phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c27">27</xref>). We therefore disrupted <italic>HHO1</italic> by replacing most of the coding region with <italic>HIS3</italic> (see Materials and Methods).

As the disrupted gene can still be transcribed, we compared the <italic>in vivo</italic> levels of the disrupted and wild-type transcripts. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f2">2</xref> (upper left), <italic>HHO1</italic> disruption results in a substantial increase in the levels of its own transcript, indicating a possible feedback mechanism in the regulation of <italic>HHO1</italic> transcript levels in the cell. As the transcript has been modified it has a different size from the original.</p></sec><sec><title>Disruption of <italic>HHO1</italic> has little affect on the RNA levels of most transcripts in the cell</title><p>Though <italic>HHO1</italic> disruption did not have a detectable phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c27">27</xref>), our results (above) and those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c26">26</xref>) did show that the presence of <italic>HHO1</italic> affected the RNA levels of several transcripts. We sought, therefore, to determine how the absence of HHO1p in the cell would affect the levels of all other transcripts. To this end, poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA from wild-type and isogenic <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strains was used to make cDNA. This cDNA was hybridized to a microarray of DNA containing every ORF in yeast (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c42">42</xref>). The results indicated that while the transcription of very few genes was affected by the <italic>HHO1</italic> disruption, a few transcripts were more abundant in the <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strain and a few transcripts were more abundant in the wild-type strain. The results for a few sample genes were confirmed using northern analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The average nucleosome distance and sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease is the same in wild-type and <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strains</title><p>As HHO1p has significant sequence homology to histone H1 in other organisms, it has been considered to be the putative yeast histone H1. Transcription during the S phase of the cell cycle in yeast is unique to core histones and <italic>HHO1</italic>, strongly supporting this contention. As histone H1 has been reported to affect nucleosome spacing and sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c45">45</xref>) and recombinant HHO1p was shown to bind dinucleosomes, we compared the average nucleosome spacing and sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease in wild-type and <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; cells using micrococcal nuclease. As earlier reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c28">28</xref>), we saw no difference in nucleosome spacing between the strains (data not shown). We calculated the nucleosome repeat to be &#x0223c;161 nt, which compares well with the published 165 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c6">6</xref>). The sensitivity was measured as the concentration of micrococcal nuclease necessary to achieve identical nuclease digestion patterns. No difference was found between the wild-type and <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strains.</p></sec><sec><title>HHO1p is not stoichiometric with core histones <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>In higher organisms, histone H1 is thought to be associated with all or most nucleosomes. We reasoned that this might not be true for HHO1p since cells lacking HHO1p did not show a difference in nucleosome spacing. In addition, Coomassie staining of the isolated histones showed considerably less HHO1p than each of the core histones.</p><p> To directly measure the levels of HHO1p molecules in the cell, we made a recombinant GST&#x02013;HHO1&#x02013;2HAp construct that we could isolate to homogeneity from bacteria and directly measure its concentration. We then loaded known amounts of GST&#x02013;HHO1&#x02013;2HAp on a polyacrylamide gel together with known amounts of protein extracted from a yeast strain producing HHO1p&#x02013;2HA. A western blot of this gel can be seen&#x000a0;in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f3">3</xref>. By extrapolating from the intensities of the GST&#x02013;HHO1&#x02013;2HAp bands and comparing them to the HHO1&#x02013;2HAp bands, we calculated a level of about 2000 copies of HHO1p per cell. This is &#x0223c;37-fold fewer molecules than the estimated number of nucleosomes in the cell and represents about one molecule of HHO1p per three genes. This number necessarily means that HHO1p cannot be responsible for packing of the majority of the nucleosomes and cannot directly affect transcription of most genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation of DNA bound to HHO1&#x02013;2HAp does not generally show preferential binding of HHO1p to differentially expressed genes</title><p>Both northern analysis and microarray data indicated that a small subset of genes may be differentially transcribed in a strain lacking HHO1p. Since we determined that there are fewer HHO1p molecules than genes in the cell, we asked whether we could detect differential binding of HHO1p to the differentially expressed genes. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation technique followed by limiting multiplex PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c38">38</xref>), we looked at both promoter and coding regions of numerous genes that were differentially expressed in the <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strain. To date, we have been unable to detect any specificity in HHO1p binding to these regions. An example of such a multiplex PCR reaction is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f4">4</xref>C (right).</p></sec><sec><title>HHO1&#x02013;2HAp does show preferential binding to genes encoding rRNA</title><p>The above data do not preclude the possibility that HHO1p does bind specific regions in the chromatin that were not tested. We therefore asked whether we could detect such sequences directly without probing specific genes. To that end, we used the DNA that had been immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody in the immunoprecipitation technique as a probe in a Southern blot with total genomic DNA following restriction digestion. Orlando<italic> et al</italic>. used a similar technique to identify DNA specifically immunoprecipated from <italic>Drosophila</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c46">46</xref>). Thus our experiment, at a minimum, was expected to detect repeated sequences that might specifically be bound to HHO1p. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f4">4</xref>A, restriction digestion with several enzymes yielded specific bands which have been attributed to specific repeated sequences in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c40">40</xref>). When the DNA in the agarose gel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f4">4</xref>A was blotted to nitrocellulose and probed with DNA that had been immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, only a subset of the bands was visible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f4">4</xref>B). All those bands could be attributed to genes encoding rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c40">40</xref>). No other bands were visible, even on extended exposure, though many other bands representing repeated sequences could clearly be seen on the ethidium stained gel before transfer. This experiment was repeated several times and the results were the same.</p><p> To confirm these results, we probed the immunoprecipitated DNA using a limiting multiplex PCR reaction as done in the experiment with differentially expressed genes. We used two different sets of primers for rDNA amplification, each coding for a portion of the 35S rRNA precursor, and one set for <italic>CUP1</italic> amplification. <italic>CUP1</italic>, which is also repeated in the genome, was used as internal control. We quantified the radioactivity in each of the amplified DNA bands (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke508tb2">2</xref>) and normalized each of the rDNA bands to the <italic>CUP1</italic> amplicon in the same lane. The results clearly show (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f4">4</xref>C and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke508tb2">2</xref>) that the immunoprecipitated rDNA sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f4">4</xref>C, left, lanes marked 2) were preferentially immunoprecipitated by antibody bound to HHO1&#x02013;2HAp when compared to the control <italic>CUP1</italic> DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f4">4</xref>C, left, lanes marked 1). rDNA sequences near the start of the large 35S rDNA repeat just upstream of the sequence encoding 18S rRNA (285 bp in the PCR) were 1.7-fold more abundant in the immunoprecipitated DNA than in total genomic DNA, while rDNA sequences within the region encoding 25S rRNA (408 bp in the PCR) were enriched 2.5-fold. As mentioned above, we were unable to specifically immunoprecipitate DNA from other parts of the genome (example in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f4">4</xref>C, right). These experiments serve as controls for the results with the rDNA, as they show the consistency and repeatability of the technique.</p><p> We next asked whether we could detect differences in the steady-state levels of rRNA in wild-type and <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strains. We preformed a northern blot using total cellular RNA from both strains. We probed it with a sequence (YER32W) we knew not to be differentially expressed in the two strains from the DNA array data and then with a sequence encoding rRNA (data not shown). Identical amounts of rRNA were found in the two stains when normalized to YER32W.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Previous work had been unable to establish a phenotype for <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; cells. Though it was shown that <italic>HHO1</italic> is transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c29">29</xref>), none of the work to date has addressed the question of the existence or amount of HHO1p in the cell when transcribed from its native chromosomal location. To address these issues, we asked whether we could detect HHO1p in cellular extracts. To this end, we replaced the <italic>HHO1</italic> gene with an epitope-tagged version, transcribed from its native promoter. Northern blot experiments showed that the levels of <italic>HHO1</italic> transcript did not change following addition of the HA tag (data not shown). We showed in a western blot that these cells produce HHO1&#x02013;2HAp and that it co-purified with histones isolated from nuclei. In extracts enriched for histones made from the nuclei of <italic>HHO1</italic> and <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strains, we were able to identify a single protein at the appropriate molecular weight on Coomassie stained gels that was present in wild-type extracts but was absent in extracts made from the <italic>HHO1</italic> disruption. We observed that this band had a higher mobility when it was tagged with two copies of HA, supporting its identification as HHO1p in the wild-type cells.</p><p> We noted that the Coomassie staining of this band was considerably less intense than staining of the core histones (see&#x000a0;Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke508f1">1</xref>A). Our analysis indicated that there are about 2000 HHO1p molecules per nucleus. This is about 37-fold fewer than the presumed number of nucleosomes. These figures may not be completely accurate, as specific degradation of HHO1&#x02013;2HAp during preparation of the extract would lower the estimate of HHO1&#x02013;2HAp in the cell. It should be noted that our extraction procedures were carried out in the presence of protease inhibitors and that almost no degradation products were seen on the Coomassie stained polyacrylamide gels nor in the western blots. However, even if our estimate of HHO1p content in the cell is somewhat inaccurate, the results indicate that there are far fewer HHO1p molecules than nucleosomes in the cell. Thus, HHO1p is unlikely to be directly responsible for general chromatin packing in yeast. It is not surprising, therefore, that our data and data from other laboratories show no difference in average nucleosome spacing between wild-type and <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; cells.</p><p> DNA array experiments comparing expression of all ORFs in wild-type and <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strains showed that the levels of a limited number of transcripts are affected by the absence of HHO1p in the cell, as expected by the HHO1p:nucleosome stoichiometry. These data may explain the lack of an observed phenotype in <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; cells.</p><p> We used the array information as a guide to try to locate the relatively low numbers of HHO1p molecules in the chromatin using a chromatin immunoprecipitation technique. While these attempts have so far been unsuccessful, possibly indicating that the effect of <italic>HHO1</italic> disruption on transcription may be indirect, HHO1p molecules were preferentially found at the repeated genes encoding rRNA. Other repeated sequences that were observed in the ethidium stained gel of total DNA did not hybridize to the immunoprecipitated probe, so we believe that the data indicate preferential binding of HHO1p to rDNA. While a northern experiment indicated no difference in steady-state rRNA levels in wild-type and <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strains, these data do not preclude the possibility that rDNA transcription rates could be different in the two strains as a result of different chromatin structure. It was found that both rDNA amplicons were specifically immunoprecipitated, though to different degrees. It will be interesting, therefore, to better map HHO1p on the rDNA chromatin. As this region is repeated, our results cannot distinguish binding of many HHO1p molecules to a subset of the repeats from increased uniform binding to all the repeats.</p><p> Our results suggest that while yeast HHO1p is not involved in global chromatin compaction, as is histone H1 in other eukaryotes, it may serve a similar function at the local level. It is particularly interesting that HHO1p is preferentially found at the rDNA locus, since this region apparently has a particular chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c47">47</xref>). It will be very interesting to determine how a <italic>HHO1</italic> disruption affects the rate of polymerase I transcription in this region and whether its chromatin structure is affected. It is not surprising that the steady-state rRNA levels are not different in wild-type and <italic>hho1</italic>&#x00394; strains as rRNA levels are carefully controlled in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c48">48</xref>).</p><p> We believe it is possible that specificity of HHO1p binding to particular regions of the chromatin may be a function of local chromatin structure, rather than sequence specificity. It has been noted, for example, that histone H1 preferentially binds supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c50">50</xref>). HHO1p may bind these and other regions, helping to stabilize chromatin structure, and thus influence accessibility to RNA polymerase. It will be interesting to check these predictions at the locus encoding rRNA. In the light of recent evidence showing the effect of histone H1 phosphorylation on transcription of specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke508c51">51</xref>), it will also be important to probe the phosphorylation state of HHO1p at specific positions in the chromatin and in the nucleus in general.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke508f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Histone preparations from yeast nuclei.
