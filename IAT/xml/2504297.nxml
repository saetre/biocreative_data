We have dissected the direct and indirect components of DNA recognition by CRP employing <italic>in vitro</italic> selection of a random library of DNA-binding sites containing inosine (I) and 2,6-diaminopurine (D) instead of guanine and adenine, respectively. Accordingly, the DNA helix minor groove is structurally altered due to the &#x02018;transfer&#x02019; of the 2-amino group of guanine (now I) to adenine (now D), whereas the major groove is functionally intact. The majority of the selected sites contain the natural consensus sequence TGTGAN<sub>6</sub>TCACA (i.e. TITIDN<sub>6</sub>TCDCD). Thus, direct readout of the consensus sequence is independent of minor groove conformation. Consequently, the indirect readout known to occur in the TG/CA base pair step (primary kink site) in the consensus sequence is not affected by I&#x02013;D substitutions. In contrast, the flanking regions are selected as I/C rich sequences (mostly I-tracts) instead of A/T rich sequences which are known to strongly increase CRP binding, thereby demonstrating almost exclusive indirect readout of helix structure/flexibility in this region through (anisotropic) flexibility of I-tracts.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA-binding proteins achieve a large part of their specificity through direct hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between specific amino acid side chains and functional groups on the bases in the major and minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). However, these direct amino acid&#x02013;base contacts (direct readout), is insufficient to fully explain the specificity of numerous DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">6&#x02013;12</xref>). In the indirect readout mechanism a local sequence-dependent DNA structure is recognized through protein contacts with the sugar&#x02013;phosphate backbone and/or non-specific parts of the DNA bases. In this way, DNA features such as minor groove width, bending and flexibility/deformability of the helix adds another dimension to the recognition event. However, the contribution of the structural adaptations to binding affinity and thermodynamics is at present not fully understood.</p><p>One of the most extensively studied prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins is the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The protein binds to DNA as a homodimer and regulates transcription initiation from more than 100 promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> and references therein) by binding to DNA sequences located upstream from the RNA polymerase binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Comparative analysis of the CRP-binding sites in the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome has established a 22 bp 2-fold symmetrical consensus sequence 5&#x02032;-AAATGTGAN<sub>6</sub>TCACATTT-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21 B22">16&#x02013;22</xref>). Among the binding sites compared, the N<sub>6</sub> spacer sequence between the two half-sites seems to be only very weakly, if at all conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of crystal structures of CRP&#x02013;DNA complexes revealed features such as CRP-induced bending of the DNA helix and suggested a recognition mechanism including a combination of direct and indirect readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>). Upon binding, each CRP monomer interacts directly with the DNA bases G<sub>5</sub>, G<sub>7</sub> and A<sub>8</sub> within the symmetrical half-site: 5&#x02032;-A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>A<sub>3</sub>T<sub>4</sub>G<sub>5</sub>T<sub>6</sub>G<sub>7</sub>A<sub>8</sub>N<sub>9</sub>N<sub>10</sub>N<sub>11</sub>-3&#x02032; by means of a helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motif. The overall &#x0223c;90&#x000b0; bending of the DNA in the CRP&#x02013;DNA complex is a consequence of a primary and a secondary kink in each half-site. The preference for the remaining bases in the consensus is a consequence of an indirect readout mechanism in the sense that no direct protein&#x02013;DNA nucleobase contacts have been identified. Especially, T<sub>6</sub> in the T<sub>6</sub>G<sub>7</sub>/CA base-pair step in the half-site is not in direct contact with the helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motif of the CRP monomer, but is nevertheless highly conserved and known to be involved in the &#x0223c;40&#x000b0; primary kink in the CRP&#x02013;DNA complex observed in the crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). In addition, two smaller secondary kinks are located in the flanking A/T rich sequences outside the T<sub>4</sub>G<sub>5</sub>T<sub>6</sub>G<sub>7</sub>A<sub>8</sub> sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27">24&#x02013;27</xref>) and these sequences also appear to be important for DNA bending accommodated through electrostatic interactions between amino acids and phosphates in the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30 B31">28&#x02013;31</xref>).</p><p>Despite the fact that a consensus sequence has been deduced, most CRP-binding sites in the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) deviate significantly from this, suggesting that the interaction with the protein cannot be determined by the specific base&#x02013;amino acid contacts alone. In general, besides recognizing the bases within the half-sites, a critical factor for high affinity CRP binding relies on deformability of the DNA to accommodate an induced fit between protein and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28 B29 B30">25&#x02013;30</xref>).</p><p>The exocyclic 2-amino group of guanine is an element of prime importance in DNA structure and recognition and has been shown to exert a significant influence on DNA bending, flexibility and intrinsic curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33 B34 B35 B36 B37 B38 B39 B40 B41 B42 B43 B44">33&#x02013;44</xref>). Not only does the 2-amino group obstruct access to the floor of the minor groove in B-DNA, but it also disrupts the pattern of hydration, alters the electrostatic potential in the minor groove and it is the only hydrogen bonding donor available in the minor groove.</p><p>Minor groove width is an important parameter for ligand&#x02013;DNA recognition, and is to a first approximation correlated with the contents of A/T and G/C base pairs (absence or presence of the 2-amino group, respectively).</p><p>The two widely used nucleobase analogues, inosine (I) and 2,6-diaminopurine (D), offers the possibility to study the effect of the 2-amino group in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In essence, the nucleobase analogues I and D keep the major groove information intact, whereas the minor groove properties including width are changed. With respect to minor groove width, we have previously shown that the minor groove width of I (i.e. guanine without the 2-amino group) rich sequences resemble that of A/T rich sequences and that D (i.e. adenine with a 2-amino group) rich sequences resemble that of G/C rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>In order to define regions of structural importance (as opposed to major groove recognition information) in the binding region of the CRP protein, we have studied the interaction of CRP with I and D substituted DNA in solution by employment of an <italic>in vitro</italic> selection system. Accordingly, substitutions in the minor groove may be a unique way to unravel the importance of the exocyclic 2-amino group in recognition of sequence-specific major groove binding proteins whose binding mechanism includes both direct and indirect recognition mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>The wild-type CRP protein was purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) using an overproducing <italic>E. coli</italic> strain and cAMP affinity columns.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA oligos and plasmids</title><p>The primers used were 345: 5&#x02032;-AGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGT-3&#x02032;, 346: 5&#x02032;-ATGACCATGATTACGCC-3&#x02032;, M13 forward: 5&#x02032;-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3&#x02032;, M13 reverse: 5&#x02032;-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3&#x02032;, Pre-bending primer 1: 5&#x02032;-AGCTTGGTACCGAGCT-3&#x02032;, Pre-bending primer 2: 5&#x02032;-CGGCCGCCAGTGTGAT-3, <italic>Lac</italic> promoter 1: 5&#x02032;-CATAAAGTGTAAAGCCT-3&#x02032; and <italic>lac</italic> promoter 2: 5&#x02032;-GAAAGCGGGCAGTGAGC-3.</p><p>The sequence of the randomized <italic>in vitro</italic> selection template was: 5&#x02032;-<underline>AGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGT</underline>ATAT(N<sub>32</sub>)ATAT<underline>GGCGTAATCATGGTCAT</underline>-3&#x02032; where underlined sequence show the location of primer 345 and 346.

All experiments were performed at least in triplicates. In this assay, a mixture of two different sized DNAs (5&#x02013;20 pM), both containing a binding site for CRP, competes for a limited amount of CRP protein simultaneously. After incubation, the CRP&#x02013;DNA complexes are resolved from each other and free DNAs by electrophoresis. Following exposure to phosphor imager storage screens, four different bands were clearly visible and the amount of radioactivity in each band was quantified using STORM Phosphor Imager scanner and Image Quant 5.2 software from Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, California, US.

The result, therefore, strongly suggests that inherent structural parameters such as minor groove width and bending and flexibility, which either may be anisotropic or isotropic in some region of the binding site, are of significant importance for binding. Alternatively, protein-induced deformability may in some regions be diminished upon I and D substitutions. However, the substitutions still allow strong CRP binding due to maintenance of direct amino acid&#x02013;base pair contacts in the major groove of the I and D substituted DNA fragment. Consequently, the experiment demonstrates that both direct and indirect readout are involved in CRP&#x02013;DNA interactions as also previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> selection of CRP-binding sites containing nucleobase analogues</title><p>In order to gain more detailed information on the observed consequence of changing the amino substituents in the minor groove and on the recognition mechanism of CRP, a modified PCR-based <italic>in vitro</italic> selection method was developed, in which I and D triphosphates were incorporated instead of dGTP and dATP, respectively, into the PCR products.</p><p>The starting material for CRP selection was a population of &#x0223c;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>11</sup> different DNA fragments of 75 bp in which the central 32 bp had been randomized.

In contrast, the position of the 2-amino group on guanine and consequently, the width of the minor groove in the 5-bp half-sites seem to be of minor importance in this region.

Interestingly, it is noted that none of the 9 clones with perfect half-sites are among the strongest binding sites.

These two clones are nearly identical in sequence, but clone G8.01 has an A in position +4 instead of a G. This may explain the &#x0223c;3-fold reduction (&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.01</sub> &#x02013; &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.85</sub> = &#x0223c;0.62 kcal/mol) in relative affinity of clone G8.01 compared to clone G8.85.</p><p>In contrast an A in position &#x02212;4 seems to reduce binding since clone G8.08 represents a relatively weak binding site compared to stronger binding sites with a T or C in position &#x02212;4 (compare G8.08 with e.g. G8.03 and G8.05, and also with G8.50).</p><p>Even though the T in the TG step at positions &#x02212;6 and &#x02212;7 in the left half-site is not in direct contact with any residues of the CRP protein, it is highly conserved and known to be involved in a &#x0223c;40&#x000b0; kink in the CRP&#x02013;DNA complexes observed in the crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). Despite the use of I and D we observe that the high preference for a T in this position is maintained. In other words, the base step TI/CD seems to be able to undergo the same major groove compression as the TG/CA step in normal DNA.</p><p>However, in a few cases other base pair steps than the TI/CD at the primary kink site were found among the selected sequences. Specifically, some of the binding sites (clones G8.09, G8.29, G8.30 and G8.82) have a left half-site with the sequence TGGGA or CGGGA, i.e. II/CC at the primary kink site. Selection of these sites may well be explained by the high deformability of the region, since I, due to the absence of the 2-amino group in the minor groove, allows local deformability of the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36 B37 B38 B39 B40">34&#x02013;40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). In fact, our data led us to conclude that a TI/CD base pair step is as deformable as the II/CC base pair step. This is evident when comparing clone G8.05 (TI/CD) with G8.82 (II/CC) and clone G8.01 (TI/CD) with G8.82 (II/CC). These clones are pairwise nearly identical in sequence but contain a different base at position &#x02013;6 (a T versus an I). Nevertheless, there is no significant difference in relative affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Finally, a DI/CT base pair step is found at the primary kink site in clones G8.80 and G8.84, further emphasizing that base pair steps other than TG/CA as in normal DNA can undergo the deformation needed for high-affinity CRP binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of I-tracts outside the 5-bp half-sites</title><p>By inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> it is evident that the flanking regions proximal to the consensus half-sites are very inosine rich and most contain pure I-tracts without IC or CI steps. It is also noted that the clone with the highest affinity, G8.85, has I-tracts on both sides of the consensus site. This is also true for clones G8.07, G8.19, G8.05, G8.82 and G8.01. Other clones like G8.80, G8.29, G8.09, G8.23, G8.26, G8.11, G8.76 and G8.08 have only a single I-tract flanking either the left or the right side of the consensus site. This is in contrast to several of the weakest binding sites, e.g. clones G8.06 and G8.74, which have a perfect consensus sequence but no flanking I-tract. Thus, to a first approximation it appears that I-tracts outside the consensus sequence increase the overall affinity. Based on the measured <italic>K</italic><sub>relative</sub> values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, the significance of the I-tracts may be estimated. Firstly, in order to identify the contribution of a single I-tract clones G8.06 and G8.23 are compared. These two clones have identical half-sites and a nearly identical intervening N<sub>6</sub> spacer region and right-flanking sequence. From this comparison it seems plausible that addition of an I-tract to clone G8.06 on the left side of the first half-site could be responsible for the 4-fold higher relative affinity of clone G8.23 (&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.06</sub> &#x02013; &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.23</sub> = 0.85 kcal/mol).</p><p>Likewise clones G8.76 and G8.01 are very similar, but a T (at position +2) in clone G8.76 interrupts the right I-tract, which may be responsible for the &#x0223c;3-fold weaker relative affinity (&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.76</sub> &#x02013; &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.01</sub> = 0.55 kcal/mol).</p><p>The importance of the I-tracts is obvious if clone G8.23 and G8.74 are compared. Despite minor differences in the N<sub>6</sub> spacer region between the two half-sites, it seems reasonable to assume that the presence of the I-tract in clone G8.74 is responsible for the 8-fold higher relative affinity of clone G8.23 (&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.74</sub> &#x02013; &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.23</sub> = 1.26 kcal/mol).</p><p>In general, sequences with two I-tracts flanking the two 5-bp half-sites constitute significantly better binding sites than sequences without flanking I-tracts. Thus, the presence of the I-tracts may account for the observed difference between strong and weak binding sites.</p><p>These examples clearly show that I-rich flanking sequences increase binding, and to further support this conclusion clone G8.05 was used as a scaffold for synthesizing three mutants in which the right, left or both I-tracts were substituted with a random sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The results from these <italic>K</italic><sub>relative</sub> measurements were a 2-fold reduction in relative affinity when the right I-tract was replaced (&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.05*1</sub> &#x02013; &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.05</sub> = 0.47 kcal/mol) and a 3-fold reduction in relative affinity when the left I-tract was replaced (&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.05*2</sub> &#x02013; &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>G8.05</sub> = 0.67 kcal/mol).

In each experiment, the I&#x02013;D containing fragments (75 bp) derived from clone G8.06, G8.29 and G8.50 competed against their own dNTP containing sequence, respectively (180 bp). ICAP DNA was in these experiments not used as internal standard as the relative affinities for the dNTP containing DNA fragments were off-scale. Therefore, each clone competed against its own sequence. Nevertheless, it was not possible to calculate a <italic>K</italic><sub>relative</sub> value for clone G8.29, as no CRP&#x02013;DNA (dNTP) complex was visible even after long-term exposure using phosphor imager screens indicating a very low binding constant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn452f6"/></fig></p><p>By removal of both I-tracts from G8.05 we end up with a DNA sequence (i.e. G8.05*<sup>3</sup>) that looks very much like clone G8.17 where both half-sites are identical. In fact the <italic>K</italic><sub>relative</sub> values of these two clones are very close to each other.</p><p>Thus I-tracts in the flanking regions apparently have structural characteristics that facilitate CRP binding. Upon binding, CRP wraps the DNA-binding site around the protein surface in order to optimize the fit between the partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27 B28 B29 B30">24&#x02013;30</xref>). DNA wrapping around CRP is accompanied by a compression of the minor groove in the flanking regions 10&#x02013;11 bases away from the dyad axis just outside the 5-bp half-sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27 B28 B29 B30">24&#x02013;30</xref>). Therefore, for a high affinity CRP-binding site this DNA region must be either statically bent towards the minor groove or be (anisotropically) flexible. We note a pronounced strand asymmetry of the I-tracts as for virtually all clones the I-tracts are on the same strand (and thus the C-tracts on the other strand). Since the tracts are 20 bp apart corresponding to two helical turns, this arrangement would indicate that the effect is indeed due to directional bending and/or anisotropic flexibility of these I-tracts.</p><p>It is noteworthy that I-tracts, A-tracts and in general A/T-rich sequences, which have all been shown to increase CRP binding if present proximal to the consensus site, are characterized by a narrow minor groove in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). However, in contrast to pure A-tracts (without TA step), I-tracts (and general A/T-rich sequences) in phase with the helical pitch do not give rise to markedly macroscopic curvature at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42">40&#x02013;42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>), although it has been found that I-tracts may produce slight static DNA bending, which is enhanced at low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42">40&#x02013;42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Several natural CRP-binding sites in <italic>E. coli</italic> contain A/T-rich sequences in the flanking regions, and mutational analysis of the <italic>Lac</italic> P1 CRP-binding site has demonstrated that placing a pure A-tract, which is directionally bent into the minor groove, in the flanking regions, produce much stronger CRP than binding sites than analogous TA containing A/T-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Consequently, and not surprisingly, the strongest CRP-binding sites contain already pre-bent flanking A-tracts. Less efficient but still strong binding sites are expected for helically phased anisotropically flexible sequences followed by isotropically flexible sequences (such as AT-tracts). Weak binding sites contain flanking regions of low bendability (flexibility). The enhancing effect of the asymmetrically positioned flanking I-tracts on CRP binding is therefore most likely due to anisotropic flexibility of I-tracts (rather than static bending).</p></sec><sec><title>CRP binding to <italic>in vitro</italic> selected sequences containing natural dNTP</title><p>Despite the use of I and D in the selection we find strong binding sites with a normal consensus sequence, or minor variations of that, very strongly indicating that the direct readout of CRP in the half-sites are not significantly affected by I and D. However, substituting I and D for the natural G and A bases in the ICAP sequence resulted in a &#x0223c;70-fold reduction (&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> = 2.50 kcal/mol) in relative affinity of CRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Therefore, we ascribe the reduced binding of CRP to I&#x02013;D containing ICAP predominantly (or exclusively) to the binding contribution of the A-tracts which is lost upon I&#x02013;D substitution.</p><p>In order to further dissect the relative contribution of the flanking sequences, we decided to study the effect on CRP binding strength of reverting three of the I&#x02013;D selected clones (G8.06, G8.29 and G8.50 having no, one or two flanking I-tracts) to normal nucleobases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). The relative affinity of CRP binding to the sequence in clone G8.06 is only slightly affected by the presence of normal nucleobases instead of I and D, whereas the relative affinity of CRP binding to clone G8.50 is decreased approximately 25 times (&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> = 1.86 kcal/mol) and that of clone G8.29 &#x0003e; 2000-fold (&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> &#x0003e; 4.4 kcal/mol). These results confirm that the indirect readout of the I-tracts contributes very significantly to the binding energy. From the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A the contribution is estimated to &#x0223c;1 kcal/mol, whereas the data of clone G8.29 in Figure 6B would indicate &#x0003e;4 kcal/mol. The latter is clearly an overestimate since in this case the G &#x02192; I substitution may also affect the consensus recognition through the TG &#x02192; GG change at the primary kink site, which is expected to reduce binding by &#x0223c;1.4 kcal/mol per half-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present results clearly demonstrate that <italic>in vitro</italic> selection employing modified nucleobases such as inosine and 2,6-diaminopurine is a powerful tool for analysing the contribution of direct and indirect interactions in protein-DNA recognition.</p><p>Specifically, we find that with I&#x02013;D-substituted DNA, CRP selects binding sites that have a preferred TITIDN<sub>6</sub>TCDCD consensus sequence, corresponding to TGTGAN<sub>6</sub>TCACA and thus identical to that previously found to be optimal for CRP binding to non-modified DNA. Therefore, the results emphasize that direct readout (occurring in the major groove) in the two half-sites is not significantly influenced by the position of the 2-amino group in the minor groove (and consequently by minor groove width). Furthermore, all the selected sequences contain an inosine in position 7 and the majority of the sequences have thymine in position 6. Thus the 2-amino group does not seem to affect the indirect readout interaction at the T<sub>6</sub>G<sub>7</sub> step, which is responsible for primary kinking in the half sites.</p><p>In contrast, it is clearly demonstrated that the 2-amino group affects the indirect readout component of CRP&#x02013;DNA interactions in the flanking regions one helical turn from the centre of the binding site, where A/T rich sequences have been shown to increase affinity in normal CRP-binding sites. Selection of inosine-rich sequences in these regions emphasizes the importance of flexibility/deformability, known to be present in sequences containing I/C base pairs, as opposed to direct sequence readout. Flexibility introduced by inosine substitutions has previously been shown to account for strong affinity of both the FIS and HMG proteins for their respective binding targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Furthermore the results are in full accordance with previous conclusions on the structural similarities between A/T-rich sequences and I-tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), and finally our results additionally suggest that pure I-tracts are anisoptropically flexible.</p><p>In a simplified model one may consider the DNA recognition of CRP to be divided into four partially independent (half-site) components: the pentameric consensus element, the primary kink site, the proximal flanking region and the intervening (N<sub>6</sub>) region. From the present results it seems quite clear that while the consensus element is recognized through a direct readout mechanism, the flanking regions clearly contribute almost exclusively via indirect readout, as most probably does the kink site, while the contribution of the N<sub>6</sub> region still remains to be established.</p><p>Very strong CRP-binding sites were selected in this study indicating that selection has been rigorous. In the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome most, if not all, CRP-binding sites appear to have half-sites strongly deviating from the consensus. In some cases, as in the <italic>gal</italic> operon half-site sequences may even exist without the two important guanines in the TGTGA (i.e.TITID) sequence found in all the selected sequences. Therefore, some weaker CRP-binding sites severely deviating from the consensus half-site TGTGA (i.e.TITID) may be obtained with a less rigorous selection. This could reveal new interesting DNA structural alternatives (e.g., increased indirect readout contacts that compensate for loss of direct readout contacts) that are capable of forming the CRP&#x02013;DNA complex as exemplified by the sequence of clone G8.29. Such studies are in progress.</p><p>We also foresee that the <italic>in vitro</italic> selection system presented in this study could be very useful for categorizing different DNA-binding proteins with respect to the contribution and magnitude of indirect versus direct readout components to the recognition process.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>This work was supported by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Lundbeck Foundation and the Danish Medical Research Council.
