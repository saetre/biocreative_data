Although a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family, neither a cyclin partner nor a physiological target has been identified. In this report we identify a cyclin, Lsc1p, that physically interacts and co-localizes with Lsk1p. Furthermore, <italic>lsk1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>lsc1</italic>&#x00394;, as well as kinase-dead <italic>lsk1-K306R</italic> mutants, display highly similar cytokinesis defects. Lsk1p is related to CDKs that phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest sub-unit of RNA polymerase II (Rpb1p). Interestingly, we find that Lsk1p and Lsc1p are required for phosphorylation of Ser-2 residues found in the heptad repeats of the CTD. To determine if Rpb1p could be a physiological target, we replaced the native <italic>rpb1</italic> gene with a synthetic gene encoding a Rpb1p protein in which Ser-2 was substituted with the non-phosphorylatable amino-acid alanine in all heptads. Cells carrying this allele were similar to <italic>lsk1</italic>&#x00394; mutants: They were viable, displayed genetic interactions with the SIN, and were unable to complete cytokinesis upon perturbation of the cell division machinery. We conclude that Ser-2 phosphorylation of the CTD heptads plays a novel physiological role in the regulation of cytokinesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> cytokinesis is monitored by a checkpoint system that scrutinizes the integrity of the actomyosin ring.

This domain is a highly conserved component of the RNA pol II complex and is composed of a variable number of repeats (between 20 and 50 depending on species) of the seven amino acid sequence YSPTSPS. This sequence can be phosphorylated on both Ser-2 and Ser-5 residues by a sub-family of CDKs that are related to, but distinct from traditional CDKs involved in cell cycle control. The phosphorylation status of the CTD influences initiation and elongation by the pol II complex, as well as the binding of a wide variety of accessory factors required for the proper splicing, capping, and poly-adenylation of transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Prelich1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Howe1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Lsk1p, as well as <italic>S. pombe</italic> Cdk9p, display significant sequence similarity to human Cdk9p.

We also demonstrate that over-expression of the CTD phosphatase, Fcp1p, as well as mutations in Rpb1p that substitute alanine for serine in the CTD result in cytokinesis defects that are characteristic of <italic>lsk1</italic>&#x00394; mutants.

Since the identification of a cyclin partner would allow us to assess whether Lsk1p activity was regulated by modifications in cyclin stability and/or localization we decided to determine whether such a physiologically relevant cyclin sub-unit existed in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. To this end we compared the sequence of all 13 cyclins in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> genome to the cyclin partners of Lsk1p relatives in budding yeast, mouse, human, and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A phylogeny created by MEGA version 3.1 software using the neighbor-joining algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Kumar1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> predicted that the open reading frame designated SPBC530.13 was the best candidate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). SPBC530.13 encodes a previously uncharacterized protein of 325 amino acids and contains one copy of the conserved cyclin box in its N-terminus. Homology to yeast and human counterparts is mainly in the N-terminal half of the protein containing this domain. Its C-terminus bears no other motifs to suggest other potential biochemical functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). </p><p>To further explore the possibility that SPBC530.13 was indeed the cyclin partner of Lsk1p, we deleted the ORF and examined the loss of function phenotype. We began by assaying the sensitivity of the deletion strain to low doses of the actin polymerization-inhibitor, Latrunculin A. As previously demonstrated, treatment with LatA in the range of 0.2&#x02013;0.5 &#x000b5;M leads to a Clp1p dependent delay in mitotic entry and the extended activation of the SIN. This leads to a prolonged cytokinesis-competent state characterized by continuous repair and re-establishment of the actomyosin ring. Thus, such treatment can be employed as a tool to activate the cytokinesis checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Mishra1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Mishra2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Karagiannis1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>When mutants deleted for SPBC530.13 were compared to <italic>clp1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>lsk1</italic>&#x00394; deletions, they displayed a similar hyper-sensitivity to LatA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, deletion of <italic>lsc1</italic> gave rise to phenotypes characteristic of <italic>lsk1</italic>&#x00394; mutants. These included the inability to complete septum formation upon LatA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g001">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000433-t001">Table 1</xref>), as well as the ability to suppress the lethal, multi-septate phenotype conferred by the constitutive hyperactivation of the SIN (as assayed using the temperature sensitive <italic>cdc16-116</italic> mutation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Minet1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Fankhauser1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).

In addition, mutations in either the kinase or cyclin sub-unit might affect localization and interaction with the associating partner (e.g. deletion of the B-type cyclin, <italic>cdc13</italic> in <italic>S. pombe</italic> prevents the nuclear accumulation of the kinase subunit, Cdc2p) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Booher1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. To first determine the localization of Lsc1p, and also to determine whether modulation of cyclin localization might play a regulatory role in controlling the activity of the constitutively nuclear, Lsk1p, we examined the localization of Lsc1-GFP fusion proteins expressed from a construct integrated at the <italic>lsc1</italic> locus and under the control of the native <italic>lsc1</italic> promoter (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Similarly to Lsk1p-GFP, Lsc1p-GFP was constitutively localized to the nucleus. Its localization was not affected by changes in temperature, cell cycle position, or by treatment with LatA (data not shown).</p><p>To assay co-localization we expressed Lsk1-CFP and Lsc1-GFP fusion proteins under the control of the thiamine repressible <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter, and subsequently expressed them in wild-type fission yeast cells. Consistent with a model in which Lsk1p and Lsc1p formed a complex, both the kinase and cyclin co-localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Lsc1-myc fusion proteins could be detected in anti-HA immunoprecipitates in strains expressing Lsk1-HA, but not in similar immunoprecipitates from strains expressing non-HA tagged Lsk1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, when Lsc1p localization was monitored in <italic>lsk1&#x00394;</italic> or in <italic>lsk1-K306R</italic> mutants, Lsc1p was unable to enter the nucleus and was found distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, GFP-tagged <italic>lsk1-K306R</italic> proteins displayed a similar localization to that seen by wild-type Lsk1p, indicating that Lsc1p mis-localization was not simply an indirect consequence of mis-directed <italic>lsk1-K306R</italic> encoded protein. Lsk1p localization was not affected by deletion of <italic>lsc1</italic> (data not shown).</p><p>As expected HA-tagged <italic>lsk1-K306R</italic> proteins, unlike wild-type Lsk1-HA proteins, failed to show any physical interaction with Lsc1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, Lsk1p kinase activity is required for both Lsc1p nuclear localization as well as the assembly of a functional Lsk1p-Lsc1p complex. Taking all data together, our results strongly indicate that Lsk1p and Lsc1p form a bona fide CDK-cyclin complex that plays an important role in the completion of cytokinesis through its actions as a positive regulator of the SIN. However, no physiological target of the complex was known.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Lsk1p and Lsc1p are required for Ser-2 phosphorylation of the CTD of Rpb1p</title><p>CDKs can be broadly divided into two groups: those that are involved in regulating the control of cell cycle progression, and those that play a role in transcriptional control by directly phosphorylating the RNA polymerase II machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Prelich1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. One specific sub-group is known to phosphorylate the CTD of the largest sub-unit of RNA polymerase II. Since the Lsk1p-Lsc1p CDK was most closely related to this latter sub-groups of CDKs we considered the possibility that it too might affect CTD phosphorylation status.</p><p>We assayed this possibility by utilizing phosphospecific antibodies against the Ser-2 and Ser-5 phosphorylated forms of the CTD. When protein extracts were analyzed, Ser-2 phosphorylated CTD could be detected in wild-type strains, but not in <italic>lsk1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>lsc1</italic>&#x00394;, or <italic>lsk1-K306R</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g003">Figure 3</xref>, bottom panel, lanes 1&#x02013;8). Equal loading was confirmed by blotting for the Arp3p protein. In contrast Ser-5 phosphorylated CTD, as well as the level of unphosphorylated CTD, was not affected in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g003">Figure 3</xref>, top and middle panels, lanes 1&#x02013;8). Experiments assaying the effect of LatA treatment on phospho-CTD levels also did not reveal any differences between treated and non-treated cells in any of these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Over-expression of the CTD phosphatase Fcp1p results in cytokinesis defects</title><p>Given that the Lsk1p-Lsc1p complex was required for Ser-2 phosphorylation of the CTD, we next considered the possibility that a reduction in Ser-2 phosphorylation was indeed responsible for the observed cytokinetic defects in <italic>lsk1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>lsc1</italic>&#x00394; mutants. Two alternate experimental approaches were chosen to test this hypothesis. In the first method, we examined the effects of over-expressing the Fcp1p phosphatase under the control of the moderate strength thiamine repressible <italic>nmt41</italic> promoter. Fcp1p is a <italic>S. pombe</italic> phosphatase that has been shown to preferentially de-phosphorylate synthetic CTD peptides phosphorylated on Ser-2 residues as opposed to similar peptides phosphorylated on Ser-5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Kimura1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Hausmann1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Since the localization of Fcp1p had not been experimentally determined, and since it would need to localize to the nucleus in order to be a physiologically relevant Ser-2 CTD phosphatase, we first examined its localization by creating a C-terminally tagged GFP fusion. Similar to Lsk1p, and Lsc1p, Fcp1p displayed a constitutive nuclear localization that was not affected by cell cycle position, temperature, or the presence of LatA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000433.s001">Figure S1</xref>; data not shown).</p><p>We next examined the phenotypic consequences of Fcp1p over-expression. Remarkably, when Fcp1p over-expressing cells were treated with LatA, they displayed a characteristic inability to complete cytokinesis in both repressing and non-repressing conditions. This was in contrast to cells carrying vector alone, which were able to complete septum formation upon similar treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000433-t002">Table 2</xref>). The fact that Fcp1p over-expressing cells behaved similarly in both the presence and absence of thiamine was somewhat surprising. However, this likely reflects the fact that repression of the <italic>nmt41</italic> promoter is incomplete even in the presence of excess repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Forsburg1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, this suggests that only slight over-expression of Fcp1p is required to bring about a physiological effect.</p><p>We next examined the effects of Fcp1p over-expression on the levels of Ser-2 and Ser-5 phosphorylated CTD. When extracts of cells expressing Fcp1p under repressing conditions (plus thiamine) were examined, Ser-5 phosphorylated CTD could be readily detected. However, under non-repressing conditions (minus thiamine) the levels of Ser-5 phosphorylated CTD were consistently reduced compared to repressed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, middle panel, lanes 5&#x02013;8). In contrast, Ser-5 phosphorylated CTD could be detected at similar levels in the presence or absence of thiamine in cells expressing empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, middle panel, lanes 1&#x02013;4). Furthermore, the levels of unphosphorylated CTD were unaffected by Fcp1p over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, top panel).</p><p>Since, Fcp1p over-expressing cells displayed a strong cytokinesis phenotype in the presence of thiamine, we expected to observe a reduction of phospho-Ser-2 CTD under both repressing and non-repressing conditions. However, while Ser-2 phosphorylated CTD could not be detected in the absence of thiamine, it was clearly observed in cells grown in the presence of the repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom panel, lanes 5&#x02013;8). These results could suggest that slight changes in Ser-2 phosphorylation, beyond the resolution of detection of our Western blots, may be sufficient to result in a physiological effect. Alternatively, the dynamic turn-over of phosphate groups, as opposed to the average level of phosphorylation, may be the crucial factor in terms of phenotypic consequence. As with the level of Ser-5 phosphorylated CTD, the level of Ser-2 phosphorylated CTD was not altered when empty vector controls were assayed in repressing or non-repressing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom panel, lanes 1&#x02013;4). In addition, LatA treatment had no effect on non-phosphorylated, or phospho-CTD levels in either repressing or non-repressing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Although these experiments were suggestive of a role for CTD phosphorylation in the control of cytokinesis, they suffered from two limitations. First, since Fcp1p was being over-expressed, it was conceivable that it might be promiscuously de-phosphorylating substrates other than the CTD. Secondly, Fcp1p over-expression was affecting both phospho-Ser-2 and phospho-Ser-5 CTD levels. Thus it was not possible to determine whether changes in phospho Ser-5 and/or phospho Ser-2 levels were the primary cause of the observed defects in cytokinesis. We thus sought more direct evidence by creating an Rpb1p mutant in which the serine-2 residues of the CTD heptads were mutated to alanine to mimic the non-phosphorylated state.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Lsk1p and Lsc1p facilitate the successful completion of cytokinesis by promoting Ser-2 phosphorylation of the CTD of Rpb1p</title><p>Since the CTD contains approximately 30 heptad repeats, a standard site-directed mutagenesis approach to alter serine to alanine in the CTD of Rpb1p would have been impractical. Thus, we utilized a method adapted from West and Corden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-West1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> to create two Rpb1p mutant strains through the concatamerization of DNA fragments (constituting one heptad repeat) derived from annealed oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g005">Figure 5</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).

Importantly, these mutant <italic>rpb1</italic> genes were integrated by homologous recombination and were expressed under the control of the native <italic>rpb1</italic> promoter. Proper integration of the constructs was confirmed by colony PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000433.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

As expected, when these strains were examined with antibodies specific for phospho-Ser-5 CTD we were able to detect lesser intensity bands with increased mobility in both <italic>rpb1-12xCTD</italic> and <italic>rpb1-12xS2ACTD</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g003">Figure 3</xref>, middle panel, lanes 9&#x02013;12). Also as expected (since the Ser-2 residue is a critical part of the epitope recognized by the antibody against unphosphorylated CTD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Pines1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Kumar1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, down-shifted and lesser intensity bands could also be detected in <italic>rpb1-12xCTD</italic>, but not in <italic>rpb1-12xS2ACTD</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g003">Figure 3</xref>, top panel, lanes 9&#x02013;12).</p><p>However, while we were unable to detect phospho-Ser-2 CTD in <italic>rpb1-12xS2ACTD</italic> strains as one would predict, this observation was made moot since we were also unable to detect phospho-Ser-2 CTD in <italic>rpb1-12xCTD</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We believe this to be due to technical limitations in our ability to detect phospho-Ser-2 CTD. In contrast to the signal obtained when using the phospho-Ser-5 specific antibody (which was readily detectable), signals obtained when utilizing the phospho-Ser-2 specific antibody were consistently only slightly above background. Thus, we believe that the reduction in the number of CTD repeats (from 30 to 12) may have reduced phospho-Ser-2 levels beyond our capability of detection.</p><p>To further examine the phenotypic consequences of the <italic>rpb1</italic> mutations, we performed genetic crosses with <italic>cdc16-116</italic> and <italic>cdc14-118</italic> mutants. Interestingly, the <italic>rpb1-12xS2ACTD</italic> strain, unlike <italic>rpb1-12xCTD</italic>, was able to suppress the lethal multi-septate phenotype conferred by the <italic>cdc16-116</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000433-g006">Figure 6C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000433-t003">Table 3</xref>). In addition the <italic>rpb1-12xS2ACTD</italic> mutant displayed synthetically lethal genetic interactions with <italic>ts</italic> mutations in the SIN component <italic>cdc14</italic> at the semi-permissive temperature of 30&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000433.s003">Figure S3, A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000433.s005">Table S1</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the Lsk1p-Lsc1p complex promotes SIN function and thus actomyosin ring integrity by promoting Ser-2 phosphorylation of the heptad repeats found in the Rpb1p sub-unit of RNA pol II.</p><p>To further examine the effects of Ser-2 mutations, we proceeded to create an <italic>rpb1</italic> strain bearing twelve copies of YEPTSPS heptads in order to mimic the constitutively phosphorylated state. Interestingly, when heterozygous diploid strains bearing the <italic>rpb1-12xS2ECTD</italic> mutations were sporulated, tetrads gave rise to only two viable spores that were phenotypically ura<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. When examined after 4 days growth at 32&#x000b0;C, the inviable progeny had germinated, but formed only microcolonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000433.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Germination of spores on 1.2M sorbitol plates (which often rescues cell wall/morphogenetic defects) did not alleviate the observed lethality (data not shown). Thus, while the absence of phosphorylation on Ser-2 residues is non-essential for growth, mutations that mimic Ser-2 hyperphosphorylation, can not be tolerated in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Taken together these results support a model in which Lsk1p and Lsc1p form a cyclin dependent kinase complex that functions to promote cytokinesis through its role as a positive regulator of SIN signaling. The most surprising and intriguing aspect of this work is the mechanism by which the complex acts. Our phenotypic analysis of <italic>rpb1-12xCTD</italic> and <italic>rpb1-12S2ACTD</italic> strains suggests that lack of Lsk1p-Lsc1p dependent phosphorylation of Ser-2 residues located in the heptad repeats of Rpb1p is responsible for the cytokinesis phenotypes observed in the <italic>lsk1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>lsc1&#x00394;</italic> mutants.</p><p>These results raise the intriguing possibility that alterations in CTD phosphorylation play a more specific and directed role in the regulation of discrete pathways than previously thought. Alternatively, the observed phenotypic effects may simply represent an indirect, and potentially random consequence of altering the core RNA pol II machinery. Two recent findings would seem to support the former interpretation.</p><p>First, work in <italic>S. pombe</italic> has clearly shown that alterations in CTD phosphorylation do not necessarily result in generalized effects on the overall level of transcription. In their recent work, Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Lee1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrate that the reduction of Ser-5 phosphorylation (through mutation of the <italic>pmh1</italic> or <italic>mcs6</italic> genes) leads to the specific reduction of a sub-set of transcripts involved in the regulation of cell separation. Furthermore, the <italic>ts pmh1-26</italic>, and <italic>mcs6<sup>ts1</sup></italic> mutants die with a cell separation phenotype characteristic of mutants that are unable to fully degrade the septum after cytokinesis. Thus, this specific phenotype together with the specific effect on the transcription of a sub-set of genes, showsin principle that changes in CTD phosphorylation can result in selective alterations in transcription and phenotype.</p><p>Secondly, the phosphorylation status of the CTD can be affected by environmental conditions. For example, the level of Ser-2 phosphorylation increases both upon heat shock, and during the diauxic shift in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Patturajan1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, Ser-2 phosphorylation of the CTD (mediated by Ctk1p) is also seen to increase upon exposure to DNA damaging agents such as hydroxyurea as well as UV irradiation. Furthermore, such alterations led to dramatic changes in the transcript levels of genes involved in the response to stress, as well as in DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Ostapenko1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. This responsiveness to environmental conditions, together with specific effects on transcripts required for a wild-type response to the initiating environmental insult, suggests that changes in CTD phosphorylation plays a regulatory role in the control of discrete pathways within eukaryotic cells.</p><p>While it is clear that Ser-2 phosphorylation of the CTD heptads of Rpb1p plays a role in the regulation of cytokinesis, it is still a mystery how a reduction in phospho-Ser-2 levels affects RNA pol II in such a way as to impinge upon the genes required for the successful completion of cell division. The systematic creation and analysis of CTD mutant strains altered in the composition of the CTD heptad sequence, together with expression profiling, will be a powerful tool in understanding how CTD phosphorylation can affect discrete genetic pathways, such as the SIN, within eukaryotic cells.</p><p>Lastly, it is of interest to note that budding yeast strains expressing Rpb1p/Rpo21p with serine to alanine transitions at position 2 display a lethal phenotype that is suppressed by mutations in SRB9/SSN2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Yuryev1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Srb9p is a component of the Srb8-11 complex that forms part of the RNA pol II holoenzyme. This complex is associated with, but is genetically and biochemically distinct from the Mediator complex, and can play both positive and negative roles in transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Myers1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Borggrefe1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The Srb10p and Srb11p components of this complex are themselves a CDK/cyclin pair capable of phosphorylating both Ser2 and Ser5 residues of CTD heptads in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Borggrefe1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. How mutations in Srb9p affect downstream target genes to relieve the lethality caused by S2A mutations is not clear. Most interestingly, however, recent work has shown that Srb9p is specifically phosphorylated by Pka1p. Furthermore, genetic data indicates that this phosphorylation modulates the activity of the Srb proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Chang1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. These data further imply that the core transcriptional machinery may be modified by specific signalling pathways in order to alter the transcriptional regulation of gene sub-sets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains, media, and growth conditions</title><p>All <italic>S. pombe</italic> strains used in this study were cultured in either YES or MM media as indicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000433-Alfa1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

When these pairs of oligos were annealed they created sequences encoding a single heptad repeat, bearing either the wild-type sequence, or sequences encoding either a serine to alanine, or serine to glutamate transition at the S2 position. Resultant dsDNA fragments were also designed to bear ssDNA overhangs that allowed the uni-directional concatamerization of the fragments. Oligos JK71 and JK72, JK72 and JK73, as well as JK78 and JK79 were separately annealed by combining the individual pairs of oligos at a concentration of 50 &#x000b5;M in annealing buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl). The reaction was subsequently incubated at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes, and the reaction cooled to 25&#x000b0;C at a rate of 1&#x000b0;C per minute in a thermocycler.</p><p>Two micrograms of annealed DNA fragments were subsequently phosphorylated in 10&#x000d7;ligase buffer (New England Biolabs) with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C.

Due to the design of the ssDNA overhangs, these annealed, phosphorylated DNA fragments could then be directionally concatamerized in a standard ligation reaction. Products of these ligations were run on a 2&#x00025; agarose gel and fragments in the size range of &#x0223c;200&#x02013;400 bp were gel purified (Qiagen).
