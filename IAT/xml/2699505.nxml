However, it is known that hnRNPs are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing for many genes, including the <italic>Ddc</italic> gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Therefore, we first confirmed that poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) interacts with two <italic>Drosophila</italic> hnRNPs, Squid/hrp40 and Hrb98DE/hrp38, and that this function is regulated by Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase 1 <bold>(</bold>PARP1) and Poly(ADP-ribose) Glycohydrolase (PARG) <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings then provided a basis for analyzing the role of pADPr binding to these two hnRNPs in terms of alternative splicing regulation. Our results showed that <italic>Parg</italic> null mutation does cause poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Squid and hrp38 protein, as well as their dissociation from active chromatin. Our data also indicated that pADPr binding to hnRNPs inhibits the RNA-binding ability of hnRNPs. Following that, we demonstrated that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Squid and hrp38 proteins inhibits splicing of the intron in the <italic>Hsr&#x003c9;-RC</italic> transcript, but enhances splicing of the intron in the <italic>Ddc</italic> pre-mRNA. Taken together, these findings suggest that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation regulates the interaction between hnRNPs and RNA and thus modulates the splicing pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Covalent modification of proteins by Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1) has been found to be involved in a variety of biological processes, including DNA repair, apoptosis, and transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In addition, PARP1-bound poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr), or free pADPr, is able to bind to proteins through a conserved domain in a non-covalent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). This very stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) non-covalent binding to pADPr is equally prevalent in cells and can also modulate protein functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">4&#x02013;12</xref>).</p><p>The concentration and size of pADPr within a cell depend on the relative activity of PARP1 and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), which degrades pADPr polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). While PARP1 is potently up-regulated by environmental stress signals, such as DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) and heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), PARP1 is also required for normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). PARG plays a key role in recycling automodified PARP1 and maintaining homeostasis of pADPr levels in cells. Thus, PARG loss-of-function in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice causes the accumulation of pADPr which, in turn, results in lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>The six major <italic>Drosophila</italic> heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) (<italic>Hrb87F/hrp36, Hrb98DE/hrp38, Squid/hrp40, Hrb27C/hrp48, Hrb57A/Bancal</italic> and <italic>hrp59</italic>) have been characterized. Among them, the following hnRNP proteins are similar to the human hnRNP A/B type, which has two RNA-binding domains and one glycine-rich and M9-like (nuclear shuttling signal) domain: Hrb87F/hrp36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>); Hrb98DE/hrp38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>); Squid/hrp40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and Hrb27C/hrp48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). <italic>Hrb57A/Bancal</italic> encodes a homolog of the vertebrate hnRNP K protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and Hrp59 encodes a homolog of the vertebrate protein hnRNP M containing three RNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Hrp36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), hrp38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), hrp40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), hrp48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and hrp59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) have all been shown to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing, and hrp40 is required for proper RNA localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Recently, we established that Hrb98DE/hrp38 is one of the major proteins associated with PARP1 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Previously, the human hnRNP A1 protein has been shown to have a pADPr-binding motif and can bind with pADPr by an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, whether hnRNPs can interact with PARP1 and bind with pADPr <italic>in vivo</italic> is currently unknown. Furthermore, the biological functions of pADPr binding to hnRNPs have not yet been investigated.</p><p>Therefore, we use <italic>Drosophila</italic> as the model organism to study the regulation of hnRNPs by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Our data demonstrate that pADPr binding to Squid/hrp40 and Hrb98DE/hrp38 does occur <italic>in vivo</italic> and is, furthermore, regulated by endogenous PARP1 and PARG. In addition, we find that pADPr binding to hnRNPs changes the RNA-binding ability of hnRNPs, further modulating splicing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and breeding conditions</title><p>Flies were cultured on standard cornmeal-molasses-agar media at 22&#x000b0;C, unless otherwise indicated.

The co-immunoprecipitation experiment showed that even the wild-type fly has a modest amount of Squid protein interacting with pADPr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Since the co-immunoprecipitated Squid protein had the same molecular weight as the native Squid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), it appears that pADPr binds with Squid in a non-covalent way. To confirm immunoprecipitation efficiency, we reprobed the same blot with anti-pADPr antibody and observed that there were multiple bands, which are poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins or free pADPr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). We further investigated if pADPr binding to Squid could be impacted by regulating the endogenous PARP1 and PARG. Increases of pADPr-binding Squid protein from two PARP overexpression transgenic lines (<italic>UAS-PARPe-EGFP; 69B-Gal4</italic> and <italic>G1-Gal4, UAS-PARP1-DsRed</italic>) compared to the wild-type, by 2.3 times and 9.4 times, respectively, were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). In addition, overexpression of PARP1-DsRed, which represents full PARP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), resulted in a 4-fold increase of pADPr-binding Squid protein over PARPe-EGFP overexpression, which does not have a catalytic domain, but is required for PARP1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and can be modified by PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Indeed, probing the same amount of immunoprecipitated complex from three different genotypes with anti-pADPr antibody showed an increasing order of pADPr level from the PARP overexpression lines (2.0-fold in <italic>UAS-PARPe-EGFP; 69B-Gal4</italic> and 2.9-fold in <italic>G1-Gal4; UAS-PARP1-DsRed</italic>) when compared to the wild-type (<italic>yw</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments also showed that PARG loss-of-function resulted in a 2.7-fold increase of pADPr-binding Squid protein over that of the heterozygous genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). Reprobing the same blot with anti-pADPr antibody showed a greatly increased pADPr level in the <italic>Parg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F), indicating that increased Squid bound to pADPr is positively correlated with pADPr accumulation by PARG loss-of-function. Taken together, both PARP overexpression and PARG loss-of-function result in increased amounts of Squid bound to pADPr. Therefore, we conclude that pADPr binding to Squid occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> and is regulated by PARP and PARG. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Increased amounts of Squid bound to pADPr <italic>in vivo</italic> by PARP overexpression and <italic>Parg</italic> mutation.

To make this assessment, we first used anti-GFP antibody to immunoprecipitate the PARPe-EGFP fusion protein from the PARPe-EGFP transgenic line and further immunoblotted the immunoprecipitated complex using anti-Squid antibody. The 40&#x02009;kDa Squid protein was observed from the immunoprecipitated complex with anti-GFP antibody, but not with preimmune rabbit IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), suggesting that an interaction between PARP1 and Squid does take place. The same blot was reprobed with anti-GFP antibody, and the 97&#x02009;kDa PARPe-EGFP protein was detected, confirming immunoprecipitation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Moreover, automodified PARPe-EGFP was also detected in the immunoprecipitated complex using anti-pADPr antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), suggesting that the interaction between PARP1 and Squid is mediated by pADPr. In addition, RNase treatment of the lysates did not disrupt the association between Squid and automodified PARPe-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), confirming that RNA did not mediate the interaction. Secondly, to determine whether an interaction between PARP1 and hrp38 exists <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used anti-GFP antibody to immunoprecipitate the hrp38:GFP fusion protein from the PARP1-DsRed; Hrp38:GFP fly strain, followed by immunoblotting the immunoprecipitated complex using anti-DsRed antibody.

Our previous studies showed that heat shock results in pADPr accumulation at the heat shock-induced puffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Therefore, we tested if heat-shock treatment alters pADPr binding to Squid. As expected, the pADPr level increased by 2.1 times after heat-shock treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Subsequently, even greater amounts of Squid protein bound to pADPr (a 3.9-fold increase) were observed following the heat-shock treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D), suggesting that the ability of pADPr to bind hnRNPs is up-regulated by the heat-shock treatment.

Therefore, we proposed that increased pADPr binding to hnRNPs caused by either heat shock or PARG loss-of function alters the RNA-binding ability of hnRNPs because of charge repulsion between pADPr and RNA, which, in turn, results in the dissociation of hnRNPs from most of the transcripts. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>The dissociation of hrp38 and Squid from the puffs in polytene chromosomes caused by heat shock and Parg null mutation: hrp38:GFP from the intact nuclei is shown as green in (<bold>A</bold>) through (<bold>D</bold>).

The results showed that the <italic>Parg</italic> mutant had only 47% and 21% of the <italic>dsx-M</italic> expression level in the control line at the third-instar larvae stage and the pharate stage, respectively, which suggests that PARG loss-of-function likely inhibits splicing exon 5 in the <italic>dsx</italic> pre-mRNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp218/DC1">Supplementary Figures S4A and S5</ext-link>).</p><p>In addition, we tested the effect of PARG and PARP on alternative splicing in the <italic>dopa decarboxylase</italic> (<italic>Ddc</italic>) gene. This gene encodes a 2.0&#x02009;kb completely spliced isoform (Ddc-RC) expressed in the central nervous systems (CNS) and a 1.9&#x02009;kb alternatively spliced isoform (Ddc-RB) after skipping the second exon, which is mainly expressed in the hypoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), we found that the spliced transcript (Ddc-RC) relative to the skipped isoform (Ddc-RB), as expressed in the wild-type, increased about 2-fold after heat shock compared to that under the unstressed condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D). We therefore proposed that heat shock promotes splicing of exon B by displacing splicing repressors from the Ddc-pre-mRNA. To test whether hrp38 could be a splicing repressor, we characterized a <italic>hrp38</italic> null mutation (<italic>P[XP]d05172</italic>) which has a P-element insertion in the encoding region of the <italic>hrp38</italic> gene and fails to complement a <italic>hrp38</italic> region deficiency (<italic>Df(3R)Exel6209</italic>). We observed that the expression level of the spliced isoform (Ddc-RC) relative to the skipped isoform (Ddc-RB) in both Squid homozygotes (<italic>Sqd<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) and hrp38 hemizygote (<italic>Hrp38<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/Df</italic>) increased around ten-fold compared to the wild-type under the unstressed condition, suggesting that hnRNPs are splicing repressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp218/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6</ext-link>). Interestingly, both <italic>Parg</italic> mutant and <italic>Parp</italic> overexpression animals (PARPe-EGFP; 69B,GAL4/TM3) also had a very high expression level of the spliced isoform (Ddc-RC) relative to the skipped isoform (Ddc-RB) compared to the wild-type under the unstressed condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp218/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6</ext-link>), suggesting that accumulation of pADPr enhances splicing of exon B, presumably by increased pADPr binding to the splicing repressors (Hrp38 and Squid). It was also observed that the enhanced splicing effect by heat shock was partially abolished in the <italic>PARP1</italic> mutants (a 50% increase in the <italic>PARP1</italic> mutant <italic>versus</italic> a two-fold increase in the wild-type) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp218/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6</ext-link>), suggesting that the <italic>PARP1</italic> gene is required for the heat shock-induced splicing regulation. Taken together, we propose that pADPr binding to the splicing repressors (hrp38 and Squid) on the <italic>Ddc</italic> pre-mRNA results in the dissociation of the splicing repressors from the pre-mRNA, which thereby enhances exon B splicing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our results show that pADPr can bind with both Squid and hrp38 in a non-covalent way <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that PARP1 is required for pADPr binding to Squid, and both PARP1 overexpression and PARG loss-of-function result in increased amounts of hnRNPs bound to pADPr. We also demonstrated that heat-shock treatment upregulates pADPr-bound Squid as a consequence of the increased pADPr level in the cells. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that the ability of pADPr binding to hnRNPs is subject to regulation by PARP and PARG at the genetic level, as well as physiological conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>, which ultimately determine pADPr synthesis and degradation rates in an organism. This is consistent with the observation that the binding affinity of pADPr to specific proteins depends on the pADPr chain length and branching complexity by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p><p>Heat shock has a dramatic effect on the redistribution of hnRNPs in polytene chromosomes, including Squid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and Hrp38 (this report). Upon heat shock, hnRNPs dissociate from most of the transcripts and exclusively bind to one heat shock-induced transcript (hsr&#x003c9;-n) at the <italic>Hsr&#x003c9;</italic> locus, likely serving as the storage speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Here we propose a model which includes the following steps: (i) pADPr-PARP accumulated after heat shock binds with hnRNPs associated with the transcripts. (ii) This binding, in turn, results in the dissociation of hnRNPs from most of the transcripts as a result of either charge repulsion between pADPr and RNA or abolishment of RNA-binding ability of pADPr-bound hnRNPs. (iii) Then, a PARP-pADPr-hnRNPs complex moves into the nucleoplasm where PARG cleaves most of the pADPr. (iv) Finally, the free hnRNPs released from the PARP-pADPr complex bind with the non-coding RNA (hsr&#x003c9;-n) at the <italic>Hsr&#x003c9;</italic> locus. Consistent with our model, we observed that diminished amounts of Squid and hrp40:GFP in the <italic>Parg</italic> mutant are sequestered at the <italic>Hsr&#x003c9;</italic> (93D) locus upon heat shock. Thus, in the <italic>Parg</italic> mutant, it appears that PARG failed to cleave pADPr after heat shock so that only a minimum of free hnRNPs are available to bind to 93D.</p><p>It has been observed that hnRNPs can either promote or inhibit splicing by binding with exonic and intronic splicing enhancers (ESEs and ISEs) and silencers (ESSs and ISSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Since pADPr binding to hnRNPs causes the dissociation of hnRNPs from RNA, we have further proposed that splicing is either promoted or inhibited, depending on whether hnRNP binding takes place with splicing enhancers (ESEs and ISEs) or silencers (ESSs and ISSs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, we first observed that <italic>Parg</italic> null mutation partly inhibited splicing Hsr&#x003c9;-RC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B) and splicing of the <italic>doublesex</italic> gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp218/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). Our results also demonstrate that PARG loss-of-function and PARP overexpression can enhance splicing of the <italic>Ddc</italic> pre-mRNA, which is similar to the effect of heat shock on splicing of the <italic>Ddc</italic> pre-mRNA. It is well known that heat shock can inhibit splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). However, the effect of heat shock on splicing of the <italic>Ddc</italic> pre-mRNA illustrates that heat shock also can also promote splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Our data strongly suggest that hrp38 and Squid are the splicing repressors for <italic>Ddc</italic> splicing since either hrp38 or Squid null mutation results in a very low expression of the skipped isoform which is produced by splicing inhibition. There are several G triplets or quartets in the intron 1 and intron 2 of the <italic>Ddc</italic> gene, which could be intronic splicing silencers (ISSs) for hrp38 and Squid binding (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp218/DC1">Supplementary Figure S8</ext-link>). We have observed that heat shock treatment results in increased amounts of hnRNPs bound to pADPr and the dissociation of hnRNPs from most of the transcripts. Based on this evidence, we proposed that heat shock induces the dissociation of the repressors (hrp38 or Squid) from the intronic splicing silencers in the <italic>Ddc</italic> pre-mRNA as a result of pADPr binding to hnRNPs and that this, in turn, enhances splicing of the <italic>Ddc</italic> pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). It has been reported that heat shock can induce dephosphorylation of a serine-arginine-rich splicing factor (SRp38) to inhibit splicing in human HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Recently, it was also shown that pADPr can bind with human SR splicing factor (ASF/SF2) and further inhibit its phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Therefore, pADPr binding to hnRNPs induced by heat shock could be an alternative to, or a mechanism combined with, the action of SRp38 dephosphorylation to regulate splicing upon heat shock. <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>The model for the modulation of splicing by hnRNP poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.

However, it has been reported that mammalian Parp-1 knockout cells have an increased incidence of alternative splicing within a subset of inflammatory response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the proposed model can be extended to explain tissue- or developmental-specific splicing under normal physiological conditions as a consequence of the spatial- and temporal-specific activity of PARP and PARG in the cell. For example, the maximal accumulation of pADPr was observed at the prepupal stage in the wild-type fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), and we also observed that both pADPr and Sqd accumulated at E74 and E75 loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D) where both genes have several alternative spliced isoforms. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer a dynamic scenario in which pADPr produced by activated PARP1 could transiently bind to hnRNP in puffs for the regulation of splicing at these sites. Further elucidation to confirm the developmental roles of hnRNP poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on splicing will be undertaken in future investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp218/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp218_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp218_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id>(R01 GM077452)</award-id> and the Ellison Medical Foundation (GM27875) [to A.V.T].
