Clinical heterogeneity in the disease phenotype suggests that diabetes in the Oji-Cree may have both genetic and environmental components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). The most common genetic susceptibility determinant is a G&#x0003e;A base substitution at nucleotide 955 (c.955G&#x0003e;A) in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1 homeobox A (<italic>HNF1A</italic>) gene, rare mutations that cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). This variant is found only in the Oji-Cree and is predicted to result in a glycine to serine substitution at codon 319 (p.Gly319Ser; G319S). Almost 40&#x00025; of diabetic subjects carry the G319S variant, with an odds ratio of 1.97 for heterozygotes and 4.00 for G319S homozygotes compared with subjects without the variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>).</p><p>Oji-Cree subjects without the variant show the characteristic features of type 2 diabetes with high levels of obesity, high plasma insulin, and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). The diabetic phenotype of G319S carriers is more consistent with a defect in insulin secretion, with an earlier onset of diabetes, less obesity, and lower insulin levels than in diabetic noncarriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). Although some of the insulin-resistance features that have been reported in Oji-Cree diabetic subjects may arise from their unique genetic background, it is more likely that most of these features arise from the concurrent obesity in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>).</p><p>The G319S variant is located within the proline-rich domain II of the transactivation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>) but outside the regions important for nuclear localization or maximum transactivation capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). In vitro transient transactivation studies demonstrated reduced transactivation activity of the HNF-1&#x003b1; protein by 54&#x00025; compared with the wild-type protein. No dominant-negative effects or influences on protein stability or DNA binding were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). The G319S missense variant results from a base substitution at the most 3&#x02032; nucleotide of exon 4. This base is located within the conserved intron 4 splice donor site, and we hypothesized that the c.955G&#x0003e;A variant might affect splicing. In this study, we determined the sequence and levels of <italic>HNF1A</italic> mRNA transcripts expressed in Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cells derived from a G319S homozygote and two controls. We demonstrate that the G319S variant leads to the production of two abnormal transcripts and disrupts the normal balance of <italic>HNF1A</italic> expression.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The G319S homozygous subject was diagnosed with diabetes at 13 years of age. He was asymptomatic at presentation, with no history of polyuria, polydypsia, or weight loss. He had no acanthosis nigricans, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or evidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. There was a family history of diabetes affecting two maternal aunts, the maternal grandmother, the father, and two paternal uncles. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the Health Research Ethics Board, University of Manitoba, and was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Commercially available human pancreatic RNA was obtained from a pool of five donors aged 24&#x02013;77 years (Clontech, Oxford, U.K.).</p><sec><title>EBV transformation.</title><p>Cell lines were established from the G319S homozygous subject and two unrelated control subjects by EBV transformation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (ECACC, Porton Down, Salisbury, U.K.). Cell lines were maintained in 1&#x000d7; RPMI-1640 (Gibco Life Technologies, Paisley, U.K.), supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (Gibco Life Technologies).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and reverse transcription.</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from &#x0223c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> lymphoblastoid cells using the Perfect RNA Mini RNA kit (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 4.5 &#x003bc;g total RNA using the Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Gibco Life Technologies), with 50&#x000b0;C as the incubation temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of <italic>HNF1A</italic> transcripts.</title><p><italic>HNF1A</italic> transcripts were amplified in triplicate from G319S and control mRNAs as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). Individual splice products were then isolated by bandstab PCR and sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). To investigate the occurrence of variants in <italic>cis</italic>/<italic>trans</italic>, long-range PCR was used with primers EX4FP, EX4FS, EX9RP, and EX9RS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time PCR quantification of G319S and normal transcripts.</title><p>Ectopic mRNA transcripts were amplified from lymphoblastoid cells using a single-tube TaqMan approach on the ABI Prism 7900 platform (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, U.K.). Primer and probe sequences are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. Triplicate single-round reactions were carried out for each cell line using 2 &#x003bc;l cDNA. PCR products were detected by the use of mutation-specific probes that were identical except for the site of the mutation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Final profiles were pooled from at least two separate reverse transcriptions to ensure accuracy.</p></sec><sec><title>Relative quantification of normal and mutant transcripts.</title><p>Relative quantification of the two transcripts was carried out using the equation 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> described by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). The ubiquitously expressed &#x003b2;-2 microglobulin (<italic>&#x003b2;2M</italic>) gene was selected as an endogenous control.

An alternative cryptic splice site 12 bp 5&#x02032; of the native splice donor site was also indicated with a score of 0.94 in both normal and G319S sequences.</p><p>Analysis of cDNA from the homozygous G319S subject revealed four different sequences (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>D</italic></xref>). Transcript 1 corresponds with the full-length <italic>HNF1A</italic> product including the G319S substitution (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Transcript 2 corresponds with use of the alternative splice donor site and the generation of an mRNA transcript lacking 12 base pairs at the 3&#x02032; end of exon 4, which includes nucleotide 955 (the site of the G319S substitution) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). These mRNAs will result in the translation of an in-frame protein of either 631 or 627 amino acids, respectively. Transcript 3 shows a small insertion of 7 bp of intron 4 immediately following the G319S variant (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). This results from the use of a further intron 4 splice donor site 3&#x02032; of the native site. The 7 bp insertion disrupts the reading frame, and a premature termination codon is introduced at codon 332 in exon 5. The fourth transcript shows complete skipping of exon 8 in addition to the 7 bp insertion from intron 4 predicted to result in premature termination at codon 332 (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). Long-range PCR analysis confirmed that the IVS4nt &#x0002b; 7 insertion and the exon 8 deletion are present within the same transcript (<italic>in cis</italic>).</p><p>The four mRNA transcripts identified in the G319S homozygous cell line were quantified by real-time PCR (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). The most abundant transcript was transcript 2, which comprised 55&#x00025; of <italic>HNF1A</italic> mRNA transcripts. This transcript results from the use of a cryptic spice site 12 bp proximal to the native splice donor site of intron 4. The full-length G319S transcript (transcript 1) represented 24&#x00025; of total <italic>HNF1A</italic> expression, with transcripts 3 and 4 at &#x0223c;15 and 6&#x00025;, respectively. The levels of transcripts 3 and 4 were increased 1.6- and 1.7-fold, respectively, by the addition of the translation blocker cycloheximide, which abolishes the nonsense-mediated decay mRNA surveillance pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Transcript 2 was also present in both normal cell lines and in human pancreatic tissue (28, 38, and 17&#x00025; of total <italic>HNF1A</italic> expression, respectively), which suggests that it is a normal splice variant and may not compromise HNF-1&#x003b1; activity (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>The c.955G&#x0003e;A base substitution is predicted to alter the secondary structure of the <italic>HNF1A</italic> pre-RNA (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). When guanine is present at nucleotide 955, the sequences flanking the splice donor site of exon 4 are held in a relatively open conformation, but when adenine is substituted, they are incorporated into a double-stranded region (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). These changes in mRNA secondary structure predict a global change in conformation, which may obscure binding sites for splicing factors.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The <italic>HNF1A</italic> G319S variant may moderate diabetes susceptibility through the disruption of normal mRNA splicing. We detected two abnormal transcripts (transcripts 3 and 4) in the G319S cell line that result in premature termination codons. We also identified a novel isoform, transcript 2, that arises from the use of a cryptic splice donor site 12 bases upstream of the native intron 4 splice donor site. This is the major <italic>HNF1A</italic> isoform (55&#x00025;) in G319S lymphoblastoid cells but was also present in normal control cell lines and human pancreas at lower levels (&#x0223c;33 and 17&#x00025;, respectively). The G319S variant does not completely abolish the use of the native splice donor site, since full-length G319S transcripts were also present (24&#x00025; of transcripts).</p><p>The identification of an mRNA transcript lacking exon 8 was unexpected since this exon is located 4.6 kb downstream from the c.955G&#x0003e;A substitution. Mutations located close to one splice site causing deletion of remote exons have been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>), but they are rare. One possible explanation may be that alterations in the conformation of the nascent hnRNA (pre-mRNA) transcripts may influence both splice site choice and the stability of the resultant mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). The inclusion of sequences from intron 4 may therefore disrupt the secondary structure of the transcript and prevent binding of proteins to additional splicing factors such as exon splicing enhancers. The predicted changes in RNA secondary structure resulting from the intron 4 insertion (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>) are consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>This study has identified a novel <italic>HNF1A</italic> isoform (transcript 2) expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines and adult human pancreas. This isoform lacks the 3&#x02032; terminal four amino acid residues of exon 4 that are not located within any of the regions required for maximal transactivation capacity or nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). It seems unlikely that this isoform would have reduced functional activity. Previous in vitro functional studies of full-length G319S protein showed a reduction in HNF-1&#x003b1; activity by &#x0223c;54&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). This transcript represented 24&#x00025; of total mRNA and is estimated to account for &#x0223c;11&#x00025; of active HNF-1&#x003b1; protein in G319S homozygotes. This, together with the predicted 55&#x00025; activity attributable to transcript 2, suggests that G319S homozygotes might retain up to 66&#x00025; of HNF-1&#x003b1; activity. The levels of active HNF-1&#x003b1; protein in a G319S heterozygote are predicted to be intermediate between these and normal levels.</p><p>The Oji-Cree diabetic phenotype associated with the G319S variant is consistent with reduced insulin secretion and is likely to be a consequence of reduced HNF-1&#x003b1; activity. Our results suggest that the residual level of transactivation activity is greater than that observed in <italic>HNF1A</italic>-MODY, where the mutational mechanism of haploinsufficiency was confirmed by the identification of heterozygous gene deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). The reduction in HNF-1&#x003b1; activity may result from a combination of NMD-mediated reduction in mRNA levels due to the premature termination codon&#x02013;containing transcripts and the reduced function of the full-length G319S protein. The aberrant splicing resulting from the base substitution at the 3&#x02032; end of exon 4 moderates the diabetic phenotype through the upregulation of a novel isoform that is predicted to have normal transactivation activity.</p><p>We considered the possibility that other coding polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes might also affect splicing, but the <italic>HNF1A</italic> coding single nucleotide polymorphisms A98V and I27L are not located close to conserved splice sites or exonic splice enhancers. Our study demonstrates that susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in the Oji-Cree may be mediated in part by aberrant splicing, highlighting the potential utility of mRNA analysis in the investigation of disease susceptibility alleles.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the Research and Development Directorate at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust for funding this study.</p><p>We are grateful to Dr. Heather Dean for clinical collaboration and constructive comments on the manuscript.
