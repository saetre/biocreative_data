It belongs to the spectrum of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 with mutations in <italic>Tau</italic> (FTDP-17T). Here we present the longitudinal clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, neuropathological, biochemical and genetic characterization of the MSTD family. Presenting signs were consistent with the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia in 17 of 21 patients. Two individuals presented with an atypical form of progressive supranuclear palsy and two others with either severe postural imbalance or an isolated short-term memory deficit. Memory impairment was present at the onset in 15 patients, with word finding difficulties and stereotyped speech also being common. Parkinsonism was first noted 3 years after the onset of symptoms. Neuroimaging showed the most extensive grey matter loss in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and frontal operculum/insular cortex of the right hemisphere and, to a lesser extent, in the anterior cingulate gyrus, head of the caudate nucleus and the posterolateral orbitofrontal cortex and insular cortex bilaterally. Neuropathologically, progressive nerve cell loss, gliosis and coexistent neuronal and/or glial deposits consisting mostly of 4-repeat tau were present in frontal, cingulate, temporal and insular cortices, white matter, hippocampus, parahippocampus, basal ganglia, selected brainstem nuclei and spinal cord. <italic>Tau</italic> haplotyping indicated that specific haplotypes of the wild-type allele may act as modifiers of disease presentation. Quantitative neuroimaging has been used to analyse the progression of atrophy in affected individuals and for predicting disease onset in an asymptomatic mutation carrier. This multidisciplinary study provides a comprehensive description of the natural history of disease in one of the largest known families with FTDP-17T.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>frontotemporal dementia</kwd><kwd>progressive supranuclear palsy</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>voxel-based morphometry</kwd><kwd><italic>Tau</italic> haplotype</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by behavioural and personality changes, as well as an impairment of executive function, language and movement (Brun <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1994</xref>; Neary <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1998</xref>; Cairns <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2007</xref>). Following the demonstration of linkage to chromosome 17q21 in a family with an autosomal-dominant form of FTD (Wilhelmsen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">1994</xref>), additional kindreds with inherited FTD linked to the same region were identified (Petersen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">1995</xref>; Wijker <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">1996</xref>; Yamaoka <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">1996</xref>; Bird <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">1997</xref>; Heutink <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1997</xref>; Murrell <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1997</xref>), resulting in the denomination &#x02018;frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17&#x02019; (FTDP-17) for this syndrome (Foster <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">1997</xref>). In 1998, genetic analysis of the <italic>Tau</italic> (<italic>MAPT</italic>) gene on chromosome 17q21 revealed mutations in affected individuals from 9 of the 13 families originally linked to chromosome 17 (Poorkaj <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">1998</xref>; Hutton <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">1998</xref>; Spillantini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1998<italic>b</italic></xref>; Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1998</xref>). More recently, mutations in <italic>Progranulin</italic> (<italic>PGRN</italic>), another gene located on chromosome 17q21, have been associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau-negative, ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) (Baker <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2006</xref>; Cruts <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2006</xref>). A mutation in <italic>PGRN</italic> has also been found in affected members from three of the four original FTDP-17 kindreds without <italic>Tau</italic> mutations (Mukherjee <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2006</xref>; Bronner <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2007</xref>; Leverenz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2007</xref>). Since FTDP-17 can be caused by mutations in two different genes, FTDP-17T is now being used to refer to the disease in individuals with a mutation in <italic>Tau</italic>. Currently, more than 40 different <italic>Tau</italic> mutations have been shown to cause FTDP-17T in individuals from over 100 families (Goedert and Spillantini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2006</xref>).</p><p>During the past 13 years, we have studied the family with &#x02018;multiple system tauopathy with presenile dementia&#x02019; (MSTD), one of the original FTDP-17T kindreds (Ghetti and Farlow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">1994</xref>; Murrell <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1997</xref>; Spillantini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">1998<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1998<italic>b</italic></xref>). The disease in this family is caused by a (g) to (a) transition at position +3 in intron 10 of <italic>Tau</italic>, which results in the overproduction of tau isoforms with 4 microtubule-binding repeats (Spillantini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1998<italic>b</italic></xref>). In normal adult human brain, 6 tau proteins are expressed, with similar levels of 3-repeat and 4-repeat isoforms (Goedert <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1989</xref>; Goedert and Jakes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">1990</xref>). Here, we have used clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, neuropathological, biochemical and genetic data to provide a longitudinal characterization of the disease in a large number of individuals from the MSTD family.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The MSTD pedigree comprises more than 200 individuals spread over seven generations; 51 individuals are known to have had a clinical history of frontotemporal dementia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Clinical information has been collected on 24 affected family members (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Individuals 1&#x02013;10 underwent a baseline clinical and neuropsychological assessment, as well as an annual follow-up evaluation at the Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center (IADC). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was carried out in eight of these subjects (numbers 1&#x02013;4, 6&#x02013;9) and in one asymptomatic mutation carrier, whose personal data are not disclosed to preserve anonymity; this individual underwent baseline and annual follow-up clinical and neuropsychological assessment at the IADC. Clinical information on patients 11&#x02013;24 was obtained by interviewing family members and through examination of clinical records. Data from the neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment, informant interviews and past medical records were used to establish a diagnosis of FTD using standard criteria (Neary <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1998</xref>). A sub-diagnosis of behavioural variant FTD (bv-FTD) was also established using standard criteria (McKhann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2001</xref>). Pathological studies were carried out on 14 individuals whose brains were collected at autopsy (numbers 2, 5, 11, 13&#x02013;17, 19&#x02013;24). The spinal cord was dissected from five individuals (numbers 11, 14, 19, 20, 21). Informed consent was obtained, either from the patients themselves, or from their next of kin.

To obtain additional information, a structured interview was conducted by a research nurse with the patients&#x02019; caregivers. All patients underwent extensive neuropsychological testing. Tests were administered according to standard procedures and interpreted by comparison with control individuals of similar age and education. The clinicians were blind to the results of the genetic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Magnetic resonance imaging</title><p>A 1.5 Tesla GE Signa scanner was used to acquire a heavily T<sub>1</sub>-weighted, spoiled gradient echo sequence (SPGR; echo time = 8 ms, repetition time = 35 ms, flip angle = 30, bandwidth = 15, matrix = 256 &#x000d7; 128, field of view = 24 cm, slices = 124 ranging from 1.1 mm to 1.3 mm thicknesses to assure whole brain coverage). Images were registered at baseline and subsequent annual follow-up visits. SPM2 was used to conduct optimized and modulated voxel-based morphometry (VBM) (Ashburner and Friston, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2000</xref>; Good <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2001</xref>), aided by an automated script designed by Christian Gaser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm.html">http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm.html</ext-link>). For VBM studies, MRI was performed on seven MSTD patients [1 year (numbers 4, 6), 2 years (number 1) and 3 years (numbers 2, 3, 8, 9) after disease onset] and 19 age- and gender-matched controls (patients: four females, three males, mean age 49.0 &#x000b1; 4.7 years; controls: 11 females, 8 males, mean age 49.4 &#x000b1; 6.1 years). Details of the technique are described in supplementary information, Materials and Methods. Whole brain volume (WBV) and ventricular volume (VV) normalized for subject's head size, as well as two time-point percentage of brain volume changes (PBVC), were measured from serial MRI using the SIENAX and SIENA methods (Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2004</xref>). They were assessed during the annual follow-up of the asymptomatic mutation carrier and symptomatic mutation carriers 1, 2, 3, 7, 9. Standard T<sub>2</sub>-weighted coronal MRI images were also acquired.</p></sec><sec><title>Neuropathology</title><p>The brains of 14 affected individuals were collected. Whole brain was harvested from five cases and fixed in formalin. For seven cases, one half of the brain was fixed in formalin and the other half was frozen. For the remaining two cases, only formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks of brain tissue were available. The spinal cord was collected from five cases. For two cases, the entire spinal cord was fixed in formalin; for the other three, representative segments were either fixed or frozen. Tissue samples for neuropathological studies were obtained from representative brain regions. The following methods were used: Weigert's hematoxylin-eosin, Woelcke&#x02013;Heidenhain, Bodian, Gallyas and thioflavin S. For immunohistochemistry, antibodies against tau, A&#x003b2;, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), prion protein, ubiquitin, CD68 and TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) were used. Tau immunohistochemistry was carried out using the following phosphorylation-dependent (p), phosphorylation-independent and conformation-dependent anti-tau antibodies: AT8 (Innogenetics, Antwerp, Belgium; 1:400) pS202/pT205; PHF1 (1:10) pS396/pS404; AT180 (Innogenetics; 1:500) pT231; AT270 (Innogenetics, 1:500) pT181; AT100 (Innogenetics, 1:500) pT212/pS214/pT217; 12E8 (Elan Pharmaceuticals, South San Francisco, California; 1:500) pS262/pS356; CP3 (1:10) pS214; PG5 (1:10) pS409; BR134 (1:500) against the carboxy-terminus of tau; RD3 (Upstate, Charlottesville, Virginia; 1:3,000) against 3-repeat tau isoforms; RD4 (Upstate 1:100) against 4-repeat tau isoforms; Alz50 (1:10) conformational. Additional information is provided in supplementary information, Materials and Methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetics</title><p>Genetic analysis was carried out on 59 members of the MSTD kindred. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood (53 individuals) or brain [fresh and/or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (six individuals)] using standard protocols (Murrell <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">1991</xref>). The <italic>Tau</italic> exon 10 sequence and adjoining intronic sequences were determined as described (Spillantini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1998<italic>b</italic></xref>). Standard amplification reactions were done with 50 ng genomic DNA. The amplified products were gel purified using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and asymmetric amplification performed using the DTCS Quick Start Kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Products were loaded onto a CEQ 2000XL DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter) and sequences compared to the known <italic>Tau</italic> sequence. <italic>Tau</italic> haplotypes H1 and H2 were identified by the presence or absence of a 238 bp deletion in intron 9. When DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, haplotypes were determined by assessing single nucleotide polymorphisms in exons 1, 9 and 11 using previously described primers (Baker <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1999</xref>). Digested products were separated on a 2% agarose gel. Amplification products were digested with <italic>AluI</italic> (SNPs 1 and 11) or <italic>MspI</italic> (SNP 9) and analysed on a 4% agarose gel. <italic>Tau</italic> haplotype was further analysed by genotyping SNPs rs1467967, rs242557, rs3785883, rs2471738 and rs7521 (Pittman <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2005</xref>) using restriction enzyme digestion of amplified products (<italic>DraI</italic> for rs1467967, <italic>ApaLI</italic> for rs242557, <italic>BsaHI</italic> for rs3785883, <italic>BstEII</italic> for rs2471738 and <italic>PstI</italic> for rs7521). <italic>ApoE</italic> genotyping was performed as described (Hixson and Vernier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1990</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemistry</title><p>Tissue samples from the following brain areas were used: caudate/putamen, cerebellum, frontal cortex, frontal white matter, hippocampus and parahippocampus, occipital cortex, occipital white matter, parietal cortex, parietal white matter, temporal cortex and thalamus. Sarkosyl-insoluble material was prepared as described (Goedert <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">1992</xref>) from brain areas of cases number 2 (11 areas), number 5 (nine areas), number 14 (eight areas), number 17 (nine areas), number 20 (nine areas) and number 21 (eight areas). The spinal cords from numbers 20 and 21 were also used. In addition, sarkosyl-insoluble material was prepared from brain areas of two unaffected family members without the +3 mutation (10 areas from each case) and from the frontal cortex of a case with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Sarkosyl-insoluble material was run on 10% Tris/glycine gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The blots were incubated with anti-tau antibodies BR133 (against the amino-terminus of tau, 1:1000) or BR134 (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Aliquots of the sarkosyl-insoluble dispersed filament preparations were processed for immunoelectron microscopy, as described (Crowther, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1991</xref>). Micrographs were recorded on a Philips EM208S microscope at a nominal magnification of &#x000d7;40 000. Antibody BR134 was used at 1:100.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Clinical findings in 10 longitudinally assessed patients with MSTD</title><p>The average age at disease onset in this group of 10 patients was 47.5 &#x000b1; 4.9 years (range 39&#x02013;54 years). Disease duration in the eight patients who are still alive ranges from 2 to 10 years. Two individuals have died 9 years (number 2) and 15 years (number 5) after developing the disease. Behavioural changes and/or deficits in executive function constituted the presenting signs in nine patients (numbers 1&#x02013;6, 8&#x02013;10). They were associated with memory loss in five patients (numbers 4&#x02013;6, 9, 10) and with memory loss and dysnomia in one patient (number 1). Subject number 7 presented with dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, pressure-like headache, up-beating nystagmus and short-term memory loss. He was diagnosed with M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re's disease. He underwent electronystagmography, electrocochleography and brainstem auditory evoked potentials studies, which indicated central and peripheral dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Neurobehavioural changes</title><p>All 10 patients were diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. Disinhibition, social conduct disorder, dysexecutive symptoms, memory impairment and progressive reduction of speech output were evident in patients affected for &#x0003e;3 years, with the exception of subject number 7, whose disease course was slower. For this individual, mild short-term memory problems and slight mental inflexibility were the only cognitive symptoms during the first 6 years of disease, with disequilibrium being the most pressing complaint. More pronounced personality changes and word-finding difficulties developed later.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical signs and symptoms</title><p>Findings were compiled from all 10 subjects seen at various stages of disease (for a more detailed description, see supplementary information, Table 1). Hypomimia and gait abnormalities were observed in the third year. Bradykinesia, symmetric rigidity and postural instability were observed later in the majority of subjects. Resting tremor was not present. One subject developed urinary incontinence. Reduced limb coordination was present in half of the subjects and was seen as early as the third year. Two individuals had speech dysfunction, with one individual developing slurred speech 6 years after the onset of disease, and the other showing a progressive reduction in speech volume after 3 years. Dysarthria developed progressively, culminating in anarthria by the sixth year. Eye movement abnormalities were noted in 4 patients; they consisted of square-wave jerks of intrusive saccades during pursuit and/or vertical gaze reduction. Both abnormalities were first noted after 5 years of disease. Four individuals suffered from a severe inversion of the normal sleep-wake cycle characterized by dramatically reduced nighttime sleep and increased daytime sleepiness. Two subjects complained of dizziness and light-headedness. These symptoms were occasional and mild in one case, but frequent and severely worsened by rapid movements of the head or after optokinetic stimulation in the other. One subject developed dysphagia. Affected individuals displayed mild disinhibition and reduced concentration during physical examination, but compliance to physician instructions was preserved until the later stages of disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Neuropsychological assessment</title><p>Of the 10 patients, nine received a clinical diagnosis of FTD at the time of their first assessment. One individual (number 7) was only diagnosed with FTD during follow-up. In order to identify the early features of cognitive dysfunction, a cross-sectional analysis was carried out on patients with a disease duration of &#x0003c;3 years (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Comparison with a matched control group is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. Despite a relatively short duration of disease (mean of 2 years) and mild dementia (mean MMSE of 25.6), the MSTD patients had statistically significantly lower scores than the controls across a broad range of cognitive domains. The greatest deficits were noted in verbal memory (Word List Memory, Word List Recall), visual memory (Visual Reproduction Recall), confrontation naming (Boston Naming Test) and verbal fluency [Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA)]. <table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Neuropsychological performance of MSTD patients at early disease stage</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected <italic>n</italic> = 7</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Controls <italic>n</italic> = 23</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic> value</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean age (years)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.5 &#x000b1; 4.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.9 &#x000b1; 6.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.58</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (% female)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.54</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Elapsed disease duration (years)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.1 &#x000b1; 1.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.a.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.a.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.6 &#x000b1; 2.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.0 &#x000b1; 0.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Digit Span</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.0 &#x000b1; 5.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.0 &#x000b1; 3.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.095</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Word List Memory</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.9 &#x000b1; 4.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.0 &#x000b1; 3.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Word List Recall</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.7 &#x000b1; 1.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.4 &#x000b1; 1.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Logical Memory</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.4 &#x000b1; 6.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.6 &#x000b1; 7.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.005</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Logical Memory Recall</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.9 &#x000b1; 7.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.4 &#x000b1; 8.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Visual Reproduction</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.6 &#x000b1; 4.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.0 &#x000b1; 3.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.005</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Visual Reproduction Recall</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.2 &#x000b1; 13.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.0 &#x000b1; 5.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Boston Naming Test</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.6 &#x000b1; 12.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.6 &#x000b1; 3.0 (<italic>n</italic> = 22)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Animal Category</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.3 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.7 &#x000b1; 4.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">COWA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.6 &#x000b1; 10.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.5 &#x000b1; 12.0 (<italic>n</italic> = 22)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.005</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Block Design</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.0 &#x000b1; 12.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.0 &#x000b1; 7.4 (<italic>n</italic> = 22)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.05</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Constructional Praxis</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.3 &#x000b1; 1.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.5 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.53</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Constructional Praxis Delayed</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.1 &#x000b1; 3.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.9 &#x000b1; 2.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trail Making A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.9 &#x000b1; 14.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.6 &#x000b1; 6.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trail Making B</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">128.4 &#x000b1; 60.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.9 &#x000b1; 16.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">WCST Category</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.2 &#x000b1; 2.6 (<italic>n</italic> = 6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.4 &#x000b1; 1.2 (<italic>n</italic> = 21)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.01</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">WCST Pers.

The mean disease duration was 10.4 &#x000b1; 5.7 years (range 1&#x02013;21 years). Clinical data were available on 12 subjects (numbers 11&#x02013;22). The presenting signs of disease are known for 11 individuals. Behavioural abnormalities were the initial symptom in 8 individuals (numbers 12, 13, 15&#x02013;18, 20, 22). They were associated with short-term memory loss in two cases (numbers 18, 22) and with short-term memory loss and dysnomia in four cases (numbers 13, 15&#x02013;17). Two siblings (brother and sister, numbers 11, 14) presented with an atypical progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)-like syndrome characterized by dizziness, pressure-like headaches, neck stiffness and postural imbalance (Litvan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">1996</xref>). In addition, subject number 11 reported episodes of tachycardia, increased perspiration, swallowing difficulties, sleep disorder and urinary incontinence.

Unsteadiness and light-headedness were initially experienced in association with rapid turning of the head; they became more frequent and severe later on and ended up being continuous. To reduce discomfort, both patients required proper adjustment when sitting and could not use a car because of severe motion sickness. They experienced neck muscle spasms, as well as numbness and tingling sensations in hands, arms and shoulders; grip strength and coordination were also reduced. On physical examination, they had increased muscle tone, particularly in the neck, as well as hyperactive deep tendon reflexes. They experienced weakness of hand muscles and, to a lesser extent, upper and lower extremities, in the absence of atrophy and visible fasciculations. The Hoffmann sign was present bilaterally, but no Babinski sign was noted. Electromyography revealed signs of denervation at multiple levels of the cervical spinal cord and scattered fasciculations of hand muscles. Mild intentional tremor and impaired alternating movements were noted during the finger-to-nose test. Both patients exhibited limitation of neck extension, reduced superior gaze, pursed lips and swallowing difficulties. Sensory findings were normal. Subject number 11 died of aspiration pneumonia almost 1 year after disease onset without displaying cognitive alterations. Subject number 14 became unable to walk and developed resting and intentional tremor, mild global cognitive decline, reduced verbal fluency and naming. She died suddenly 6 years after disease onset.</p><p>Data from a neurological evaluation were available for 9 of the 14 patients.

RD3 labelled virtually all flame-shaped and perinuclear NFTs that were also RD4-immunoreactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>A and B). In addition, a few tau-immunoreactive neurons and flame-shaped NFTs in the neocortex of patient number 5, as well as a few neurons in the locus coeruleus of case number 2, were reactive with antibody RD3.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Genetic analysis and phenotypic correlation</title><p>A (g) to (a) transition at position +3 of the 5&#x02032; splice site of intron 10 of <italic>Tau</italic> was present in 30 of the 59 individuals investigated.

Cases 2, 5, 17, 20 and 21 showed a substantial filament load in frontal and temporal lobes, with smaller numbers of filaments in parietal and occipital lobes. Filaments were particularly abundant in frontal and parietal white matter, probably reflecting the presence of abundant glial cell inclusions. Where examined, numerous filaments were present in caudate/putamen, hippocampus, parahippocampus, thalamus and spinal cord. The cerebellum was devoid of tau filaments. Overall, the distribution and relative abundance of tau filaments in 5 cases were consistent with a disease process prominently affecting the frontal and temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex. This was not true of case number 14, who lacked tau filaments in frontal and temporal lobes and had a filament load that was less severe than that of the other five cases.

The same was true of sarkosyl-insoluble tau from the spinal cord of case number 21 (data not shown). In contrast, immunoblots of sarkosyl-insoluble tau from brain and spinal cord of case number 20 displayed three major tau bands of 60, 64 and 68 kDa, as well as the minor 72 kDa band, in keeping with the presence of PHFs and SFs by immunoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figs 11</xref>J and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). The 60 kDa band was less intense than the 64 and 68 kDa bands. No pathological tau bands were detected in the equivalent brain areas from two unaffected members of the MSTD kindred.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The MSTD family was the first known kindred with a +3 mutation in the intron following exon 10 of <italic>Tau</italic> (Spillantini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1998<italic>b</italic></xref>). Subsequently, two additional kindreds with this mutation were identified (Tolnay <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2000</xref>; Neumann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2005</xref>). Here, we present a comprehensive study of 24 affected individuals of the MSTD kindred. Age at onset of disease ranged from 39 to 58 years and the disease duration was 1&#x02013;21 years. The bv-FTD was the most common clinical presentation in the MSTD family. It was seen in 17 of the 21 affected individuals for whom sufficient clinical information was available. Five of these patients had a pure behavioural syndrome, with 12 patients also presenting with memory impairment. The second most common clinical presentation was an atypical PSP-like syndrome, which was present in two individuals, one of whom also had memory deficits. Another patient presented with severe postural imbalance; however, coexistent M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re's disease may have contributed to the severity of symptoms. This patient also presented with memory loss and developed personality changes, as well as dysexecutive symptoms. One patient presented with an isolated short-term memory deficit. These findings indicate that memory loss is a common presenting sign in MSTD.</p><p>Early-stage MSTD patients with bv-FTD, studied by MRI-based VBM and compared to age-matched controls, had the most extensive grey matter loss in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and frontal operculum/insular cortex of the right hemisphere. This pattern strongly resembles that observed in a group of FTDP-17 subjects with the exon 10 + 16 <italic>Tau</italic> mutation (Whitwell <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">2005</xref>). To a lesser extent, MSTD patients also displayed grey matter loss in the anterior cingulate gyrus, head of the caudate nucleus, posterolateral orbital cortex and insular cortex bilaterally. These data suggest a pattern of early grey matter loss in limbic, cortical and subcortical regions, which have extensive prefrontal-frontal connections. This was reflected in the patients&#x02019; early symptoms, which were marked by behavioural changes and memory loss, suggestive of prefrontal and hippocampal dysfunction. Bilateral atrophy of the orbitofrontal and insular cortices, as well as impaired metabolic activity of the same regions, have previously been reported in FTD in association with disinhibition (Rosen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2002</xref>; Peters <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2006</xref>). Furthermore, behavioural changes have been associated with atrophy or impairment of the anterior cingulate gyrus (Salmon <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2003</xref>; Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2004</xref>; Williams <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2005</xref>). In contrast, the early involvement of hippocampus and parahippocampus observed in MSTD has not been consistently seen in FTDP-17T or FTD generally.</p><p>Little is known about the progression of anatomical changes in FTDP-17T along the disease course. In our study, the longitudinal evaluation of brain volume revealed a near linear increase in brain atrophy in affected mutation carriers, similar to what has been described for two siblings with the S305N mutation in <italic>Tau</italic> (Boeve <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2005</xref>). In an MSTD asymptomatic mutation carrier followed for 7 years, brain atrophy was slowly progressive for the first 2 years, but has been increasing in a near linear fashion since. Brain volume and rate of atrophy now approach those of affected mutation carriers. This trend parallels that of the progressive cognitive decline evidenced by neuropsychological assessment. Performance on a test of verbal learning is now below the fifth percentile of controls. Additional scores on tests for verbal memory, verbal fluency and response inhibition are now close to the cut-off of affected individuals. Several biomarkers have been proposed in order to identify FTDP-17 disease onset (Alberici <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2004</xref>; Arvanitakis <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2007</xref>). Our findings suggest the usefulness of quantitative brain imaging for determining and predicting disease onset in FTDP-17T.</p><p>A new finding emerging from this study is the identification of individuals affected with a phenotypic variant of MSTD, resembling an atypical PSP-like syndrome. The observed clinical heterogeneity extends knowledge derived from similar findings in other FTDP-17T families (Bugiani <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1999</xref>) and further supports an aetiological relationship between FTD and PSP (Kertesz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2003</xref>). Previously, different mutations in <italic>Tau</italic> were also found to give rise to atypical PSP-like syndromes (Delisle <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1999</xref>; Stanford <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2000</xref>; Pastor <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2001</xref>; Poorkaj <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2002</xref>; Ros <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2005</xref>; Van Swieten and Spillantini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2007</xref>). Genetic modifiers may have a strong influence on the initial clinical presentation of disease in the MSTD family. The mutation occurred on the background of at least one H2 <italic>Tau</italic> allele, with no statistically significant differences in age at onset and disease duration between mutation carriers with haplotypes H1H2 and H2H2. This finding is consistent with the results of a previous study (Baba <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2005</xref>). Since it has been shown that specific H1 <italic>Tau</italic> sub-haplotypes are differently associated with the risk to develop tauopathies (Pittman <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2005</xref>), we analyzed <italic>Tau</italic> sub-haplotypes in our group of MSTD individuals. Interestingly, the two subjects (brother and sister), who presented with an atypical PSP-like phenotype, were carriers of an H1C <italic>Tau</italic> haplotype wild-type allele, which has been associated with an increased risk to develop PSP (Pittman <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2005</xref>) and increased expression of 4-repeat tau isoforms (Myers <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2007</xref>). The synergistic effects of an H1C haplotype in the wild-type allele and the exon 10 + 3 mutation in the pathogenic allele may have played a role in giving rise to the clinical presentation of atypical PSP in these two siblings. However, a third subject with the H1C haplotype in the wild-type allele did not develop signs of PSP. This individual belongs to a different branch of the pedigree from that of the two siblings and has thus a different genetic background, suggesting that additional genetic modifiers may also play a role. The small sample size prevented us from investigating statistical correlations between specific <italic>Tau</italic> sub-haplotypes and clinicopathological findings. Since the large majority of affected subjects was homozygous for the <italic>ApoE</italic> &#x003b5;3 allele, we were unable to study the role of <italic>ApoE</italic> genotype as a genetic modifier of MSTD.</p><p>Language dysfunction was found in 8 of the 21 patients at disease onset and in a total of 20 individuals along the disease course. It was mostly characterized by naming difficulties, stereotyped speech and reduced verbal fluency, resulting in late mutism. Reduced verbal fluency and, to a lesser extent, executive functioning have been reported as the most consistent early feature of cognitive dysfunction in FTDP-17T individuals (Van Swieten <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">1999</xref>; Ferman <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2003</xref>). Parkinsonism was only noted in the third year of disease, with limb incoordination appearing in year 4, and frontal release signs, eye movement disorders and sleep abnormalities in year 5.</p><p>The neuropathological correlates of MSTD were investigated in 14 patients, 12 of whom had suffered from bv-FTD and two from atypical PSP. In cases with FTD of long duration, atrophy of the frontotemporal lobes and the cingulate gyrus was extensive, with less neurodegeneration in parietal and occipital lobes. Hippocampal formation and striatum were also severely affected, as were substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve.</p><p>The involvement of selected brainstem nuclei may explain some of the clinical features of MSTD. Thus, sleep-wake cycle disruption (7/19 subjects) may have resulted from neurodegeneration in locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and pontine reticular formation, as well as in the limbic system, all regions known to be important for sleep-wake cycle regulation (Sakurai, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2007</xref>).</p><p>Motor system pathology was characterized by mild cell loss and tau pathology in giant pyramidal cells of Brodmann area 4, as well as mild loss of axons and myelin in the corticospinal tract. The spinal cord consistently showed nerve cell loss in the anterior horn, similar to what has been described for a case with the N279K mutation in <italic>Tau</italic> (Slowinski <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2007</xref>). Vulnerability of motor neurons to tau-induced neurodegeneration is also supported by the phenotypes of some transgenic mouse models of human tauopathies (Lewis <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2000</xref>; Allen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2002</xref>). Tau pathology was consistently detected in neurons of lamina VII. In most cases, motor neurons in lamina IX contained strongly tau-immunoreactive deposits. However, in one case, lamina IX was free of deposits. Additional studies are necessary to verify the existence of a heterogeneous pattern of tau pathology in the spinal cord of different MSTD patients. These findings may explain the presence of pyramidal/motor neuron disease signs in some patients and motor incoordination, possibly secondary to pathology of different descending pathways (e.g. reticulospinal and vestibulospinal), in others (Schoenen and Grant, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2004</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the severity of neurodegeneration in MSTD was proportional to disease duration. Cases with an atypical PSP-like syndrome were of either short (1 year) or intermediate (6 years) disease duration. They had much less pathology in the cerebral cortex than cases with FTD, with similar changes in subcortical areas. By immunohistochemistry, deposits made of hyperphosphorylated tau protein were present in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in all affected brain regions. Oligodendroglial inclusions were particularly numerous in subcortical white matter in all cases, consistent with our previous findings (Spillantini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">1997</xref>; Spillantini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">1998<italic>a</italic></xref>). In some cases, tufted astrocytes and astrocytic plaques were also present.</p><p>Tau inclusions were mostly made of 4-repeat tau, in keeping with the known effects of the +3 intronic mutation on the splicing of exon 10 of <italic>Tau</italic> (Spillantini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1998<italic>b</italic></xref>; Varani <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">1999</xref>). Ultrastructurally, tau filaments had the appearance of twisted ribbons or half ribbons, in line with our earlier work (Spillantini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">1997</xref>). Relative filament numbers correlated well with the level of tau staining in a given brain region and the magnitude of neurodegeneration therein. One case showed a large number of Alzheimer-type PHFs and SFs, in addition to ribbon-like filaments. By immunohistochemistry, tau inclusions in this case were made of 3- and 4-repeat tau. By immunoblotting, pathological tau bands of 60, 64, 68 and 72 kDa were present, as is the case in Alzheimer's disease (Goedert <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">1992</xref>). However, unlike what is observed in Alzheimer's disease, the 60 kDa band was weaker than the 64 and 68 kDa bands, consistent with the presence of more ribbon-like filaments than PHFs and SFs. This case constitutes an exception to the rule that the overexpression of human 4-repeat tau isoforms results in the formation of inclusions made solely of 4-repeat tau (Goedert and Spillantini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2006</xref>; Van Swieten and Spillantini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2007</xref>). The mechanisms leading to the coexistence of filaments made of 4-repeat tau only and of all 6 tau isoforms remain to be established.</p><p>In summary, this multidisciplinary and longitudinal characterization of the MSTD kindred has provided new insights into the neurodegenerative process: (i) mutation +3 in intron 10 of <italic>Tau</italic> can give rise to a clinical and neuropathological picture of either FTD or atypical PSP; (ii) <italic>Tau</italic> haplotype of the wild-type allele may act as a genetic modifier of disease presentation; (iii) early-onset memory loss and hippocampal atrophy are common findings in MSTD; (iv) quantitative neuroimaging may be useful in predicting disease onset in FTDP-17T; (v) neurodegeneration in MSTD involves various neurological systems, including prefrontal and limbic cortical/subcortical regions, hippocampus, parahippocampus, selected brainstem nuclei and spinal cord.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Brain</italic> online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are indebted to the MSTD family members and caregivers for their enthusiastic commitment and participation in this study.
