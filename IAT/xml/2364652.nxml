Recently, the role of AQPs in human carcinogenesis has become an area of great interest. Here, by immunohistochemistry (IHC), we have found an expression of AQP5 protein in 35.3&#x00025; (IHC-score: &#x02265;1, 144/408) of the resected NSCLC tissue samples. Cases with AQP5-positive status (IHC-score: &#x02265;2) displayed a higher rate of tumor recurrence than negative ones in NSCLC (54.7&#x00025; vs. 35.1&#x00025;, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.005) and worse disease-free survival (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.033; OR&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.52; 95&#x00025;CI:1.04&#x02212;2.23). Further <italic>in vitro</italic> invasion assay using BEAS-2B and NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with overexpression constructs for full length wild-type AQP5 (AQP5) and its two mutants, N185D which blocks membrane trafficking and S156A which blocks phosphorylation on Ser156, showed that AQP5 induced cell invasions while both mutants did not. In BEAS-2B cells, the expression of AQP5 caused a spindle-like and fibroblastic morphologic change and losses of cell-cell contacts and cell polarity. Only cells with AQP5, not either of two mutants, exhibited a loss of epithelial cell markers and a gain of mesenchymal cell markers. In a human SH3-domains protein array, cellular extracts from BEAS-2B with AQP5 showed a robust binding activity to SH3-domains of the c-Src, Lyn, and Grap2 C-terminal. Furthermore, in immunoprecipitation assay, activated c-Src, phosphorylated on Tyr416, showed a stronger binding activity to cellular extracts from BEAS-2B with AQP5 compared with N185D or S156A mutant. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis failed to show evidence of genomic amplification, suggesting AQP5 expression as a secondary event. Based on these clinical and molecular observations, we conclude that AQP5, through its phosphorylation on Ser156 and subsequent interaction with c-Src, plays an important role in NSCLC invasion and, therefore, may provide a unique opportunity for developing a novel therapeutic target as well as a prognostic marker in NSCLC.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The aquaporins (AQP) represent a family of transmembrane water channel proteins widely distributed in various tissues throughout the body and play a major role in transcellular and transepithelial water movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-King1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Verkman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have previously demonstrated the expression of AQP1 in human primary lung cancer tissues; 18 out of 44 samples of non small cell lung cancer patients showed positive AQP1 protein expression. However, it has been shown that AQP5 showed more robust oncogenic potential than AQP1 as well as AQP3 in soft agar assay, focus formation assay, and cell proliferation (MTT) assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Hoque1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, leading us to choose AQP5 for its role in lung carcinogenesis not only for clinical validation study but also for studies in its underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Here, we present both molecular and clinical evidence that AQP5 may play a role in the progression of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). First, based on immunohistochemical analysis of hAQP5 with 408 NSCLC tissues, we have investigated whether expression profile of AQP5 in human lung cancer correlates with disease progression and survival. Then, we have performed invasion assay and epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker study in human bronchial epithelial cells overexpressing AQP5 versus its mutants in addition to mock control, followed by further molecular interaction studies to elucidate AQP5 mediated pathway. Moreover, FISH analysis was done to identify molecular mechanisms underlying hAQP5 expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (Rockville, MD).

Clones were confirmed by restriction analysis and by DNA sequencing of both strands. Serine 156 or Asparagine 185 was replaced with alanine or aspartic acid, respectively, by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to produce the S156A or N185D AQP5 mutant based on the AQP5 pcDNA3.1 construct as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. AQP5 WT and two mutants were inserted into the EcoR I and BamH I sites of p3XFLAG-CMV-14 (SIGMA) and verified by DNA sequencing of both strands of the mutants. Expression constructs were transfected into NIH3T3 and BEAS2B cells with FuGENE 6 according to manufacturer's recommendations. All transfectants were selected with 800 &#x000b5;g/mL G418 for 3 weeks and selected clones were screened with Western blot using AQP5 antibody and/or RT-PCR. When confluent, cells were subcultured by trypsinization (0.05&#x00025; trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution). The pictures that show the morphologies of various stable cells expressing different constructs were taken through phase contrast microscopy (ECLIPSE TE300, Nikon Co., Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Invasion assay</title><p>Matrigel invasion assay was performed with NIH3T3 and BEAS2B cells. BioCoat Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) that reconstitutes the basal membrane was purchased to assess cell invasion. 24-well tissue culture plate inserts coated with Matrigel were re-hydrated for 2 hours in 37&#x000b0;C media. Media (0.6 ml) containing 5&#x00025; fetal bovine serum was added to each plate well as a chemoattractant, and 0.2 ml (2&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells) of cell suspension was added to each insert. After incubation for 24 hours, non-invading cells were removed from the upper side of the membrane by scrubbing. To minimize the effect of cell proliferation on the invasion assay, we have confirmed that, in the first 24 hours, BEAS-2B cells undergo minimal cell division and do not show any noticeable difference in cell proliferation between cells expressing AQP5 and cells expressing mock vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002162.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Invasion of cells to the underside of the Matrigel-coated membrane was detected by staining the cells with Mayer's hematoxylin solution and visualizing the cells under a microscope. After staining, cells were counted under a microscope in four randomly selected fields (magnification &#x000d7;100) and results were expressed in the form of a bar graph. Assays were performed with triplicate wells for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation</title><p>Lysates from cultured cells and tissues were prepared in ice-cold NP-40 lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mM NaCl, 10&#x00025; glycerol and 0.1&#x00025; Nonidet P-40) containing an inhibitor cocktail of 10 mM &#x003b2;-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM Na orthovanadate, 4.5 U/ml aprotinin (Sigma), and 1 &#x000b5;g/ml leupeptin (Sigma).

Phospho-Src antibody was first used; blots then were stripped and re-blotted with anti-src and beta-actin antibodies. Appropriate anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1&#x02236;3000; Amersham) were used.

The probe for AQP5 detection was derived from Homo sapiens 12 BAC RP11-469H8 containing the whole AQP5 gene (GenBank Accession no. AC025154), and labeled with rhodamin (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). Two genomic DNA clones with 91 kb and 68 kb sizes franking 12p13.31 region labeled with FITC were used as control probes (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). FISH was performed using Vysis reagents according to the manufacturer's protocols (Vysis, IL, USA). Slides were counterstained with 4, 6-diamidino 2-phenylindole for microscopy.

Prognostic factors were examined by both univariate and multivariate analyses. In multivariate analysis, age, sex, histological grade, and tumor stage were accounted for. We did not control for treatment methods since a majority of the patients underwent surgery and the TNM stage based on which treatment modalities are decided, demonstrated no association with AQP5 expression.

In order to investigate whether AQP5 overexpression promotes cell invasion in human bronchial epithelial cells and, at the same time, to determine what components of AQP5 protein plays a role in the process, we first performed Matrigel invasion assay in BEAS-2B cell lines stably expressing AQP5 and its two mutants, N185D which blocks membrane trafficking and S156A which blocks phosphorylation on S156 site of AQP5 molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

This report, although provided certain insight regarding the role of AQPs in NSCLC, did not demonstrate either its clinical implication or related molecular pathways. In our preliminary study for AQP5 in NSCLC, we noticed a series of AQP5 expression in several NSCLC cell lines including H1975, H1838, H1650, H1437, and H838. In addition, similar to our observations with NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, we have recently identified that AQP5 overexpression in BEAS-2B cells induces activation of the ERK pathway leading to stimulation of cell proliferation (Kang et al., manuscript in preparation); human bronchial epithelial cells stably transfected with AQP5 demonstrated significantly higher proliferation rate than cells stably transfected with mock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002162.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Based on these preliminary findings and prior observations we had with AQP1 in NSCLC and AQP5 in colorectal cancer study, we have examined the expression profile of AQP5 in a large panel of clinical samples.</p><p>While expression of AQP5 in its message level is reported in certain parts of normal human bronchial and alveolar tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Kreda1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, so far, AQP5 expression profiles in NSCLC tissue samples, in its protein level, have not been reported. In order to find clinical implications of AQP5 overexpression in NSCLC, we have gathered resected human NSCLC tissues with an average of five year follow-up, on which we performed immunochemistry to examine the protein expression level of AQP5. While we found AQP5 expression in cancer cells, we did not see any evidence of AQP5 immunoreactivity among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which is contrary to our previous findings showing an induced expression of AQP5 messages during lymphocytes activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Moon3">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this discrepancy can be a result of multiple reasons, it is possible that AQP5 expression during lymphocyte activation can be a temporary event and that, once lymphocytes are activated, they may downregulate AQP5 expression.</p><p>We have identified three interesting expression profiles of AQP5 protein in NSCLC with clinical correlation. First, an expression of AQP5 protein is noticed in 35.3&#x00025; (144/408, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002162-t001">Table 1</xref>.) of the resected NSCLC tissue samples. Second, NSCLC cases with AQP5-positive status displayed a higher rate of tumor recurrence than negative ones (54.7&#x00025; vs. 35.1&#x00025;, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.005). Third, AQP5 overexpression in NSCLC was significantly associated with earlier disease progression (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.033; OR&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.52; 95&#x00025; CI 1.04&#x02212;2.23) and worse disease-free survival. We believe that this is the first clinical evidence indicating a strong correlation between AQP5 expression and the outcome of cancer patients who underwent surgery, and further suggest that hAQP5 is a potential independent prognostic marker. Moreover, the fact that this study is based on a substantial size of patient samples (more than four hundred cases) with an average of 5 year follow-up corroborates our findings.</p><p>The prognostic marker for lung cancer is crucial as there are still on-going controversies regarding the post-operative management and follow-up plans for NSLCLC. Although the needs and the effects of post-operative chemotherapy are relatively well established, there seem to be few candidate prognostic biomarkers from which the decisions for chemotherapy can be made <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Vielh1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Singhal1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Part of this problem stems from the fact that most of the studies were based on the sample size of less than 200 with an average follow-up year of less than 5 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Singhal1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Only a few molecular marker studies published used a sample size of above 400 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Pastorino1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-DAmico1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Looking at a 50&#x00025; increase in terms of recurrence risk in AQP5 positive group vs. negative group among more than 400 samples with up to 7 year follow-up, study of AQP5 expression in addition to other prognostic markers in surgical samples may provide a dependable guidance for making a better informed decision for postoperative management in NSCLC patients.</p><p>Based on our observations with clinical samples from NSCLC and also from our previous observation in colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Kang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, where AQP5 expression was detected in patients with liver metastasis, we hypothesized that AQP5 is associated with cell invasion. For our invasion assay, we have decided to use BEAS-2B stable cell lines stably transfected with AQP5 overexpression construct and those of two mutants. BEAS-2B is a SV-40 transformed immortalized cell lines originated from normal lung epithelium that has been used extensively as a model cell line to examine the molecular events leading to NSCLC development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Ke1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, we had previously reported that in BEAS-2B cells, membranous expression of AQP5 is not necessarily associated cAMP induced phosphorylation of AQP5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we have used full length wild-type AQP5(AQP5) and its two mutants, S156A and N185D, to examine the effect of PKA pathway (S156A) and NPA motif related with membrane trafficking (N185D), respectively, on cell invasion activity of BEAS-2B. We did so based on our previous finding that in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, while decreased cell proliferation in S156A mutant was due to the poor activation of Ras/ERK pathway, in the case of N185D mutant, it was owing to the improper trafficking of AQP5 into the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, AQP5 induced cell invasion in BEAS-2B cells as well as NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, both of the N185D and S156A mutants failed to induce any significant cell invasion in either BEAS-2B cells or NIH3T3 cells compared with mock. Overall, our result suggests that both phosphorylation of AQP5 in PKA site (S156A) and membrane targeting (N185D) are likely to be critical for the enhanced cell invasion induced by AQP5.</p><p>Of note, we have found that the expression of AQP5 in BEAS-2B cells promotes both cell invasion and proliferation. Interestingly, even before we see the effects of cell proliferation, cells become highly invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002162-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002162.s001">Fig S1</xref>). This may explain, in part, why some of the lung cancers are highly invasive in nature and easily metastasize even when the size of tumor mass is small.</p><p>Additionally, the expression of AQP5 in BEAS-2B cells caused a spindle-like and fibroblastic morphology and a loss of cell-to-cell contacts and cell polarity. We have not found comparable changes in cell morphology with mouse NIH3T3 cell line which is already a fibroblast cell line and various other cancer cell lines including colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, DLD1) and leukemic cell lines (K562, LAMA-84). In our previous findings with AQP1 in lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Hoque1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, no notable morphologic changes in AQP1 transfected cells were reported. We surmise that the transfection of AQP5 into the normal epithelial cell line may have played a role in inducing fibroblast-like morphologic alteration. However, further transfection of different types of AQPs into normal human bronchial epithelial cell line is planned.</p><p>Expression assay of epithelial proteins such as E-cadherin, &#x003b1;-catenin and &#x003b3;-catenin, and mesenchymal proteins including fibronectin and vimentin in the BEAS-2B cells transfected with AQP5 and its two mutants demonstrated that only cells with AQP5, but none of the mutants, exhibited a loss of epithelial cell markers and a gain of mesenchymal cell markers. Therefore, both morphological modification and molecular profile change suggest that AQP5 expression in BEAS-2B cells induces EMT, thus promoting cell invasion and metastasis.</p><p>To elucidate the molecular interaction between AQP5 and its downstream pathway leading to cell invasion with enhanced EMT activity, we hypothesized that the diproline peptide sequence (RTSPVGSP) in loop D of AQP5 is likely to be involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Mayer1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Raina1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> in its interaction with other adaptor proteins. Due to its sequence similarity to SH3 binding consensus, it is possible that this particular sequence can directly bind with the SH3 domain of certain adaptor molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Mayer1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Raina1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, to identify candidate adaptor molecules which, directly or indirectly, bind to AQP5 through this particular amino acid sequences, we have screened a human SH3 domains protein array. Interestingly, cellular extracts from AQP5 showed a robust binding to SH3 domains of several key proteins associated with signal transduction including c-Src, Lyn, and Grap2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002162-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Particularly, a phosphorylated Loop D fragment of AQP5 (88 aa through 182 aa) was able to bind to the SH3 domains of c-Src, Lyn, and Grap2 C-terminal as strongly as AQP5, while unphosphorylated Loop D fragment was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002162-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Of note, our competitive inhibition assay using phosphorylated and unphosphoryalated Loop D fragment showed that only the phosphorylated Loop D fragment inhibited cell proliferation in NIH3T3 cells (Lee et al., manuscript submitted), further suggesting that phosphorylation of Loop D is likely to be critical in the interaction of AQP5 with its adaptor molecules involved in the signal transduction pathways of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion such as c-Src <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Avizienyte1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings altogether indicate that both the diproline peptide sequence in Loop D and phosphorylation of Ser156 inside the diproline peptide sequence by PKA are required to interact with Src family molecules.</p><p>Src is a non-receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase associated with invasive and metastatic phenotype in various tumors and has been known to promote EMT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Avizienyte1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Boyer2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of c-Src has also been emphasized in the carcinogenesis of NSCLC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Zhang1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The activated, or the phosphorylated form (Tyr416) of c-Src favors invasion by disrupting E-cadherin dependent cell-to-cell contact and enhancing integrin mediated cell-matrix adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Avizienyte2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Our finding with c-Src is important because AQP5 seems to interact only with the activated form of c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002162-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). More interestingly, the cells with AQP5 were shown to have more activated c-Src than the cells with N185D or S156A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002162-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), hinting that the interaction with AQP5 may induce a conformational change in the inactivated c-Src, enabling it to become phosphorylated, and thus, activated. Overall, our findings on the interaction of AQP5 with c-Src, based on several experiments: <italic>in vitro</italic> SH3 domain protein array and GST pull-down assay and <italic>in vivo</italic> immunoprecipitation, offers a plausible explanation for the molecular mechanism of AQP5 mediated enhanced invasion and EMT.</p><p>Finally, to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of AQP5 in NSCLC, we performed FISH analysis. We were unable to detect any clear evidence of genomic amplification, which indicates that AQP5 expression is likely to be a secondary event. Of note, this finding is similar to the case for AQP1, where no evidence for genomic amplification was identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Hoque1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Further efforts to identify promoter element responsible for the induced expression of AQP5 in several tumor cell lines suggested several potential cis-acting elements responsible for promoter activity. In addition, methylation analysis of AQP5 promoter regions suggested a possible role of promoter demethylation as a mechanism of AQP5 expression in NSCLC (Kim et al., unpublished result). However, these results are still preliminary and warrant further validation in the future.</p><p>We have previously reported that the phosphorylation of AQP5 at the PKA consensus site may play a role in promoting cell transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In a more recent study, phosphorylation of AQP5 was reported in the tissues of human non small cell lung cancer, but not in normal lung tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. While it is possible that activation of AQP5 may lead to increase in its water permeability and thus increase the metabolic capacity of the cell, it appears to be unlikely, as data in Xenopus oocytes suggest otherwise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Yang2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Yang et al. reported that water channel (including AQP5) phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C did not affect water permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Yang2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Although, there still exists a possibility that AQP5 mediated water transport may, in part, play a role in cell migration as in AQP4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Saadoun3">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, the role of water transport may not be significant compared with the suggested c-Src mediated epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) promoting property of AQP5.</p><p>In summary, our clinical and molecular findings support our hypothesis that AQP5 may play a critical role in the progression of NSCLC through enhanced cell invasion. This contrasts to other reports showing the role of AQPs in cell proliferation (AQP1 and AQP5) or angiogenesis (AQP1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Saadoun2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Woo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Hoque1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. It, further, makes hAQP5 an attractive molecular marker for predicting cancer prognosis. Moreover, a significant expression level of AQP5 (35.3&#x00025;, 144/408) in NSCLC and its association with worse clinical outcomes may warrant a future study to explore AQP5 as a novel therapeutic target for the management of NSCLC. For example, one of the standard second line therapies of lung adenocarcinoma in the U.S. is the use of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) antagonist, erlotinib, which inhibits tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002162-Herbst1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. We surmise that in the future, AQP5 antagonists, possibly through inhibition of phosphorylation in S156 or its interaction with downstream pathways, may be used for the management of NSCLC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002162.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Cell proliferation assay between BEAS 2B cells transfected AQP5 and mock.
