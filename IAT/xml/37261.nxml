Previously we have shown that GST&#x02013;Z2, a protein that contains three zinc fingers and a proline-rich multimerization domain from the polydactyl zinc finger protein RIP60 fused to glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST), mediates DNA binding and looping <italic>in vitro</italic>. Atomic force microscopy showed that GST<bold>&#x02013;</bold>Z2 is able to condense 130&#x02013;150 kb bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) into protein&#x02013;DNA complexes containing multiple DNA loops. Condensation of the DNA loops onto the Z2 protein&#x02013;BAC DNA core complexes with cationic lipid resulted in particles that were readily transferred into multiple cell types in culture. Transfer of total genomic linear DNA containing amplified DHFR genes into DHFR<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells by GST&#x02013;Z2 resulted in a 10-fold higher transformation rate than calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Chinese hamster ovarian cells transfected with a BAC containing the human <italic>TP53</italic> gene locus expressed p53, showing native promoter elements are active after GST&#x02013;Z2-mediated gene transfer. Because DNA condensation by GST&#x02013;Z2 does not require the introduction of specific recognition sequences into the DNA substrate, condensation by the Z2 domain of RIP60 may be used in conjunction with a variety of other agents to provide a flexible and efficient non-viral platform for the delivery of large genes into mammalian cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Functional elements of mammalian chromosomes, including genes, centromeres, replicons and telomeres, may encompass tens of thousands of base pairs. Studies on the control of gene expression have shown that boundary elements, promoters, enhancers, splicing signals, mRNA stability elements and other regulatory sequences are dispersed throughout genes and their flanking sequences. <italic>Cis</italic>-acting elements within gene loci may act in concert over very long distances (at least 50 kb), perhaps through DNA looping, DNA linking or sequestration in a common subnuclear compartment (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c4">4</xref>).</p><p> In the study of gene expression, transfection of plasmids bearing selected regulatory sequences into mammalian cells has proven remarkably valuable. However, plasmid-based transfection studies often fail to recapitulate the activity of sequences that reside in their native chromosomal context, perhaps because they do not reproduce the contributions of multiple <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements that are dispersed over long distances in genetic loci. For example, locus control regions may influence promoter activity at least 50 kb away, while promoters in turn may influence recruitment of factors to distal locus control regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c4">4</xref>). Additionally, some regulatory elements may not function when isolated as small sequence segments. For example, initiation sites for DNA synthesis have been mapped to specific chromosomal zones of 20&#x02013;50 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c5">5</xref>), yet plasmids bearing suspected replication origins generally do not replicate in the same manner as the chromosomal loci from which they were derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c6">6</xref>).</p><p> To dissect the role of specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory sequences in the control of a transcription unit, replicon or other genetic domain, it would be useful to employ an experimental system that allows precise modification of specific elements in the context of the complete locus. Homologous recombination in bacteria permits the introduction of precise modifications in bacterial and P1 artificial chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c12">12</xref>), but the difficulty of introducing large DNA molecules bearing such alterations into cells has limited the utility of standard transfection assays for studying function.</p><p> We are interested in assessing the interaction of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements at a distance in DNA synthesis and gene expression. Because of their stability, size and ability to be modified by homologous recombination, bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) represent an attractive experimental system for the study of entire genes and other chromosomal domains. Here we report the development of a simple gene transfer system that allows the introduction of BACs and other large DNA molecules into cultured cells with high efficiency. This system relies on the ability of a small protein fragment (Z2) of the polydactyl zinc finger protein RIP60 to bind at dispersed sites, multimerize on DNA and then induce DNA condensation by DNA looping. Collapse of DNA loops onto the GST&#x02013;Z2&#x02013;BAC DNA core complex with cationic lipids results in gene delivery complexes that are readily internalized and expressed by several cultured cell lines. Together with the ability to modify BACs by homologous recombination, DNA transfer systems that function with large DNA molecules should facilitate dissection of complex multipartite regulatory arrays within the context of entire gene loci.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of BAC and plasmid DNA</title><p>BACs were isolated using a modified alkaline lysis method as described by Sinnett <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c13">13</xref>).

After organic extraction, the DNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by precipitation with glycogen and ethanol, amplified by 20 cycles of PCR and double-stranded DNA products of 60 bp were isolated by gel electrophoresis as before. Binding of each pool of selected sequences was assessed by gel mobility shift assays. After four rounds of selection and amplification, no further increase in the specific activity of the libraries as assessed by gel mobility shift activity was detected (data not shown).

One to three days later, coverslips were removed, rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the cells were fixed in PBS containing 3&#x00025; para-formaldehyde.

Located between hand Z2 and Z3 is a proline-rich region (18 of 58 residues are proline) that contains three segments of repeated (P-X-X)<sub>n</sub> motifs (n &#x0003d; 3 or 4) that are predicted to form three polyproline II helices. The smallest GST fusion of RIP60 with stable DNA binding and looping activities that we have identified to date is GST&#x02013;Z2, which contains ZFs 6&#x02013;8 and two of the predicted polyproline helices of RIP60. Upon binding to specific RIP60 sites, GST&#x02013;Z2 forms multimers on DNA, protecting as much as 150 bp of flanking DNA from nuclease cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c15">15</xref>). AFM (see below) and ligation enhancement assays (data not shown) indicated that GST&#x02013;Z2 bound avidly to substrates not known to contain consensus RIP60 sites.</p><p> To determine the sequence preference of GST&#x02013;Z2, binding site selection experiments were performed (see Materials and Methods). While full-length RIP60 binds with strong preference to the <italic>dhfr</italic> ori&#x003b2; sequence TTTTATTATTATTATTAG, selection experiments indicated GST&#x02013;Z2 interacted preferentially with sequences containing one or more ATT motifs, or stretches of four or more thymidines, or both (data not shown). As suggested by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c15">15</xref>), the binding site selection assays indicate the binding specificity of GST&#x02013;Z2 is relaxed as compared to full-length RIP60.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of GST-Z2 to plasmids and BACs</title><p>AFM was used to examine the binding of GST&#x02013;Z2 to a variety of supercoiled, linear or relaxed circular substrates. Binding of GST&#x02013;Z2 to pCH127 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c1">1</xref>), a plasmid that contains both the upstream (URS) and downstream (DRS) RIP60 binding sites from <italic>dhfr</italic> ori&#x003b2;, results in a protein&#x02013;DNA complex with three prominent lobes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f1">1</xref>A). The plasmid DNA within these complexes appeared to be either supercoiled (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f1">1</xref>A, filled arrows) or relaxed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f1">1</xref>A, open arrows). For complexes containing supercoiled plasmids, the DNA appeared to be wound around or between the protein lobes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f1">1</xref>B). GST&#x02013;Z2 also bound pOICAT plasmid DNA that lacks RIP60 binding sites, but binding did not result in the formation of trilobular complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f1">1</xref>C). Binding to linear DNA fragments resulted in complexes with 2&#x02013;6 DNA molecules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f1">1</xref>D). Linking of linear molecules did not require the presence of specific RIP60 binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f1">1</xref>D and data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Condensation and gene transfer of BAC DNA by GST&#x02013;Z2</title><p>Transfection of DNA into cells involves a number of steps, most of which are poorly understood.

When incubated with purified BAC 269-21 DNA (&#x0223c;130 kb), GST&#x02013;Z2 induced the formation of complexes containing multiple DNA loops (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f2">2</xref>B). Estimation of the size of individual DNA loops from photomicrographs ranged between 10 and 25 kb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f2">2</xref>B). The ratio of protein to DNA and the concentration of DNA in the binding reaction had an effect on the formation of looped complexes: at high protein to DNA ratios intermolecular linking was favored, while at lower protein to DNA concentrations intramolecular condensation was observed (data not shown).</p><p> BAC 269-21 contains an IRES&#x02013;EGFP translation cassette in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region of <italic>Zipro1</italic>, a gene encoding a ZF transcription factor expressed in the brain and epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c25">25</xref>). BAC 269-21 also contains an SV40 promoter in the BAC vector such that <italic>Zipro1</italic> is expressed in other cell types. BAC 269-21 DNA was incubated first with GST&#x02013;Z2 for 15 min, and the protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were then diluted in SFM containing Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) as described in the Materials and Methods. AFM indicated addition of cationic lipid condensed the DNA loops onto the GST&#x02013;Z2&#x02013;BAC DNA core (data not shown).</p><p> When incubated with BAC 269-21&#x02013;GST&#x02013;Z2&#x02013;Lipofectamine complexes GFP-positive cells were observed as early as 24 h after addition of medium containing DNA. By 4 days post-transfection, transfer of BAC 269-21 into CHOC 400 cells resulted in a high proportion of GFP positive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f3">3</xref>D) as compared to control preparations prepared without GST&#x02013;Z2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f3">3</xref>C). In contrast to the diffuse GFP signal observed by standard transfection with the pCMV-GFP plasmid expression vector pK7-GFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f3">3</xref>B), the GFP signal from BAC 269-21 was punctate in nature. Examination of cells expressing GFP from BAC 269-21 at high magnification showed that the GFP-positive cells were dead or dying from apoptosis: the cells were rounded up, extruded from the culture plate and displayed cell remnants typical of apoptotic cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f3">3</xref>E and F). These results indicate that elevated expression of <italic>Zipro1</italic> induces apoptosis, and that both EGFP and <italic>Zipro1</italic> were expressed upon transfer into CHOC 400 cells.</p><p> Other experiments show BAC 269-21 was readily transferred by complexes containing GST&#x02013;Z2 into several cell types, including CHO, COS and U2OS cells (data not shown). When the number of GFP-positive cells was estimated as a percentage of cells present at the time of transfection, efficiency of gene transfer in four experiments ranged from 45 to 70&#x00025;. In typical experiments, GFP-positive cells were observed after 2 days at a level near 70&#x00025; of the initial cell population (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Transfer of total genomic DNA by GST&#x02013;Z2</title><p>Mammalian DNA is known to bear covalent modifications (i.e.&#x000a0;methylated cytosines) that have important consequences for gene expression.

In an effort to restore p53 expression to wild-type levels in cells lacking p53, we screened a human BAC DNA library for the <italic>TP53</italic> gene locus. From a series of candidate clones, analysis by SSCP and direct sequencing showed BAC clone 66H22 contained wild-type sequences for the entire coding region of the human <italic>TP53</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f5">5</xref>).</p><p> While CHOC 400 cells express a mutant form of Chinese hamster p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c30">30</xref>), the hamster protein is not recognized by several antibodies to human p53 (data not shown). As a test for p53 expression from its own promoter region, we transfected CHOC 400 cells with BAC 66H22 and examined cell lysates for p53 by immunoblotting. When transfected with 2.0 &#x000b5;g of pCMV-p53, CHOC 400 cells expressed very large amounts of p53, much of which was constitutively nuclear, polyubiquitinated or degraded (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f6">6</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4, and data not shown). In addition, cells transfected with pCMV-p53 died from apoptosis due to elevated expression of p53, and consequently could not be propagated (data not shown). In contrast, CHOC 400 cells transfected with BAC 66H22 using the GST&#x02013;Z2&#x02013;Lipofectamine co-condensation method expressed full-length p53 at levels that did not lead to significant ubiquitination or degradation of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f6">6</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;8). Moreover, in contrast to cells transfected with pCMV-p53, cells transfected with BAC 66H22 showed no signs of overt cytotoxicity. While treatment of cells transfected with BAC 66H22 with <italic>cis</italic>-platinum for 4 h appeared to induce a modest increase in p53 levels, further studies will be required to determine if human p53 expressed from 66H22 is phosphorylated and stabilized in response to DNA damage, and consequently mediates a DNA damage checkpoint in hamster or human cells. As expected, shorter exposures of the blot shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f6">6</xref> showed <italic>cis</italic>-platinum had no effect on the expression profile of p53 from pCMV-p53 (data not shown).</p><p> From a series of BAC transfection experiments similar to those shown here we estimate that condensation by GST&#x02013;Z2 improves the efficiency of transfer of large molecules into cells in culture &#x0223c;50&#x02013;100-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f6">6</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 7 and 8). We have recently generated modified alleles of BAC 66H22 that contain a CMV&#x02013;RFP expression cassette in the pBelo BAC vector (S.Phelps and N.H.Heintz, unpublished data). Introduction of these and other modified BAC alleles into cells will permit us to directly measure transfection efficiency, expression of p53 or other proteins and the fate of transfected BAC DNA over time.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>An efficient method for the transfer of BACs, yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) and other large DNA molecules into mammalian cells would facilitate genetic analysis of specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements that act over large distances in the context of native flanking sequences. Moreover, the ability to transfer BACs containing targeted modifications into cells in culture would permit evaluation of modified alleles prior to generating BAC transgenic mice. The ability to transfer imprinted genes or other modified sequences directly from one cell to another should also prove useful. Here we have described a small recombinant fusion protein that facilitates transfer of large linear or circular DNA molecules into mammalian cells.</p><p> A working model for gene transfer by GST&#x02013;Z2 is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f7">7</xref>. Based on the binding site selection experiments, the protein appears to bind to ATT or T-rich sequences, which are likely to occur at random with considerable frequency in DNA from mammalian cells. Upon initial binding to ATT or T-rich sequences, GST&#x02013;Z2 nucleates the formation of multimers on neighboring DNA, leading to protection of 150&#x02013;200 bp of sequence. AFM suggests GST&#x02013;Z2 does not saturate DNA, even at high protein concentrations, but rather forms discrete multimeric complexes, even on substrates that lack known RIP60 sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke309f1">1</xref>C). On BAC 269 molecules the GST&#x02013;Z2 protein complexes were located at 5&#x02013;25 kb intervals along the entire 130 kb BAC DNA substrate. Based on the ability of RIP60 to mediate DNA looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c15">15</xref>), we suggest protein&#x02013;protein interactions between multimeric GST&#x02013;Z2 complexes then foster the formation of DNA loops, resulting in a complex with a single protein core and multiple free DNA loops. Addition of cationic lipid (or other agents) may then be used to collapse the DNA loops onto the protein core, resulting in a stable, compact particle. Upon binding the cell surface, the complex is internalized, ferried to the cell nucleus and the DNA is transcribed. Because GFP&#x02013;Z2 locates to the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke309c15">15</xref>), it is also possible that GST&#x02013;Z2 promotes nuclear import. Preliminary experiments indicate that phosphorylation of the proline-rich region of GST&#x02013;Z2 <italic>in vitro</italic> by casein kinase II prevents multimerization and DNA binding (J.Gilbert, T.Messit, C.Houchens and N.H.Heintz, unpublished data), suggesting phosphorylation of the multimerization domain may release GST&#x02013;Z2 from DNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. If so, this feature of the transfer system would provide a mechanism for the efficient dissolution of gene delivery complexes upon cell entry.</p><p> Transfer of multiple BACs and total genomic DNA into cells shows that the DNA substrates need not contain RIP60 binding sites for condensation by GST&#x02013;Z2, thereby obviating introduction of specific binding sites into the substrate. In addition, linear, relaxed circular or supercoiled substrates are all bound by GST&#x02013;Z2. As a recombinant protein, GST&#x02013;Z2 may be modified by protein engineering to contain specific motifs, such as nuclear localization sequences, protein degradation domains or cell targeting sequences. Moreover, the DNA loops emanating from GST&#x02013;Z2&#x02013;DNA complexes may be decorated with peptides, polymers or conjugates to encourage uptake by specific cell types. Hence, combined with other methods, GST&#x02013;Z2 may represent one element of a flexible, non-viral platform for gene delivery <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke309f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> AFM of Z2&#x02013;DNA complexes.
