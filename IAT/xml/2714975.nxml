Intestinal epithelial cells are exposed to bacterial products and therefore must prevent signaling through innate immune receptors to avoid pathology. However, enteric pathogens are able to stimulate intestinal inflammation. We show here that the enteric pathogen <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium can stimulate innate immune responses in cultured epithelial cells by mechanisms that do not involve receptors of the innate immune system. Instead, <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium stimulates these responses by delivering through its type III secretion system the bacterial effector proteins SopE, SopE2, and SopB, which in a redundant fashion stimulate Rho-family GTPases leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling. These observations have implications for the understanding of the mechanisms by which <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium induces intestinal inflammation as well as other intestinal inflammatory pathologies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium is one of the most common causes of food-borne illness in the United States and a major cause of diarrheal diseases in developing countries.

Conserved microbial products, collectively known as &#x0201c;pathogen-associated molecular patterns&#x0201d; (PAMPS), stimulate specific host receptors triggering a variety of generic responses directed at controlling pathogen spread. In the case of bacterial pathogens, conserved bacterial products such as lipopolysacharide, flagella, or peptidoglycan, are recognized by transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or intracellular nucleotide oligomerizaton domain-like receptors (NLRs), leading to conserved signaling cascades that culminate in the activation of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Medzhitov1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Creagh1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These receptors are widely expressed in cells of the innate immune system such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, which consequently are well equipped to respond to virtually any invading pathogen.</p><p>Intestinal epithelial cells, however, are a special case in that they are exposed to massive amounts of bacterial products with the potential to activate innate immune receptors. Therefore, signaling through these receptors, in particular surface TLRs, must be prevented to avoid uncontrolled inflammation, which would be detrimental to the host. The mechanisms by which this negative regulation of innate immune receptor activation is exerted are poorly understood. It is believed that a combination of topological sequestration of the receptors and the activity of specific negative regulators that control the output through TLRs, are responsible for the control of intestinal cell homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Creagh1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Lang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The mechanisms by which these or other intestinal pathogens bypass the negative regulatory controls in the intestinal epithelium to induce inflammatory responses are poorly understood.

The ability of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to stimulate intestinal responses requires the activity of a type III protein secretion system (TTSS) encoded within its pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Hobbie1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is unclear whether this system stimulates inflammatory responses directly, or whether it works in conjunction with surface innate immune receptors that may recognize components of this machine, or cytoplasmic receptors that may recognize conserved bacterial products, since this TTSS is also required for <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to enter epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Galn1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, bacterial infection stimulated the expression of several genes whose products limit the immune response, which most likely constitute a negative feed-back loop to preserve homeostasis and limit damage as a consequence of the inflammatory response.

Therefore, it is possible that the needle substructure itself may be directly recognized by innate immune receptors in epithelial cells thus stimulating transcriptional responses. In addition, delivery of proteins by the TTSSs requires the deployment of a group of TTSS secreted protein translocases, which mediate the passage of effector proteins through the host cell plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Tardy1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Collazo1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that potential membrane perturbations caused by the deployment of the TTSS protein translocases, which does not occur in cells infected with the <italic>&#x00394;invA</italic> mutant, could be sensed by the cell triggering innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Tardy1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000538-Collazo1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, stimulation of innate immune responses may be the result of the TTSS-mediate delivery of some agonist of intracellular immune receptors (e. g. flagellin).</p><p>To distinguish among these possibilities we examined the transcriptional responses of human epithelial cells infected with a <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium strain lacking the protein effectors delivered by the SPI-1 TTSS (from here forth referred as &#x0201c;effectorless&#x0201d;).
