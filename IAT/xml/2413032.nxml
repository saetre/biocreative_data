The intestine contains IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells, but these cells have not been characterized phenotypically or in terms of their developmental origins. We describe a previously unidentified and unique subset of immunoglobulin M<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells that present with an AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup> major histocompatibility complex class II<sup>bright</sup> surface phenotype and are characterized by a low frequency of somatic hypermutation and the potential ability to produce interleukin-12p70. This B cell subset resides within the normal mucosa of the large intestine and expands in response to inflammation. Some of these intestinal B cells originate from the AA4.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> immature B2 cell pool in the steady state and are also recruited from the recirculating naive B cell pool in the context of intestinal inflammation. They develop in an antigen-independent and BAFF-dependent manner in the absence of T cell help. Expansion of these cells can be induced in the absence of the spleen and gut-associated lymphoid tissues. These results describe the existence of an alternative pathway of B cell maturation in the periphery that gives rise to a tissue-specific B cell subset.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: BAFF-R, receptor of B cell activation factor from the TNF family; Btk, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; DSS, dextran sodium sulfate; FDC, follicular dendritic cell; GALT, gut-associated lymphoid tissue; LT, lymphotoxin; MLN, mesenteric lymph node; PP, Peyer's patch; SHM, somatic hypermutation.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>BM-derived immature IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells can mature in the BM itself or migrate to the spleen and mature into follicular and marginal zone B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).

Newly formed B cells that have recently emerged from the BM represent the T1 transitional stage of development in which cells express high levels of CD24 and AA4.1 and low levels of CD23, CD21, and IgD. At the T2 stage, cells acquire the ability to recirculate and to express higher levels of CD23, CD21, and IgD, and they are capable of maturing into either marginal zone or follicular B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). The T3 subset may represent a specific follicular B cell population that has recently matured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), but it has also been recently suggested that T3 cells may represent anergic B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>In several systemic and organ-specific inflammatory disorders, ectopic neolymphoid follicles, which are sometimes called tertiary lymphoid tissue, are induced by the mobilization of B cell progenitors from the BM to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Interestingly, although the BM functions as a primary lymphoid organ, it may also serve as a secondary lymphoid organ in which activation of B cells may occur in response to circulating pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Although &#x0003e;80% of the body's B cells are located in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), it is unknown whether these cells are derived from the activation of recirculating B cells or if they include novel populations of naive B cells that specifically home to these sites.</p><p>The mucosal immune system is constitutively exposed to a wide spectrum of commensal microflora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). The effecter lymphoid component of GALT includes scattered lymphocytes throughout the lamina propria of the small and large intestine. The inductive sites consist of organized lymphoid tissues, such as Peyer's patches (PPs), which are formed in a lymphotoxin (LT)-&#x003b1; dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Because the small intestine represents a major source of IgA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasma cells, the majority of studies on intestinal B cells have focused on small intestinal IgA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Three pathways have been identified for small intestinal plasma cell development. Approximately half of all IgA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasma cells in the intestine may originate from peritoneal B1 cells, whereas the remainder may be either derived from activated B cells that migrate from organized lymphoid tissues such as PPs, or originate from naive B cells through a distinct pathway for gut-primed B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). In addition to plasma cells, IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells also exist within the normal intestine and significantly increase within large intestinal mucosal tissues during inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). However, the phenotypic and developmental properties of IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells in the intestine have not yet been fully explored.</p><p>We describe a previously unidentified, intestine-specific, IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cell subset that is characterized by an AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup>MHCII<sup>bright</sup> phenotype, by a low frequency of somatic hypermutation (SHM), and by the potential ability to produce IL-12p70 after exposure to microbes. These cells appear to exist in a unique preactivated state, as indicated by the very high expression levels of MHC class II on these cells. This intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cell subset may originate from AA4.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> immature transitional B cells in the steady state, and may be significantly increased in the inflamed intestine after recruitment from the recirculating naive B cell pool.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Identification of a unique AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cell subset in the large intestine</title><p>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells have been described in the large intestine, and these cells expand significantly and form B cell clusters in certain disease states involving intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). We herein demonstrate that the majority of IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells in the large intestine of WT mice exhibit a unique surface phenotype that is distinct from that of recirculating splenic and mesenteric LN (MLN) B cells. In contrast to splenic, MLN, and PP B cells, the majority of intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells are CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IgD<sup>low</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Because a significant increase in intestinal B cells has been well documented in several colitis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), we next examined the phenotype of IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells from the inflamed intestine of three colitis models, including TCR&#x003b1; KO mice (Th2 cell&#x02013;dependent chronic colitis), IL-10 KO mice (Th1 cell&#x02013;dependent chronic colitis), and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)&#x02013;induced acute colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). As previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), a significant increase in IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells was observed in the inflamed intestine of TCR&#x003b1; KO mice and IL-10 KO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Interestingly, we found that in the DSS colitis model intestinal B cell expansion was specifically induced during the recovery phase (after termination of DSS treatment), but not during the acute phase when DSS was being administered. In comparison to day 0 (normal mucosa), the proportion as well as the absolute numbers of IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the large intestine were slightly decreased at day 4 (acute phase), but increased significantly at day 8 (during the recovery phase) of DSS colitis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Like normal intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells, the majority of intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells in these colitis models were also of the CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IgD<sup>low</sup> phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). In addition, intestinal B cells from normal and inflamed mucosa were CD24<sup>intermediate</sup>CD62L<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD1d<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and did not express B1 cell markers (CD43, CD11b, and CD5; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref> and Fig. S1). The intestinal B cells proliferated in vitro in the response to BCR ligation, as well as LPS stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).

These cells could develop in the intestine in situ from uncommitted lymphoid progenitors, or they may be derived from newly formed B cells that not only seed the spleen but also home to the intestine, or they could represent a population that differentiates from recirculating follicular phenotype B cells or from B1 B cells. The rapid expansion of intestine-specific CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup> B cells in the DSS colitis model provided us an opportunity to more closely examine how these cells expand either by proliferation of existing cells or by enhanced recruitment or development from progenitors. Because intestinal B cells share some phenotypic features with T1 B cells, but the latter also express AA4.1, a marker for recently generated B cells, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), we next examined AA4.1 expression on intestinal B cells. Less than 10% of intestinal B cells expressed AA4.1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Unlike AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> intestinal B cells, the AA4.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> intestinal B cells consisted of two subsets, T1-like CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and T2-like CD23<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). To examine whether AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup> intestinal B cells could potentially mature from the AA4.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> immature B cells, in vivo BrdU pulse labeling was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). In the AA4.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population from the normal large intestine of WT mice, BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were observed on both day 2 and 6 after the initial BrdU injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, top). In contrast, BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were not detectable at day 2 in the AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population, but became clearly detectable at day 6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, bottom). Similar findings were also observed in the inflamed intestine after DSS treatment (Fig. S2).

The expression levels of MHC class II were comparable on B cells from normal and inflamed intestine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In addition, a slight increase in the expression of CD69 was observed on the intestinal B cells in comparison to splenic B cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In contrast, no significant up-regulation of Fas, PNA, CD80, or CD86 was found on the intestinal B cells. Therefore, it is possible that intestinal B cells represent a unique activated B cell population that is MHCII<sup>bright</sup>, CD69<sup>intermediate</sup>, Fas<sup>low</sup>, PNA<sup>low</sup>, CD80<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and CD86<sup>low</sup>. To elucidate whether the phenotype of intestinal B cells represents a response to an intestinal pathogen, and to determine if these cells can be further activated by pathogens, we examined intestinal B cells after infection with <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>. This infection did not induce the expression of Fas or PNA on intestinal B cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These data suggest that the MHCII<sup>bright</sup> intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cell population is not elicited by a known intestinal pathogen, and these cells may represent a unique preactivated B cell population.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Unique activated status of intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells.</bold> (A) Expressions of IgM versus MHC class II, CD69, Fas, PNA, CD80, or CD86 in cells of the spleen and colon from WT mice (Day 0) and WT mice during recovery phase of DSS colitis (Day 8) are shown.

In addition, significantly enhanced apoptosis of intestinal B cells was observed in BAFF-R mutant as compared with control mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 H</xref>), which is consistent with an important role of BAFF-R signaling in B cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>).

These findings suggest that the BAFF-R&#x02013;associated signaling pathway plays a crucial role in intestinal B cell development and homeostasis. They are consistent with a role for BAFF-R in all B2 populations after the T1 stage and the absence of a role for BAFF-R in B1 B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have described a previously unidentified, intestine-specific, IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cell subset that is characterized by a unique AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup>MHCII<sup>bright</sup> surface phenotype, low frequency of SHM, and the ability to secrete IL-12 in response to a TLR ligand. This B cell subset exists in the normal mucosa of the large intestine and expands in the inflamed mucosa of mice with acute or chronic colitis. The LT&#x003b1;1&#x003b2;2 signaling cascade is required for the development of organized lymphoid tissues (such as PP) that provide a site of origin of some of IgA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plasma cells in small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Most other small intestinal plasma cells originate from peritoneal B1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). We herein describe an additional pathway for intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cell development, in which AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup> B cells in the large intestine are supplied from B2 lineage cells that do not require organized lymphoid tissues for their development. Indeed, recent studies have revealed that some IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells in the small intestine are derived from the BM through a pathway distinct from that used by gut-primed B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Although the phenotype of BM-derived small intestinal B cells has not been characterized in previous studies, it is possible that the AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup>MHCII<sup>bright</sup> B cells in the large intestine characterized in this study may have a counterpart in the small intestine.</p><p>Recirculating B cells mature through transitional stages in the spleen, as well as the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Our BrdU labeling and cell transfer studies suggest that intestinal AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells can be derived from the AA4.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> immature B cell pool. In addition, intestinal AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup> B cells were virtually absent in BAFF-R mutant mice in which development of AA4.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD23<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T2 transitional B cells is defective and T1 transitional/newly formed B cells accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that recirculating T2 B cells that mature from T1 cells in the spleen seed the intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup> B cell compartment in the steady state, down-regulating CD23 when they enter the intestinal milieu. Soon after they seed the intestine, they may continue to express AA4.1, which is a marker of recent maturation. In addition, CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup> B cells may accumulate in the intestine after the recruitment to the inflamed intestine of cells from the recirculating IgD<sup>high</sup> naive B cell pool that contains both T2 cells and more mature recirculating follicular B cells. Therefore, it may be inferred that inflammatory chemokines and cytokines participate in the recruitment of recirculating B cells to the intestine during inflammation.</p><p>Peripheral B cell maturation in the spleen and BM depends in part on BCR-linked positive selection events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Interestingly, although inflammatory conditions generally induce a restriction of BCR clonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), our data showed that intestinal AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells polyclonally expand even in the presence of intestinal inflammation (Fig. S3 and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, B cells with a restricted BCR expanded readily in normal and inflamed intestine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, T cell help was not required for the intestinal AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cell development. Importantly, a large number of intestinal AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells were still detectable even in the absence of Btk or Lyn, which are major signaling molecules involved in BCR-mediated signaling. In addition, SHM that is often induced in mature B cells after encounter with specific antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>) was detectable at very low frequency in the intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells. These data suggest that intestinal AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells that are constitutively exposed to enteric microorganisms may develop or expand through a BCR-independent pathway.</p><p>Our data demonstrated that intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells express remarkably high levels of MHC class II. In contrast, several conventional markers expressed on activated splenic B cells, were not expressed by intestinal B cells. The unique expression profile of activation markers was not altered under several intestinal inflammatory conditions, including spontaneous chronic colitis, a chemically induced acute colitis, and <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection. Therefore, it is possible that the intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cell population may represent a unique preactivated B cell population presumably caused by the constitutive exposure to enteric microorganisms in the intestine. B cells have generally been believed not to produce IL-12p70, as this cytokine was detectable only in EBV-transformed B cells but not normal systemic B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>). However, recent accumulating studies have identified the potential ability of B cells to produce IL-12p70 under certain inflammatory and stimulatory (e.g., combination of CpG and CD40) conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Interestingly, intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells showed the ability to easily produce IL-12p70 in response to a microbial product CpG. Because IL-12p70 is a well known cytokine required for safeguarding against microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>), it is possible that the intestinal IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells may contribute to preserve appropriate host&#x02013;microbe interaction.</p><p>In summary, we have identified an intestine-specific AA4.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD21<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup>MHCII<sup>bright</sup> B cell subset that is derived from AA4.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> immature B cells and from recirculating naive B cells. This maturation of these cells represents a distinct pathway of B cell development that occurs in a tissue site, rather than in the BM or the spleen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>TCR&#x003b2;&#x003b4; DKO, RAG-1 KO, IL-7R&#x003b1; KO, Rac2 KO, Lyn KO, Btk KO, LT&#x003b1; KO, IghelMD4 Tg, GFP Tg mice of C57BL/6 background, BAFF-R mutant (A/WySnJ), and control (A/J) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in specific pathogen&#x02013;free facilities at Massachusetts General Hospital.
