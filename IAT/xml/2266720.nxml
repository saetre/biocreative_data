The Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases plays a pivotal role in cell signaling. In order to determine if Src plays a role in mammary gland development we have examined mammary gland development and function during pregnancy and lactation in mice in which expression of Src has been eliminated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have characterized a lactation defect in the Src-/- mice which results in the death of over 80% of the litters nursed by Src-/- dams. Mammary gland development during pregnancy appears normal in these mice; however secretory activation does not seem to occur. Serum prolactin levels are normal in Src-/- mice compared to wildtype controls. Expression of the prolactin receptor at both the RNA and protein level was decreased in Src-/- mice following the transition from pregnancy to lactation, as was phosphorylation of STAT5 and expression of milk protein genes. These results suggest that secretory activation, which occurs following parturition, does not occur completely in Src-/- mice. Failed secretory activation results in precocious involution in the mammary glands of Src-/- even when pups were suckling. Involution was accelerated following pup withdrawal perhaps as a result of incomplete secretory activation. In vitro differentiation of mammary epithelial cells from Src-/- mice resulted in diminished production of milk proteins compared to the amount of milk proteins produced by Src+/+ cells, indicating a direct role for Src in regulating the transcription/translation of milk protein genes in mammary epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Src is an essential signaling modulator in mammary gland development as Src-/- mice exhibit a block in secretory activation that results in lactation failure and precocious involution. Src appears to be required for increased expression of the prolactin receptor and successful downstream signaling, and alveolar cell organization.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The mammary gland is a unique organ in that development primarily takes place postnatally. During puberty, primarily under the influence of estrogen, ductal elongation and branching occurs to form the primary ductal tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. At the onset of pregnancy, progesterone and prolactin stimulate the outgrowth of both lateral and alveolar buds resulting in the formation of secretory lobuloalveolar units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. During lactation these lobuloalveolar units produce and secrete the milk needed to sustain the viability and growth of newborn pups. At parturition there is a dramatic increase in the expression of milk protein genes and lipid biosynthetic enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The transition from late pregnancy to lactation is referred to as secretory activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and this transition is stimulated by a rise in prolactin (PRL) and decrease in serum progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. While the molecular mechanisms underlying secretory activation remain obscure, the expression of several signaling molecules and transcription factors increases at this time, including Src (Richert et al, unpublished data), Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], Elf5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and sterol response element binding protein (SREBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Each of these factors may play either unique or redundant roles in secretory activation. Copious production of milk during lactation is stimulated by PRL, which induces expression of milk protein genes and maintains viability of the mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The role of PRL in regulating lipid biosynthesis by mammary epithelial cells is less well established, and is likely to be heavily influenced by the diet of the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Upon weaning of the pups, the mammary gland undergoes involution: involution is characterized by the apoptosis of the majority of the mammary epithelial cells and degradation/remodeling of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) resulting in ductal structures that closely resemble those present in the virgin mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Src is the prototype of the Src family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, a family that includes eight closely related members which share common structural motifs [Src, Fyn, Yes, Fgr, Lyn, Lck, Hck, and Blk] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The activation of this family of protein kinases is regulated by interaction of either the SH2 or SH3 domains of Src family kinases with specific ligands that results in structural changes leading to catalytic activation of the kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Src family kinases can be activated by stimulation of cells with peptide growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], steroid hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and through engagement of integrins by binding to extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus Src family kinases appear to be a central node in signaling by numerous receptor complexes. Since mammary gland development and function is regulated by all of these stimuli (peptide growth factors, steroid receptors and integrins), we expected that mammary gland development and/or function might be disrupted in mice lacking expression of Src. It has been observed that mammary gland development during puberty is altered in the Src-/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] (Richert et al, unpublished data) such that ductal elongation is delayed in Src-/- mice compared to wildtype Src+/+ mice. Mechanisms that may underlie the delay in ductal elongation include changes in estrogen receptor signaling or a change in the amount of estrogen receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], or a requirement for expression of Src in the stromal cell compartment of the mammary gland (Richert et al, unpublished data). While conducting these studies we also observed that Src-/- mice display many aspects of a lactation failure including death of most of the pups and retarded growth of any surviving pups. In this manuscript we report that Src is required for the induction of lactation and Src-/- mice exhibit a block in secretory activation that results in lactation failure, death of newborn pups, and precocious involution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Src deficient mice have normal pregnancy-induced development</title><p>Mammary gland development occurs in defined stages that are linked to sexual development and reproduction. Src is required for ductal elongation during pubertal development of the mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] (Richert et al, unpublished data). Gene expression analysis and immunoblot analysis demonstrates that expression of Src increases late in pregnancy during the transition from pregnancy to lactation (Richert et al, unpublished data), a transition referred to as secretory activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The expression of Src in the mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation was examined by immunoblot analysis of whole mammary gland lysates harvested at day eighteen of pregnancy and days two and nine of lactation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Src protein expression was detected at all three of these stages in lysates prepared from Src+/+ mice, although the amount of Src protein is lower at day nine of lactation compared to day two of lactation. While there is some variation between the three different animals shown at each time point, the general trend is clear; there is an increase in the amount of Src between day eighteen of pregnancy (P18) and day two of lactation (L2), followed by a decrease in the amount of Src protein by day nine of lactation (L9) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, middle panel, lanes 4&#x02013;6, 10&#x02013;12 and 16&#x02013;18). No Src was detected in lysates of glands harvested from Src-/- mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, middle panel, lanes 1&#x02013;3, 7&#x02013;9 and 13&#x02013;15). To examine the catalytic activation of Src, protein lysates were immunoblotted with an anti-phospho-Src antibody that specifically detects Src family members when phosphorylated on tyrosine<sup>416 </sup>in the activation loop of the kinase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, top panel). Phosphorylation of tyrosine<sup>416</sup>, which correlates with the catalytic activation of Src, was apparent in lysates prepared from the mammary glands of wildtype mice at P18, L2, and L9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, top panel, lanes 4&#x02013;6, 10&#x02013;12 and 16&#x02013;18). Although most of the lysates isolated from Src-/- mice do not appear to react with the anti-phospho-Src tyrosine<sup>416 </sup>antibody, immunoreactive material is detected in several of the samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, top panel, lanes 3, 14 and 15). The anti-phospho- Src tyrosine<sup>416 </sup>antibody is not specific for Src and is able to recognize the same phosphorylation site in the activation loop in Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Yes, and Hck; of these Src family members only Fyn is expressed in high levels in the mammary gland (Richert et al, unpublished data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Therefore we believe that this band represents activated Fyn in these samples, although we have not directly demonstrated this by immunoprecipitation of Fyn from these samples. Each lane represents tissue lysates harvested from different animals, and it would be expected that there might be animal-to-animal variations in the expression and activation of Src. The fact that Src is expressed and is activated during late pregnancy and lactation stimulated us to determine whether it plays a role in the complex signaling events that occur within the mammary epithelial cell during this developmental phase.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Src is expressed and activated in wildtype mammary glands during pregnancy and lactation</bold>.

Three separate mice were used per genotype and developmental stage. Protein lysates were prepared as described in the Materials and Methods sections, and immunoblotting conducted to detect phosphorylated Src (tyrosine<sup>416</sup>) (top panel), total Src (middle panel), total actin, as a loading control (bottom panel).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-8-6-1"/></fig><p>Mammary gland development during pregnancy is characterized by the formation of secondary branches and extensive lobuloalveolar development, and results in a dramatic increase in the number of mammary epithelial cells in the mammary gland; based upon the expression levels of keratin-19 and claudin 7, there is a 1000-fold increase in the number of epithelial cells by the end of pregnancy, although when the volume of epithelial cells is considered, a 125-fold increase might be considered to be a more conservative estimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This phase of mammary gland development is primarily driven by progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Whole mounts of mammary glands from Src knockout animals from days six (P6), twelve (P12) and eighteen (P18) of pregnancy demonstrate that at P6 the density of ducts, the extent of ductal branching and alveolar bud formation in Src-/- mice was reduced compared to both Src+/+ and Src+/- mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel C compared to A and B). By P18, however, there appeared to be no difference in mammary gland development between Src+/+, Src+/-, and Src-/- mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels G, H and I). The density of the epithelial structures in the Src-/- mice appeared similar to glands from Src+/+ mice on day eighteen of pregnancy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels G and I). Thus the whole mounts indicate that by the end of pregnancy ductal density and lobuloalveolar development in the Src-/- mice is normal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels G-I). Examination of hematoxylin and eosin stained thin sections of mammary glands isolated from Src+/+, Src+/- and Src-/- mice on P18 also demonstrate that pregnancy-induced development in the Src-/- mice is normal, with prominent densely-staining secretory alveoli surrounded by adipocytes visualized in all three genotypes examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels J, K and L). Therefore we conclude that the diminished ductal branching and density observed at P6 may reflect the reduced ductal density and delayed mammary gland development observed in 10 week-old virgin Src-/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] (Richert et al, unpublished data), as mice of this age were used in these studies, rather than decreased proliferation of mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Src deficient mice have normal pregnancy-induced development</bold>.

The first indication that Src is an important mediator of mammary gland development was observed when the Src knockout mice were unable to support growth and survival of their pups. The litters born to Src-/- dams were small and over 90% of the pups died within three days. In order to assess the apparent lactation failure of the Src-/- mice, average pup weights during the first 9 days of lactation were measured. The pups from the Src-/- mice were replaced with eight newborn pups from wildtype FVB, C57Bl6, or Src+/- mothers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panels A, B and C, respectively). Due to the poor growth and recurrent death of these foster pups, resulting in the death of over 80% of the fostered litters, we also tried replacing the pups of the Src-/- dams with older pups that were "experienced" at nursing. In the course of the experiments to characterize the lactation potential of the Src-/- dams only three fostered litters nursed by the Src-/- dams survived. The pups in each of these three litters had reduced weight gain over the nine days of lactation analyzed compared to litters nursed by control mothers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> eight newborn FVB pups were nursed by a Src-/- mouse. For the first few days the FVB pups showed very little weight gain then after day 4 their weight steadily increased and after nine days of lactation the average pup weight was 2.8 grams, which is much reduced compared to the 4.7 grams for FVB pups nursed by an FVB mother (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). When eight day old C57Bl6 pups were cross-fostered onto a Src-/- mouse, in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, the growth of these pups was severely diminished compared to those nursed by control dams (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Indeed on day 16, when the cross-fostered pups had been nursed by the Src-/- mouse for 9 days, the average pup weight was 3.7 grams compared to 5.8 grams for the control C57Bl6 pups nursed by a C57Bl6 dam. The 6 day old pups from a Src+/- litter that were fostered by the Src-/- mouse in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> demonstrated the least detrimental effect on their growth. When they were 9 days old (day 4 of lactation for the Src-/- mouse) the average pup weight was 3.7 grams compared to 4.5 grams for those nursed by Src+/- dams. For each of these studies the growth of pups nursed by Src-/- dams was compared to 3 litters of pups nursed by control dams (FVB, C57Bl6 and Src+/-). Due to the high mortality of pups nursed by Src-/- dams there were no additional litters to include in this analysis. These results demonstrate that Src knockout mice have diminished lactation capacity regardless of the strain or genotype of the pups nursed and therefore support the conclusion that Src is essential for secretory activation and/or lactation.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Pups suckled by Src knockout mice have dramatically reduced weight gain</bold>.

The histology of the mammary gland at this time point reflects the expansion of lactation and it is generally characterized by the presence of fully expanded lumens surrounded by a densely staining layer of mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The mammary glands of both the Src+/+ and Src+/- mice were similar and displayed the normal morphology expected in lactating mice at this time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panel C and data not shown). In contrast two different morphologies were observed in the mammary glands of Src-/- mice; in one of the three mice shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the structure of the mammary gland appeared to be similar to that seen in wildtype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), however the mammary glands of the two other Src-/- mice have the morphology expected of a mammary gland that is undergoing involution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panels D and E). In both of these mammary glands the secretory alveoli have collapsed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panels D and E), and a large distended duct that is filled with milk proteins, lipid droplets and apoptotic cells is readily apparent in one of the mice examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panel D). When compared to the histology of an involuting mammary gland from normal mice, the morphology observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panel D is typical of what would be expected on day four of involution, while the morphology observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panel E is typical of a mammary gland on day six to eight of involution when extensive remodeling of the gland has occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In all of the cases shown in panels D-F of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the dams were nursing pups and thus were considered to be "lactating". In the course of our experiments we have observed that one out of six Src-/- mice exhibits histology similar to that observed in the mammary gland of a wildtype gland at lactation day 9. The mammary glands of the five remaining Src-/- mice displayed histology typically seen in mammary glands undergoing involution, and the morphology observed varied from that normally seen on day two of involution to that seen on day eight of involution. Our observation that one of six Src-/- mice has a normal histology at L9 is consistent with the observation that 3 out 16 mice were able to sustain growth of foster pups over this time period, although at a reduced rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Secretory activation does not occur in Src-/- mice following parturition</title><p>The decrease in the concentration of progesterone that occurs immediately prior to parturition combined with the increased concentration of PRL that occurs late in pregnancy, and the PRL that is released by the pituitary in response to suckling, are required for secretory activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Characteristically mammary epithelial cells from late pregnant mice have large cytoplasmic lipid droplets (CLDs) that are often centrally located within the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Following parturition only small lipids droplets are observed at the luminal surface of mammary epithelial cells; a change that is thought to reflect secretory activation of cells in the alveolus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (T. Russell and J.L. McManaman, unpublished data). At L2 mammary epithelial cells from Src+/+, and Src+/- mice have small lipid droplets at their apical surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5, C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>), while mammary epithelial cells from Src-/- mice have large, centrally located lipid droplets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>). To further examine the induction of secretory activation following parturition, sections of mammary gland from Src+/+, Src+/- and Src-/- mice were stained with rabbit anti-adipocyte differentiation-regulated protein, also known as adipophilin (ADPH), which is present in the outer membrane of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (CLDs) The luminal surfaces of secretory alveoli were visualized with Oregon-Green 488-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and the nuclei were stained with DAPI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5, A, B, D, E, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>). Secretory alveoli of Src+/+ mice on day eighteen of pregnancy were readily apparent by the circle of DAPI-stained nuclei deposited around the luminal surface of the alveolus, which was stained with WGA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, luminal space is labeled L). Mammary epithelial cells from Src+/+ mice at P18 contained large lipid droplets that are outlined red by ADRP staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, white arrowheads). By L2 the luminal space has expanded considerably and the lipid droplets are smaller in size and primarily deposited along the luminal surface of the cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, white arrowhead). Staining of P18 mammary glands from Src-/- dams in an identical manner revealed poorly organized secretory alveoli with disordered lumen as evidenced by the unorganized pattern of staining with WGA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>, white arrow). Large CLDs were apparent in Src-/- mammary gland sections at P18 based upon anti-APDH staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>, white arrowhead). Luminal spaces were more evident when the structure of the secretory alveoli from Src-/- mice at L2 were examined, however, some mammary epithelial cells stained on multiple surfaces with WGA and these cells contained large CLDs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>). These observations suggest that Src is required for the structural organization of mammary epithelial cells into secretory lobuloalveolar units. The lack of Src expression results in large CLDs persisting in the mammary epithelial cells at L2, indicating that secretory activation has not occurred. Mammary glands from Src+/- mice have an intermediate phenotype at P18. Organized lobuloalveolar structures are apparent, however, unorganized alveoli are also evident, as are alveoli with WGA staining between cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, white arrows). By L2, the mammary gland structure in the Src+/- mice appeared to be largely normal with expanded luminal spaces and small lipid droplets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). This indicates that although lobuloalveolar development may be somewhat disorganized in Src+/- mice late in pregnancy, secretory activation post-partum occurs normally and that by L2, the mammary gland exhibits the normal structure of a lactating mammary gland.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum prolactin levels are not altered in Src-/- mice, however expression of the prolactin receptor is diminished</title><p>The hormone PRL was first identified by its ability to stimulate mammary gland development and lactation in rabbits and it has since been demonstrated as an essential modulator of proliferation and differentiation of alveoli during pregnancy and milk protein expression during lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

PRL action requires binding to its cognate receptor, the PRL receptor (PRLR). To determine if expression of the PRLR is altered in the Src-/- mice, PRLR levels were examined by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting with an anti-PRLR antibody. The message for the long isoform of the PRLR increased in the mammary glands of wild type mice during lactation, peaked at L9, and then declined by day two of involution. This pattern of expression for the long form of the PRLR during mammary gland development is consistent with previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, no increase in the levels of mRNA encoding the long form of the PRLR was detected in the Src-/- mice following parturition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The level of PRLR mRNA in the mammary gland of Src-/- mice remained level from P17 through both lactation time points, and then declined at the second day of involution (I2).</p><p>The protein level of PRLR was also increased in Src+/+ mice during lactation compared to the amount of PRLR protein present at P18 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, top panel, lanes 10&#x02013;12 and 16&#x02013;18 compared to 4&#x02013;6). PRLR protein expression was only detected in two of the mammary gland lysates from Src-/- mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, top panel, lanes 9 and 14). While two of the protein lysates from Src-/- mice at L2 are under loaded as indicated by actin loading control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, bottom panel, lanes 7 and 8), analysis of the third sample suggests that there are lower levels of PRLR protein at this time point, compared to the samples from Src+/+ mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, top panel, lane 9 versus 10&#x02013;12). No PRLR protein was detected in two of the three Src knockout lysates from mice at L9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, top panel, lanes 13 and 15), while the third Src-/- sample shows diminished PRLR levels compared to the samples from Src+/+ mice when then amount of actin present in each sample in taken into consideration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, top and bottom panels, lane 14 compared to 16&#x02013;18). Thus, although there is some animal to animal variation, we conclude that both PRLR mRNA and protein levels do not increase in Src-/- mice following parturition. The fact that PRLR mRNA does not increase following parturition provides further evidence that secretory activation is altered in Src-/- mice, as expression of the long form of the PRLR has been shown to dramatically increase during this transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Prolactin-dependent signaling pathway is diminished in Src-/- mice</title><p>Downstream components of the prolactin signaling pathway have also been found to be critical for proliferation and differentiation of alveoli during pregnancy and for lactation.

The levels of STAT5 are not reported to vary greatly during mammary gland development, although the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 increases late in pregnancy and is maintained throughout lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The phosphorylation of STAT5 was examined in the mammary glands of Src+/+ and Src-/- mice at P18, L2, and L9, three mice for each timepoint, by immunoblotting mammary gland lysates with anti-phospho-STAT5 (tyrosine<sup>694</sup>) antibody and anti-STAT5 antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The phosphorylation of STAT5 was detected at P18 in Src+/+ mice, and phosphorylation increased further during lactation; high levels of phosphorylated STAT5 were observed in all three mice at L2, and in two of the three samples analyzed at L9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, top panel, lanes 10&#x02013;12 and 17&#x02013;18). Based upon the actin loading control, the total levels of STAT5 in Src+/+ mice did not vary greatly between pregnancy and lactation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, middle and bottom panels, lanes 4&#x02013;6, 10&#x02013;12 and 16&#x02013;18). Phosphorylation of STAT5 in the Src-/- mice at L2 and L9 was dramatically reduced compared to wildtype mice. At P18 the phosphorylation of STAT5 was evident in only one of the three Src-/- samples at a level comparable to that detected in the Src+/+ mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> lane 3 compared to 5&#x02013;6). During lactation only one of the analyzed Src-/- samples displayed more than a trace level of phosphorylated STAT5 signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> lane 9).

MECs were cultured on a laminin-rich basement membrane in the absence or presence of PRL, and protein lysates were harvested after 24 and 72 hours. The expression and activation of Src in the primary MECs isolated from each of the three genotypes was determined by western blotting. Src protein was detected in Src+/+ MECs, and a reduced level was detected in the Src+/- MECs, indicating that there was a dose-dependent relationship between the number of Src alleles and the level of Src protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>, middle panel, lanes 4&#x02013;9 and 13&#x02013;18). No Src protein was detected in MECs from Src-/- mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>, middle panel, lanes 1&#x02013;3 and 10&#x02013;12).

Due to the difficulty of timing specific biochemical events during natural involution, involution is experimentally induced by withdrawal of pups from a lactating dam. Although involution induced by pup withdrawal results in a process that is significantly different on the molecular level from that which occurs following natural weaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], it does result in a series of reproducible and well-defined histological and biochemical changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Pups were withdrawn after L9 from Src+/+ and Src-/- dams to induce involution. The first day following pup withdrawal is referred to involution day 1 (I1). Twenty four hours after pup withdrawal (I1), secretory alveoli were still present in the mammary glands of Src+/+ mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, panel A). By I2 secretory alveoli were distended and mammary adipocytes could be observed in the Src+/+ mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, panel B). Collapse of the lobular alveolar units, numerous mammary adipocytes, and distended ducts were clearly present in the mammary glands of control Src+/+ mice by I4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, panel C). The remodeling of the mammary gland continued after this point and was largely complete by I8 in the Src+/+ mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panel E).

Thus it appears that involution is dramatically accelerated in Src-/- mice, and may reflect the apparent failed secretory activation and the precocious involution that appears to occur in Src-/- dams even when pups are suckling and should be providing a stimulus for lactation and survival of mammary epithelial cells (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panels D and E).</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Involution is accelerated in mammary glands from Src-/- mice</bold>.

Because all of these receptors are important in different phases of mammary gland development, we were interested in exploring whether Src-like kinases mediated the downstream signaling events required for a functional mammary gland. Src, Fyn and Yes are widely expressed in different tissues, while the remaining family members (Blk, Hck, Fgr, Lyn, and Lck) are expressed in one or more lineages of hematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].

Soriano <italic>et al </italic>reported that most of the mice die at 3&#x02013;4 weeks if weaned, although a small number of mice could be maintained past five weeks if fed a soft diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Replacement of rodent chow with a liquid diet allows growth to a normal size and long-term survival.</p><p>We and others have described that Src is required for ductal elongation during puberty in Src-/- mice. Kim et al have suggested that this defect is due to diminished estrogen receptor signaling in the mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], while we hypothesize that expression of Src is required in the stromal cell compartment (Richert et al, unpublished data). The data presented in this manuscript describe a novel role for Src in the mammary gland during secretory activation and/or lactation that was not previously anticipated by the phenotype of the Src knockout mice. We have observed that the growth of pups nursed by Src-/- dams is severely diminished and over 80% of the litters do not survive more than a few days. This phenotype is determined by the genotype of the dam and not the pups such that the growth of FVB, C57Bl6 and Src+/- pups nursed by Src-/- dams was diminished. The fact that over 90% of pups born to Src-/- mothers die within days, and that over 80% of fostered litters also die, indicates that a failed lactation is the predominant phenotype. The variation in the histology of the lactating mammary gland may reflect a physiological state in which survival of mammary epithelial cells is supported even when lactation is compromised. Analysis of the mammary gland of Src-/- mice during pregnancy and lactation reveals that large CLDs accumulate in the MECs of Src-/- mice following parturition providing evidence that secretory activation has not occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Serum PRL levels in the Src-/- mice are normal indicating that neuronal stimulation of the hypothalamus, release of prolactin releasing factor, the response of the pituitary to this stimulus and hormonal signals from the pituitary are not affected by the absence of Src. We have demonstrated by gene expression profiling that expression of the long form of the PRLR increases at parturition in the mammary gland of normal mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which is in agreement with other data using PCR-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], however it appears that expression of the PRLR is diminished, although not absent, in the mammary glands of Src-/- mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). The decreased expression of the PRLR in the Src-/- mice can thus account for the diminished activation of the STAT5 transcription factor, which regulates expression of milk protein genes.</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p><bold>Model of the pathways required for secretory activation and lactation that are perturbed in Src-/- mice</bold>. A) PRLR EXPRESSION. In normal mice PRLR expression increases at parturition, this is absent in the Src-/- mice and they have decreased levels of both PRLR message and protein. B) INTEGRIN CROSSTALK. Integrin-mediated adhesion is essential for STAT5 activation downstream of PRLR signaling and Src may be a required mediator for the &#x003b2; 1 integrin-induced crosstalk. The Src-/- mice have diminished levels of STAT5 phosphorylation. C) POLARITY. Epithelial cell polarity is crucial for secretory activation. The mammary glands of Src-/- mice do not have organized lobuloalveolar structures and many of the epithelial cells do not show restricted apical staining suggesting that Src is required for epithelial cell polarity and organization. D) MILK PROTEIN TRANSCRIPTION. Src-/- mice have significantly less &#x003b2;-casein message compared to wildtype mice. This may be directly related to the decreased levels of STAT5 activation in these cells or Src may also be a required signaling molecule in the additional pathways necessary for milk protein transcription. E) MILK PROTEIN TRANSLATION. Milk protein expression is also regulated at the translational level. Src-/- mice have decreased levels of milk proteins and a possible role for Src in the post-transcriptional regulation has not been investigated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-8-6-11"/></fig><p>The impaired lactation we have observed in the Src-/- mice shares some features with those observed in the PRLR knockout mice described by Ormandy et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. While is not surprising that the PRLR-/- mice exhibit severely diminished lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy and a complete failure of lactation, it was unexpected that young PRLR+/- mice also exhibit severely diminished lactation since these mice still have one functional PRLR allele. Lactation failure only occurs after the first pregnancy of young PRLR+/- mice however, and the success of lactation in PRLR+/- mice improves as the number of pregnancies increases or if the mice are older at the time of first pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. This implies that there is an important effect of the level of PRLR expression upon mammary gland development either late in pregnancy or during secretory activation. In the PRLR+/- mice this is manifested by the lactation failure at first pregnancy that is offset by further mammary gland development that occurs as the mouse ages such that older PRLR+/- mice successfully lactate. Thus the phenotype we have observed in the Src-/- mice may be directly related to the level of PRLR expressed at secretory activation.</p><p>As noted in the introduction, we have identified four potential regulatory genes whose expression dramatically increases at secretory activation: PRLR, Src, Akt, and SREBP1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In light of these observations, it is interesting to note that in the absence of Src, the increase in the expression of the long form of the PRLR at secretory activation does not occur in Src-/- mice as observed in wildtype mice, suggesting that Src is required for optimal PRLR expression in the mammary gland during the transition from pregnancy to lactation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, panel A). Because the expected increase in PRLR expression and milk protein genes does not happen in the Src-/- mice we believe that secretory activation has not occurred. A recent study suggests that Akt1 plays a critical role in lactation, perhaps by regulating the levels and plasma membrane localization of GLUT1, as well as the levels of lipogenic enzymes whose expression are regulated by SREBP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. We have not examined whether the expression levels of either Akt or SREBP-1c are altered in the mammary gland of Src-/- mice.</p><p>As a means to confirm our <italic>in vivo </italic>observations, we chose to examine the differentiation of primary MECs established from Src+/+, Src+/-, and Src-/- mice. MECs were established from adult virgin mice following injection with progesterone and estradiol for 21 days to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of these cells. We used this approach because it allowed expansion of the epithelial cell compartment of the mammary gland in the absence of pregnancy which might have presented additional complications to the experimental design. MECs were plated on Matrigel, induced to differentiate following stimulation with PRL, and differentiation monitored by the expression of &#x003b2;-casein protein. At early time points after differentiation with PRL, the activation of STAT5 was lower in cultures of Src-/- MECs than in Src+/- or Src+/+ MECs, and the amount of &#x003b2;-casein protein was lower in Src-/- and Src+/- cells compared to Src+/+ MECs. There is an apparent dose-dependent effect on the amount of &#x003b2;-casein expressed in the cells with regard to the expression of Src. We have not detected a difference in the amount of PRLR in cultures of primary MECs from Src-/- mice compared to wildtype mice and thus suggest that there is an effect of Src upon either the transcription and/or translation of &#x003b2;-casein and by extension other milk protein genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, panels D and E).</p><p>A possible mechanism by which Src might regulate expression of &#x003b2;-casein is suggested by the observations of Streuli and his colleagues who have demonstrated a role for the cytoskeleton in PRL-dependent differentiation of MECs and that activation of STAT5 occurs in a integrin-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, panel B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Binding of integrins to extracellular matrix or peptide ligands leads to activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Src is associated with FAK and Src phosphorylates FAK on at least one site that may regulate activation of downstream signaling molecules including phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. In spite of the known association of Src with FAK and the ability of Src to phosphorylate FAK, we have not detected a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK at site favored by Src in the Src-/- MECs implying that other tyrosine kinases are able to phosphorylate this site in these cells (H. Watkin and S.M. Anderson, data not shown). This also suggests that while Src may be an intermediate in the pathway by which integrins regulate milk protein gene expression, it is likely that the Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK is not the means by which this occurs. The recent suggestion that Rac1 links integrins to lactational differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] causes us to wonder whether Src lies upstream, downstream, or is independent of Rac1.</p><p>The disorganized luminal structure of secretory alveoli in Src-/- mice also suggests an important role for Src in establishing the polarity of epithelial cells. Src family kinases have previously been implicated in both positive and negative regulation of epithelial tight junction assembly and polarization. Src-dependent phosphorylation of Par3 downstream of EGF receptor activation is required for tight junction formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]; however it has also been suggested that ErbB2-dependent activation of Src results in disruption of epithelial cell-cell contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>], thus highlighting the multiple roles of Src within a cell and the different effects that depend on upstream signals and cellular context. In the case of normal mammary gland development, it appears that Src plays a positive role with regard to the structural organization of the secretory epithelial cells within alveoli and the polarity of these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, panel C).</p><p>Additionally, several links have been reported between the activity of Src kinase and Rho GTPases. The small GTPases of the Rho family regulate many cellular functions including cell adhesion, migration and cell-cell junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Src is involved in the activation of Rac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] and Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>] and can inhibit Rho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. In the mammary gland Rac1 has been found to be required for lactational differentiation in a primary cell culture model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. Whilst we have not investigated the activation of Rac1 in the mammary glands of Src-/- mice this may be another pathway that could be perturbed by a lack of Src. PKN1 transgenic mice are another mouse model that display impaired secretory activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. The expression of a constitutively activated form of the Rho effector protein PKN1 results in impaired tight junction sealing. This implies that Rho negatively regulates tight junction closure. The possible requirement for Src to down regulate Rho is an additional mechanism by which Src may regulate secretory activation. Whilst we have observed disorganized alveolar structures in the Src-/- mice we have not established which of the many pathways that regulate tight junction formation, cell polarization, and differentiation are perturbed by the lack of Src in mammary epithelial cells.</p><p>Secretory activation occurs at parturition and is required for lactation. While the mechanisms underlying secretory activation remain unknown, we have noted that there are four signaling molecules/transcription factors whose expression is increased at this time; PRLR, Src, Akt1, and SREBP1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Secretory activation requires the coordinate increase in the expression of milk protein genes as well as the genes that are required for the synthesis of the lipid component present in milk. When the pattern of expression of milk proteins genes is closely examined, it becomes apparent that there are actually two different classes of milk proteins genes; the level of the casein-like class increases over the course of pregnancy and then undergoes a further three-fold increase at secretory activation (&#x003b1;-casein, &#x003b2;-casein, &#x003b4;-casein, &#x003ba;-casein, whey acidic, and ADPH), while the second does not increase during pregnancy and the RNA level only increases at secretory activation (&#x003b4;-casein, &#x003b1;-lactalbumin, MUC1, xanthine oxide dehydrogenase, and butyrophilin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The fact that we are able to detect &#x003b2;-casein RNA at P18 suggests to us that the increase in milk proteins genes in the early-expressed class, referred to as the casein-like genes above, occurs in the Src-/- mice, however the second increase in expression that occurs at secretory activation does not occur. This is re-enforced by the fact that there is no increase in the amount of &#x003b2;-casein RNA between P18 and L2 in the Src-/- as observed in the Src+/+ control mice. We have recently noted that expression of lipogenic enzymes increases dramatically at secretory activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and it would be of great interest to determine whether expression of these genes is altered in Src-/- mice. The fact that large CLDs are observed in the mammary glands from Src-/- mice clearly indicates that lipid biosynthesis during pregnancy is normal; however, it is not clear whether it increases following parturition.</p><p>The mammary glands of Src-/- mice undergo precious involution, as demonstrated by histology and biochemical markers. The decisive trigger for the onset of involution and apoptosis of the epithelial cells within the mammary gland is unknown, however a number of molecules and stimuli have been shown to play a role. These include milk stasis, leukemia inhibitory factor, STAT3 activation, interleukin 6, Fas ligand, loss of integrin activation, transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; 3 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. Lactation failure has been observed in the mammary glands of several other transgenic mice, including models with impaired tight junction sealing and another in which the milk has a high fat content which may result in milk stasis due to the inability of pups to remove milk from the mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]; in both of these models lactation failure leads to activation of a precocious involution program. The lactation failure observed in the Src-/- mice may result in a dominant signal that results in precocious involution and thus it is not possible to determine whether Src is required for survival of mammary epithelial cells. The fact that increased apoptosis was not observed in primary mammary epithelial cells from Src-/- mice, and the fact that mammary epithelial cells proliferate during pregnancy suggest that Src may not be required for cell survival although we have not directly tested this possibility.</p><p>Our studies indicate a new role for Src that had not been anticipated based upon previous studies of Src-/- mice, or the study of mammary gland development using either <italic>in vivo </italic>or <italic>in vitro </italic>systems. The role for Src in secretory activation and lactation is apparently unique to Src as we have not observed this phenotype in Fyn-/- mice. The lactation failure in the Src-/- mice demonstrates that other Src family members are not able to compensate for the loss of Src. Given the number of different regulatory pathways activated in secretory activation, which includes both Akt1 and SREBP1, it will be of great interest to determine whether expression of any of the regulatory molecules that lie downstream of the PRLR is able to compensate for the loss of Src in secretory activation. We would anticipate that expression of some might complement the loss of Src in stimulating expression of milk protein genes in MECs, while other molecules might be required to complement the loss of Src in vivo. Expression of constitutively activated signaling molecules in vitro and in the mammary gland in vivo, via either the use of recombinant human adenoviruses or expression of transgenes in the mammary gland will provide additional insights into the multiple actions of Src in this tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Src is essential in the mammary gland for successful lactation as Src-/- mice are unable to support the growth, and often the survival, of their pups. Histological analysis of mammary glands from late pregnant and post-partum Src-/- mice suggests that Src-/- mice fail to undergo secretory activation. The precise mechanisms by which secretory activation are controlled are not yet fully understood, however we have studied some of the known critical factors in order to investigate the role of Src, summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>. Src is required for an increase in PRLR expression and may also be required for the crosstalk from integrin signaling that is essential for signal propagation down-stream of the PRLR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, panels A and B). Tight junction closure is a hallmark of secretory activation and epithelial polarity is essential for lactation. The disorganized luminal structure of secretory alveoli in Src-/- mice suggest an important role for Src in establishing the polarity of epithelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, panel C). Src-/- mice also have decreased levels of &#x003b2;-casein message (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, panels D and E). <italic>In vitro </italic>studies conducted on MEC from Src-/- mice suggest a primary role for Src in regulating either the transcription or translation of milk protein genes that may be distinct from its role in secretory activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Src-/- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] mice were obtained from Dr. Paul Stein (Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago, IL).

Thus Src-/- and Src+/- mice are mixed C57Bl6 and 129Sv. The Src-/- mice lack teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and therefore were fed Liquid Rat Diet (Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ; Product #F1259SP) and water <italic>ad librium</italic>.

Genotyping of Src-/- mice utilized the following primers: NeoSrc, 5'-TCATAGCCGAATAGCCTCTCCAC-3'; forward Src primer, 5'-AGCAACAAGAGCAAGCCCAAGGAC-3', and reverse Src primer, 5'-GTGACGGTGTCCGAGGAGTTGAAG-3'. One microgram of DNA was amplified by PCR using primers (50 pmol/reaction) described above: 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min; 30 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 1.5 min, 60&#x000b0;C for 1.5 min, and 72&#x000b0;C for 1.5 min; followed by a 10 min extension time at 72&#x000b0;C.

All of the mammary glands were removed, and the surrounding tissue and inguinal lymph nodes removed to minimize contamination of the cultures. MECs were prepared as described by Pullan and Strueli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>]. The isolated aggregates of mammary organoids were washed 3&#x000d7; in F12 medium to remove single cells such as fibroblasts.

Homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 &#x000d7; g for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C and immunoblot analysis performed as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Zymogram gels</title><p>The samples to be analyzed were prepared from frozen tissue in mammary gland extraction buffer and protein concentrations quantified as described above. 30 &#x003bc;g of total protein was diluted in SDS sample buffer lacking &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and was not heat denatured prior to loading. Samples were separated on a 7.5% SDS gel containing 3 mg/ml of type A porcine gelatin (Sigma Aldrich, cat. #G-2500). The gels were run at 60 V for 30&#x02013;45 min through the stacking gel and then at 120 V until the samples reached the bottom of the running gel. The gels were washed twice for 30 minutes in 2.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature while rocking. The gels were then incubated on a rocking platform at 37&#x000b0;C for 24&#x02013;72 hours in substrate buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). The gels were stained for one hour at room temperature with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue-R, and destained overnight in water.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADPH, adipophilin; CLD, cytoplasmic lipid droplet; DAPI, 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MECs, mammary epithelial cells; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; MRNA, messenger RNA; PRL, prolactin; PRLR, prolactin receptor; QRT-PCR, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA, Ribonucleic Acid; SREBP, sterol response element binding protein; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3; STAT5, signal transducer and activator of transcription-5; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HW carried out the pup weight experiments, quantitative RT-PCR, primary cell culture, western blot analysis and drafted the manuscript.
