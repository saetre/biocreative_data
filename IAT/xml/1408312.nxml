Based on our previous study with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> exonuclease III (ExoIII), the ExoIII family AP endonucleases probably recognize the DNA-pocket formed at an AP site. The indole ring of a conserved tryptophan residue in the vicinity of the catalytic site presumably intercalates into this pocket. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a series of mutants of ExoIII and human APE1. Trp-212 of ExoIII and Trp-280 of APE1 were critical to the AP endonuclease activity and binding to DNA containing an AP site. To confirm the ability of the tryptophan residue to intercalate with the AP site, we examined the interaction between an oligopeptide containing a tryptophan residue and an oligonucleotide containing AP sites, using spectrofluorimetry and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. The tryptophan residue of the oligopeptide specifically intercalated into an AP site of DNA. The tryptophan residue in the vicinity of the catalytic site of the ExoIII family AP endonucleases plays a key role in the recognition of AP sites.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cellular DNA is spontaneously and continuously damaged by environmental and internal factors such as X-rays, ultraviolet (UV) light, alkylating agents and oxygen radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). DNA damage contributes to mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites form with the repair of damaged bases during base excision repair (BER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Damage-specific DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosidases cleave the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic linkage between the damaged base and deoxyribose ring, producing an AP site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Furthermore, AP sites are generated by the spontaneous loss of normal bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). In human lung fibroblasts, the number of AP sites in the steady state is about 0.67/10<sup>6</sup> nt (&#x0223c;2000 AP sites/human cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Unless the AP site is repaired, transcription and replication are disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In BER, the AP endonuclease is an important player in the repair of AP sites. This enzyme recognizes a AP site in DNA and cleaves on the 5&#x02032; side of the site through AP endonuclease activity. In mammals, after cleavage of the AP site by APE1 AP endonuclease, the nucleotide gap is filled, the 5&#x02032;-abasic residue is removed, and the nick is sealed in the short-patch or long-patch pathway. In these pathways, DNA polymerase&#x003b2; and DNA ligase III act in the short-patch pathway and DNA polymerase&#x003b2;/&#x0025b;, flap endonuclease (FEN1) and DNA ligase I act in the long-patch pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p>Based on the homology of the amino acid sequences and structures, AP endonucleases are divided into the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> exonuclease III (ExoIII) family and <italic>E.coli</italic> endonuclease IV family. From prokaryotes to eukaryotes, a number of genes which encode ExoIII family AP endonucleases have been cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The major AP endonuclease of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, which is termed APE1 (also APEX, HAP1 or Ref-1), belongs to the ExoIII family. The <italic>E.coli xthA</italic> mutant lacking ExoIII was shown to be hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide and UV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Homozygous mutant mice lacking the APE1 AP endonuclease died early in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Experiments with these deletion mutants have suggested that the AP endonucleases play an important role in the life of organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.</p><p>Despite many studies of the ExoIII family AP endonucleases, how they recognize AP sites has not yet been elucidated. Four mechanisms of recognition have been proposed. Hypothesis I: based on the structure of <italic>E.coli</italic> ExoIII, it has been suggested that the AP endonuclease recognizes an extrahelical non-pairing base opposite an AP site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Hypothesis II: based on the crystal structure of APE1 with or without substrate DNA, it has been suggested that the AP endonuclease recognizes an extrahelical abasic deoxyribose ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Hypothesis III: a specific local distortion produced by the AP site might be recognized by the AP endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Hypothesis IV: we have proposed that the space produced by deletion of the nucleic acid base is recognized by the AP endonuclease through intercalation of the aromatic side chain (indole ring) of the tryptophan residue, which is located in the vicinity of the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). In the case of ExoIII, this tryptophan residue is Trp-212. The tryptophan residue protrudes from the open face of the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). This hypothesis was based on our previous experimental results.</p><p>In our previous experiments, ExoIII cleaved single-stranded DNA containing an AP site, and DNA containing an AP site analog such as propanediol, which had no ring structure, was a good substrate for the endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). From these results, it has been suggested that an orphan base opposite an AP site and abasic ribose ring are not critical for recognition of the AP site by the ExoIII family AP endonuclease. Moreover, it was clarified that ExoIII and APE1 do not cleave bulged DNA, which is similar in structure to AP-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). This result has indicated that a site-specific structure, namely a specific local distortion, is not recognized by the AP endonuclease. Therefore, hypotheses I, II and III seem not to explain how the AP site is recognized by the ExoIII family AP endonucleases. According to hypothesis IV, the tryptophan residue in the vicinity of the catalytic site is conserved from bacteria to mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, the tryptophan side chain of the tripeptide (Lys-Trp-Lys) intercalates into the space of the AP site in double-stranded DNA supports this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>).</p><p>The present study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism by which the ExoIII family AP endonucleases recognize AP sites. First, based on hypothesis IV, we constructed a series of mutants of ExoIII and APE1 with substitutions of the aromatic amino acid residues, which exist in the vicinity of the active site. The AP endonuclease activity and binding ability of the mutants were examined using oligonucleotides containing AP sites. Second, to confirm that tryptophan has the ability to interact specifically with the AP site, we examined the specific binding of an oligopeptide containing a tryptophan residue to the oligonucleotides containing AP sites using spectrofluorimetry and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction and site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>The overexpression plasmid for <italic>E.coli</italic> ExoIII was produced by cloning a PCR-generated <italic>xthA</italic> fragment into the EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites of pKP1500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).

Three residues, Glu-34, Asp-229 and His-259 of <italic>E.coli</italic> ExoIII and Glu-96, Asp-283 and His-309 of human APE1, are known to be essential for AP endonuclease activity as catalytic residues, but not for the recognition of DNA containing an AP site (AP-DNA). The crystallographic studies showed that the three residues are located in close proximity to each other at the bottom of a putative DNA-binding cleft. The sequence alignment of twelve homologs shows that some aromatic amino acid residues are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the reverse displayed amino acids). These residues reside in the vicinity of the catalytic centers of these AP endonucleases. We have proposed that an aromatic amino acid residue near the catalytic center of the AP endonuclease plays a key role in the recognition of AP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Hence, three conserved aromatic amino acid residues in the vicinity of the catalytic center of ExoIII, Tyr-109, Trp-212 and Phe-213, were selected for site-directed mutagenesis. Mutational analyses of the aromatic amino acid residues of APE1 were performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). The mutation of Phe-266, which corresponds to Trp-212 of ExoIII, had only minor effects on the cleavage and binding abilities of APE1. The mutation of Trp-267, which corresponds to Phe-213 of ExoIII, also only slightly affected function. From these results, it was considered that the specific intercalation of the aromatic amino acid into the AP site was unlikely. However, based on the crystal structure of human APE1, we speculate that Phe-266 and Trp-267 do not serve as the intercalator, but Trp-280 intercalates into the AP site, as well as Trp-212 of ExoIII. Trp-212 of ExoIII and Trp-280 of APE1 protrude from the surface in the vicinity of the catalytic center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Therefore, Trp-280 of APE1 was selected as the target of mutagenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of mutant ExoIII and APE1 proteins</title><p>The ExoIII mutant proteins, Y109S, W212S and F213W, were purified from the supernatants of cell extracts. Since the mutant protein, F213S, was expressed as an inclusion body, soluble F213S was obtained from the purified inclusion body by a renaturation procedure. It was confirmed that the method used in this study was suitable for ExoIII by renaturation of the inclusion body of the wild-type ExoIII. The wild-type ExoIII proteins purified from the inclusion body and from the supernatant had almost the same AP endonuclease activity (data not shown). The wild-type and mutant proteins of APE1 were purified as soluble proteins. All these proteins were detected as a clear single band by SDS&#x02013;PAGE followed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Cleavage activities and complex formation abilities of the ExoIII mutant proteins</title><p>All the mutant proteins were assayed for the ability to cleave DNA containing an AP site, which was a 1&#x02032;, 2&#x02032;-dideoxyribose residue (tetrahydrofuran residue). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the double-stranded AP-DNA substrate was almost completely cleaved by the wild-type ExoIII (lane 3). Under the same conditions, no cleaved product was detected from the W212S mutant protein (lane 4). The mutant proteins, F213W (lane 5), F213S (lane 6) and Y109S (data not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), cleaved the double-stranded AP-DNA by 90, 72 and 14%, respectively. Products smaller than product 1 were generated by exonucleolytic cleavage of the AP endonucleolytic product from the 3&#x02032; end to the 5&#x02032; side (product 2). In our previous study, it has been elucidated that ExoIII cleaves single-stranded DNA containing an AP site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). The single-stranded AP-DNA was cleaved by the wild-type ExoIII (lane 7) and the mutant proteins F213W (lane 9), F213S (lane 10) and Y109S (data not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) by 65, 19, 17 and 4%, respectively. However, the W212S mutant did not cleave the single-stranded AP-DNA at all (lane 8).</p><p>To find the cause of the decrease in the cleavage activity of the mutant ExoIII proteins, substrate-binding ability was examined using a gel retardation assay with a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled AP-DNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, unambiguous retarded bands, which correspond to the AP-DNA&#x02022;ExoIII complex, were observed in the case of the wild-type ExoIII and the F213W mutant. The binding ability of the F213W mutant (lane 4) relative to that of the wild-type ExoIII (lane 2) was 90%. In the case of the F213S mutant protein, a subtle retarded band of the AP-DNA&#x02022;F213S complex (lane 5) was detected (6%) and a smeared band was observed. This phenomenon indicates that the F213S mutant has a weak, but obvious ability to bind AP-DNA. A slight decrease in the intensity of the complex's band was observed for the Y109S protein (data not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, 40%). In the case of W212S, the complex was not detected at all (lane 3). The tendency for ExoIII and its mutant proteins to form a complex was nearly identical to the tendency of their AP endonuclease activities. Based on the results described above, it has been elucidated that the Trp-212 residue of <italic>E.coli</italic> ExoIII is critical for the AP endonuclease activity and also the ability to bind AP-DNA. It has already been clarified that Glu-34, Asp-229 and His-259 are the catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Though Trp-212 is not among the catalytic residues, it is obvious that it too plays an important role.</p></sec><sec><title>Cleavage activities and complex formation abilities of the APE1 mutant proteins</title><p>To ascertain the importance of the tryptophan residue for the functions of the ExoIII family AP endonucleases, mutational experiments of APE1 were conducted similar to the ExoIII mutants. There are four aromatic amino acid residues, Tyr-171, Phe-266, Trp-267 and Trp-280, in the vicinity of the catalytic center of human APE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because Tyr-171 of APE1 corresponds to Tyr-109 of ExoIII which is not important for AP endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), a Tyr-171 mutant of APE1 was not prepared. In addition, it has already been demonstrated that Trp-267 is not related to the AP endonuclease activity with the use of the W267A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Thus, we prepared F266S and W280S mutants in this study. The position of Phe-266 of APE1 corresponds to that of Trp-212 of ExoIII, which is a critical amino acid residue for the activity of ExoIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). ExoIII does not have an aromatic amino acid residue at the position corresponding to Trp-280 of APE1. However, it has been elucidated from an X-ray crystallographic analysis that Trp-280 of APE1 extrudes from the surface of the active site as does Trp-212 of ExoIII. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the double-stranded AP-DNA substrate was almost completely cleaved by the wild-type APE1 (lane 3). Under the same conditions, the F266S mutant cleaved the AP-DNA as much as the wild-type APE1 (lane 4, 82% of the wild-type cleavage). On the other hand, the W280S mutant protein (lane 5) did not cleave the double-stranded AP-DNA at all. A similar tendency was observed for the binding of the mutant proteins to the double-stranded AP-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The F266S mutant bound to AP-DNA like the wild-type APE1 (93% of the wild-type binding). However, W280S did not form a complex (lane 4). These results have suggested that the tryptophan residue protruding from the surface of the catalytic center of the AP endonuclease, such as Trp-212 of ExoIII and Trp-280 of APE1, plays an important role in the function of the AP endonuclease.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of translocating tryptophan in the vicinity of the active site on the functions of the AP endonuclease</title><p>The tryptophan residues in the vicinity of the catalytic sites of the ExoIII family AP endonucleases are conserved at the position corresponding to Trp-212 of ExoIII and/or Trp-280 of APE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The W212S mutant of ExoIII had neither AP endonuclease activity nor any ability to bind AP-DNA as described above (lanes 4 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, respectively). Then we prepared the W212S/L226W mutant of ExoIII, in which the tryptophan residue was translocated from position 212 to 226. Namely, the Leu-226 of ExoIII was changed to Trp-226 because Leu-226 of ExoIII corresponds to the position of the critical Trp-280 of APE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the W212S/L226W mutant had almost the same level of AP endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 5, 66%) and the same binding ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 4, 82%) as the wild-type ExoIII. In a similar manner, we tried to recover the AP endonuclease activity of the inactivated W280S APE1 mutant, which lost the critical Trp-280 residue. The F266S mutant of APE1 has AP endonuclease activity and can bind AP-DNA as described previously [lane 4 (82%) and lane 3 (93%) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>, respectively]. These results indicate that Phe-266 does not play an important role in the enzyme activity of APE1. The F266S/W280S mutant which lacked the critical residue Trp-280 also lost all AP endonuclease activity and ability to bind AP-DNA (lanes 5 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, respectively). We then prepared a F266W/W280S mutant, in which Phe-266 of the W280S protein was replaced with Trp-266. In this mutant, it can be considered that Trp-280 and Ser-266 of the F266S protein are exchanged. The F266W/W280S mutant had almost the same level of AP endonuclease activity and binding ability as the wild-type APE1 or F266S mutant [lane 6 (82%) and lane 5 (82%) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, respectively]. Consequently, if there is a tryptophan residue in the position that corresponds to Trp-212 of ExoIII or Trp-280 of APE1, the ExoIII family AP endonuclease functions as an AP endonuclease.</p><p>In order to detect the interactions between APE1 mutants and AP-DNA on a condition, that was nearer <italic>in vivo</italic> than the condition of the gel retardation assays, direct binding experiments using SPR-based Biacore technology were performed. The response was directly proportional to the bound mass. APE1 and its mutants as analytes were dialyzed against 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA and 10 mM HEPES&#x02013;NaOH (pH 7.4) immediately before use. Consistent with the results obtained from the gel retardation assay, the direct binding analyses using the SPR-based Biacore technology clearly demonstrated that the tryptophan residue in the vicinity of the catalytic center played an important role in the formation of a complex with the double-stranded AP-DNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the W280S and F266S/W280S mutants lacking the tryptophan residue near the catalytic center showed only week interaction with the oligonucleotide containing three AP sites. These weak responses were also observed in the SPR analyses of the wild-type APE1 and its mutants with the DNA not containing an AP site (data not shown). It seems that the subtle binding is due to non-specific interactions, so-called electrostatic interactions. There was no response at all when BSA was used as an analyte (data not shown). Therefore, it has been speculated that these weak responses due to non-specific interaction correspond to the palpation of the DNA to search for an AP site by the AP endonuclease. The wild-type APE1 with Trp-280, the F266S mutant with Trp-280 and the F266W/W280S mutant with Trp-266 were bound to the double-stranded AP-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Using Biacore technology, significant binding responses of the wild-type APE1, F266S and F266W/W280S to the single-stranded AP-DNA (3AP-ssDNA) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), although a complex of APE1 and the single-stranded AP-DNA was not detected by the gel retardation assay (data not shown). The response of the wild-type APE1, F266S and F266W/W280S to the double-stranded AP-DNA decreased in strength in that order. It has been elucidated that the function of the AP endonuclease is maintained even if the critical tryptophan residue migrates to a different position within the catalytic center. We could not obtain kinetic parameters for the native APE1 and its mutants because the observed sensorgrams did not fit any model. These unfitted sensorgrams could be due to the AP-DNA containing three AP sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction between peptides containing a tryptophan residue and AP-DNA</title><p>It has been clarified that the conserved tryptophan residues near the catalytic sites of ExoIII and APE1 play an important role in the formation of the complex and AP endonuclease activity. This finding implies that the tryptophan residue interacts with the AP site. Thus, we have assumed that the tryptophan residue in the vicinity of the catalytic center of the AP endonuclease intercalates into the space of the AP site. To investigate the possibility that the tryptophan residue is inserted into the AP site, the interaction between the peptide containing a tryptophan residue and the double-stranded DNA containing AP sites was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>To examine the interaction between the peptide and AP-DNA, experiments using SPR-based Biacore technology were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Because of the insolubility of the oligopeptide that referred to the amino acid sequence surrounding Trp-212 of ExoIII, it was not used. Two peptides which are rich in basic amino acids in order to enhance the electrostatic interaction between the peptide and AP-DNA were prepared. The peptide sequences used as the analytes were KSRGKWKGRSK (11KWK) and KSRGKAKGRSK (11KAK). The amino acid sequence of 11KWK is the same as that of 11KAK, except that a tryptophan residue is substituted for the alanine residue at the center of the peptide. Both peptides bound to the native double-stranded DNA (3Native-dsDNA) to the same degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, this binding seems to be attributable to a non-specific interaction such as an electrostatic interaction. To the double-stranded DNA containing three AP sites (3AP-dsDNA), 11KWK showed an obviously large response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). On the other hand, the strength of the interaction of 11KAK with 3AP-dsDNA was almost the same as that of a non-specific interaction with the native DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). It has been understood that a process obviously different from an electrostatic interaction occurs during the interaction between 11KWK and 3AP-dsDNA.</p><p>To clarify how 11KWK interacts with AP-DNA, the interaction between 11KWK and AP-DNA was examined using a fluorescent spectrophotometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The environment around the tryptophan residue influences the emission of the residue. The emission spectrum of the tryptophan residue in a mixture of 11KWK and 3Native-dsDNA was slightly decreased when compared with 11KWK alone (&#x0223c;88%). In the case of a mixture of 11KWK and AP-dsDNA, an unambiguous quenching of &#x0223c;53% was observed in the emission spectrum of the tryptophan residue of 11KWK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This phenomenon indicates that the tryptophan residue of 11KWK is embedded in a hydrophobic pocket, that is, the AP site.</p></sec><sec><title>Thermal stabilization of AP-DNA by a peptide containing a tryptophan residue</title><p>The stabilization of the nucleic acid structures by proteins or peptides can be readily monitored as an elevation in the nucleic acid <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>.

Thus, these results have suggested that the tryptophan residue intercalates into the pocket of the AP site instead of the deleted nucleic acid base.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>AP sites are generated spontaneously under physiological conditions and produced enzymatically during the process of BER. How to repair these AP sites is an essential problem for all organisms. AP endonucleases seem to be evolutionarily stable, and the homology of these enzymes from bacteria to mammals is surprisingly high. Many studies have been performed to characterize AP endonucleases. However, the mechanism by which the ExoIII family AP endonucleases recognize AP sites has not yet been clarified. Many complex structures formed between DNA-repair enzymes and substrate DNAs have already been reported. Such structures are stable Michaelis complexes. Because the initial step in the recognition of a DNA-damaged site by a DNA-repair enzyme occurs before the formation of the ultimate Michaelis complex, the early-stage recognition mechanisms cannot be determined from these complex structures. With respect to how the AP sites are identified by the ExoIII family AP endonuclease, four hypotheses have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). In this study, we focused on a number of aromatic amino acid residues in the vicinity of the catalytic site that may play a definitive role in the recognition of AP sites.</p><p>Previously, we speculated that an indole ring of the tryptophan residue or a side chain of another aromatic amino acid residue in the vicinity of the catalytic site intercalates into the DNA-pocket formed at an abasic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). In the present study, site-directed mutagenesis of the aromatic amino acid residues of <italic>E.coli</italic> ExoIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and human APE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) demonstrated that Trp-212 of ExoIII and Trp-280 of APE1 are critical for the AP endonuclease activity and binding to AP-DNA. Each of these site-directed mutants, W212S of ExoIII and W280S of APE1, lost all AP endonuclease activity and the ability to bind AP-DNA, although these essential tryptophan residues are not catalytic amino acid residues. It was shown that these tryptophan residues protrude from the hollow catalytic sites by the crystal structures of the AP endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). It was reported that the mutation of Trp-267 of APE1, which is at almost the same position as Trp-212 of ExoIII, did not influence its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). This Trp-267 is buried at the surface in the vicinity of the catalytic site. Therefore, we speculate that the tryptophan residue protruding from the surface near the catalytic center of the AP endonuclease is a key residue at the initial stage of in the recognition of a substrate. The ExoIII and APE1 AP endonucleases belong to the DNase I superfamily and retain the tryptophan residue near the catalytic site. Members of this superfamily such as DNase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), the cytolethal distending toxin subunit B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), the endonuclease domain of LINE-1 reverse transcriptase homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) and the endonuclease domain of TRAS1 retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>), lack AP endonuclease activity, and do not have a tryptophan residue in the vicinity of the catalytic sites. These findings support that the tryptophan residue near the catalytic site is indispensable for AP endonuclease activity.</p><p>To investigate the function of the tryptophan residue, experiments involving interaction between an oligopeptide containing a tryptophan residue and an oligonucleotide containing an AP site were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Basic peptides containing a tryptophan residue, KSRGKWKGRSK (11KWK) and lacking a tryptophan residue, KSRGKAKGRSK (11KAK), were used. Using SPR-based Biacore technology, the interaction between the peptide and AP-DNA was investigated. Both the peptides lacking and containing a tryptophan residue weakly interacted with the native DNA duplex to the same degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The interaction seems to be an electrostatic interaction between the basic peptide and the oligonucleotide. As for the oligopeptide 11KWK containing a tryptophan residue, a characteristic interaction obviously different from an electrostatic interaction was observed with the oligonucleotide duplex containing an AP site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Furthermore, specific interaction between 11KWK and the oligonucleotide duplex (AP-DNA) was observed in the experiment with the mixture of 11KWK and AP-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These observations provided further support for our hypothesis that the indole ring of the tryptophan residue in the vicinity of the catalytic site of the AP endonuclease intercalates into the DNA-pocket formed at an abasic site.</p><p>In the sequence of DNA-repair processes, DNA-repair enzymes recognize, hold and excise the damaged parts in the huge DNA duplex. Recent studies have discussed a long-standing question with regard to DNA recognition, namely, how do site-specific DNA-binding proteins find their target sites in DNA? Many studies have been carried out to answer this question, and three proposals (sliding, hopping and intersegmental transfer) have been made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). In all these processes, the protein initially binds at a random non-specific site in the DNA, then translocates from the initial binding site to the final specific target site. It seems that the weak responses between the APE1 mutants (W280S, F266S/W280S) and the AP-DNA, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, are attributed to a weak non-specific binding between the mutants and DNA during the translocational search. This non-specific binding was also observed in the SPR analyses of the wild-type APE1 and its mutants with the native DNA (data not shown).</p><p>The many complex structures between DNA-repair enzymes and damaged DNA have been solved. These structures seem to be stable and to be the ultimate Michaelis complexes immediately before or after the reaction. Solving the complex structures has provided the structural basis for understanding the catalytic mechanism and the manner in which the substrate is hold. However, the initial recognition of the target site in DNA, which occurs before the formation of the Michaelis complex, is a dynamic process with an induced-fit (conformational change) of the enzyme and the target DNA. Therefore, the initial damage-encountering complex is not equivalent to the stable complex structures analyzed by NMR or X-ray. In the X-ray structure of APE1&#x02022;AP-DNA complex, the essential tryptophan residue does not intercalate into the AP site pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). However, it is almost certainly correct that the intercalation of the tryptophan residue occurs in the first step of the complex's formation prior to the development of the Michaelis complex.</p><p>We speculate about the process by which the AP site is recognized by a tryptophan residue as follows. First of all, the AP endonuclease searches for an AP site while translocating on the DNA strand. It recognizes such a site through the insertion of a tryptophan residue into the AP site pocket and then becomes fixed there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We term such a tryptophan residue a &#x02018;recognizer&#x02019;. In addition, the induced-fit from this state to the Michaelis complex seems to happen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Finally, the AP endonuclease cleaves the AP site, and then migrates from the cleaved site.</p><p>There are many ExoIII homologue proteins, which have two tryptophan residues at the positions corresponding to Trp-212 of ExoIII and Trp-280 of APE1. Such ExoIII family AP endonucleases widely exist in bacteria. ExoA of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is an AP endonuclease of this type (namely ExoA type AP endonuclease). We have already clarified the properties of this ExoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). It has been elucidated that ExoA is a multifunctional DNA-repair enzyme in <italic>B.subtilis</italic> that is very similar to <italic>E.coli</italic> ExoIII except with less 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. Further evidence in support of the role of the tryptophan residue in the vicinity of the catalytic site of the ExoA type AP endonucleases from <italic>Thermoplasma volcanium</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> will be reported elsewhere.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Prof. S.
