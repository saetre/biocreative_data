In order to investigate the involvement of each of these functions in releasing RNA from the elongation complex, we have isolated different termination defective mutants of Rho by random mutagenesis, characterized them for their different functions and established the structure-function correlations from the available structural data of Rho. These mutations are located within the two domains; the N-terminal RNA binding domain (G51V, G53V, and Y80C) and in the C-terminal ATP binding domain (Y274D, P279S, P279L, G324D, N340S, I382N) including the two important structural elements, the Q-loop (P279S, P279L) and R-loop (G324D). Termination defects of the mutants in primary RNA binding domain and Q-loop could not be restored under any conditions that we tested and these were also defective for most of the other functions of Rho. The termination defects of the mutants (Y274D, G324D and N340S), which were mainly defective for secondary RNA binding and likely defective for translocase activity, could be restored under relaxed <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. We also show that a mutation in a primary RNA binding domain (Y80C) can cause a defect in ATP binding and induce distinct conformational changes in the distal C-terminal domain, and these allosteric effects are not predictable from the crystal structure. We conclude that the interactions in the primary RNA binding domain and in the Q-loop are mandatory for RNA release to occur and propose that the interactions in the primary RNA binding modulate most of the other functions of Rho allosterically. The rate of ATP hydrolysis regulates the processivity of translocation along the RNA and is directly correlated with the efficiency of RNA release. NusG improves the speed of RNA release and is not involved in any other step.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>Rho</kwd><kwd>NusG</kwd><kwd>transcription termination</kwd><kwd>mutagenesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Once the process of transcription is initiated, RNA polymerase (RNAP) makes a stable elongation complex with the DNA and the nascent RNA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Elongation complex (EC) only dissociates in response to <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> termination signals.

We concluded that the mutations in the N-terminal primary RNA binding domain can exert allosteric effects in the distal C-terminal domain, and this domain may act as a &#x0201c;master switch&#x0201d; that governs all the other functions of Rho. The primary RNA binding domain and the Q-loop are the most crucial structural elements for the RNA release function. Altered interactions in the secondary RNA binding domain only reduce the rate of ATPase activity which most likely slows down the translocation rate of Rho along the RNA. The rate of ATP hydrolysis is directly correlated with the efficiency of RNA release and involvement of NusG is restricted only to the final step of RNA release from the EC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Isolation of termination defective mutants of Rho</title><p id="P8">We have randomly mutagenized the whole <italic>rho</italic> gene and screened for mutants defective for termination at two Rho-dependent terminators (see Materials and Methods).

These mutations are G51V, G53V, Y80C, Y274D, P279S, P279L, G324D, N340S and I382N. G51V and I382N mutations were independently isolated at least six times.

Termination defects exhibited by these mutations on three Rho-dependent terminators (defect for <italic>nutR/TR<sub>1</sub></italic> terminator is described below) suggest that the defect is not specific for a particular terminator.

These reporter fusions were present as a single copy prophage (see Materials and Methods and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref> for the strains).

Even in the presence of a WT copy of Rho, the read-through efficiency of the mutants was significantly high (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, column 7). This could be attributed to the multi-copy (copy number of pCL1920 is &#x0223c;5)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> dominance of the mutant Rho over WT Rho. The partial suppression of the defects could also arise from the mixing of WT and mutant protomers of Rho.</p><p id="P11">The kinetic coupling model of Rho-dependent termination predicts that a slow moving RNA polymerase can suppress the effect of defective Rho.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> So we wanted to know whether the defects of these mutants could be suppressed by B8 (rpoB, Q513P), a slow elongating RNA polymerase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> Similar measurements of termination read-through in the presence of B8 RNAP showed that defects of none of the Rho mutants were suppressed by the &#x0201c;slow&#x0201d; RNAP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, column 10), which is in contrast to earlier observations of different Rho mutants being suppressed by this RNAP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> According to the kinetic coupling model, slow RNAP will suppress only the Rho mutants which are defective in translocation along the RNA. Thus, either these mutants translocate too slow to catch up B8 RNAP or these mutants are defective in other steps of Rho-dependent termination. It is also noted that none of these mutants were compatible with a fast moving RNAP, B2 (rpoB, H526Y). It was difficult to obtain transformants in the strain having B2 RNAP in the chromosome with all the plasmids bearing Rho mutants. The defects of these Rho mutants might have amplified in the presence of a fast moving RNAP that caused this lethality. We also observed increased read-through activity with the slow RNAP (B8), which was unexpected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, column 10) and the reason for this is not clear.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> termination defects of the Rho mutants</title><p id="P12"><italic>In vitro</italic> transcription termination activity of the Rho mutants was studied at the <italic>trp t</italic>&#x02019;terminator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> using purified WT and all the mutant Rho proteins, except G53V and P279L.

These mutants (and N340S; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(a) and (b)</xref>) might have defects in the RNA release step(s) from the EC, and NusG is likely to be involved in this step during the Rho-dependent termination process.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Location of the mutations on the crystal structure of Rho and prediction of functional defects</title><p id="P14">We mapped the positions of the mutations on the recently reported hexameric closed ring structure of Rho, which has both the primary and secondary RNA binding sites occupied with nucleic acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(a) and (b)</xref>). In general, the mutations are located within or close to the previously identified important functional domains of Rho. Among them, G51V, G53V and Y80C are in the primary RNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(c)</xref>). Y274D, P279S and P279L are in or close to the Q-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(d)</xref>). G324D and N340S are close to the secondary RNA binding domain and G324D is in the R-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(d)</xref>). The mutation I382N could not be located on the structure as the C-terminal end of the closed ring structure of Rho is not resolved.

So there is a high probability that Y80C change will affect the primary RNA binding drastically. Amino acids G51 and G53 also come within 12-14 &#x000c5; of the nucleic acid in the crystal structure and changes in these amino acids can also affect the primary RNA binding (see the distance calculations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(e)</xref>). The crystal structure revealed the binding of only two nucleotides, whereas about ten nucleotides can be occupied in the primary RNA binding site of a monomer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Therefore it is likely that other amino acids of this domain (including G51 and G53) will take part in the primary RNA binding.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> Defect in the primary RNA binding due to the change in these three amino acids will subsequently affect the secondary RNA binding and the RNA release processes.</p><p id="P16">The amino acids G324 and N340 are situated close to the RNA in the secondary RNA binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(d) and (e)</xref>). It is likely that G324, located in the R-loop, will take part directly in the interaction with RNA. Therefore, it can be predicted that changes in these two amino acids will cause a defect in the secondary RNA binding and in the ATP hydrolysis activities. This may in turn affect the processive translocation of Rho along the RNA, which will lead to a termination defect.</p><p id="P17">P279S and P279L changes in the Q-loop can alter the loop conformation by extending the length of the preceding helix. The closed ring structure of Rho revealed that the Q-loop is about 30 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(e)</xref>) away from the nearest RNA residue in the secondary RNA binding site. In the closed ring structure of Rho, the Q-loop forms a hairpin-like structure from the disordered conformations observed in the open ring structure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> This alteration may be important for attaining the active conformation of Rho and the change in the loop conformation due to the mutations will affect its function. On the other hand Y274, which is located just outside this loop, may come on the pathway of the RNA passing through the dimeric interface of two Rho protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(d)</xref>). So Y274D may have similar defects as G324D and N340S changes.</p><p id="P18">In order to test these predictions of the additional defects of these mutants in different properties of Rho, we assayed their efficiencies for primary and secondary RNA binding as well as for their ATP binding and hydrolysis activities.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Primary RNA-binding properties of the Rho mutants</title><p id="P19">There are two distinct types of polynucleotide interaction sites in Rho.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> The primary RNA-binding site, located in the N-terminal region, recognizes both single-stranded DNA and RNA, whereas the secondary binding site located at the central hole of the oligomer, binds specifically to the RNA.

This mutant showed significantly reduced cross-linking efficiency even at 20 &#x003bc;M of rC<sub>10</sub> and did not show any gel-shift compared to WT Rho (data not shown).

It was observed that the G51V-oligo(dC)<sub>34</sub> complex was significantly resistant to both the competitors compared to either WT or P279S complexes. This unusually stable interaction at the primary RNA binding site, which was not predicted from the crystal structure, could affect the proper release of RNA from the primary RNA binding site of G51V during the translocation process. It should be noted that the position of G51 is about 14 &#x000c5; away from the nearest RNA residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(e)</xref>).

The distortion of the loop conformation due to this mutation might have an allosteric effect in the nearby primary RNA binding domain.

Under the same conditions, a modest improvement in the RNA release efficiency was observed for G51V and Y80C mutants, but it never reached to the level of WT Rho. For Y274D, G324D and N340S, the efficiency of RNA release improved significantly when 1 mM ATP was present and NusG was absent.

These mutants may also have defects in the RNA release step, which most likely requires a direct interaction with the EC.

All the termination defective mutants (except I382N) were found to be located in the previously identified functional domains, such as in the primary RNA binding domain and in the secondary RNA binding domain including Q-loop and R-loops. The termination defect of the mutants G51V, Y80C and P279S could not be overcome under the most relaxed conditions that have been tested, suggesting that the primary RNA binding domain and Q-loop are the most crucial elements for RNA release activity. These mutants are also defective for most of the other functions of Rho. The termination defects of the mutants (Y274D, G324D and N340S), which are mainly defective for secondary RNA binding and most likely for the translocase activity, could be restored under relaxed <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. The functional defects of most of the mutants correlate with their spatial localization in the crystal structure. We also show that mutations in the primary RNA binding domain (Y80C) can affect functions and induce conformational changes in the distal C-terminal domain, which is not predictable from the structure of Rho. We did not observe any severe <italic>in vitro</italic> defect in I382N, which is not consistent with its <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype.

As the defect in ATP binding and other conformational changes occurred in the absence of RNA binding we propose that this mutation by itself has induced a major allosteric effect in the C-terminal domain, which is located far away from primary RNA binding domain. On the other hand, mutation at G51, located in the same primary RNA binding domain, renders very stable binding with the nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This leads to severe defects in the RNA release and secondary RNA binding. This suggests that it is important that Rho leaves the <italic>rut</italic> site once it starts tracking the nascent RNA. Based on the properties of these two point mutations in the primary RNA binding domain we propose that this domain of Rho not only works as an &#x0201c;eye&#x0201d; to find the <italic>rut</italic> site but also exerts allosteric control over the downstream interactions upon binding to RNA. Therefore, mutations in this domain block the subsequent steps in the process of RNA release. We have recently found that Psu, an inhibitor of Rho, which inhibits Rho-dependent termination by slowing down the rate of ATP hydrolysis, does not interact with the Y80C mutant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> This lack of interaction between the Psu and Y80C mutant might also arise due to conformational changes in the ATP binding/hydrolysis domain.</p><p id="P37">What is the role of Q-loop? The Q-loop is a structural element, which is located at the entry point of secondary RNA binding domain and protrudes into the central hole of the Rho hexamer. A comparison of the open and closed ring structures of Rho reveals that this loop undergoes major conformational changes upon ring closure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> and was found to be protected in the Rho-poly(C) complex from the hydroxyl radical cleavage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> P279S and earlier reported mutants in this loop<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> are defective in secondary RNA binding and in subsequent activities like ATP hydrolysis and translocation. Based on these results and the spatial location of this loop in the Rho hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4(c)</xref>), we propose that this structural element works as a rudder that guides the RNA into the dimeric interface of the secondary RNA binding domain. This proposal is consistent with the &#x0201c;RNA handoff model&#x0201d;, where the Q-loop is proposed to be involved in transferring RNA between the subunits during translocation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p><p id="P38">It is known from the previous works that ATPase or NTPase activity of Rho is required for transcription termination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref> and is believed that the free energy generated from the hydrolysis is required for the translocation of Rho along the RNA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref> Using a roadblocked EC we have uncoupled the transcription elongation from the Rho-dependent RNA release from the EC, which enabled us for the first time to observe a direct correlation between ATP hydrolysis and RNA release by Rho from a stalled EC.

These results suggest that a higher rate of ATP hydrolysis improved their processivity and overall rate of translocation and the free energy from the ATP hydrolysis is used to bring them in the vicinity of the EC. It is likely that the ATP hydrolysis helps Rho to remain bound to the nascent RNA during the &#x0201c;chase&#x0201d;, because intrinsically the interactions in the secondary RNA binding domain are weak.</p><p id="P39">On the other hand, RNA release kinetics experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) suggest that NusG is involved only in the RNA release step(s) once Rho reaches the vicinity of the EC, which is consistent with role of NusG that was proposed earlier.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> WT Rho on its own is capable of releasing RNA, but the speed of RNA release is increased in the presence of NusG. Early termination that is usually observed in the presence of NusG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(a)</xref>) is the consequence of this enhanced rate of RNA release. So the requirement of NusG becomes mandatory under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions where the RNA release has to be performed within a small time window. The RNA release step, in addition to their translocation defect, must be severely compromised in case of the mutants Y274D, G324D and N340S and therefore they are highly dependent on NusG. The final RNA release step may involve a direct interaction of Rho with the EC, so it is possible that the region of Rho defined by these amino acids is involved in the interaction with the EC.</p><p id="P40">Based on the properties of different termination defective mutants of Rho and in the light of open and closed ring hexameric structures complexed with nucleic acids in primary and secondary RNA binding domains we sum-up the sequential steps that lead to the RNA release from the EC.

(2) RNA gets channeled into the secondary RNA binding domain <italic>via</italic> the Q-loop and the closed ring structure is formed. (3) This activates ATP hydrolysis and onsets the translocation of Rho along the mRNA, which brings Rho in the vicinity of the EC. (4) Rho then releases RNA possibly by pushing the EC or by pulling the RNA out of the EC by its translocase activity. It is also possible that Rho specifically interacts in the RNA exit channel and exerts allosteric effects on the stability of the EC. As NusG is only involved in increasing the rate of RNA release at this step, it is possible that NusG in the presence of Rho makes the EC more prone to termination.</p><p id="P41">How important is Rho-dependent termination <italic>in vivo</italic>?
