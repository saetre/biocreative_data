Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) were retrofitted with enhancer traps, and expressed as transgenes in zebrafish. Expression from both transient assays and stable lines were used for analysis. Although the enhancer was active in specific nonneural cells of the notochord when placed with APPb gene promoter proximal elements its function was restricted to, and absolutely required for, specific expression in neurons when juxtaposed with additional far-upstream promoter elements of the gene. We demonstrate that expression of green fluorescent protein fluorescence resembling the tissue distribution of APPb mRNA requires both the intron 1 enhancer and &#x0223c;28 kb of DNA upstream of the gene. The results indicate that tissue-specificity of an isolated enhancer may be quite different from that in the context of its own gene. Using this enhancer and upstream sequence, polymorphic variants of APPb can now more closely recapitulate the endogenous pattern and regulation of APPb expression in animal models for Alzheimer's disease. The methodology should help functionally map multiple noncontiguous regulatory elements in BACs with or without gene-coding sequences.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>About two-thirds of the highly conserved genome sequence between human and other vertebrates as divergent as the fish does not code for proteins, is distributed throughout the genome, and mostly located at large distances along the DNA from the start sites of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7">1&#x02013;7</xref>). Part of these conserved noncoding <bold>e</bold>lements (CNEs) plays a role in regulating gene expression, and is believed to be essential to all vertebrate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). Conservation of gene regulatory function has also been demonstrated recently in the absence of sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), suggesting that structural features of DNA can be preserved despite their different sequence. Despite these findings, tools for functionally analyzing CNEs continue to use a &#x02018;targeted approach&#x02019;, where PCR amplified CNE&#x02013;DNA is joined to a reporter gene and analyzed for expression either in mice or zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Thus amplified CNE&#x02013;DNA, was either coinjected with linear reporter DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) or introduced as reporter vector plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) into zebrafish eggs, and analyzed for transient expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence. A second approach used the Tol2 transposon system that allowed CNE-reporter gene fusions to be integrated into the germline more efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). While such studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of CNE function, and can be scaled up, they encounter hurdles when multiple regulatory domains from noncontiguous DNA act in concert to regulate expression of the gene. Difficulties also arise when the noncoding regulatory DNA is not conserved across species and thus not recognizable prior to testing. A third approach used the traditional enhancer trap with a pseudo-typed murine leukemia virus to infect dechorionated zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) to identify regulatory sequences in a nontargeted fashion, but more importantly, in the context of the gene and chromosome. However, subtractive analysis requiring deletion of sequences thought to act in combinatorial fashion with other noncontiguous enhancing elements, remains a hurdle with this approach. The task of functionally identifying regulatory DNA of either the conserved or nonconserved variety therefore presents a real challenge, and is likely to benefit most from using a &#x02018;nontargeted&#x02019; approach that is also unbiased. Because such regulation is often observed over large distances along the DNA, using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and P1-derived artificial chromosomes (PACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>) might prove most beneficial, as issues of context of those regulatory modules to the gene can be addressed simultaneously.</p><p>A novel approach that addresses several of these issues has been developed. An enhancer trap comprising of a basal promoter driven reporter gene, such as GFP, is positioned at short intervals along the genomic DNA in the BAC clone with the help of a Tn10 transposon. The set of enhancer trap modified BACs is then introduced into zebrafish eggs, and the patterns of GFP expression used to map <italic>cis</italic>-acting gene regulatory elements functionally in the BAC DNA.</p><p>We have explored the role of conserved as well as nonconserved DNA in regulating expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, that is central to Alzheimer's disease (AD), because the understanding of its regulation remains incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21">15&#x02013;21</xref>). An enhancer with novel properties within intron 1 of the gene has been identified in this report using the new approach. We demonstrate that it is required, along with &#x0223c;28 kb of DNA upstream of the gene, for expression of GFP fluorescence resembling the tissue distribution of APPb mRNA in neuronal cells reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This newly identified enhancer has unique characteristics of tissue specificity: when operating with its full complement of far upstream regulatory elements, the expression is exclusively in neurons, but its enhancing function is restricted to the notochord when acting through its basal promoter elements. These observations have implication for APP gene expression and, more generally, for context-dependent function of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Four BAC clones from the zebrafish genomic library, CH211-235E22, CH211-219P8, CH211-192O20, CH211-43O16 designated here as BACs A, B, C and D, respectively, were purchased from BAC/PAC resources, Oakland, CA, USA. DNA fragments from the zebrafish genome are in the pTARBAC2.1 vector in these clones.

However, to date expression of APP gene using its endogenous promoter elements is unavailable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). It led us to conclude that key regulatory sequences remained unidentified, and BACs containing the gene were used so as not to preclude regulation from distal promoter elements.</p><p>A loxP transposon procedure to make progressive end deletions in BACs has been used to map genetic markers and gene regulatory elements both on a physical map of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), as well as functionally using cell lines or transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). An important feature of this technology is its ease of determining exactly where in the BAC the loxP-transposon had inserted to create the truncation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). An additional feature is the ability to introduce reporter genes and other DNA cassettes precisely at the new end created in the large BAC clone: sequence in front of the loxP arrowhead as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A is retained after the recombination event that creates the deletion (note orientation of arrow refers to directionality of loxP sequence). It is this particular feature that we have now utilized to place a basal promoter containing GFP gene in the BAC, such that potential regulatory elements further upstream (shown as RE-1, -2 and -3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) can drive reporter gene expression when the retrofitted BAC DNA is introduced into zebrafish as a transgene. DNA sequences +0.147 to &#x02212;0.75 kb or +0.147 to &#x02212;0.35 kb surrounding the transcription initiation site of APPb comprised the basal promoter in the enhancer trap transposons used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the methodology.

Transient expression from an episomal plasmid is suitable because the gene/enhancer(s) in stably integrated DNA in cell lines are often influenced by chromosomal regions adjoining it. This leads to variable expression in different lines. Thus although few of such episomal expression studies yield insights into transcriptional mechanisms that involve chromatin remodeling/modification, they appear capable of identifying enhancer elements rapidly. Transcription enhancement by CNEs has also used transient expression in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>), or mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and similar assays are used here to identify enhancers in APPb. Stable transgenic zebrafish lines derived from our enhancer trap BACs also show variable expression in neurons (see below). Thus, enhancer assays used here have relied more on transient expression, although the major conclusions derived from these are supported by the data from germline transgenic fish.</p><sec><title>Characterization of zebrafish APPb BACs</title><p>The BAC clones (160&#x02013;200 kb size) used here were characterized by sequencing the ends of progressive deletions of insert DNA using transposon-based primers Seq 1 or Seq 4 as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).

Two independent lines of germline fish were isolated from each of the two BACs &#x00394;94C and &#x00394;84C. The F1s from different founders with the same BAC DNA vary somewhat in their expression patterns, although neural fluorescence is seen in all of them. Expression from two lines of &#x00394;94C and &#x00394;84C is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, respectively. The yolk sac has much higher levels of GFP fluorescence between the 48 and 72 hpf window of observation in all stable lines tested. Difficulty in imaging the neural fluorescence against this yolk sac background is probably exacerbated by the low copy numbers of BACs known to integrate into the germline compared to small plasmids. The problem is more severe in the head region apparently due to its proximity, and dissipates towards the tail. At still later times, pigmentation increases and interferes with imaging. The network pattern of GFP fluorescence seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A&#x02013;C for &#x00394;84C, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C for &#x00394;94C, appears to originate from glial cells and oligodendrocytes thought to ensheathe axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). These, along with the fluorescence in neurons of the lateral line, are components of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Fluorescence from neurons of the lateral line, is clearly visible below the stellate cells (marked by the successive pink arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8</xref>A&#x02013;C and 9A&#x02013;C), and appear similar to those observed in transient expression patterns of those BACs seen earlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A. Such expression patterns are not observed in embryos that do not carry the BAC DNA in their germline as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D. This control embryo shown was obtained from parents that were positive for transient expression of GFP characteristic of the &#x00394;94C expression pattern; but which failed to transmit the BAC DNA through the germline. Overall, the fraction of fish with transient expression that transmitted to the next generation was slightly below 1%. A large fraction of the transients died during the 2-week period following injection. No &#x0003e;7% of the transiently expressing embryos surviving till adulthood were found to transmit the DNA through the germline, i.e. their eggs were GFP positive. Additionally, over 90% of embryos from such germline founders were found to express GFP fluorescence. Thus, expression in neurons, from possibly both the central nervous system (CNS) and PNS, from both stable transgenic lines with BACs &#x00394;94C and &#x00394;84C substantiate some of our earlier findings with transient expression. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Expression in F1 animals derived from germline transgenic parents that were injected with DNA from BAC &#x00394;94C are shown.

Although the zebrafish APPb gene promoter remains uncharacterized, regulation of the gene from several other vertebrates had been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21">15&#x02013;21</xref>). As much as 8000 bp upstream of the transcription start site has been shown to contain regulatory activity in conventional CAT assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) has also been implicated to contain regulatory elements responsive to iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), interleukin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) and TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). In order to preserve such regulation in germline transgenic fish derived from these enhancer trap-modified BACs, the UE in our enhancer trap transposons include the 147 bp of this UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>Comparison of data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7 F8 F9">7&#x02013;9</xref>, demonstrate that the intron 1 enhancer identified here directs specific expression of a GFP-reporter gene in two completely different tissues depending on whether APPb promoter proximal or far upstream promoter elements of the gene are adjacent to it. We conclude that the enhancer can function specifically in nonneural tissue such as the notochord when used with promoter proximal elements within the +0.147 to &#x02212;0.35 kb of sequence surrounding the transcription start site of APPb. However, this promiscuity disappears and its function becomes exquisitely specific to enhancing expression in neurons when juxtaposed with additional promoter elements located farther upstream till about &#x02212;28 kb of APPb. The data also suggest that some type of transcription repression activity resides around &#x02212;28 kb that suppresses expression in the notochord, because simultaneous expression in the notochord and neural cells is not observed in the same fish using BAC deletions &#x00394;74D through &#x00394;75C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Once this upstream DNA extending till &#x02212;28 kb is deleted, as in BACs &#x00394;72C, &#x00394;52C, &#x00394;38C and &#x00394;29C, reappearance of the notochord expression pattern is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). Nevertheless, BACs &#x00394;72C, &#x00394;52C, &#x00394;38C and &#x00394;29C, serve as important controls to show that the exclusive neural pattern observed with BACs &#x00394;74D through &#x00394;75C is not merely a consequence of the enhancer trap being in the BAC environment as opposed to the small Tn-plasmid, but that far-upstream promoter elements located within the &#x0223c;28 kb DNA upstream of the start site are required for neuron-specific expression. The strikingly different, yet specific, expression patterns elicited by this enhancer when working in or out of context of its own gene is unique to the best of our knowledge.</p><p>Tissue-specific expression of the APPb gene resembling its endogenous pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) requires two separate, somewhat distant regulatory domains to cooperate in <italic>cis</italic> to confer tissue-specificity. The two domains of regulation are the &#x0223c;1 kb of DNA within intron 1 (ZFISH7:9:29144733-29145740), and the region +0.147 to &#x02212;28 kb upstream of the gene. As indicated above in this report, exclusion of the &#x0223c;1 kb IE produced no expression of GFP: APPb BAC-C deleted from the wild-type loxP end of insert DNA with Tn-US (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>B, C and 2) failed to express GFP in any tissue (data not shown). Absence of the +0.147 to &#x02212;28 kb region on the other hand leads to expression in the inappropriate tissue, as seen with both the set of Tn-plasmids Tn-10, Tn-13, Tn-3 and Tn-82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), and BACs &#x00394;72C, &#x00394;52C, &#x00394;38C and &#x00394;29C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C).</p><p>A search for transcription factor binding sites in the &#x0223c;1 kb intron enhancer sequence using bioinformatic tools reveals a high likelihood for GATA 3 and SOX 5 recognition sites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn628/DC1">Supplementary Figure</ext-link> 2). Although definitive identification of actual binding by these transcription factor complexes to this enhancer region awaits further studies, it is rather intriguing to note that GATA 3 and associated factors have been implicated in pathways guiding the aging process in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), and involved also in allergic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). SOX 5 has been implicated, along with SOX 9, in the differentiation and establishment of several cell lineages including chondrocytes and glial cells of the nervous system in the spinal chord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Binding sites for SOX 9 and other SRY-related protein factors are also evident within the 1 kb intron enhancer sequence as indicated in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn628/DC1">Supplementary Figure</ext-link> 2.</p><p>Results from both transient expressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), and stable lines with BACs &#x00394;84C and &#x00394;94C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), suggests that upstream regulation of the APPb gene is likely to extend much farther than the 8 kb limit identified for the primate APP earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Ends of BACs &#x00394;94C and &#x00394;84C map to 13.6 and 24.1 kb upstream of the APPb transcription start site, respectively, and neural expression from these clones in stable lines therefore suggest that APPb-specific regulatory sequences exist at locations beyond &#x02212;24 kb that, in conjunction with the 0.35 kb UE and 1.2 kb IE, can assemble productive transcription initiation complexes specifically in neurons to express GFP. The earlier determination that 8 kb is the limit of regulation by upstream sequences in primate APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) appears unlikely; as we note that the zebrafish genome is compressed &#x0223c;4-fold with respect to that of rhesus monkey.</p><p>The simpler pattern of expression with BAC deletions &#x00394;80C through &#x00394;75C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) might indicate that residual promoter elements required for neural cell-specific expression are available till about 28 kb upstream, and these might prove sufficient to produce partial expression patterns by recruitment of factors through protein&#x02013;protein interactions similar to those described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Importantly, there is no expression in the notochord from these BACs.</p><p>The upstream regulatory regions identified here probably pertain to APPb only, and are unadulterated by those from adjoining genes: the 200 kb upstream of APPb has only two other genes, one ASMT-like EST annotated some 60 kb away and another, NCAM2, located &#x0223c;160 kb from APPb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Sequences downstream of APPb intron 1 are deleted in all BACs during retrofitting with enhancer traps.</p></sec><sec><title>Highlights of the methodology</title><p>The methodology described here uses BACs, and therefore has all of the advantages associated with their use compared to small plasmid constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53 B54 B55 B56 B57 B58 B59 B60">53&#x02013;60</xref>). Unlike the other BAC recombineering approaches; however, our strategy is &#x02018;nontargeted&#x02019;, and produces a large set of DNA constructs rapidly to test for function of potential regulatory elements without having to select sequences for modifications. It is also not affected by repetition of sequences elsewhere in the chromosome. Subtractive analysis from one or both ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), to decipher the role of individual regulatory elements in a cluster, is also likely to be easier using the enhancer trap BAC approach described here.</p><p>In situations where function is conserved without sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), choosing the correct sequence to test might be a hit-or-miss phenomenon with a targeted approach. Our methodology should prove most helpful here since it acts more like a &#x02018;mine-sweeper&#x02019; moving along the BAC DNA; capable of identifying all regulatory sequences upstream of a gene in an unbiased manner. Functional comparisons between individual enhancer trap BACs are thus more meaningful as the modifications in each remain constant. While the Tol2 system can score functional CNEs using zebrafish rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>); subtractive analysis for exploring mechanisms of combinatorial interplay of multiple elements regulating a gene, similar to that described here, would be tedious. The BAC enhancer trap technology has three additional features that might also prove beneficial: (i) allows sampling much larger DNA, and consequently multiple discontinuous regulatory domains simultaneously, (ii) the context of regulatory DNA with respect to the gene and chromosome is preserved and (iii) can be used with BACs in established libraries from a wide variety of organisms, and tested in several species. Although the methodology does not allow generation of internal deletions, truncations from the end opposite to the enhancer trap can be made with a lox511 transposon to explore functions of candidate regulatory regions in a limited way. Sequences bending DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61 B62 B63">61&#x02013;63</xref>), or phasing nucleosomes and other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64 B65 B66">64&#x02013;66</xref>) are left unaltered using BACs compared to characteristics of the gene region found endogenously. Bringing exogenous pieces of DNA together to create artificial joints in small plasmids to <italic>trans</italic>-activate reporter genes do not adequately address the endogenous role of the regulatory sequence, and this is avoided using BACs. DNA structure surrounding regulatory factor binding sites have evolved over long periods, and these are also left unaltered here. We note there are 52 sites with six or more A-residues, known to cause bends in unpackaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>), in the 28-kb upstream regulatory sequence identified here in APPb.</p><p>Trapping gene regulatory elements by random insertion of a transposon containing reporter gene with minimal promoter into the genomes of Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>), and other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69 B70 B71 B72 B73">69&#x02013;73</xref>) has been very successful. These approaches insert the enhancer trap, i.e. p-element, retroviral vector or transposable element, directly into the genome of the organism, with mapping of the sites of integration done subsequently. BACs in contrast have already been mapped on the chromosome.</p><p>The BAC enhancer trap methodology is amenable to manipulation along several lines: GFP reporter in the transposon can be replaced by clinically relevant mutant cDNAs of the gene, such as the Swedish mutant form of human APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), to create animal models for screening small molecules to generate drug leads.
