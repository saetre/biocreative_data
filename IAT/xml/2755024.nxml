The &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit accumulated in rice seeds at a higher level than the &#x003b2; subunit, but no detectable difference in mRNA transcription level between subunits was observed. Sequential extraction results indicate that the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit formed one or more disulphide bonds with glutelin. Electron microscopic analysis showed that the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit and the &#x003b2; subunit were transported to PB-II together with glutelin. In mature transgenic seeds, the &#x003b2; subunit accumulated in low electron density regions in the periphery of PB-II, whereas the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit accumulated together with glutelin in high-density regions of the periphery. The subcellular localization of mutated &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunits lacking one cysteine residue in the N-terminal mature region (&#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys1) or five cysteine residues in the pro and N-terminal mature regions (&#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys5) were also examined. Low-density regions were formed in PB-II in mature seeds of transgenic rice expressing &#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys 5 and &#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys1. &#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys5 was localized only in the low-density regions, whereas &#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys1 was found in both low- and high-density regions. These results suggest that the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit could make a complex via one or more disulphide bonds with glutelin and accumulate together in PB-II of transgenic rice seeds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Disulphide bond</kwd><kwd>glutelin</kwd><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>soybean</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice storage proteins are composed of glutelin (acid/alkaline-soluble), prolamin (alcohol-soluble), globulin (saline-soluble), and albumin (water-soluble). Glutelins, account for about 80% of the total proteins in rice seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ogawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li and Okita, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cagampang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1976</xref>). They are synthesized as a precursor which is further processed proteolytically into acidic and basic chains connected with a disulphide bridge like 11S globulin. Rice proteins are rich in sulphur-containing amino acids, but are deficient in lysine. By contrast, &#x003b2;-conglycinin (7S globulin of soybean) and glycinin (11S globulin of soybean) are rich in lysine but are poor in sulphur-containing amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Utsumi, 1992</xref>). Moreover, their physiological benefits to humans have been established. &#x003b2;-conglycinin lowers plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sirtori <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit of &#x003b2;-conglycinin has been reported to have LDL-cholesterol-lowering activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sirtori and Lovati, 2001</xref>) and phagocytosis-stimulating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tsuruki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Therefore, an accumulation of &#x003b2;-conglycinin in rice seeds could lead to the development of a product with high nutritional value, several important physiological activities, and useful physicochemical properties.</p><p>&#x003b2;-Conglycinin has a trimeric structure similar to other 7S globulins. The &#x003b1; and &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunits contain an N-terminal extension in addition to a core region common to all the subunits. The &#x003b2; subunit consists of only the core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maruyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). The extension regions of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunits probably protrude from the molecular surface of the core domains and have a minor role in proper folding and assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maruyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The &#x003b1;/&#x003b1;&#x02032; subunits and the &#x003b2; subunit are synthesized on polysomes as prepro- and pre-forms, respectively. The signal peptides are co-translationally removed, the polypeptides are N-glycosylated with high-mannose glycans and assemble into trimers in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamauchi and Yamagishi, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Utsumi, 1992</xref>). The resultant &#x003b1;/&#x003b1;&#x02032; subunits and the &#x003b2; subunit are in the pro-form and the mature form, respectively. Each trimer is transported from the ER to the protein storage vacuoles through the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mori <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The pro-regions of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunits are proteolytically processed to give their mature forms. Both the &#x003b1; and &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunits contain four cysteine residues (Cys) in their pro-regions and one Cys in the mature extension region (Cys13).</p><p>In rice seeds, there are two types of protein bodies, PB-I and PB-II. PB-I, derived directly from the ER, contains mainly prolamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yamagata and Tanaka, 1986</xref>). Binding protein (BiP) facilitates the folding and assembly of prolamin polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18"><italic>b</italic></xref>). PB-II, derived from the vacuoles, have non-spherical structures and primarily contain glutelin and globulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980</xref>). Both proteins are synthesized on the rER, assembled in the ER, transported to the Golgi apparatus, and sorted to the vacuole. Both glutelin and globulin are transported from the Golgi apparatus to storage vacuoles by the so-called dense vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Krishnan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986, 1992</xref>). However, glutelin and globulin accumulate in different regions of PB-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krishinan and White, 1995</xref>). Globulin accumulates in the periphery region of PB-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krishnan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krishinan and White, 1995</xref>).</p><p>To develop rice having a high nutritional value and physiological function, the &#x003b1;&#x02032; and &#x003b2; subunits of soybean &#x003b2;-conglycinin were introduced and expressed in rice seeds. Further, the traffic and accumulation behaviour of the &#x003b1;&#x02032; and &#x003b2; subunits in rice seeds were analysed. Our results indicate that the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit accumulates at a higher level than the &#x003b2; subunit and that the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit forms a complex with glutelin via one or more disulphide bonds in transgenic rice seeds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Construction of binary vectors and transformation</title><p>cDNAs encoding the &#x003b1;&#x02032; and &#x003b2; subunits were modified to remove a <italic>SacI</italic> cleavage site in the coding sequence while retaining the actual amino acid sequence, and to introduce the <italic>Sac</italic>I site downstream of the stop codon by PCR using the following pairs of oligonucleotide primers: 5&#x02032;-GATATGAACGAGGGGGCTCTTTTTCTGCCA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CACAACACTGAGGAAGACATCCAAGTCC-3&#x02032; for &#x003b1;&#x02032;; 5&#x02032;-GGATATCAACGAAGGCGCTCTTCTTCTACC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-ACAGAACTGAGGAAGATATCCAAGTCCCG-3&#x02032; for &#x003b2;; 5&#x02032;-ATGATGAGAGCGCGGTTCCCATTAC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CATCATGC<underline>GAGCTC</underline>TCAGTAAAAAGCCCTC-3&#x02032; for &#x003b1;&#x02032;; 5&#x02032;-ATGATGAGAGTGCGGTTTCCTTTG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CATCATGC<underline>GAGCTC</underline>TCAGTAGAGAGCACCTAAG-3&#x02032; for &#x003b2; (underlines indicate the <italic>Sac</italic>I cleavage site).

To verify this possibility, the quantities of both mRNAs were compared by real-time PCR. The top lines having a single copy were self-pollinated to obtain homozygous lines. The accumulation levels of the &#x003b1;&#x02032; and &#x003b2; subunits in homozygous lines were 7.9&#x000b1;0.7% and 4.4&#x000b1;0.8% in total proteins, respectively (data not shown). In the homozygous line seeds, the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit accumulated about twice as much as the &#x003b2; subunit, similarly with the T<sub>1</sub> seeds. The total RNAs from 15 d after-flowering (15 DAF) seeds of &#x003b1;&#x02032;6-2 and &#x003b2;5-4 homozygous lines were subjected to real-time PCR.

To correct the experimental error between the &#x003b1;&#x02032; and &#x003b2; subunits, the rice actin gene RAc1 was used as the internal standard. The Ct values of RAc1 in transgenic rice seeds expressing the &#x003b1;&#x02032; and &#x003b2; subunits were 28.5 and 28.1, respectively. To compare their transcription levels, the Ct values were normalized. The results indicate that the transcription level of &#x003b1;&#x02032;6-2 was close to that of &#x003b2;5-4, although the accumulation level of &#x003b1;&#x02032;6-2 was about twice as much as that of &#x003b2;5-4.

Further, both &#x003b1;&#x02032; and &#x003b2; subunits were shown to undergo post-translational modification in rice seeds similar to those in soybean seeds (N-glycosylation by high-mannose glycans and detachment of N-terminal pro-region from the &#x003b1;&#x02032; precursor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). The accumulation level of the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit in mature rice seeds was about two-times higher than that of the &#x003b2; subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).

A sequential extraction experiment showed that the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit could form a disulphide bond with glutelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Further, the behaviour of two kinds of modified &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit (&#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys5 devoid of all Cys by means of removal of its pro-region and substitution of Cys13 with serine, and &#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys1 containing an intact pro-region and substituted Cys13) were examined in transgenic rice seeds to elucidate the role of Cys residues in the accumulation of the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit. Both &#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys5 and &#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys1, similar to the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit, formed trimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).

These results suggest that the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit makes a complex with glutelin via one or more disulphide bonds in rice seeds. Previous reports suggest that there could be a &#x02018;dominant&#x02019; effect of the storage proteins in directing foreign proteins to the vacuole in seed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arcalis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Drakakaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

This suggests that the traffic ability of early developing rice seed is sufficient to transport storage proteins from the ER to the vacuoles through the Golgi apparatus. However, PAC-like vesicles were observed in the early developing stage (10 DAF) of transgenic rice seeds expressing the &#x003b2; subunit, although the accumulation level of the &#x003b2; subunit was lower than that of the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit. This suggests that introduction of the &#x003b2; gene in the rice induced the PAC-like vesicle formation in the early developing stage.</p><p>There have been reports on the direct pathway from the ER to the vacuole, introduced by transgenes. Introduction of a gene of sulphhydryl-endopeptidase (SH-EP) which has a KDEL-tail, papain-type vacuolar proteinase of germinated <italic>Vigna mungo</italic> seeds in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> resulted in the formation of KDEL-vesicle, transported to the vacuoles by a Golgi-independent. Such vesicles were not observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds expressing SH-EP mutant lacking the KDEL-tail and non-transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Okamoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). When a gene for KDEL-tagged &#x003b2;-phaseolin, 7S storage protein of French bean (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>), was introduced into tobacco leaf protoplasts, KDEL-tagged &#x003b2;-phaseolin was transported to the vacuole but the complex glycan was not formed, although normal &#x003b2;-phaseolin had the complex glycan. These suggest that the KDEL-tagged &#x003b2;-phaseolin was transported to the vacuoles directly from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frigerio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). When human serum albumin containing N-terminal signal sequence and C-terminal KDEL tag was introduced into wheat and expressed in seeds, it was also transported to the vacuoles through the Golgi-independent route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arcalis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). It is likely that the overexpression of transgenes contained the KDEL-tail coding sequence in the ER caused ER stress, and that the ER stress induced the expression of some kind of molecular chaperons or transmembrane proteins resulting in a Golgi-independent pathway. The &#x003b2; subunit does not contain the KDEL sequence, but a direct transport pathway from the ER to the vacuoles was induced. In soybean seeds, ER-derived protein bodies (PBs) were observed at high frequency in the mutant line containing glycinin composed of only group I subunits the solubility of which was lower than that of the normal glycinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mori <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Consequently, there is a possibility that the induction of PAC-like vesicle in rice seeds also depends on physicochemical properties, such as solubility and surface hydrophobicity, of the &#x003b2; subunit. The pH in the ER is estimated to be approximately 7.1 in resting HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). The &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit is soluble at &#x003bc;=0.08 and pH 7.1, whereas the &#x003b2; subunit is insoluble under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maruyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2002</xref>). These findings suggest that the &#x003b2; subunit is insoluble in the ER lumen environment of rice seed and partly aggregates. By contrast, the &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunit, &#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys1 and &#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x00394;Cys5, containing the hydrophilic domain (extension domain), are soluble in the ER lumen environment, so all of them could be transported to the vacuoles via the Golgi apparatus. Recently, it was shown that the aggregated type of red fluorescent protein forms ER-derived compartments in soybean and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maruyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Application of the aggregated-type of red fluorescent protein could further elucidate a formation of ER-derived compartments in rice seeds.</p></sec><sec><title>Development of highly-physiologically functional rice to improve human health</title><p>&#x003b2;-Conglycinin has many physiological functions.
