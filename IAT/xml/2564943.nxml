Investigating the evolution of aquaporins (AQPs) in these vertebrates should help to elucidate how mechanisms for water homeostasis evolved. The marine teleost gilthead sea bream (<italic>Sparus aurata</italic>) has a mammalian aquaporin-1 (AQP1)-related channel, termed AQP1o, with a specialized physiological role in mediating egg hydration. However, teleosts have an additional AQP isoform structurally more similar to AQP1, though its relationship with AQP1o is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>By using phylogenetic and genomic analyses we show here that teleosts, unlike tetrapods, have two closely linked AQP1 paralogous genes, termed <italic>aqp1a </italic>and <italic>aqp1b </italic>(formerly AQP1o). In marine teleosts that produce hydrated eggs, <italic>aqp1b </italic>is highly expressed in the ovary, whereas in freshwater species that produce non-hydrated eggs, <italic>aqp1b </italic>has a completely different expression pattern or is not found in the genome. Both Aqp1a and Aqp1b are functional water-selective channels when expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes. However, expression of chimeric and mutated proteins in oocytes revealed that the sea bream Aqp1b C-terminus, unlike that of Aqp1a, contains specific residues involved in the control of Aqp1b intracellular trafficking through phosphorylation-independent and -dependent mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose that 1) Aqp1a and Aqp1b are encoded by distinct genes that probably originated specifically in the teleost lineage by duplication of a common ancestor soon after divergence from tetrapods, 2) Aqp1b possibly represents a neofunctionalized AQP adapted to oocytes of marine and catadromous teleosts, thereby contributing to a water reservoir in eggs and early embryos that increases their survival in the ocean, and 3) Aqp1b independently acquired regulatory domains in the cytoplasmatic C-terminal tail for the specific control of Aqp1b expression in the plasma membrane.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Membrane intrinsic proteins (MIP) such as aquaporins (AQP) are molecular channels present from bacteria to humans that transport water and small molecular weight solutes across biological membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These membrane proteins are classified into two groups: those that are water-selective, and those that also transport small neutral molecules, such as glycerol and urea, termed aqua(glycero)porins. All known AQPs have six transmembrane domains connected by five loops (A-E), in which both the N- and C-termini are cytoplasmic. Their primary structure can be divided into two similar halves each of which bear the highly conserved Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motif in loops B and E that are involved in the formation of the water pore, which is the hallmark of the MIP family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In higher vertebrates, 13 different AQPs have been described, which differ in tissue expression, regulation and selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have shown that, in mammals, AQP1 and AQP2 are essential for water resorption in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], AQP4 is involved in cerebral water balance, astrocyte migration and neural signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and AQP3 and AQP7 seem to play important roles during skin hydration and metabolism of adipocytes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, there is little information on the functional properties and physiological functions of AQPs in teleosts, vertebrates which form a highly diverse group of organisms adapted to living both in freshwater and seawater.</p><p>Marine teleosts are thought to have colonized the oceans after a long freshwater ancestry, which is supported by the fossil record and by the hypo-osmotic condition and the presence of a glomerular kidney in extant marine species (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] for review). The re-entry of teleosts into seawater, however, most likely required new molecular adaptations to maintain water homeostasis, which is especially important for gametes and early embryos that do not have osmoregulatory systems. The spawning of pelagic eggs by many marine teleosts (termed pelagophils), where water content may reach up to 95% in weight, has been proposed as a mechanism to provide a water reservoir in the embryo to compensate for the passive water efflux due to the hyper-osmotic effect of the seawater until osmoregulatory organs develop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, hydration of the egg contributes to buoyancy, thereby improving oxygen exchange and dispersal in the ocean.</p><p>Egg hydration in marine fish occurs during the later stages of oogenesis, prior to ovulation (i.e., oocyte meiotic maturation). It is driven by the osmotic gradient created by the generation of a large pool of free amino acids (FAAs) in the oocyte, produced from the hydrolysis of vitellogenin (Vtg)-derived yolk proteins, and the accumulation of inorganic ions (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] for review]. In the pelagophil teleost gilthead sea bream (<italic>Sparus aurata</italic>), we recently showed that water influx into the oocyte is facilitated by a novel water-selective AQP, predominantly expressed in the ovary, which, being structurally and functionally similar to mammalian AQP1, was named the <italic>S. aurata </italic>aquaporin-1 of the ovary (SaAQP1o) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This finding illustrates how marine teleosts have evolved novel molecular mechanisms to face life in the ocean. However, sea bream also expresses another water-selective, AQP1-related channel, termed SaAQP1, which is more similar to mammalian AQP1 and is ubiquitiously distributed in tissues, including osmoregulatory organs such as the kidney, gills and intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Water channels related to SaAQP1o and SaAQP1 have also been found in other teleosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], but the phylogenetic and functional relationships between these two vertebrate AQPs remain unclear.</p><p>Now that the genome of several teleosts has been completely or partially sequenced, and there is an increasing number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and cDNAs available, the phylogeny and functional properties of teleost AQP1-like proteins can be investigated. Using phylogenetic reconstruction and genomic analysis, we show here that the AQP1o gene (<italic>aqp1b</italic>) is teleost specific and probably originated by local duplication of a vertebrate AQP1 ancestor, while tetrapods have only a single <italic>AQP1 </italic>gene structurally more similar to teleost AQP1 (<italic>aqp1a</italic>). Expression analyses and functional characterization in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes suggest that teleost Aqp1b represents a neofunctionalized water channel in the ovary and some osmoregulatory organs of marine species, which has evolved unique regulatory domains at the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail for the control of intracellular trafficking.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Duplication of AQP1 in teleosts</title><p>AQP1-related, non-redundant amino acid sequences of teleosts were obtained by searching available genome and protein databases, and by cDNA cloning. The teleost sequences were aligned with the amino acid sequence of tetrapod AQP1 and the phylogenetic analyses conducted using the neighbour-joining (NJ), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian inference (BI) methods (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; see also Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The phylogenetic tree obtained consistently separated tetrapod AQP1 from the teleost lineage (NJ: 100; ML: 100; BI: 100), which appeared to have undergone a duplication event giving rise to the Aqp1a and Aqp1b subgroups (NJ: 92; ML: 46; BI: 96). The length of the branches of Aqp1b sequences were in general longer than those of Aqp1a, specially that of the zebrafish Aqp1b, suggesting a higher rate of residue mutations than members of the parent group, and hence a rapid evolution. Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) Aqp1b, however, clustered significantly outside the Aqp1a and Aqp1b subgroups, which may be a result of the well-known long-branch attraction effect that can pull long branches towards the outgroup (in this case the tetrapods). In the amphibian <italic>Bufo marinus</italic>, two AQP1 sequences were found, termed <italic>Bufo </italic>a and <italic>Bufo </italic>b, that clustered together with the other amphibian AQP1, confirming that neither was a homolog of the teleost Aqp1b subgroup. These results confirmed the presence of two paralogous gene copies early in the Actinopterygii (Teleostei) lineage, related to human AQP1, that may have arisen after an early duplication event of an ancestral AQP1 gene. Thus, the two paralogous genes were termed <italic>aqp1a </italic>and <italic>aqp1b </italic>according to the nomenclature established for zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The cDNAs encoding sea bream SaAQP1 and SaAQP1o, and Senegalese sole (<italic>Solea senegalensis</italic>) AQP1o, previously isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], correspond to the transcripts of <italic>aqp1a </italic>and <italic>aqp1b </italic>paralogs, respectively. The European eel (<italic>Anguilla anguilla</italic>) Aqp1b cDNA that we cloned here is 100% identical to that recently isolated from the same species and named AQP1dup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic relationships of AQP1-like proteins in vertebrates</bold>.

In all these species, both chromosome loci were found to be linked, <italic>aqp1b </italic>being downstream of <italic>aqp1a</italic>. Based on this synteny, the corresponding genomic region in sea bream was obtained by PCR, employing cDNA-based oligonucleotides, and sequenced, to compare the genomic organization of <italic>aqp1a </italic>and <italic>aqp1b </italic>between extant and more primitive teleosts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

To investigate whether both AQPs were differentially expressed or translocated in the oocyte cytoplasm, a series of dose-response experiments, injecting increasing amounts of Aqp1a or Aqp1b cRNA followed by Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses, were carried out (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Immunocytochemistry on sections of these oocytes revealed that Aqp1a was present in the plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), whereas Aqp1b was also detected just below the plasma membrane, possibly in vesicles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). This staining was specific for Aqp1b since control oocytes, not injected or injected with water, were unstained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Western blots of protein extracts from total and plasma membranes of oocytes showed there was a higher proportion of Aqp1a in the plasma membrane when compared with Aqp1b (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), confirming that Aqp1b was retained in the cytoplasm. However, immunoblots of total and plasma membrane of Aqp1b-expressing oocytes revealed the presence of two reactive bands of approximately 28 and 29 kDa after incubation with the Aqp1b antisera (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, arrows). Both bands were visible in total and plasma membrane fractions, although the 29-kDa band was much weaker in the plasma membrane fraction. Alkaline phosphatase treatment of total membrane proteins before SDS-PAGE prevented the detection of the 29-kDa polypeptide, indicating that this band corresponded to a phophorylated form of Aqp1b (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Differential localization of sea bream Aqp1a and Aqp1b expressed in <italic>X. laevis </italic>oocytes</bold>.

These signals appeared to be highly conserved in fish Aqp1a (with the consensus sequence R [M/V] [K/R]VLV), whereas in Aqp1b they were more variable, although all of them included a di-Leu or Leu-Ile motif. Teleost Aqp1a and Aqp1b also had a variable number of Ser, Tyr and Thr residues with a high probability of being phosphorylated.

The Leu<sup>234</sup>Leu<sup>235 </sup>motif in this sequence was also mutated into an Ala pair. Wild-type and mutated proteins were then expressed in oocytes to determine their permeability and subcellullar localization as indicated above (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Swelling assays showed that Aqp1b-T229A and Aqp1b-L234A/L235A mutants reduced water permeability by 38.1 &#x000b1; 2.4% and 70.1 &#x000b1; 4.4%, respectively, with respect to oocytes expressing wild-type Aqp1b (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). For Aqp1b-T229A mutant, reduced permeability was apparently caused by retention of the protein in cytoplasmic vesicles, although it did not affect the phosphorylation state of Aqp1b (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8G</xref>). In contrast, as the mutant was predominantly localized surrounding the oocyte nucleus (i.e., germinal vesicle), the strong inhibition of water permeability showed by Aqp1b-L234A/L235A was possibly caused by the accumulation of the protein in intracellular compartments, which could enhance protein-lysosomal targeting and degradation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8H</xref>). The Aqp1b-T229D mutant was less expressed than wild-type Aqp1b (data not shown), causing low accumulation of the protein in the plasma membrane, thereby reducing oocyte water permeation (by 63.4 &#x000b1; 4.0% inhibition). However, water permeability was higher in oocytes expressing the Aqp1b-S254A mutant than those expressing wild-type Aqp1b (65.6 &#x000b1; 12.8% increase), associated with the absence of a phosphorylated form of the protein and increased expression in the plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8I</xref>). Conversely, Aqp1b-S254D induced the retention of the protein in cytoplasmic vesicles as with Aqp1b-T229A, thus inhibiting protein translocation into the plasma membrane and reducing water permeability (36.7 &#x000b1; 18.5% reduction) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8J</xref>). Other Ser residues present in the C-terminal region of sea bream Aqp1b, Ser<sup>238</sup>, Ser<sup>253</sup>, Ser<sup>258 </sup>and Ser<sup>262</sup>, were also substituted by Ala but these mutants had no effect on water permeability with respect to wild-type Aqp1b (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). These data suggest that dephosphorylation of Ser<sup>254 </sup>may enhance Aqp1b shuttling into the plasma membrane, and that Thr<sup>229 </sup>may also regulate this process through a phosphorylation-independent mechanism.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Role of specific residues in the sea bream Aqp1b C-terminal tail for intracellular trafficking in oocytes</bold>.

These isoforms, Aqp1a and Aqp1b, seem to coexist exclusively in teleost fish since Aqp1b was not found in mammals, amphibians or birds. The main difference between Aqp1a and Aqp1b is in the C-terminal tail, which contains specific residues for regulation of intracellular trafficking in Aqp1b.</p><p>Previous sequence analyses of MIPs suggest that substrate selective modes (AQPs and aquaglyceroporins) were acquired early in the history of the family by gene duplication and functional shift, with the highest level of diversification occurring in vertebrates and higher plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Analysis of Aqp1a and Aqp1b distribution by searching currently available genome sequence information and by cDNA cloning suggest that both isoforms are present exclusively in the teleost genome. Phylogenetic reconstruction of vertebrate AQP1-like proteins indicates that Aqp1a and Aqp1b share a common origin and are likely to have evolved from duplication of a common ancestor. Because both isoforms are present in fish species belonging to distant taxonomic groups, from basal (e.g., Anguilliformes) to more modern (e.g., Gasterosteiformes, Perciformes, Pleuronectiformes and Tetraodontiformes) groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], this duplication must be ancient and is likely to have affected most teleosts. As suggested for many duplicated genes in teleosts, the origin of Aqp1b might be the whole-genome duplication (WGD) event that occurred specifically in the ray-finned (Actinopterygian) lineage after splitting from the tetrapod lineage about 350 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, as it has not been possible to identify Aqp1b in most basal actinopterygians (e.g., paddlefish and sturgeon) with the genomic information available, it is not known whether the AQP1 duplication also affected these groups. In all teleosts examined, the <italic>aqp1a </italic>and <italic>aqp1b </italic>loci were found to be closely linked, indicating that Aqp1b possibly arose by a gene duplication event at a local level rather than at the chromosome or genome level. Local gene duplication has also been proposed, for instance, to explain the repertoire of teleost opsins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and the generation of the <italic>Xiphophorus Xmrk </italic>oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The radiation of teleosts in the ocean most likely required the evolution of new osmoregulatory mechanisms in eggs and early embryos to alleviate the passive water loss imposed by the hyper-osmotic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this scenario, it is plausible to hypothesize that duplication of <italic>aqp1 </italic>genes in teleosts allowed for one duplicate to encode a product with a new function through innovating mutations in regulatory and/or structural sequences ('neofunctionalization'). This seems to be the case for sea bream Aqp1b which plays a specialized physiological role in the oocyte mediating water uptake during meiotic maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In other marine and catadromous teleosts, such as sole and eel, respectively, that like sea bream also spawn highly hydrated eggs, we show here that <italic>aqp1b </italic>also encodes a functional water channel whose RNA is predominantly accumulated in the ovary, suggesting a similar role of Aqp1b during oocyte hydration. In other pelagophil teleosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], as well as in some species of catfish, in which oocyte hydration may also occur despite having a freshwater life cycle (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]), Aqp1b-encoding ESTs have also been found in the ovary. In contrast, in zebrafish, a freshwater species where almost no oocyte hydration is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], we found a completely different <italic>aqp1b </italic>expression pattern, together with a higher mutation rate in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Based on these data, we argue that, in marine teleosts producing highly hydrated eggs, Aqp1b possibly represents a neofunctionalized water channel adapted to oocytes to facilitate water transport. Finn and Kristoffersen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] recently proposed that neofunctionalization of duplicated Vtg genes, which allowed one paralog to be proteolyzed into FAAs driving hydration of the maturing oocytes, was a key event in the evolution and success of the teleosts in the oceanic environment. The duplication and neofunctionalization of <italic>aqp1b </italic>may have occurred in parallel to this mechanism to facilitate oocyte water uptake in marine teleosts.</p><p>The Aqp1b isoform found in freshwater teleosts that spawn non-hydrated eggs, such as zebrafish, might be inactivated by mutations, or be eventually lost in the genome. This hypothesis is supported by the absence of <italic>aqp1b </italic>in advanced freshwater species, such as medaka, while the synteny between the <italic>aqp1a </italic>chromosome loci and downstream genes (e.g., <italic>thoc1</italic>) is conserved. However, in other extant freshwater teleosts that arose later in evolution, such as <italic>Tetraodon</italic>, <italic>aqp1b </italic>is retained in the genome. The retention of <italic>aqp1b </italic>in freshwater pufferfishes is intriguing, given that there appears to have been a massive elimination of DNA after WGD in most modern teleost genomes, resulting in the retention of only a subset of the duplicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is possible to speculate, however, that the recent evolution of Tetraodontiformes did not last long enough to allow specific divergence of the genome and hence of <italic>aqp1b</italic>. The relatively high amino acid sequence identity (77%) between fugu, a marine pufferfish which produces hydrated eggs, and <italic>Tetraodon </italic>Aqp1b supports this conjecture. In any event, additional studies aiming at the characterization of Aqp1b in more freshwater fish species, as well as the determination of sites of gene expression and protein accumulation, are required to better understand the driving force behind <italic>aqp1b </italic>isoform evolution.</p><p>In addition to the ovary, <italic>aqp1b </italic>mRNA has been detected in the posterior intestine, kidney, gills and esophagus of marine fish (this work, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]). The intestine of marine teleosts has an important osmoregulatory role, as hypo-osmoregulating fish have long been known to drink seawater to replace water lost by diffusion to their environment (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] for review). Accordingly, Aqp1a and Aqp1b proteins have been reported to be localized in the intestinal epithelia of teleosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, in the sea bream gastrointestinal tract Aqp1a and Aqp1b have a different distribution pattern. Whereas Aqp1a is localized in the apical and basolateral membrane of enterocytes in duodenum and hindgut, Aqp1b is exclusively localized in the apical microvilli of rectal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, freshwater acclimation reduces the synthesis of Aqp1a in all intestinal segments, and of Aqp1b in rectum. Conversely, seawater acclimation of eels increases Aqp1a expression and protein synthesis in the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, although the specific physiological functions of Aqp1a and Aqp1b in the teleost gastrointestinal tract remain unknown, these data may point to an additional role of Aqp1b in water movement across the intestinal epithelia.</p><p>The primary structure of AQP1-like proteins corresponding to the TM2 and TM5 domains and connecting loops B and E, which are involved in the formation of the water-selective pore, is highly conserved between teleost and mammals. However, Aqp1a and Aqp1b show different permeability efficiencies when expressed in <italic>X. laevis </italic>oocytes, and teleost Aqp1b isoforms also show a marked structural divergence at the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail with respect to Aqp1a and mammalian AQP1. Functional experiments, using artificial expression in oocytes of sea bream wild-type Aqp1a and Aqp1b, and chimeric proteins in which the C-terminus of Aqp1a was totally exchanged for that of Aqp1b, or the reverse, revealed that the Aqp1a tail drives constitutive targeting to the plasma membrane, unlike that of Aqp1b which produces partial retention of the expressed proteins in intracelluar vesicles. These data strongly suggest that Aqp1b independently acquired specific regulatory domains in the C-terminal region for the control of Aqp1b intracellular trafficking.</p><p>To investigate the nature of putative regulatory sites in the Aqp1b C-terminus, we analyzed its amino acid sequence in different teleosts. Based on this analysis, selected residues of sea bream Aqp1b were mutated into Ala or Asp and the resulting proteins were expressed in oocytes to determine their intracellular localization and permeability properties. In the Aqp1b C-terminus, we found typical sorting and internalisation signals that are common in many mammalian transmembrane proteins for targeting from the trans-Golgi network to the lysosomal-endosomal compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These motifs, however, were also detected in the Aqp1a C-terminal tail, although their sequence appeared to be different between the Aqp1a and Aqp1b isoforms. Thus, in all six teleost Aqp1b sequences analyzed, but not in Aqp1a, a di-Leu or Leu-Ile signals appear to be conserved. Mutation of sea bream Aqp1b Leu<sup>234</sup>Leu<sup>235 </sup>motif into Ala<sup>234</sup>Ala<sup>235 </sup>produced the retention of the protein in intracellular compartments and apparently increased its degradation, thereby reducing water permeability of these oocytes. These results are similar to those observed with the mammalian AQP2 mutant which has an altered and extended C-terminal tail, retained in late endosomes/lysosomes triggering degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Similarly, mutation of the C-terminal Leu<sup>345</sup>Leu<sup>346 </sup>motif in the human vasopressin V3 receptor produces mis-folding of the protein and abolishes receptor export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It is possible therefore, that the di-Leu motif in sea bream Aqp1b also plays a role in conformation, ensuring correct routing to the plasma membrane. However, di-Leu motifs are also involved in basolateral membrane targeting and microvilli anchoring of mammalian cell adhesion proteins, ion channels and receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], including AQP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], in polarized epithelial cells. Further studies are needed to establish whether the di-Leu motif has an additional function in the control of Aqp1b expression on the cell surface.</p><p>Most notably, functional analyses revealed that two residues in the sea bream Aqp1b C-terminal sequence, Thr<sup>229 </sup>and Ser<sup>254</sup>, were responsible for sea bream Aqp1b translocation from intracellular vesicles to the oocyte plasma membrane. The probability of the Thr<sup>229 </sup>residue being phosphorylated was low, and accordingly the Aqp1b-T229A mutant did not affect the phosphorylation state of Aqp1b, although it did inhibit Aqp1b cell surface expression and oocyte water permeability. Since Thr<sup>229 </sup>did not match any kinase phosphorylation consensus site other than protein kinase C (which apparently is not relevant here), the specific function of this residue is unknown and awaits further experimentation. Nevertheless, it was observed that the Aqp1b-S254A mutant prevented phosphorylation and increased Aqp1b translocation into the plasma membrane and subsequent water permeability, whereas the Aqp1b-S254D mutant, which mimicked the constitutively phosphorylated state of Aqp1b, was predominantly located in intracellular vesicles. These results suggest that dephosphorylation of Ser<sup>254 </sup>triggers Aqp1b shuttling to the cell surface, while its phosphorylation may retain the protein in intracellular vesicles. This mechanism is thus apparently the opposite to that described so far for mammalian and amphibian AQPs (i.e., AQP2 and AQP-h2), where channel insertion in the plasma membrane of collecting duct cells or granular cells of the anuran urinary bladder is triggered by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of specific Ser residues in the C-terminal tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Interestingly, the Ser<sup>254 </sup>in sea bream Aqp1b, a consensus site for a Pro-directed kinase, seems to be conserved in modern marine teleosts which produce hydrated eggs (Ser<sup>244 </sup>in fugu Aqp1b and Ser<sup>244 </sup>in sole Aqp1b). Pro-directed kinases are a large family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and cyclin-dependent kinase-like kinases, some of which (e.g., p38 MAPK) are involved in transduction pathways leading to the activation of the maturation promoting factor (MPF) during oocyte meiotic maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In sea bream, Aqp1b translocation into the oocyte plasma membrane is a tightly regulated process thought to occur transiently downstream of MPF activation during meiotic maturation, just before complete hydrolysis of yolk proteins and maximum K<sup>+ </sup>accumulation is reached in the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, it will be of interest to investigate the potential role of cell-cycle related kinases, or other kinases activated during oocyte maturation, in Ser<sup>254 </sup>phosphorylation and regulation of Aqp1b trafficking.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We provide phylogenetic and functional evidence for the teleost lineage-specific duplication of AQP1 channels and further divergence at the C-terminal tail. The generation and neofunctionalization of the Aqp1b isoform in oocytes of marine teleosts most likely contributed with the production of highly hydrated eggs to ensure survival in seawater. The neofunctionalization of Aqp1b has also been accompanied by the acquisition of regulatory domains in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail for the specific control of Aqp1b intracellular trafficking, which are currently being investigated. The elucidation of the biological functions of Aqp1a and Aqp1b in teleosts will contribute to our understanding of the evolution of phenotypic complexity, diversity and innovation in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Adult zebrafish, gilthead sea bream, Senegalese sole, and European eel were purchased from local pet stores or fish farms and maintained as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].
