During malaria, ROI production can contribute to both faster parasite clearance and more severe disease, especially anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, ROI are involved in cell signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), ROI have been implicated as mediators for demyelination and axonal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and enhanced respiratory burst activity has been detected in leukocytes of MS patients compared to control individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>One of the key enzymes leading to production of ROI is the leukocyte NADPH oxidase, consisting of several subunits, which are membrane-bound or located in the cytosol. Loss-of-function-mutations within the genes of these subunits lead to the development of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Genetic variation in components of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase may, therefore, influence disease susceptibility to and disease course of parasitic infection and autoimmune disease. The length of a TA-repeat in the promoter region of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase subunit gp91<sup>phox </sup>is associated with severity of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the subunit neutrophil cytosolic factor (NCF) 4 (p40<sup>phox</sup>) has been shown to be associated with antibody-negative arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Susceptibility to animal models of autoimmune diseases such as collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is influenced by genetic variation of Ncf1 (p47<sup>phox</sup>), another NADPH-oxidase subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. An intrinsic lower ROI release was associated with increased susceptibility to arthritis in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Recently it was shown that transgenic expression of <italic>ncf1 </italic>in macrophages can suppress autoimmune T cell responses in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>A mutation in human NCF1 accounts for about 25% of all CGD cases. Unlike the heterogeneous CGD-causing mutations in other leukocyte NADPH oxidase subunits, about 95% of the cases are attributed to a NCF1 mutation carry a common dinucleotide deletion (&#x00394;GT) in exon 2, leading to a frameshift and premature stop codon. This phenomenon is explained by the existence of two pseudogenes of NCF-1 (&#x003a8;NCF1), located in the same genomic region on chromosome 7q11.23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Two types of these pseudogenes have been described: type I &#x003a8;NCF1 contains the GT deletion (&#x00394;GT) while the more recently described type II &#x003a8;NCF1 does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is, therefore, possible that type II &#x003a8;NCF1 might be translated into functional protein similar to the NCF1 gene. In healthy individuals (non-CGD, non-carrier) the prevalence of type I and II &#x003a8;NCF1 can be determined by the &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio. Heyworth <italic>et al </italic>found among 53 healthy individuals 44 with a ratio of 2:1 (reflecting two type I &#x003a8;NCF1 genes per NCF1 gene), seven with a ratio of 1:1 (reflecting heterozygosity for a haplotype containing each one type I and type II &#x003a8;NCF1) and two with a ratio of 1:2 (possibly reflecting homozygosity for a haplotype containing each one type I and type II &#x003a8;NCF1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Whether the &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio has functional significance in terms of individual NCF1 expression, ROI production or susceptibility to infectious or autoimmune diseases is currently unknown. This study evaluates whether NCF1 &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratios are associated with severity of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>malaria or individual ROI production in Gabonese children suffering from malaria. In order to search for a possible association with autoimmune diseases, a case-control association study in MS patients from Germany and Poland was conducted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>German MS patients (n = 265) were recruited at the Neurology Department, University of T&#x000fc;bingen. German control persons (n = 191) were recruited from age and sex-matched participants of the Dortmund Health Study, a health survey of the general population in western Germany. Polish MS patients (n = 187) were recruited at the Department of Neurology, Medical University of Lodz.

Measurements were taken from whole blood (diluted 1:100 in Krebs Ringer phosphate glucose medium) and separated granulocyte suspensions with and without stimulation using either the mitogen phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Relative light units were measured after adding 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phtalazin-dion (Luminol) to an concentration of 11 &#x003bc;M in a luminometer (Lumat LB 9501-0 (Berthold AG, Wildbad, Germany) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

Briefly, exon 2 of the NCF1 gene/pseudogenes was amplified from genomic DNA using the FAM-labeled forward primer 2LB2 5'-GTGCACACAGCAAAGCCTCT-3' and the unlabeled reverse primer 2RB2 5'-CTAAGGTCCTTCCCAAAGGGT-3' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] under standard PCR conditions. PCR products were quantified on a DNA sequencer using the GENEMAPPER software v3.5 (both Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Individual &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratios were calculated by dividing the area of the 209 bp peak (reflecting PCR products from the genes carrying the &#x00394;GT deletion) by the area of the 211 bp peak (representing products from the GTGT-containing sequence). Individuals can have only discrete values of one or two &#x00394;GT with one or two GTGT genes per allele. Therefore, study persons were categorized according to a cut-off value of 1.5 as having a ratio &#x02264; 1:1 or &#x02265; 2:1. Measured median [interquartile range] ratios from European individuals categorized as having a ratio &#x02265; 2:1 were 2.28 [2.21 to 2.43] and for the ratio &#x02264; 1:1 were 1.09 [1.04 to 1.15]. Thus, actually measured &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratios were higher than the respective expected ratios, most probably due to higher PCR efficacy of the shorter &#x00394;GT amplicon.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Analysis of variance was performed in order to explain levels of ROI production in children suffering from <italic>P. falciparum </italic>malaria by their &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratios.

In the next step we searched for differences in ROI production dependent of the &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratios in different subgroups defined by severity of malaria, time point of measurement and stimulation conditions. Only in the group with severe malaria at admission a tendency for higher maximum and cumulative ROI production by unstimulated and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in children with a ratio &#x02264; 1:1 compared to children with a ratio &#x02265; 2:1 was found. The geometric mean of maximum and cumulative PMA-stimulated ROI production within this subgroup was 1.7-fold higher in children with a &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio &#x02264; 1:1 compared to children with a &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio &#x02265; 2:1 (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.9 for maximum and 1.0 to 3.0 for cumulative ROI production). Maximum unstimulated ROI production was 1.9-fold higher (95% CI: 0.8 to 3.7) in children with a &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio &#x02264; 1:1 compared to children with a &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio &#x02265; 2:1 (cumulative basal ROI production: 1.5-fold increase; 95% CI: 0.8 to 2.8).

This tendency for higher ROI production in whole blood preparations from children with a &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio &#x02264; 1:1 than from those with a ratio &#x02265; 2:1 would be consistent with the previously published observation, that individuals with ratio 1:2 had about 76% more NCF-1 protein in their neutrophils compared to persons having ratio 2:1 while one individual with ratio 1:1 displayed an intermediate phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

Detailed clinical data for these analyses were available from 217 German MS patients. Analysis of variance did not establish &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio as a factor influencing disease severity (reflected by Kurtzke's <italic>Expanded Disability Status Score </italic>[EDSS], an established measurement score of disability in multiple sclerosis patients) but as a factor associated with age-of-onset (whole model for age-of-onset: Rsquare 0.11, RMSE 8.9; factor &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio <italic>P </italic>= 0.03; factor bout-onset versus progressive-onset <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001).

Only within the subgroup of children with severe malaria during the acute disease, a weak association of &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio with ROI production in whole blood was found. It has been suggested that the &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio influences the expression levels of NCF1 most probably by the occurrence of an NCF1 transcript from the type II pseudogene that does not contain the GT deletion, which leads to a premature stop codon in the type I pseudogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. If this effect on p47<sup>phox </sup>expression in turn may determine oxidative burst is currently unclear. In cell lines from persons hemizygous for the NCF1 locus decreased p47<sup>phox </sup>expression and decreased superoxide anion production has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The present data showing a tendency for enhanced ROI production in individuals with a ratio &#x02264; 1:1 would fit this hypothesis. However, no influence of &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratios on clinical disease course of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>malaria was detected, although it was previously shown by us that ROI production plays a role in parasite clearance as well as in the pathology of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>As for autoimmune diseases, in humans there were only two studies so far which examined the putative genetic associations of p47<sup>phox </sup>pseudogenes and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The initial publication showed a relative excess of &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio &#x02264; 1:1 in patients, especially in the subgroup of those with Crohn's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A second study involving 488 IBD patients and 181 control persons did not reproduce these findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Genetic association of NCF1 with MS has so far been reported only in animal models of the disease. In CIA and EAE the presence of a genetic variant of <italic>ncf1 </italic>leads to reduced oxidative burst and exacerbates disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the present study no association of &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratios with MS in a Polish and a German population was detected. However, one limitation of this study is that only moderate numbers of patients were included, which allows only to exclude NCF1 &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratios as a major susceptibility factor for MS. When searching for possible associations with sub-phenotypes of MS, no influence of &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratios on MS disease severity was found. However, within the German MS population &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratios were associated with age-of-onset, namely that individuals with a ratio &#x02264; 1:1 had a later disease onset. Assuming that a &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio &#x02264; 1:1 would also be associated with higher ROI production in MS patients, which in turn would rather modulate T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], these results do also fit the findings in animal experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study examined for the first time a possible influence of type I/type II NCF1 pseudogene ratios on ROI production and disease severity in children with malaria and susceptibility to multiple sclerosis in a German and Polish population. A tendency for higher ROI production among persons with a &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio &#x02264; 1:1 compared to those with a ratio of &#x02265; 2:1 only within a subgroup of children with malaria was found. These results need to be confirmed in an independent set of patients focussing on the acute phase of the disease. NCF1 &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratios were not associated with severity of malaria or susceptibility to and severity of MS. However, an association with age-of-onset among MS patients was detected. These results fit the hypothesis that a &#x00394;GT/GTGT ratio &#x02264; 1:1 could lead to enhanced expression of NCF1 and subsequently to higher ROI production which could in turn modulate T cell responses. Based on these results, further studies involving larger numbers of clinically well-defined patients would be needed in order to confirm this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BG participated in the design of the study, measured ROI, participated in the statistical analysis and drafted the paper.
