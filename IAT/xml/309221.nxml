The noncovalent complexes were subjected to a mild ultraviolet irradiation treatment and the sites of photo-incorporation were analysed. When the photo-affinity label was attached to the aminoacyl group cross-linking was observed from both A- and P-site bound tRNA and involved exclusively the 50S subunit. In both cases the major target of cross-linking was a single site in 23S RNA, localized to position A-2439. A lower yield of cross-linking to L27 from both P- and A-sites was also observed. In contrast, cross-linking from the acp3U47 derivative was specific for P-site bound tRNA and involved mainly (but not exclusively) the 50S subunit. In this case rRNA and ribosomal protein were labelled in approximately equal yields, the sites of cross-linking involving A-2309 in 23S RNA and L33. These results are discussed in the light of our present knowledge concerning the structural arrangement of the tRNA-ribosome complex.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0108-a" xlink:role="891"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0108-b" xlink:role="891"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0109-a" xlink:role="892"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="887"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="888"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="889"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="890"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="891"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="892"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="893"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="894"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="895"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00053-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="896"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
