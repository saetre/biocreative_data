Although controversy still exists, Kaiso is supposed to be involved in human cancer. However, there is limited information regarding the clinical significance of cytoplasmic/nuclear Kaiso in human lung cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this study, immunohistochemical studies were performed on 20 cases of normal lung tissues and 294 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including 50 cases of paired lymph node metastases and 88 cases with complete follow-up records. Three lung cancer cell lines showing primarily nuclear localization of Kaiso were selected to examine whether roles of Kaiso in cytoplasm and in nucleus are identical. Nuclear Kaiso was down-regulated by shRNA technology or addition a specific Kaiso antibody in these cell lines. The proliferative and invasive abilities were evaluated by MTT and Matrigel invasive assay, transcription of Kaiso's target gene matrilysin was detected by RT-PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Kaiso was primarily expressed in the cytoplasm of lung cancer tissues. Overall positive cytoplasmic expression rate was 63.61% (187/294). The positive cytoplasmic expression of Kaiso was higher in advanced TNM stages (III+IV) of NSCLC, compared to lower stages (I+II) (<italic>p </italic>= 0.019). A correlation between cytoplasmic Kaiso expression and lymph node metastasis was found (<italic>p </italic>= 0.003). In 50 paired cases, cytoplasmic expression of Kaiso was 78.0% (41/50) in primary sites and 90.0% (45/50) in lymph node metastases (<italic>p </italic>= 0.001). The lung cancer-related 5-year survival rate was significantly lower in patients who were cytoplasmic Kaiso-positive (22.22%), compared to those with cytoplasmic Kaiso-negative tumors (64.00%) (<italic>p </italic>= 0.005). Nuclear Kaiso staining was seen in occasional cases with only a 5.10% (15/294) positive rate and was not associated with any clinicopathological features of NSCLC. Furthermore, after the down-regulation of the nuclear expresses Kaiso <italic>in vitro</italic>, both proliferative and invasive abilities of three cancer cell lines were significantly enhanced, along with the up-regulation of Kaiso target gene, <italic>matrilysin</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest cytoplasmic Kaiso expression is associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC and various subcellular localizations of Kaiso may play differential biological roles in NSCLC.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The transcriptional repressor Kaiso belongs to the BTB/POZ (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric-a-brac/Pox virus, and Zinc finger) family[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This protein contains an amino-terminal, protein-protein interaction BTB/POZ domain and a carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>zinc finger domain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. To date, Kaiso appears to be the only known POZ-ZF transcription factor that possesses bi-modal DNA-binding activity. The candidate Kaiso target genes identified thus far, such as <italic>matrilysin</italic>, <italic>c-myc</italic>, and <italic>cyclin D1</italic>, seem to be regulated via its zinc finger domain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>However, the role of Kaiso still needs to be defined in tumorigenesis. Considering that some cancer-associated canonical and noncanonical Wnt target gene, such as <italic>matrilysin </italic>and <italic>Wnt11</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], are repressed by Kaiso, it seems that this protein might function as a tumor suppressor. Conversely, data obtained from Kaiso-null mice strongly conflicts with this notion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. When Kaiso-deficient mice were cross-bred with the well-characterized, tumor-susceptible <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+ </sup>mice, the progeny showed resistance to intestinal tumorigenesis. Furthermore, a recent study carried out in colon cancer cell lines suggests that Kaiso is a methylation-dependent "opportunistic" oncogene, which represses the tumor suppressor gene <italic>CDKN2A </italic>and provides a survival advantage to colon cancer cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although controversy still exists, there is no question regarding Kaiso's involvement in human cancer.</p><p>To date, little clinicopathological report has referred to the relationship between Kaiso expression and the malignant characteristics of human tumors, including lung cancer. Soubry A. <italic>et al. </italic>initially attempt to explore the expression pattern of Kaiso in human tissues using immunohistochemistry[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Interestingly, they found that, in contrast to the nuclear localization of cultured cells (such as MDCK, NIH3T3, HT29, and SW48), this transcription factor predominantly localized to the cytosol in both cancerous and noncancerous human tissues. They also showed that the subcellular localization of Kaiso was dynamic, rather than static, and this phenomenon may contribute to an unexpected influence of the microenvironment. However, further studies are still needed on many topics, including whether this transcription factor exerts a function in the cytoplasm, whether Kaiso is expressed in lung cancer, and the correlation between the subcellular localization of Kaiso and tumor grade and/or prognosis. These issues prompted us to determine the expression profile of Kaiso and to clarify the relationship between Kaiso expression and tumor clinicopathological features in lung cancers, using a large specimen size.</p><p>In the current study, we examined the expression of Kaiso in 294 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and analyzed the correlation between the expression of Kaiso and clinicopathological factors. Meanwhile, Kaiso expression in 50 cases of nodal metastases was probed to investigate differences between primary lung cancers and paired lymph node metastases. In order to obtain prognostic data more quickly, immunohistochemistry was performed on partial lung cancer paraffin embedded tissues from five years ago to determine the expression of Kaiso. The effect of Kaiso on prognosis of the patients with lung cancer was analyzed by inspecting follow-up data. In addition, we ablated Kaiso, which is principally localized in the nuclei of cells, in three lung cancer cell lines to investigate alterations in both <italic>matrilysin </italic>transcription and in the cells, proliferative and invasive abilities, to provide insight into the role of Kaiso in the progression of lung cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue samples</title><p>Tumor specimens from 294 patients with NSCLC were obtained between 1998 and 2005 following surgical resection at the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University. 20 cases (included in the 294 cases) of tumor and paired non-tumor portion (with &#x0003e;5 cm distance from the primary tumor's edge) of the same case were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and maintained at -70&#x000b0;C for protein analysis. Among the 294 cases, the lymph node metastases of 50 patients were available. None of the patients had received radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy prior to tumor excision. Of the patients, 165 are male and 129 are female, creating a 1.87:1 ratio of male to female. Patients' ages at the time of surgery ranged from 35 to 81, with an average age of 57.24 years old. The tumors were classified according to the TNM stage revised by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) in 2002[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. All specimens were re-evaluated for diagnosis following the criteria for classification of lung cancer by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and 133 squamous cell carcinomas and 146 adenocarcinomas were confirmed. A total of 50 samples (21 squamous cell carcinoma, 23 adenocarcinoma, and 6 large cell carcinoma) with autologous lymph node metastases were used as paired samples to perform immunohistochemical analysis. In addition, immunohistochemistry was completed on 88 cases of primary NSCLC paraffin specimens, excised from February 1998 to October 2007, which had complete follow-up records. This study was conducted under the regulations of the Institutional Review Board of China Medical University. Informed consent was obtained from all enrolled patients prior to surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical staining and evaluation</title><p>As described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were cut into 4 &#x003bc;m-thick sequential sections. After dewaxing in xylene and rehydrating stepwise in ethanol, sections were boiled in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 105 seconds within an autoclave. Endogenous peroxidase activity and non-specific binding were blocked with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and non-immune sera, respectively. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Specifically, mouse anti-human Kaiso monoclonal antibody (clone 6F, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY, USA) and goat anti-human Kaiso polyclonal antibody (C-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. CA, USA) were used at concentration of 4 &#x003bc;g/ml. The following day, the staining was followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Maixin Biotechnology, Fuzhou, Fujian, China). The peroxidase reaction was developed with 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (MaiXin Biotechnology). Counterstaining was done lightly with hematoxylin, and the sections were dehydrated in alcohol before mounting. For the negative control, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used in place of the primary antibodies.</p><p>All of the stained sections were assessed by three observers (S.D.D., Y.W. and E.H.W) who had no knowledge of the patients' clinical status. Cases with discrepancies were jointly re-evaluated by the investigators, and a consensus was obtained. The sections were evaluated at low magnification (&#x000d7;100) to identify areas where Kaiso was evenly stained. We counted 400 tumor cells and calculated the percentage of positively staining cells. The proportion of cells exhibiting Kaiso expression was categorized as follows: 0: less than 25%; 1: 26%&#x02013;50%; 2: 51%&#x02013;75%; and 3: more than 75%. The staining intensity was categorized by relative intensity as follows: 1(weak); 2 (intermediate) and 3 (strong). The proportion and intensity scores were then multiplied to obtain a total score. To obtain final statistical results, score less than 1 was considered as negative, while scores of 2 or more were considered as positive. Cases were scored nuclear positive when &#x02265;5% of the cells reacted with the anti-Kaiso antibody in the nucleus or in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture, transfection, and antibody inhibition</title><p>The BE1 cell line was established from a human pulmonary giant cell carcinoma (a gift from Dr. Jie Zheng, Medical College of Beijing University, Beijing, China).

The total protein extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies following SDS-PAGE analysis. Immunoblots were performed using goat polyclonal primary specific for Kaiso and &#x003b2;-actin (a housekeeping protein used as a loading control to assure equal amounts of protein in all lanes). After blocking non-specific binding with 5% BSA in TBS (pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST), primary antibodies were incubated on the membranes for Kaiso (1:1000, C-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and &#x003b2;-actin (1:200, Beijing Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co.

Due to lack of information regarding to Kaiso expression in tumors, no Kaiso positive criterion has been detailed by researchers. Thus, a criterion still needed to be specified in the current study. Based on the basic expression profile of Kaiso in NSCLC and in consulting with general criterion widely applied in immunohistochemical studies, we considered expression of cytoplasmic Kaiso to be positive when scores of 2 or more, because the distribution ratio of stained cells showed bipolarity using this method. We also found that no significant difference between cytoplasmic Kaiso localization and clinicopathological features could be elucidated when other positive criterions were applied.</p><p>The transcriptional repressor Kaiso belongs to the BTB/POZ (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric-a-brac/Pox virus, and Zinc finger) family[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which is abbreviated as POZ-ZF. Many members of the POZ-ZF family have roles in the development of cancer. For example, APM-1 inhibits the growth of cervical carcinoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and the human BCL-6 and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger proteins are causally involved in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute promyelocytic leukemia, respectively[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, Pokemon was proven to be a type of proto-oncogene[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], whereas the BTB/POZ protein HIC1 is candidate tumor suppressor in a variety of human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, the relationship between Kaiso and cancer still needs to be clarified. Some data clearly indicate a tumor-suppressor activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], while the fact that a Kaiso knockout was detrimental to tumor growth and survival in an animal model suggests that Kaiso facilitates tumorigenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The latter point is consistent with results obtained from a recent study where Kaiso depletion sensitized colon cancer cells to cell cycle arrest and chemotherapy.</p><p>There is little documentation regarding to the immunohistochemical expression of Kaiso in lung cancer. Only one report examines Kaiso expression in lung cancer tissues, and the author reported no Kaiso expression in two lung squamous cell carcinomas[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Since there is little current knowledge about Kaiso expression in lung cancer, its expression profile and relationship to clinical characteristics still needed to be clarified. In the present study, we examined the expression of Kaiso in 294 cases non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and analyzed the correlation between expression of Kaiso and clinicopathological factors. Meanwhile, Kaiso expression was assessed in 50 cases of lymph node metastases to investigate differences between primary lung cancer and paired lymph node metastases. Our study demonstrated that 63.61% of 294 lung cancer samples contained cytoplasmic Kaiso expression, which is a significant increase compared to normal bronchial epithelial cells (regarded as negative expression). This data implied an oncogenic role for Kaiso. Besides, the 294 cases with primary lung cancer showed that, cytoplasmic Kaiso expression in lung cancer tissue of patients with TNM stages III+IV was significantly higher than that in TNM stages I+II (<italic>p </italic>= 0.019). Moreover, cytoplasmic expression (71.2%) of Kaiso in the lung cancer samples from patients with lymph node metastases was significantly higher than that (54.2%) in samples from patients without lymph node metastases, suggesting that cytoplasmic Kaiso expression in primary cells was closely associated with tumor lymph node metastases (<italic>p </italic>= 0.003). In 50 paired cases, we also observed that lymph node metastases had increased (90.0%) cytoplasmic expression of Kaiso, compared to the primary tumors (78.0%) in fifty paired lung cancer specimens. In order to define the effect of cytoplasmic Kaiso on prognosis of the patients with lung cancer, eighty-eight NSCLC tissues with complete follow-up records were analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Prognostic analysis were performed on the clinical information by combining follow-up data, and the results indicate that the postoperative survival period of the group with positive cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was notably shorter than that of the negative group. Specifically, these results suggested that cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was a harmful factor affecting prognosis and further indicated that cytoplasmic Kaiso correlated with malignant tumor behavior. Cox model multivariate analysis showed that cytoplasmic Kaiso may be an independent factor affecting prognosis, with a p-value of 0.054. It seems important to collect more patient follow-up records to clarify this correlation between Kaiso expression and a patient's clinical response. Kaiso may exert an anti-oncogenic function in the cytoplasm of lung cancer cells. Obviously, this suggestion seems antagonistic of its role as a transcriptional repressor, but Kaiso may function in different biological roles in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. While we are still unsure of how Kaiso exerts its function in the cytoplasm, we believe that Kaiso plays a biological role in the cytoplasm, and this role may differ from that in the nucleus.</p><p>In lung cancer tissues, we found Kaiso to be primarily localized in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. In fact, the positive nuclear scoring of Kaiso was extremely low. Even when we defined nuclear staining of 5% of the cells in a sample as positive, only 15 cases were included. Our statistical analysis showed that nuclear expression of Kaiso did not correlate with various pathological factors. Considering the influence of unexpected tumor microenvironment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which may promote Kaiso to translocate from nucleus to cytoplasm, we supposed it was hard to clarify the nuclear role of Kaiso in lung cancer tissues.</p><p>Consistent with previous study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], we also found Kaiso principally localized in the nucleus when cells cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>. The subcellular localization difference of Kaiso between <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>could be explained by the tumor microenvironment. We also have data implying that other factors, such as the cell cycle and the influence of p120ctn, influence the subcellular localization of Kaiso (data not shown). We did not plan to extend this theme further in present study, although we were interested in whether Kaiso exerted its varying functions in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. Thus, we cultured three kinds of lung cancer cells (BE1, LTEP-A-2, and SPC-A-1)<italic>in vitro </italic>and observed where Kaiso is localized. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that Kaiso is localized to the nucleus in these three lung cancer cell lines. We performed the shRNA technique to down-regulate nuclear localized Kaiso, and we utilized a specific Kaiso antibody as a control. The results demonstrated that both the shRNA-Kaiso and the specific Kaiso antibody addition were able to enhance the proliferative and invasive abilities of lung cancer cell lines.</p><p>In order to determine whether the enhancement of proliferative and invasive abilities contributed to the down-regulation of nuclear Kaiso, we analyzed mRNA expression of the <italic>matrilysin </italic>gene, which is directly repressed by Kaiso. This repression is due to the <italic>matrilysin </italic>promoter, which contains two conserved copies of the Kaiso binding sequence (KBS). At present, this gene has been proven to be regulated by Kaiso[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Addition of specific Kaiso antibodies also relieved the Kaiso-mediated repression of <italic>matrilysin</italic>. These studies demonstrated that the enhancement of proliferative and invasive abilities was consistent with down-regulation of Kaiso in nucleus.</p><p>It should be noted that differences in the up-regulation of <italic>matrilysin </italic>transcription and in the proliferative and invasive abilities existed between the Kaiso antibody addition group and the shRNA-Kaiso group. These results could be explained by the fact that different experimental treatments were used on the cells for each experiment; cells transfected with shRNA Kaiso plasmids suffered from the effectiveness of transfection, while treating with a Kaiso antibody could exert more extensive effects throughout the culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Above all, in lung cancer tissues, we found that Kaiso is principally expressed in the cytoplasm, which positively correlated with TNM stage, lymph node metastases, and potentially with unfavorable prognosis of patients. However, whether Kaiso can be used as an independent prognostic factor still needs further clarification (p = 0.054, Cox multivariate analysis). As for several <italic>in vitro </italic>cultured lung cancer cell lines, Kaiso localized primarily in the nucleus. Performing both shRNA-Kaiso and using addition of Kaiso-specific antibodies, we were able to increase the expression of <italic>matrilysin</italic>, which is repressed by Kaiso, and promote proliferative and invasive abilities of the cells. Although our research is still preliminary, it has already demonstrated unique biological functions for the different localization of Kaiso in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. We also noticed that although Kaiso is basically localized to the nucleus in cultured cells, cells showing cytoplasmic or nuclear/cytoplasmic co-expression existed. Thus, it is worthwhile in the future to construct plasmids that enhance the cytoplasmic-specific and nuclear-specific localization of Kaiso in order to clarify the biological roles of cytoplasmic and nuclear Kaiso. These types of studies will also help elucidate the specific mechanisms that will further reveal the inner relationship between cytoplasmic Kaiso expression and lymph node metastasis, as well as poor prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>NSCLC: non-small cell lung cancer; KBS: Kaiso binding sequence; MTT: 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DSD, WY and WEH designed research, evaluated immunohistochemical results and wrote the paper, MY and ZY carried out prepared pathology samples, follow-up and immunohistochemical study, ZY and JGY carried out cell culture, IF, MTT and invasive assay, ZPX and YZQ performed the statistical analysis of all data.
