In some families, abnormal anterior segment development contributes to glaucoma. The genes causing anterior segment dysgenesis and glaucoma in most of these families are not identified and the affected developmental processes are poorly understood.

The penetrance and severity of abnormalities is strongly influenced by genetic background, being most severe on the C57BL/6J background and absent on some other backgrounds. On the C57BL/6J background there is also persistence of the hyaloid vasculature, diminished numbers of inner retinal cells, and absence of the optic nerve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrate that heterozygous deficiency of BMP4 results in anterior segment dysgenesis and elevated IOP.

Thus, <italic>BMP4</italic> is a strong candidate to contribute to Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly and other developmental conditions associated with human glaucoma. BMP4 also participates in posterior segment development and wild-type levels are usually critical for optic nerve development on the C57BL/6J background. <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice are useful for studying various components of ocular development, and may allow identification of strain specific modifiers affecting a variety of ocular phenotypes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness that involves loss of retinal ganglion cells and degeneration of the optic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Glaucoma is usually associated with high intraocular pressure (IOP) that results from an increased resistance to drainage of the ocular fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Developmental disorders of the ocular anterior segment, including Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, are often associated with elevated IOP and glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The developmental sequence and structure of the human and mouse ocular drainage structures are similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and the same genes are known to cause anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) in humans and mice. Known genes that cause anterior segment dysgenesis code for developmentally important transcription factors. These genes include <italic>PITX2, PITX3, PAX6, FOXC1</italic> (previously known as FKHL7 and FREAC3), <italic>Foxc2</italic> and <italic>FOXE3</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Activity levels for these transcription factors normally associated with diploid gene dosage are important for normal ocular development, with heterozygosity for null mutations in most of these genes causing anterior segment dysgenesis. For <italic>FOXC1</italic> and <italic>PAX6,</italic> both haploinsufficiency and increased gene dosage due to gene duplication result in abnormal ocular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Similarly, a mutation in <italic>PITX2</italic> that results in increased transcriptional transactivation causes ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a large subclass (more than 20 members) of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily. Although originally named because of their ability to induce bone and cartilage formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], BMPs are involved in many developmental processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, and intercellular interactions during morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Members of the bone morphogenetic protein family function in a gene dosage dependent manner during development and participate in ocular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore, mutations that alter the level of BMPs or alter the degree of BMP signaling are candidates to contribute to Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and other conditions involving anterior segment malformation, elevated IOP, and glaucoma. Interestingly, some BMPs modulate tooth morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and Axenfeld-Rieger patients present with dental abnormalities.</p><p><italic>Bmp2</italic> and <italic>Bmp4</italic> are two members of the BMP family, closely related to <italic>Drosophila dpp</italic> (decapentaplegic). <italic>Bmp4</italic> is expressed in multiple tissues during embryonic development, including the heart, lung, kidney, brain, and eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In the eye, <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression is first identified in the distal optic vesicle and overlying surface ectoderm at the 8&#x02013;12 somite stage and later in the dorsal portion of the developing optic cup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Lens induction is absent in homozygous <italic>Bmp4</italic> mutants and can be rescued by exogenous BMP4 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The effects of decreasing <italic>Bmp4</italic> dosage on anterior and posterior segment development have not been reported. In this study, we analyzed mice heterozygous for a null allele of <italic>Bmp4</italic> (<italic>Bmp4</italic><sup><italic>tmlBlh</italic></sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] to determine if decreased functional gene dosage contributes to ASD and elevated IOP. Heterozygous <italic>Bmp4</italic> mutant mice have a variety of ocular abnormalities including ASD, buphthalmia (enlarged eyes), and elevated IOP. This work functionally demonstrates that BMP4 is a good candidate to cause human ASD and developmental glaucoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>Bmp4</italic> expression</title><p>Eyes of <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup><italic>lacZneo</italic></sup> heterozygotes on a mixed background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] were evaluated for &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression at embryonic ages E14.5, E16.5, new born, postnatal ages P2, P14, and P30 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Most commonly, however, there were abnormal iridocorneal attachments (anterior synechiae) of variable extent, large irregularly shaped pupils that were often eccentrically located, and a displaced Schwalbe's line. Several eyes had peripheral corneal thinning while others demonstrated scleralization (opacity) of the peripheral cornea, diffuse corneal haze, or peripheral neovascularization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

Abnormalities were only detected in <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. The severity of lesions varied within individual eyes and between eyes of the same mouse. In most eyes, the iridocorneal angle was abnormal. The iridocorneal angle contains the ocular drainage structures (trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal) and is located at the junction of the iris and cornea. Abnormalities of the iridocorneal angle included small or absent Schlemm's canal (SC), hypoplastic or absent trabecular meshwork (TM) that appeared compressed and stalled in development, and iris attachments to the peripheral cornea (synechiae. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D,E,F</xref>). Despite the synechiae and abnormal pupils, most <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice had generally normal iris architecture. The iris in some eyes, however, was hypoplastic and malformed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), and occasionally the malformation was extensive involving both iris and ciliary body. The peripheral cornea was often thinner than normal with neovascularization. There was abnormal persistence of the anterior hyaloid vessels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Anterior subcapsular and cortical cataracts occurred in most mice.</p><p>To investigate the consequences of functionally halving <italic>Bmp4</italic> gene dosage on iridocorneal angle development in more detail, we used transmission electron microscopy. In <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, the TM consisted of robust trabecular beams with abundant organized collagen and elastic tissue cores that were covered with endothelial-like trabecular cells. SC had a normal appearance and was lined with endothelial cells. In contrast, SC was often absent and the TM had developed abnormally or was absent in <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Even in places where the TM was relatively normal, there were fewer trabecular beams and a paucity of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including organized collagen bundles and elastic tissue. For example, in the posterior trabecular meshwork of wild type mice, there are normally 7&#x02013;10 trabecular beams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice had only 1&#x02013;2 beams and these beams were nearly devoid of collagen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G,H,I,J</xref>). Further ECM abnormalities were present in the peripheral cornea where prominent irregularity of the normally regularly arranged collagen bundles explained the peripheral corneal scleralization.</p></sec><sec><title>Intraocular pressure</title><p>To determine the effects of decreased <italic>Bmp4</italic> gene dosage on intraocular pressure, we compared the lOPs of age- and strain-matched <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice. We initially assessed the lOPs of 2 to 5 month old mice. At these ages, 7 out of 17 <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> heterozygotes had elevated IOP (defined as an IOP greater than two standard deviations above the mean of the <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/+</sup>mice). To determine if the incidence of elevated IOP changed with age, we analyzed groups of mice at the ages of 6 to 10 months and 12 to 16 months. The incidence did not change appreciably with 5 out of 10 mice having elevated IOP at 6 to 10 months and 4 out of 9 having elevated IOP at 12 to 16 months (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). <italic>Bmp4</italic> genotype had a significant effect on IOP (ANOVA, P &#x0003c; 0.004) whereas age and sex did not.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Intraocular pressures in <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (filled circles) and <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> (open circles) mice on the C57BL/6J background. <bold>A.</bold> Some <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> heterozygotes have elevated IOP at all ages (defined as greater than or equal to 2SD above the mean for normal mice). In the mice that were analyzed at multiple ages, there was no obvious effect of age on IOP elevation. The number of mice analyzed at each age are: at 2 months 19+/+, 17+/-; at 6&#x02013;10 months 18 +/+, 10 +/-; at 12&#x02013;16 months 5 +/+, 9+/-. The number of circles sometimes appears different to these values as some mice had identical IOPs. <bold>B.</bold> Histological analysis demonstrated that eyes with high IOP had extensive abnormalities (see Methods), with an estimated 80% or more of the iridocorneal angle circumference being severely malformed. The eye with 100% of analyzed angle locations severely affected and low IOP had a severely malformed ciliary body.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-2-18-3"/></fig><p>Due to the variability in both anterior segment abnormalities and IOP, we reasoned that histological analysis of eyes with high versus normal IOP might provide insight to the extent of abnormalities required to cause elevated IOP. The incidence of drainage structure abnormalities and synechiae deemed severe enough to significantly decrease or prevent aqueous humor drainage was recorded by careful analysis of many sections from different regions around these eyes (see Methods). Our data suggest that IOP is normal even when 50% of the iridocorneal angle around the circumference of the eye is severely abnormal. Furthermore, all four of the studied eyes with high IOP also had severe abnormalities extending over 80% or more of the analyzed sections (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Posterior segment abnormalities</title><p>Ophthalmoscopic analysis of <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> but not <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice revealed irregular white patches in the vitreous and dense vitreous haze in the majority of eyes examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The retinal vasculature also was abnormal in <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> eyes. Fluorescein angiography showed that the main retinal vessels branched close to the optic nerve and were irregularly arranged compared to wild type mice. In addition, there was a dense network of small tortuous vessels throughout the vitreous that leaked fluorescein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). These abnormalities were identified in the youngest (2 to 3 weeks old) and oldest (17 months) mice examined. Severe retinal detachments were observed as early as four months and their incidence increased with age. Although anterior segment cloudiness often made ophthalmoscopy difficult in <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> heterozygotes, abnormalities of the optic nerve head were frequently present. Combined intraorbital and intracranial dissection of 8 randomly selected mice failed to detect a grossly visible optic nerve in all but one mouse. This mouse had a nerve extending from the right eye but the left nerve was absent.

The abnormal vitreous vessels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>) were frequently associated with the formation of adhesions between the retina and lens capsule that exerted traction on the retina resulting in retinal detachment in approximately 25% of the <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice examined and occurred as early as P30. Regression of the hyaloid vasculature is mediated via macrophage-dependent cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the first ten days after birth, macrophages were abundant in the vitreous of <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, usually localized close to the hyaloid vascular system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). As the hyaloid vessels disappeared the number of macrophages declined. In <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, macrophages were rarely observed and never identified in the vitreous of mice older than P14.</p><p>In agreement with the clinical examinations, optic nerve phenotypes in <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice ranged from normal to absent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H,I,J,K</xref>). They were often severely abnormal, consisting of loose connective tissue, with absence of neural tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I,J</xref>). Retinal architecture also varied within and between eyes. Although areas of retina were morphologically normal in <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, the retinal ganglion cell layer was estimated to on average contain approximately 50% the normal number of cells and the inner nuclear layer was unusually thin. The retinal phenotype was variable but present in mice of all analyzed ages including 1 month old. It did not correlate with IOP, being present in both high and normal IOP eyes, and was not obviously worse in old mice than in young mice. In contrast, the photoreceptor layer typically appeared normal though there may have been reduced numbers of cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4K</xref>). However, there were foci of retinal dysplasia, characterized by rosette formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4M</xref>). Additionally, there were small areas where photoreceptor nuclei extended externally and were in direct contact with the retinal pigment epithelium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4N</xref>). A panel of retinal cell markers revealed that all major retinal cell types including ganglion cells, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, rod and cone photoreceptors, and Muller cells were present in <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> retinas, and expressed markers of differentiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,B,C,D,E,F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>A-F.</bold> P7 <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> retinas treated with a panel of antibodies to retinal markers. <bold>A.</bold> Neurofilament 270 (NF) antibody identifies ganglion cells (arrow) and horizontal cells (arrowhead). <bold>B.</bold> VC1.1 antibody identifies amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer and displaced amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer (arrows). <bold>C.</bold> Pax6 antibody identifies progenitors and amacrine cells (arrows). <bold>D.</bold> ChxI0 antibody identifies bipolar cells (arrow). <bold>E.</bold> RhoD4 antibody identifies rods (arrow). <bold>F.</bold> Cyclin D3 antibody identifies Muller cells (arrow). <bold>A-F.</bold> x 200.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-2-18-5"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Electroretinography</title><p>We used full field electroretinography (ERG) to study retinal function in 15 <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> heterozygotes. Eyes with extensively opaque corneas or obvious cataracts were not used for ERG assessment, and mice with retinal detachments were dropped from the study. There was variability in both severity and age of detectable abnormalities. Compared to normal mice, some <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> eyes had normal responses even at ages up to 15 months (the oldest age assessed for these eyes). In other mice, both <italic>a</italic>- and <italic>b</italic>- wave amplitude reductions were seen, due in part to poor pupillary dilation. However, a prominent feature of the ERG waveforms to bright flashes when detectable abnormalities were present was the preferential loss of <italic>b</italic>-wave relative to the <italic>a</italic>-wave. It is well established that the <italic>a</italic>- and <italic>b</italic>- wave components of the bright flash ERG in mice reflect the functional state of outer- and inner- retinal cells, respectively. Our observations of greater deficits of the <italic>b</italic>-wave extend our analysis to the entire retina and are consistent with the histologic abnormalities that are more severe in the inner retina.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of genetic background</title><p>The penetrance and severity of anterior and posterior segment phenotypes was strongly influenced by genetic background (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

The abnormalities affect a variety of anterior segment tissues including the drainage structures of the iridocorneal angle and are similar to those reported in human patients with ASD and glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The absence of detectable <italic>Bmp4</italic> expression in the drainage structures suggests that BMP4 produced by the ciliary body and/or iris may act as a growth and differentiation factor during angle development. The drainage structures were often hypoplastic with little extracellular matrix. The defects in <italic>Bmp4</italic> mutant mice may involve abnormal cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, and/or delayed or abnormal differentiation of mesenchymal cells in the iridocorneal angle, including decreased production of ECM. All of these processes can be regulated by ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] raising the possibility that BMP4 regulates the production and/or organization of ECM, and that the ECM abnormalities lead to or exacerbate the developmental defects. Alternatively, BMP4 may direct expression of cell surface receptors that participate in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions affecting both cell migration and ECM composition and/or affecting cell fate.</p><p>The nature and variability of anterior segment phenotypes of <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> heterozygotes resemble those we reported in mice with dominant mutations in the forkhead box genes <italic>Foxc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc2</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, the <italic>Bmp4</italic> haploinsufficient phenotype is typically more severe. The phenotypic variability both between and within the eyes of genetically uniform mice with <italic>Bmp4</italic> or <italic>Foxc</italic> gene mutations indicates that stochastic developmental events are important in determining the phenotypic outcome. The possible nature of these stochastic events was previously discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Elevated intraocular pressure is caused by extensive angle dysgenesis</title><p>In humans with ASD, the phenotype is variable even between patients with mutations in the same gene, and the severity of clinically observable dysgenesis does not correlate with IOP. The etiology of IOP elevation is not well defined. Different <italic>Bmp4</italic> heterozygotes had high, low or normal IOP. Although <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> eyes of each IOP class had some degree of drainage structure abnormalities, only eyes with severe drainage structure abnormalities extending over 80% or greater of the analyzed locations had high IOP. The requirement for extensive iridocorneal angle damage for IOP elevation agrees closely with independent estimates from studies of human patients with angle recession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Ocular trauma can damage the iris and drainage structures in the angle in a manner that is clinically obvious since the iris tissue recedes posteriorly from its normal position. Patients in whom the angle recession extends for 240 to 360 degrees of the angle circumference (67 to 100%) frequently develop elevated IOP and glaucoma whereas patients with less extensive damage typically do not have high IOP, although their risk of progressing to glaucoma is increased. The major difference in most <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> eyes with low IOP was the presence of severe dysgenesis of the ciliary body that was likely to severely decrease aqueous humor production. Less obvious abnormalities in ciliary body tissues may also affect IOP by altering the volume or composition of the aqueous humor produced and possibly by altering the drainage structures in a paracrine fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus, more subtle metabolic abnormalities in the ciliary body may interact with the iridocorneal angle phenotypic variation and contribute to variability in IOP elevation between human patients.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Bmp4</italic> affects retinal vascular development and hyaloid vascular involution</title><p><italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> heterozygotes have abnormally arranged retinal blood vessels and abnormal persistence of the hyaloid vasculature. In wild type mice, the absolute number of hyaloid vessels actively decreases between P4 and P10 and all vessels disappear by P30. Elimination of the hyaloid vessels proceeds by programmed cell death in both human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and mouse eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, this death of endothelial cells and pericytes does not occur in the absence of macrophages. If macrophages are eliminated with toxic liposomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or in transgenic mice expressing diphtheria toxin from a macrophage specific transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], there is persistence of the pupillary and hyaloid vessels. The failure of capillary regression in the liposome-treated mice can be "rescued" by anterior chamber injection of exogenous bone marrow-derived macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In agreement with these findings, we observed that absence of macrophages in the vitreous of <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice is associated with persistence of these vessels. Additional studies are needed to determine how BMP4 affects the presence of the ocular macrophages required for vascular involution and if BMP4 affects the production of trophic factors or affects the macrophages themselves.</p></sec><sec><title>BMP4 has important roles in retinal and optic nerve formation</title><p>Vertebrate retinal development is an intricate process involving complex pathways that are not completely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Although our cell marker analysis indicates that all major retinal cell types differentiate, haploinsufficiency of BMP4 results in a variety of retinal abnormalities. The inner retina is the most severely affected with substantially reduced cell numbers in both the retinal ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer of nearly all <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice on the B6 genetic background. Although elevated IOP likely results in inner retinal cell death in glaucoma, deficiency of inner retinal cells in <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> heterozygotes is at least partly a developmental phenomenon. It does not correlate with IOP, being present in both high and normal IOP eyes. Cell numbers are reduced even in eyes of very young mice, and the phenotype is not obviously worse in old mice. Pressure induced cell death may occur, but the wide variability in severity between eyes may have hidden an effect of high IOP on cell survival.</p><p>The optic nerve did not develop normally and appeared to completely lack neural tissue in most B6 <italic>Bmp4</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. The nerve fiber layer, composed of retinal ganglion cell axons was not evident even adjacent to the scleral foramen where it is normally substantially thickened due to axon convergence on the optic nerve. Further experiments are necessary to determine if BMP4 modulates retinal ganglion cell axon sprouting, elongation, targeting or maintenance, or if BMP4 regulates events in optic nerve glia that affect these processes. BMPs have been implicated in neuronal maturation and axonal targeting. Exogenous BMP7 enhances dendrite but not axon growth in embryonic rat sympathetic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Overexpression studies suggest a link between <italic>Bmp4</italic> and axonal targeting of ganglion cells. Ectopic BMP4 can lead to the upregulation of <italic>Tbx5</italic> in the retina, and <italic>Tbx5</italic> misexpression results in altered retinal ganglion cell axon projections to the tectum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to the inner retinal layers, the photoreceptor layer typically appeared normal. At some locations, however, there was retinal dysplasia or disorganization of photoreceptor position. Retinal dysplasia is characterized by palisading outer retinal cells that surround a central lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. It occurs in mice with a variety of genetic defects and in some instances is associated with abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Both during development and in adult life, the retinal pigment epithelium is critical to retinal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. BMP2 and 4 may act as negative growth regulators in the retinal pigment epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. It is possible that haploinsufficiency of BMP4 in the retinal pigment epithelium may be responsible for focal retinal dysplasia and displacement of photoreceptor nuclei.</p></sec><sec><title>Modifiers and candidate genes</title><p>As shown here, haploinsufficiency of BMP4 causes a variety of ocular abnormalities that are strongly influenced by strain-specific modifier genes. Identification of the genetic modifiers that alter these phenotypes may provide an important route to understanding the cellular and genetic interactions underlying various developmental processes involving BMP4.</p><p>BMPs interact with target cells through a heteromeric complex of type I and type II transmembrane receptors, coupled to an intracellular downstream pathway that includes Smad transcription factors. The activity of this BMP signaling pathway can be modulated <italic>in vivo</italic> by several different mechanisms. For example, in the extracellular environment numerous antagonists can bind to BMPs and inhibit their interaction with receptors (e.g. noggin, chordin, twisted gastrulation), while dominant negative receptor molecules (e.g. Bambi) and inhibitory Smads (e.g. Smad 6 and 7) interfere with signaling at the cellular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].
