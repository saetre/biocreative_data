In this study, we provide further evidence, using cell-free assays, that the BH3 domain of Puma binds Bax at an activation site that comprises the first helix of Bax. We also show that, in yeast, Puma interacts with Bax and triggers its killing activity when Bcl-2 homologues are absent but not when Bcl-xL is expressed. Finally, endogenous Puma is involved in the apoptotic response of human colorectal cancer cells to the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-737, even in conditions where the expression of Mcl-1 is down-regulated. Thus, Puma is competent to trigger Bax activity by itself, thereby promoting cellular dependence on prosurvival Bcl-2 family members.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a major role in regulating apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Cory, 2007</xref>). Mammalian antiapoptotic members include Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 and display sequence conservation throughout four Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1&#x02013;4). They oppose the multidomain proapoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bak, which share BH1, -2, and -3 in common with Bcl-2, and the BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bid, Bim, Puma [p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis], Bad, and Noxa; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puthalakath and Strasser, 2002</xref>). The resistance of murine cells lacking both Bax and Bak to cell death induction by multiple stimuli, including to BH3-only proteins, implies that antiapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues favor survival by antagonizing the recruitment by death signals and/or the activity of Bax/Bak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Cory, 2007</xref>). This prosurvival activity relies in great part on the ability of Bcl-2 homologues to engage the BH3 domains of Bax, Bak, or BH3-only proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petros et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms through which Bcl-2 homologues allow survival is linked to those through which BH3-only proteins induce apoptosis upstream of Bax/Bak.</p><p>One model for BH3-induced apoptosis proposes that releasing Bax/Bak from survival Bcl-2 homologues is sufficient to promote cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Willis et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Cory, 2007</xref>). This is achieved when the BH3-binding sites of diverse Bcl-2 homologues, which slightly differ in structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petros et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Certo et al., 2006</xref>), are occupied by promiscuous BH3-only proteins (such as Bid, Bim, or Puma) or by the combination of more selective ones (such as Bad or Noxa). This model does not fully integrate the notion that native Bax is essentially inert and that substantial conformational changes are required for this protein to kill cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lalier et al., 2007a</xref>): induction of Bax-dependent apoptosis must rely on some Bax-activating signals. Another model for BH3-induced apoptosis proposes that such signals are provided by some BH3-only proteins: death agonists such as Bid, Bim, and possibly Puma harbor a BH3 domain that can promote ligand-induced activation of Bax, and other survival antagonist BH3-only proteins (Bad and Noxa) allow this process to occur by preventing Bcl-2 homologues to sequester death agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuwana et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Letai, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartron et al., 2004a</xref>). The validity of this model has also been discussed, as it has been difficult to demonstrate the interaction between endogenous purported death agonist BH3-only proteins and Bax during the course of cell death.</p><p>Whether certain BH3-only proteins are factors that, independently from antiapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues, prime cells to Bax-dependent cell death is a key question regarding the biology of human cancer cells because (a) the apoptotic response of these cells, including to BH3-only proteins, generally depends in great part on Bax and much less on Bak to be efficient and (b) Bcl-2 homologues are highly expressed in these cells and contribute to their aberrant survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Letai, 2008</xref>). These data, together with the recent development of a small molecule inhibitor of the BH3-binding activity of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 (ABT-737; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oltersdorf et al., 2005</xref>), make timely the identification of proteins that contribute to induction of cell death induced by inhibition of Bcl-2 homologues.</p><p>Puma is an essential mediator of p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeffers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Villunger et al., 2003</xref>). We showed that Puma, and its BH3 domain in particular, might promote ligand-induced activation of Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartron et al., 2004a</xref>). This has been debated since then (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Certo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Willis et al., 2007</xref>), even though recent evidence has suggested that Puma is a potent activator of cellular Bax and might function downstream of survival antagonist BH3-only proteins Bad and Noxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we have analyzed the nature of the interaction between the BH3 domain of Puma and Bax, and we have investigated whether Puma exerts a Bax-activating function independently from Bcl-2 homologues and whether, consistently, Puma plays an active role when death is triggered in human cancer cells by inhibition of these survival proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>The BH3 domain of Puma physically and functionally interacts with Bax</title><p>We previously identified Puma as a binding partner of the first &#x003b1; helix of Bax (Bax H&#x003b1;1; residues 20&#x02013;37) from a bacterial two-hybrid screen, and subsequent two-hybrid assays showed that the sole BH3 region of Puma (residues 127&#x02013;150) interacts with Bax H&#x003b1;1 and full-length Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartron et al., 2004a</xref>). To investigate whether Puma BH3 can interact with cellular Bax, we used a biotinylated 24-mer peptide (Biot-Puma<sup>BH3</sup>) that encompasses this domain. Pull-down assays after incubation of 1 &#x000b5;M Biot-Puma<sup>BH3</sup> with 500-&#x000b5;g lysates from glioblastoma cells expressing endogenous Bax (Bax-expressing glioblastoma multiforme [GBM; BeGBM]) showed that this peptide bound to endogenous Bcl-xL and also to Bax. Both interactions were inhibited by an excess of nonbiotinylated peptide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809153/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). In the absence of competing peptide, &#x0223c;2% of the initial Bax and 10% of initial Bcl-xL were pulled down by Biot-Puma<sup>BH3</sup> (unpublished data).</p><p>In two-hybrid assays, the interaction between Puma (or its sole BH3 domain) and Bax (or its first &#x003b1; helix) is prevented by the alteration within Bax of an aspartate at position 33 (i.e., in the C-terminal end of Bax H&#x003b1;1) into an Ala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartron et al., 2004a</xref>). To confirm a role for this residue in the interaction of cellular Bax with Puma BH3, we used cell lysates made from originally Bax-deficient GBM (BdGBM) cells that were engineered to express wild-type Bax, the BaxD33A variant, or the BH3-mutated BaxK64A variant as a control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartron et al., 2004a</xref>). Wild-type Bax and BaxK64A but not BaxD33A were pulled down by Biot-Puma<sup>BH3</sup> despite the comparable expression of each protein in the lysates used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Thus, D33 is involved in the interaction of Puma BH3 with Bax. Incidentally, this also demonstrates the specificity of the interaction evaluated by this pull-down assay.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Role of the C-terminal end of Bax H&#x003b1;1 in the interaction of Bax with the BH3 domain of Puma.</bold> (A) Interaction of cellular Bax with a Puma BH3 peptide. Lysates from BdGBM(Bax-&#x003b1;), BdGBM(BaxD33A), and BdGBM(BaxK64A) cells expressing comparable amounts of Bax were used. Bax molecules pulled down from these lysates by biotinylated Puma<sup>BH3</sup> were evaluated by Western blotting.

Interaction of biotinylated Puma<sup>BH3</sup> with nitrocellulose membranes, on which were spotted 48 12-mer peptides covering the indicated sequence of Bax, was analyzed as described in Materials and methods. The top panel shows one representative autoradiogram. Peptides range from A1, which is the 12-mer peptide encompassing residues 1&#x02013;12, to B24, which is the 12-mer peptide encompassing residues 95&#x02013;106.

This approach helped to define the molecular motifs involved in the interaction between Bax and its mitochondrial receptor, TOM22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellot et al., 2007</xref>). It was based on the use of nitrocellulose membranes on which 12-mer peptides, overlapping by 10 residues and covering the sequence of Bax comprised between residues 1&#x02013;106, are covalently bound. Membranes were incubated with Biot-Puma<sup>BH3</sup>, and the presence of peptides bound to each Bax peptide was revealed using avidin-coupled peroxidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Peptides comprising residues 25&#x02013;36, 27&#x02013;38, and 29&#x02013;40, which are located in the C-terminal end of Bax H&#x003b1;1, were strongly labeled by Biot-Puma<sup>BH3</sup>. Another region, which encompasses residues 89&#x02013;100 and map to Bax H&#x003b1;4, showed some, albeit weaker, interaction with Biot-Puma<sup>BH3</sup>, but most other peptides exhibited no detectable interaction. Collectively, these data reveal a preferential interaction between Puma BH3 and the C-terminal end of Bax H&#x003b1;1.</p><p>The aforementioned Puma BH3&#x02013;Bax H&#x003b1;1 interaction recalls our previous study showing that a peptide encompassing the first helix of Bax (H&#x003b1;1<sup>Bax</sup>) could prevent the interaction between Puma and in vitro&#x02013;translated Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartron et al., 2004a</xref>). Likewise, an excess of this 20-mer peptide but not that of a mutant peptide bearing the D33A mutation prevented the interaction between Biot-Puma<sup>BH3</sup> and cellular Bax in pull-down assays (Fig. S1 B). We inferred from Pepscan analysis that contiguous residues at the C-terminal end of Bax H&#x003b1;1 might suffice to interact with the Puma BH3 domain and that a shorter peptide encompassing these residues might also prevent the interaction between Puma BH3 and cellular Bax. Thus, we analyzed the effects of a 7-mer peptide (H&#x003b1;1 C terminus [H&#x003b1;1-Cter]; residues 31&#x02013;37) in pull-down assays. 10 &#x000b5;M of this peptide inhibited the interaction between Biot-Puma<sup>BH3</sup> and Bax from BeGBM lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Of note, it also inhibited the ability of Biot-Puma<sup>BH3</sup> to interact with Bax present in the cytosolic fraction of immortalized rat fibroblasts, whereas a mutant 7-mer peptide carrying the D33A mutation or other 7-mer peptides comprising adjacent residues 25&#x02013;31 or residues 92&#x02013;98 did not (unpublished data).</p><p>We used H&#x003b1;1-Cter as a tool to investigate whether the interaction of Puma BH3 with Bax accounts for the ability of the former to promote the activity of the latter. We have shown that Puma<sup>BH3</sup> can induce an apoptotic-like change of conformation in in vitro&#x02013;translated Bax and trigger its mitochondrial activity, whereas nonactivator peptides such as Bad<sup>BH3</sup> do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartron et al., 2004a</xref>). In dose-response experiments, we detected no differences between the efficiency of Puma<sup>BH3</sup> and that of other purported activator BH3 peptides (such as Bid<sup>BH3</sup>) to impact on Bax conformation and activity (Fig. S1 C). H&#x003b1;1-Cter inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, this cell-free effect of Puma<sup>BH3</sup> on Bax, indicating that it relies on a physical interaction between the two molecules (Fig. S1 D). The reason why an impact of Puma<sup>BH3</sup> on Bax activity has been difficult to detect in other cell-free systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuwana et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Certo et al., 2006</xref>) remains to be elucidated. In an integrated approach to measure Bax apoptogenicity, we also measured induction of cell death by the microinjection of recombinant Bax, which had been preincubated with various peptides. Experiments were performed in human glioblastoma cells in which Bax expression was selectively knocked down by RNA interference (GBM shBax; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manero et al., 2006</xref>) to avoid interference of endogenous Bax. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cartron et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2004a</xref>), 100 nM Puma<sup>BH3</sup> only induced weak, background cell death 6 h after its microinjection in GBM shBax, whereas it induced significant cell death amounts in control cells (GBM scramble [scr]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Although microinjection of 100 nM recombinant Bax by itself was mostly inefficient at inducing cell death in GBM shBax cells, microinjection of 100 nM Bax that had been preincubated with 100 nM Puma<sup>BH3</sup> (for 60 min at 37&#x000b0;C) did promote significant cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). The ability to trigger Bax induction of cell death was also found for Bid<sup>BH3</sup>, but it was not observed for Bad<sup>BH3</sup> (Fig. S1 E), indicating that this short-term system assays the apoptogenicity of the injectate at the time of microinjection. H&#x003b1;1-Cter diminished the ability of Puma<sup>BH3</sup> to promote cell death in Bax-expressing, GBM scr cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Moreover, when this peptide was added to Puma<sup>BH3</sup> before incubation with recombinant Bax and microinjection in GBM shBax cells, no significant cell death could be detected, indicating that enhancement of Bax activity by Puma<sup>BH3</sup> was inhibited by H&#x003b1;1-Cter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Importantly, when H&#x003b1;1-Cter was added to the microinjection preparation after Bax had been incubated with Puma<sup>BH3</sup>, the resulting mixture proved as efficient at inducing cell death in GBM shBax cells as the mixture without H&#x003b1;1-Cter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, in this system, H&#x003b1;1-Cter exerts an inhibitory effect during the incubation of Puma<sup>BH3</sup> with Bax, but it has no effect on the cell response to the mixture. In contrast, recombinant Bcl-xL prevented Puma<sup>BH3</sup> activation of Bax when added not only before but also after incubation of the peptide with Bax, supporting the idea that Bcl-xL can exert control over both ligand-induced Bax activation and Bax activity (Fig. S1 F). Importantly, microinjected H&#x003b1;1-Cter also prevented induction of cell death by overexpression of Puma in GBM cells, and Puma-dependent induction of cell death by Adriamycin in HCT116 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809153/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). These observations, together with our previous study showing that ectopic wild-type Bax-&#x003b1; or BaxK64A but not ectopic BaxD33A restores the sensitivity of Bax-deficient glioblastoma cells to Puma and Puma<sup>BH3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartron et al., 2002</xref>), are in strong agreement with the notion that the interaction of Puma BH3 with Bax H&#x003b1;1 enhances Bax activity and promotes cell death.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Functional cooperation between Puma<sup>BH3</sup> and Bax.</bold> The indicated GBM cells were microinjected with combinations of 100 nM Puma<sup>BH3</sup>, 1 &#x000b5;M H&#x003b1;1-Cter, and/or 100 nM recombinant Bax together with a fluorescent microinjection marker (0.5% FITC&#x02013;dextran 40S).

We checked that the knockdown of Puma expression in control HCT116 cells by RNA interference conferred resistance to ABT-737&#x02013;induced caspase 3 activation and cell death (Fig. S3, B and C). Notably, the resistance of Puma knockdown cells was not as marked as that of Puma knockout cells, suggesting that the remaining levels of Puma in the knockdown cells could still mediate ABT-737&#x02013;induced cell death. Microinjection of H&#x003b1;1-Cter peptide into control HCT116 cells significantly inhibited ABT-737 induction of cell death (Fig. S3 D), further supporting the notion that Puma is involved in this process. RNA interference experiments and microinjection assays using H&#x003b1;1-Cter also showed that endogenous Puma contributes to the apoptotic response of primary GBM cells to ABT-737 (Fig. S3, E&#x02013;G).</p><p>To analyze whether Puma was involved in long-term effects of ABT-737 on cell growth, control, <italic>Puma<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, and <italic>Bax<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> HCT116 cells were seeded at a low density and treated for 2 wk with 1&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M ABT-737 before visualization of viable clones.

We used a recombinant lentivirus that expresses GFP together with a short hairpin RNA targeting Bcl-xL (shBcl-xL) and infection conditions that lead to a profound loss of Bcl-xL expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Under these conditions, Bcl-xL knockdown induced the appearance of a significant number of cells with active caspase 3 2 d after infection and massive cell death 3 d after infection in control cells, whereas infection with a control (scr) lentivirus had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>).

Of note, a recombinant lentivirus targeting Bcl-2 had a strikingly weaker effect on cell viability than the shBcl-xL lentivirus, but its feeble effect was also Puma dependent (unpublished data). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> suggests that cell death induced by Bcl-xL knockdown in control cells may be slowed down by the unexpected ability of this knockdown to decrease Puma expression. The mechanism involved, which was also detected in Bax-deficient cells, remains to be characterized. It should also be noted that knockdown of Bcl-xL in control cells provoked the apparition of a truncated form of Bax of an apparent molecular mass of 18 kD. This may be a consequence of the induction of cell death, as this truncation, which has been reported in many cases of apoptosis induction and results in the removal of Bax H&#x003b1;1 from the rest of the molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cartron et al., 2004b</xref>), was not observed in Puma-deficient cells. In all cases, the view that emerges from these assays is that Bcl-xL acts in an ABT-737&#x02013;sensitive manner to counteract a constitutive Puma-related death signal.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Role of endogenous Puma in the induction of apoptotic cell death by down-regulation of Bcl-xL in human cancer colorectal cells.</bold> (A) Expression of Bcl-2 family members in HCT116-derived cell lines after down-regulation of Bcl-xL.

Thus, the involvement of Puma in the aforementioned deleterious effects of ABT-737 may rely on the ability of this protein to counteract Mcl-1 rather than on its ability to activate Bax directly. We analyzed whether Puma was still involved in the induction of death by ABT-737 in cells devoid of Mcl-1. Because we were unable to produce a lentivirus construct that would significantly knock down Mcl-1 in HCT116 cells, we used a previously published procedure in which siRNAs targeting Mcl-1 were transiently transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maiuri et al., 2007</xref>).

Thus, Puma still exerts proapoptotic activity when Mcl-1 is down-regulated and Bcl-xL is inhibited.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Role of Mcl-1 in Puma-dependent apoptosis induced by ABT-737.</bold> (A and B) Down-regulation of Mcl-1.

This puts forth the notion that Mcl-1 regulates ABT-737&#x02013;induced cell death in great part in these cells by antagonizing Puma. It implies that Puma exerts proapoptotic activity that is efficient in the absence of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 and that is restrained by these proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-xL enhances interactions between endogenous Puma and Bax</title><p>The aforementioned experiments show that the ability of Puma to mediate cell death induced by ABT-737&#x02013;mediated Bcl-xL inhibition is independent from Mcl-1. They favor the notion that a direct interaction between Puma and Bax would be involved in this cell death process. We analyzed the effects of ABT-737 on intermolecular interactions between endogenous Bcl-xL, Bax, and Puma by coimmunoprecipitation experiments using lysates from cells treated with 1 &#x000b5;M ABT-737, which is an experimental condition that does not trigger major cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, such treatment almost completely abolished the interactions between Bcl-xL and Bax in control cells. This was also the case in <italic>Puma<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). This indicates that inhibition of Bax&#x02013;Bcl-xL interactions is not an indirect consequence of cell death induction. It implies that the role of Puma in ABT-737 activity is not to allow this compound to disrupt Bax&#x02013;Bcl-xL complexes and, conversely, that disruption of Bax&#x02013;Bcl-xL complexes that preexist in <italic>Puma<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells is insufficient to promote full-blown apoptosis. In control cells, ABT-737 also disrupted the interactions between Puma and Bcl-xL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Most notably, coimmunoprecipitation showed that some interaction between Puma and Bax occurred in untreated cells and that it was enhanced by ABT-737 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Thus, ABT-737 treatment frees both Bax and Puma from Bcl-xL and allows these two proteins to interact substantially. Collectively, these assays suggest that the BH3-binding activity of Bcl-xL maintains survival by preventing Puma and Bax to interact with each other. Because some interaction was detected between Puma and Bax in viable cells, Bcl-xL may also protect cells from the consequence of these interactions.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of ABT-737 on intermolecular interactions involving Bax, Bcl-xL, and Puma.</bold> (A) Interactions between Bcl-xL and Bax or Puma.

Analysis of Bax activation by truncated Bid in model assays has put forth the notion that Bax activation is a stepwise mechanism that relies on a series of reversible binding interactions with different rates initiated by transient events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lovell et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, an initiating interaction between Bax and an activating BH3 domain may be elusive because of its fugacious nature and because of its potent inhibition by BH3-binding Bcl-2 homologues, which maintain cell survival. Thus, our analysis of a physical and functional interaction between Puma and Bax was focused on the definition of molecular motifs involved in this interaction and on the investigation of its consequences in cellular contexts in which Bcl-2 homologues are absent and/or inhibited.</p><p>We recently found that Puma could interact with the first &#x003b1; helix of Bax and then showed that Puma or its BH3 domain could promote Bax interaction with mitochondria in cell-free assays and trigger its proapoptotic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartron et al., 2004a</xref>). The evidence provided in this study suggests that the latter effect involves, at least in part, a physical interaction between the BH3 domain of Puma and Bax, as the enhancement of Bax activity by Puma<sup>BH3</sup> is prevented by a minimal peptide that prevents this physical interaction. This peptide was designed from a Pepscan analysis, which further substantiated our previous description of an interaction between Bax H&#x003b1;1 and Puma BH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartron et al., 2004a</xref>) and underscored the role of the C-terminal end of Bax H&#x003b1;1 in this interaction. Our analysis also hinted to a possible interaction between Puma<sup>BH3</sup> and Bax H&#x003b1;4, which is close to the Bax BH1 domain that was initially suggested to play a role in an interaction with Bid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 1996</xref>). However, a 7-mer peptide comprising residues 92&#x02013;98 (within Bax H&#x003b1;4) proved insufficient to prevent Puma BH3&#x02013;Bax interactions in pull-down assays (unpublished data). The roles of other regions within Bax in its interaction with Puma also require further elucidation. In particular, a recent study published after submission of this manuscript shows that not only residues in Bax H&#x003b1;1 but also residues in Bax H&#x003b1;6 might be critically involved in ligand-induced activation of Bax by a stabilized Bim BH3 peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gavathiotis et al., 2008</xref>). In our study, because Pepscan analysis using biotinylated Puma BH3 and peptides covering the sequence of Bax between residue 107 and residue 194 did not yield any significant result (unpublished data), we currently do not know whether, or which, additional regions in Bax might be involved in its interaction with Puma BH3. The involvement of regions other than the BH3 domain of Puma in the interaction between Puma and Bax has also been suggested by a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yee and Vousden, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In the native conformation of Bax, Bax H&#x003b1;1 is in the vicinity of Bax H&#x003b1;2, which contains the BH3 domain. Moreover, a salt bridge formed between D33 within the C-terminal end of Bax H&#x003b1;1 and K64 within the BH3 domain participates in the maintenance of Bax in an inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cartron et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that an intermolecular interaction between Puma BH3 and Bax H&#x003b1;1 might help to initiate an unfolding of the Bax molecule. This process, which could also play a role in Bax activation by Bim, as Bax H&#x003b1;1 is also involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gavathiotis et al., 2008</xref>), might allow the complete activation of Bax to occur, possibly in combination with additional amplificatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lakhani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>). It should be noted that Bax H&#x003b1;1 might be involved in other protein&#x02013;protein interactions engaged by Bax such as that with TOM22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellot et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, Puma and Bax may end up in distinct protein complexes during the course of cell death. This aspect is reminiscent of what was reported for the Bid&#x02013;Bax interplay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grinberg et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Yeast cells, which express no recognized Bcl-2 family proteins, tolerate the heterologous expression of wild-type, untagged Bax but undergo mitochondrial permeabilization and cell death when expressing constitutively active variants of Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arokium et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the fact that, in this paradigm, Puma physically interacts with Bax and switches on its killing activity by a Bax H&#x003b1;1&#x02013;, Bcl-xL&#x02013;sensitive process strongly underscores the potency of Puma to initiate Bax activation by itself. The ability of Puma to activate Bax in yeast is reminiscent of a similar effect recently reported for the short form of Bim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber et al., 2007</xref>). This work implies that the interaction of Bim with mitochondria is critical and that mechanisms other than protein&#x02013;protein interactions could be at stake. Bax-activating signals can be provided by nonfamily proteins or nonproteinaceous factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuwana et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lalier et al., 2007b</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that Puma may have an impact on such mechanisms, having an effect that, added to its ability to interact with Bax, will lead to efficient cell death. As we observed that, in yeast cells, Puma is essentially cytosolic (unpublished data), such additional signals would rely on different molecular mechanisms than those proposed for Bim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber et al., 2007</xref>). Because expression of cytosolic Puma leads to an accumulation of Bax at the mitochondria in yeast (unpublished data), the yeast system argues for a &#x0201c;touch and go&#x0201d; type of interaction between Puma and Bax.</p><p>A genuine activator BH3-only protein is expected to play an active role when mammalian cell death is induced by inhibition of Bcl-2 homologues. Along this line, it is important to note that endogenous Puma is involved in efficient induction of apoptosis in HCT116 cells by the small compound ABT-737. Although other death agonist BH3-only proteins might be mediators of ABT-737&#x02013;induced cell death in certain cell systems (most notably Bim; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Gaizo Moore et al., 2007</xref>), knockdown of Bim and Bid expression in HCT116 cells had no detectable impact on ABT-737&#x02013;induced cell death (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809153/DC1">Fig. S4 A</ext-link>), implying that Puma's role in this case is not upstream of these proteins. Likewise, down-regulation of Bak had no detectable effect on ABT-737 induction of cell death in the same cells (Fig. S4 B), suggesting that this protein is also dispensable for this process and underlining the major role played by the Puma&#x02013;Bax axis. Most importantly, Puma is involved in ABT-737&#x02013;induced cell death even in conditions under which Mcl-1 expression is down-regulated, and, on a molecular level, ABT-737 treatment enhances Bax&#x02013;Puma interactions at the same time as it prevents the interaction of each of these proteins with Bcl-xL. These observations support the notion that Puma is a death agonist BH3-only protein that, as such, provides a tonic death signal that the combined BH3-binding activities of Bcl-2 homologues will have to continuously counterbalance to maintain survival.</p><p>This notion is best exemplified by our observation that although Puma or Bax knockout cells tolerate Bcl-xL down-regulation, control HCT116 cells undergo massive cell death after such down-regulation. Compared with Bcl-xL down-regulation, Bcl-2 down-regulation (unpublished data) and Mcl-1 down-regulation (at the very least in the experimental conditions used) only had a modest effect on the viability of HCT116 cells. This indicates that Bcl-xL is more critically involved in maintaining the survival of these cells than its homologues. The reason for this apparent selectivity is unclear, but, strikingly, it recalls a previous study that showed that Bcl-xL much more potently prevents Puma function than Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ming et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, low levels of Puma appear sufficient to prime cells to death and lock them in a Bcl-xL&#x02013;dependent state. Thus, when Puma expression is increased, it is possible that its accumulation in complexes with Bcl-xL (and thus the ability of additional Puma molecules to interact with Bcl-xL) may play a significant role in Puma-dependent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chipuk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ming et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yee and Vousden, 2008</xref>). Another implication is that Puma may exert a proapoptotic function that will be lost only when its expression is completely abrogated. This may explain differences found between experiments that, albeit performed similarly, used Puma knockout versus Puma knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Willis et al., 2007</xref>). It is also noteworthy that Puma knockout HCT116 cells still show some response to ABT-737. Thus, Puma expression may not be an absolute requirement for induction of cell death by Bcl-xL inhibition. Along this line, it is important to note that we have shown that survival antagonist BH3 domains could promote the release of active Bax from Bcl-xL by themselves, implying that sensitizer molecules can launch a Bax-dependent apoptotic program without additional Bax-activating signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moreau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cartron et al., 2005</xref>). The ability of ABT-737 to displace Bax from Bcl-xL in Puma-deficient cells may account for the small rates of Bax-dependent cell death we observed in these cells.</p><p>With increasing evidence of secondary effects and possible acquisition of resistance to ABT-737, predictive markers of sensitivity and resistance to this compound are crucial. Puma expression can be driven downstream of diverse tumor suppressor and/or oncogenic pathways because Puma is a direct transcription target of p53, p73, Foxo3A, and E2F-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakano and Vousden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hershko and Ginsberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">You et al., 2006</xref>). Our results suggest that these pathways might install some sensitivity to wide-range or selective inhibitors of Bcl-2 homologues in cancer cells. Conversely, posttranslational mechanisms that negatively regulate Puma activity and allow cells to accumulate this protein without undergoing cell death are expected to promote resistance against such inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and cell lines</title><p>BdGBM and BeGBM cells were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cartron et al., 2003</xref>).
