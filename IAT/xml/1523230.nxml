The base consists of six AAA-ATPase subunits, Rpt1&#x02013;Rpt6, and four non-ATPase subunits, Rpn1, Rpn2, Rpn10, and Rpn13.

The lid is composed of nine non-ATPase subunits: Rpn3, Rpn5&#x02013;Rpn9, Rpn11, Rpn12, and Sem1.

The CSN contains eight core subunits that assemble into a 450-kDa particle.

High-resolution structural analyses are difficult since the complex is assembled in vivo and different subunits are expected to be dynamic and heterogeneous &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.

Pairwise interactions among the lid subunits have been studied using the yeast two-hybrid system &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b020">20</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Insight into the organization of the lid has also been gleaned from analysis of lid subcomplexes in cells that express mutant forms of specific lid subunits &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. However, a comprehensive model of subunit interactions within the lid has not been proposed, and no distinctive topological features, such as rings or well-defined channels, have been identified. </p><p>In this study, we aim to obtain novel information regarding the structural organization of the 19S lid from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> using both tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of the intact nine-component complex together with chemical cross-linking and MS analysis. It is established that MS and MS/MS can be applied to the study of intact noncovalent complexes, but to date, the majority of examples were of various complexes reconstituted in vitro &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b027">27</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. While some studies have been carried out on complexes isolated directly from cells, including bacterial RNA polymerase &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, ribosomes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, and RNA-processing complexes from yeast &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, existing structural information aided the interpretation of the resulting MS and MS/MS spectra. Here we show that the endogenous wild-type complex can be studied directly, without the need to generate mutants, and the results incorporated with existing yeast two-hybrid data to yield a comprehensive model. This represents a significant advance in MS methodology given the absence of existing high-resolution structural data. Moreover, the fact that all directly or indirectly interacting subunits can be observed within a single spectrum highlights one of the fundamental advantages of our methodology. </p><p>Using this approach the mass spectrum revealed not only the intact complex but also a substoichiometric complex. In addition, we identified the presence of an independent subcomplex containing Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn8, and Rpn9, wherein Rpn8 occupies a central position. We could also demonstrate that Rpn6, Rpn9, and Rpn12 are found on the periphery of the complex. Complementary information from cross-linking approaches enabled us to show that Rpn5 binds to Rpn3. In addition, we could determine that the recently identified lid subunit Sem1 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; binds to both Rpn7 and Rpn3. Taken together, our data allow us to propose a comprehensive model for the subunit organization of the 19S lid that incorporates our findings from MS with those of prior analyses of pairwise interactions. </p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Electrospray Ionization MS and MS/MS of the Intact Lid</title><p>The electrospray mass spectrum of the intact 19S lid isolated from <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Despite the fact that the sample analyzed was the endogenous complex and was not overexpressed, the spectrum is well resolved and has one major series of peaks centered at 8,000 m/z. This major charge state series corresponds to the nine protein components of the lid, demonstrating clearly that all subunits must be interacting, either directly or indirectly, and present at unit stoichiometry. The measured mass of the intact complex is 376,151 &#x000b1; 369 Da ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040267-t001">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, an overlapping less-intense charge state series discerned at 7,750 m/z, indicates the existence of a substoichiometric complex that results from the absence of a subunit from the complex. Calculation of the mass difference of these series indicates a mass that is 50,270 Da less than that of the intact lid. This corresponds to the absence of Rpn6 from the intact lid. The similarity in the number of positive charges between the two complexes suggests that both complexes are present in solution (see below). An additional minor series of peaks is centered at 5,500 m/z. The calculated mass for this lower m/z charge series is 185,556 &#x000b1; 137 Da, indicating that a smaller subcomplex of the lid is also present in solution. </p><p>To probe the composition and subunit organization of the lid we used an MS/MS approach &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. In such experiments, a specific well-defined m/z range that encompasses the parent ion is selected and accelerated through a collision cell at increased argon pressures. This process gives rise to multiple collisions in which the internal energy of the ions is accumulated. When this energy reaches a threshold value, dissociation occurs, yielding product ions. It is established that for noncovalent assemblies, individual highly charged subunits are dissociated from the parent ion, producing &#x0201c;stripped&#x0201d; complexes with lower charge states than the original ion &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b035">35</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. As a consequence, we can distinguish complexes formed in solution from those generated in the gas phase since the former will have charge states commensurate with their mass &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, while those formed in the gas phase will have anomalously low charge states. If we consider the propensity for dissociation of different protein subunits in the gas phase, it is known that under vacuum ionic interactions are enhanced, while hydrophobic interactions are weakened &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. However, we cannot rule out the effect of other factors that govern protein&#x02013;protein interactions such as contact area, planarity, shape complementarity, etc. There is, however, a growing number of studies demonstrating that individual proteins that are expelled during tandem MS are those that are known from high-resolution structures to be more exposed and peripheral, while those at the core of the assembly are retained in the &#x0201c;stripped&#x0201d; complex &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Applying this tandem MS strategy to the 376-kDa lid complex, using a collision cell acceleration voltage of 100 V, five series of ions were formed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). At m/z values below 2,400, two highly charged series are observed. Their measured masses correspond to 45,782 &#x000b1; 4 and 31,796 &#x000b1; 10 Da, in very close agreement with the mass calculated for Rpn9 and Rpn12, respectively. At high m/z values between 10,000 and 18,500 three further charge series are observed. Their masses are consistent with the lid stripped of Rpn9 and/or Rpn12. These results indicate that both Rpn9 and Rpn12 have weaker interactions with other subunits and are peripheral, and hence are first to dissociate. Increasing the collision cell voltage, and hence the internal energy of the lid complex, induces the dissociation of an additional subunit ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The new charge series observed at 2,000&#x02013;2,400 m/z is assigned to Rpn6, and the corresponding stripped complex appears between 13,000 to 17,000 m/z. These results enable us to deduce therefore that Rpn6, Rpn9, and Rpn12 interact weakly and are presumably at the periphery of the lid subcomplex. </p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Tandem Mass Spectrum of the Lid Subcomplex</title><p>In order to examine the composition of the 185-kDa subcomplex observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g001">Figure 1</xref> we again applied MS/MS. A single charge state isolated from this complex and subjected to collision with argon at an accelerating potential of 130 V yielded a well-resolved tandem mass spectrum, despite the low intensity of the subcomplex relative to the intact complex ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Three series of ions are observed at the low m/z region ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). On the basis of their measured masses we assign these species to Rpn5, Rpn6, and Rpn9. Between 8,000 to 16,000 m/z, ions arising from the removal of a single subunit are observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Although Rpn8 and the modified Rpn11 have similar masses, by simulating the charge states based on the known sequence of the subunits we can clearly distinguish between the two possibilities. We could then conclude that Rpn8 and not Rpn11 is a component of the subcomplex. These ions are therefore attributed to three different heterotrimers; Rpn5:6:8, Rpn5:8:9, and Rpn6:8:9. </p><p>Interestingly, while Rpn8 is not detected as an individual subunit, it is present in all three heterotrimers. By extrapolation, therefore, we can conclude that prior to the collisional activation, the subcomplex is a tetramer composed of Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn8, and Rpn9. From the dissociation pattern generated by the MS/MS experiment we can determine that Rpn8 occupies a central position within this subcomplex ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). It is noteworthy that the two charge series assigned to monomeric Rpn9 and its stripped heterotrimer, namely Rpn5:Rpn6:Rpn8, are the most intense series in the spectra. This is further evidence for the ease of dissociation of Rpn9, implying a relatively weak interaction with neighboring subunits. </p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Chemical Cross-Linking Analysis</title><p>The cross-linking agent BS <sup>3</sup> is a bifunctional reagent linking amines, and is selective for the N-terminal amino group and lysine side chains, with an eight-carbon spacer arm of 11.4 &#x000c5;.

The bands were assigned as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040267-t002">Table 2</xref>). As an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g004">Figure 4</xref>B shows part of the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrum of the peptide mixture from band D containing Rpn3, Rpn5, and Rpn8. The inset within the figure illustrates the MS/MS analysis of one of the peptides corresponding to Rpn5. </p><p>Several conclusions can be drawn from the information extracted from the six cross-linked bands. As Sem1 is present in two bands cross-linked with Rpn7 and with Rpn3, we can assume that Sem1 interacts with both subunits. Moreover, due to the small molecular mass of Sem1, it is reasonable to assume that Rpn3 and Rpn7 are in close proximity to one another. In band C, Rpn3 is observed accompanied by Rpn5, and we can therefore conclude that Rpn3 binds to Rpn5. In addition, the subunits identified in bands D and E further confirm the formation of the subcomplex comprising Rpn5, Rpn8, and Rpn9 identified from our intact complex data. For Rpn11 (band F) we can deduce that it binds either directly to Rpn5:9 or is anchored by Rpn3:7 to Rpn5:9. In summary, cross-linking analysis allows determination of four additional interactions within the lid.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We acquired remarkably well-resolved mass spectra of the intact lid from <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> despite the fact that we anticipated that the nine-component endogenous complex would be heterogeneous. From our data we were able to determine the subunit composition of the intact complex, the substoichiometric complexes present in solution, and those generated as a result of our MS/MS approach. Together with chemical cross-linking, our MS approach allowed us to obtain precise additional information regarding the subunit organization of the lid complex. Based on our data we constructed an interaction map of the lid subunits ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We identified a heterotetrameric core structure formed by Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn8, and Rpn9, in which Rpn8 is centered. The absence of Rpn11 from this complex shows that it forms after purification and indicates that it is a stable subcomplex in solution. In addition, we revealed that Sem1 binds to both Rpn7 and Rpn3. Considering the small size of Sem1, we assume that Rpn3 and Rpn7 are also interacting. We could also determine that Rpn3 binds Rpn5. Interestingly, we determined a substoichiometric complex of the lid in which Rpn6 is absent. Close inspection of the spectrum suggests that 20&#x00025;&#x02013;30&#x00025; of the purified lid complexes lack Rpn6. The MS/MS results clearly show that both Rpn9 and Rpn12 and, to a lesser extent, Rpn6, readily dissociate from the lid complex. It is established that the extent of interaction between protein subunits as well as their exposure underlies the release of subunits in tandem MS of heteroligomeric complexes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. This indicates that these subunits are therefore located at the periphery of the complex. Consistent with this, Rpn9 is known to be a nonessential subunit of the lid &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, it has been shown previously that Rpn10, which stabilizes the association of the lid and base, interacts with both Rpn9 and Rpn12 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. This suggests that Rpn9 and Rpn12 are located near the contact surface between the base and the lid. </p><p>A very recent study has shown that an <italic>rpn6</italic> temperature-sensitive mutant grown at restrictive temperatures contained a subcomplex comprising four out of the nine lid components, Rpn5, Rpn8, Rpn9, and Rpn11 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

From our cross-linking data, we could not conclude whether Rpn3:7 or Rpn5:9 were anchored to Rpn11. However the results from the <italic>rpn6</italic> and <italic>rpn7</italic> mutants support the scenario in which Rpn5:9 recruits Rpn11 into the Rpn5:6:8:9:11 subcomplex. In addition, the <italic>rpn7</italic> mutation prevented the incorporation of Rpn3, Rpn7, and Rpn12 into the lid. These results, together with the evidence that Rpn5:6:8:9 exists as a stable independent subcomplex in solution ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g001">Figure 1</xref>), are consistent with the Rpn5:6:8:9 subcomplex forming the scaffolding core of the lid. </p><p>Taking together our data with existing data from analysis of mutants &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; and results of previous two-hybrid analysis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040267-t003">Table 3</xref>), we propose a detailed interaction map ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The fact that all the data could be integrated into a single model increases our confidence in the MS analysis. In the model, two clusters become apparent. The first structural cluster includes Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn8, Rpn9, and Rpn11, in agreement with the cluster suggested previously &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Within the second cluster Rpn3, Rpn7, Rpn12, and Sem1 are included, in accord with recent observations &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. The link between the two subcomplexes is between Rpn5:Rpn3, and not Rpn7 as suggested by the analysis of an <italic>rpn7</italic> mutant &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. These results explain previous observations in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</named-content> that in cells in which <italic>rpn5</italic> is deleted the 26S proteasomes misassemble &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, our structural organization indicates that Rpn11 forms extensive interactions with all three subunits, Rpn5, Rpn8, and Rpn9. Furthermore, in our model Rpn6 is opposite Rpn9 and Rpn12. As these may interact with Rpn10 at the lid&#x02013;base junction, it follows that Rpn6 is exposed to the cellular environment. </p><p>Given the significant genetic similarity shared between the lid and the COP9 signalosome, we investigated their structural homology. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040267-t004">Table 4</xref> summarizes the protein&#x02013;protein interactions identified within the CSN subunits. Out of the 21 interactions detected, nine were observed among the 19S lid complex ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040267-g006">Figure 6</xref>), and eight of the interactions, although not physically recognized, are feasible with our current model, while 4 interactions are not in correspondence with the lid structure. We speculate that the dense web of protein&#x02013;protein interactions detected within the CSN complex could also be due to the tendency of the two-hybrid system to produce false positives &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. However, it is interesting to note that six of the nine similar interactions and two of the eight feasible interactions are found within the Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn8, Rpn9, and Rpn11 cluster. It is also worth noting that a 2-D electron microscopy study &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d; did not deduce a common architecture for the two complexes. However, since both particles have similar sizes, show asymmetric arrangements of their subunits, possess a central channel, and share a large number of similar interactions, the two particles are likely to possess some common structural features. </p><p>The major function of the lid is determined by Rpn11, a specialized isopeptidase that tightly couples the deubiquitination and degradation of substrates &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b005">5</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. So far, no catalytic activity has been described for any other subunit. A recent study suggests that the role of these subunits is of a scaffold for the other binding partners &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, namely Rpn11, and the base subunits as well as the proteolyic substrates and soluble cofactors. Interestingly, Rpn11 is unable to fold as an isolated subunit into a native, active conformation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Neighboring subunit interactions are probably required to position conjugates for cleavage by Rpn11. The multiple protein&#x02013;protein interactions observed in this study for <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> Rpn11 are in accordance with this assumption. </p><p>Given that the only interaction observed linking the two protein clusters in the lid is between Rpn3 and Rpn5, this implies that there is a flexible hinge region which allows movement necessary for productive interaction of substrates with Rpn11. Taking into consideration the fact that Rpn6 is present at substoichiometric amounts, and that Rpn11 forms extensive protein interactions, it is interesting to speculate that after substrate binding, Rpn6 dissociates to expose active Rpn11. Support for our hypothesis comes from the finding that Rpn6 is essential for assembly of the lid; however, <italic>rpn6</italic> mutants do not affect the activity of 26S proteasome after assembly &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. This may imply that Rpn6 acts as a fail-safe mechanism, at least in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> ensuring that active sites are exposed only after assembly is completed. Given the high natural abundance of proteasome particles in the cell and the need to prevent indiscriminate proteolysis of proteins, the masking of active sites before full assembly could be an essential regulatory mechanism. We anticipate that further examination of the levels of Rpn6 within the 19S lid complex will validate this scenario. </p><p>In summary, the results presented here extend significantly previous models based on pairwise interactions and allow interesting comparison with the structure of the signalosome. Our model is consistent with a core assembly of four subunits that provides a scaffold for recruitment of additional subunits. Also apparent from our analysis is the fact that subunits are assembled into two protein clusters, possibly providing a cleft in which a polyubiquitinated substrate can be accommodated. Based on our finding of substoichiometric quantities of Rnp6, and its position within the complex, we speculate that a regulatory mechanism involving dissociation of Rpn6 is responsible for the exposure of the active site of Rpn11. Overall, therefore, the subunit architecture that we have described will not only benefit further structural analysis but has also provided insight into the function and regulation of the 19S lid.</p><p>More generally, the results of this study highlight major advantages over existing approaches for generating interaction maps. For example, it is established that the yeast two-hybrid approach is complicated by the fact that protein interactions are queried pairwise. Interactions of subunits within protein complexes, such as the anaphase-promoting complex, can be underrepresented in two-hybrid datasets because assembly of such complexes may require higher-order interactions between multiple subunits. A second potential problem is that endogenous proteins may facilitate two-hybrid interactions that are not direct, and the presence of endogenous copies of proteins may confuse the analysis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. The other existing approach that has been widely applied is to generate mutants for functional analysis of this complex &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040267-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. This method can also be limited by the availability of appropriate mutants, lack of knowledge about how to generate appropriate mutants, and interpreting the effects of the mutations. The fundamental advantage of our approach is that it is carried out with the wild-type endogenous complex, and heterogeneity and subcomplex formation are immediately apparent from the spectra. Moreover, when combined with gas-phase dissociation we are able to probe the composition of protein subcomplexes and reveal peripheral subunits leading to definition of the structural organization of the complex. The fact that the assembly state of this asymmetric complex, with multiple distinct subunits, can be determined and results incorporated into a comprehensive model highlights the tremendous potential of MS. We anticipate that this approach will be used for determining the organization of many other important cellular complexes for which very little structural data exists. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials.</title><p>Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) (BS <sup>3</sup>) suberimidate was purchased from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, Illinois, United States).

observed between 7,250 and 9,000 m/z, with the most intense peak at &#x02248;8,000 m/z. Well-resolved charge states are observed, and the measured mass confirms the presence of all nine subunits. An overlapping charge series is detected and corresponds to a substoichiometric complex in which the Rpn6 subunit is absent (labeled with asterisks).

Peaks between 12,500&#x02013;17,000 m/z correspond to the loss of Rpn9 (blue squares), while the series at 10,000&#x02013;12,000 m/z correspond to the loss of Rpn12 (red squares). The low intensity charge series at 17,000&#x02013;18,000 m/z indicate the loss of both Rpn9 and Rpn12 (magenta squares). At low m/z 1,000&#x02013;2,400 series of peaks are assigned to individual Rpn9 (blue circles) and Rpn12 (red circles). The data indicate the Rpn9 and Rpn12 have a relatively small contact surface with the other subunits, which implies that they are exposed.</p><p>(B) Increasing the voltage to 120 V induces the dissociation of Rpn6 in addition to Rpn9 and Rpn12. The highly charged Rpn6 series is centered at &#x0223c; 2,200 m/z (green circles), while the remaining stripped complex is observed between 13,000 to 18,000 m/z (green squares). In summary, Rpn9 and Rpn12 are easily dissociated from the lid complex (blue).

By extrapolation we can conclude that the subcomplex is composed of four subunits, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn8, and Rpn9. Rpn8 is not observed in its monomeric form; however, because it exists in all three different hetrotrimers, we can conclude it adopts a central position within the subcomplex.</p><p>(D) A schematic summarizes the structural data obtained from MS and MS/MS results.

Considering the small size of Sem1, it is reasonable to suggest that Rpn3 and Rpn7 are in close proximity. In addition, we could determine that Rpn3 binds to Rpn5.
