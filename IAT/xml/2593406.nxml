We have previously identified a number of mammalian cDNAs capable of suppressing the deleterious effects of Bax expression in yeast. We herein report that one such suppressor, named Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup>, represents the C-terminal 86 amino acids of the previously characterized leucine zipper (LZ) motif-containing transcriptional regulator Tsc22. Employing a genome-wide two-hybrid screen, functional genomics, and deletion mutagenesis approaches, we conclude that Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup>&#x02013;mediated anti-apoptosis is independent of the LZ motif and is likely independent of effects on gene transcription. Rather, a 16-residue sequence within the conserved 56-residue TSC22 domain is necessary for anti-apoptosis. The presence of a similar sequence was used to predict an anti-apoptotic role for two yeast proteins, Sno1p and Fyv10p. Overexpression and knock-out experiments were used to validate this prediction.

Unicellular organisms, such as the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, have also been shown to undergo apoptotic-like programmed cell death (PCD). Although initially controversial, the large and ever increasing body of literature makes it quite clear that yeast undergoes a form of PCD that is similar to the process of mitochondrial or intrinsic apoptotic cell death that occurs in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Madeo <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gourlay &#x00026; Ayscough 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Frohlich <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Yeast undergoing apoptotic like cell death show the typical hallmarks of a mammalian apoptotic cell such as DNA cleavage, chromatin condensation and externalization of phosphatidylserine, as well as an elevated level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These similarities are further evident by the discovery that yeast apoptosis is also regulated by a number of different proteins that have been shown to be important in mammalian apoptosis. Yeast possess an AIF (Apoptosis Inducing Factor; <italic>AIF</italic>), an AMID (AIF-homologous Mitochondrion-associated Inducer of Death; <italic>NDI1</italic>), a caspase (<italic>YCA1</italic>), an IAP (inhibitor of Apoptosis; <italic>BIR1</italic>), an Omi/Htr2A (<italic>NMA111</italic>), a DJ-1 (<italic>HSP31</italic>), as well as a nuclease (<italic>TAT-D</italic>) that is a strong candidate to be involved cell death mediated DNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Frohlich <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Skoneczna <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Analyses of many of these proteins show that they perform similar functions as their metazoan counterparts. For example, it was recently reported that the yeast ortholog of the Omi/Htr2A serine protease (Nma111p) induces apoptosis in part by cleaving yeast Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) Bir1p (Walter <italic>et al</italic>., 2007). Furthermore, overexpression of the yeast pro-apoptotic proteins can serve to initiate or enhance cell death while yeast strains lacking any of these genes show a decrease response to a number of different death stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Madeo <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fahrenkrog <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). In addition to the extensively studied anti-apoptotic regulators, such as anti-oxidant enzymes and heat shock proteins, cells express a range of molecules that serve to prevent apoptosis and other forms of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Reed, 2004</xref>). Given that the biochemical or molecular functions of many anti-apoptotic proteins are not well known, it is probable that much remains to be answered regarding the strategies cells use to counter pro-apoptotic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Reed, 2004</xref>). In addition, the response to oxidative stress is far more pleiotropic than commonly described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Temple <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). For example, as many as 600 different genes have been found to be required for full resistance to oxidative stress while 900 or so genes have been shown to be induced by different stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Winzeler <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gasch <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The process of anti-apoptosis in yeast shows notable similarities to mammalian cells. For example, MAP kinase signalling cascades play important roles in counteracting the effects of ER stress in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hu <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Also, the analysis of the Parkinson&#x02019;s disease associated pre-synaptic protein a-synuclein has been used as a tool to identify novel proteins that can prevent ER stress-mediated cell death in both yeast and metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Zabrocki <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; Grifffioen <italic>et al</italic>., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Witt &#x00026; Flower, 2006</xref>). The ability to screen heterologous libraries to identify suppressors of the Bax-mediated cell death in yeast has also served to shed light on the process of anti-apoptosis. For example, the identification of ROS scavenging proteins as suppressors of the lethal effects of Bax expression clearly implicates the role of ROS in PCD in yeast (Kampris <italic>et al</italic>., 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Moon <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). We have made a concerted effort to study the process of anti-apoptosis in yeast through the identification of a number candidate anti-apoptotic mammalian cDNAs effective in preventing the inhibitory effects of Bax expression in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Khoury <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Khoury <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The identification of sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1), a ceramide-depleting enzyme, as an anti-apoptotic sequence in yeast highlights the central role of sphingolipid metabolism in yeast PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In a previous report, human TSC22 was identified as one of a number of suppressors of Bax-mediated cell death in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). TSC22 was first identified as a 144-residue leucine zipper (LZ) motif-containing protein that is up-regulated by Transforming Growth Factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Shibanuma <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>). &#x02018;TSC22&#x02019; is now a commonly accepted denotation for a LZ motif-containing conserved domain encoded for by a multi-gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fiol <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Although the TSC22 domain is highly conserved between the different TSC22 domain-containing proteins, there appears to be distinct functional differences. For example, some members are pro-apoptotic while others are distinctly anti-apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kawamata <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fiol <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Although yeast does not have a Tsc22 ortholog, we reasoned that its potential anti-apoptotic effects in yeast would likely function by its ability to interact with a LZ transcription factor, reminiscent of the current model for Tsc22 function in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kester <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kawamata <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Here we report that the cDNA encoding the C-terminal TSC22 domain of the human <italic>TSC22-1</italic> gene prevent yeast cell death in response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli including the ROS donor H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Global two-hybrid analysis, the analysis of yeast mutants lacking LZ transcription factors, as well as the analysis of TSC22 deletions were used to demonstrate that the LZ structure of TSC22 is not required for this anti-apoptotic function. Instead our analysis has lead to the identification of a 16 amino acid motif that is required to confer protection against ROS in yeast. The 16 amino acid sequence is present in multiple proteins including 4 different yeast proteins. The demonstration that 2 of these proteins, Sno1p and Fyv10p, are indeed anti-apoptotic suggests that we have uncovered a new motif that confers anti-apoptotic effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="S3"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p id="P5">Strain BY4741 (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> his3&#x00394;1 leu2&#x00394;0 met15&#x00394;0 ura3&#x00394;0) was used as the wild type strain.

The 18 amino acid sequence at the N-terminus of the TSC22 domain that is common to all 3 proteins is encoded by exon 3. All three TSC22 transcripts contain exons 3 and 4. The observed differences between the three TSC22 transcripts are due to alternative splicing of exons 1 and 2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The alternatively spliced variant 3 (TSC22v3) contains exon 2 at its 5&#x02032; end (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This exon contains the predicted translational start site and the unique N-terminus that is present only in the 144 aa Tsc22v3 protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The TSC22v1 mRNA consists of exons 1, 3 and 4 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Exon 1 provides its 5&#x02032; end, the predicted translational start site and the unique N-terminus that is present only in the 742-residue Tsc22v1 protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, the TSC22v2-encoded 585-residue protein is an N-terminally truncated form of the 742-residue TSC22v3 protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The 5&#x02032; end of the TSC22v2 transcript consists of exons 1A and 1B (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These are cryptic exons that are part of the larger exon 1 used to make the 5&#x02032; end of the TSC22v1 transcript. The translational start site used to make the 585-residue TSC22v2 protein is predicted to be at the 5&#x02032; end of exon 1B (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The sizes of the different exons and the sequences of the intron/exon boundaries of the <italic>TSC22</italic> gene were determined by comparing the sequences of the genomic DNA and the sequences of the different cDNAs (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table II</xref>). All the exon/intron boundaries follow the GT/AG rule for splice sites.</p><p id="P17">To confirm that the cDNAs are not artifacts of the cDNA library from which they were cloned and actually represent endogenously expressed transcripts, we performed an RT-PCR analysis of the <italic>TSC22</italic> gene products using primers that recognized both the human- and mouse-encoded transcripts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Three sets of primers were used in order to specifically detect the transcripts. We observed expression of TSC22v3 in a number of mouse tissues with prominent levels of the transcript detected in the heart, lung, spleen, and the cardiac HL-1 cell line (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The TSC22 v1 transcript was also detected in a range of mouse tissues. Due to the lack of unique regions in the v2 transcript with respect to v1, we were unable to ascertain the expression pattern for v2 alone. Nevertheless, we found that v2 is expressed in brain, spleen, kidney, and testis since v1 was not detected in these tissues. We also examined the expression of TSC22-encoded transcripts in human cells. We found readily detectable levels of the v1 and v3 transcripts in HEK293 cells, but were unable to detect expression in cDNA libraries prepared from either human fetal brain or skeletal muscle extracts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). &#x025a1;-actin was detected in all tissues and cells examined and served as a loading control for these studies. This analysis indicates that three <italic>TSC22</italic> gene products are expressed endogenously in a variety of mouse tissues and at least two of these transcripts are expressed in a human cell line.</p><p id="P18">The TSC22 cDNA that we isolated in our Bax suppressor screen, TSC22<sup>(86)</sup>, encodes for the 86 C-terminal residues of Tsc22 that is present in all 3 Tsc22 proteins produced by the alternately spliced <italic>TSC22</italic> gene (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). It consists of the entire 4<sup>th</sup> exon and also contains the 3&#x02032; end of exon 3 that supplies its predicted translational start site (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Given that there is no unique sequence present in the TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> cDNA, we were unable to use RT-PCR to determine if it represents a fourth TSC22 splice variant or if the cDNA represents a truncated version of one of the 3 known TSC22 transcripts. We therefore wondered if the anti-apoptotic effect observed with the expression of TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> is a potential artifact due to the expression of a truncated form of TSC22. We thus sought to determine whether the endogenously expressed TSC-22 gene products could also function to promote cell survival in yeast. Cells transformed with vectors expressing a cDNA encoding the 144-residue Tsc22v3 displayed an enhanced ability to grow, as compared to empty vector-transformed cells, after treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This effect, noted after both a two- and a three-hour treatment, was also observed with cells transformed with a vector expressing a cDNA encoding the 585-residue Tsc22v2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The pro-survival effect was consistently less marked than that conferred by TSC22<sup>(86)</sup>. While we have not compared expression levels, this could explain the differences in the protective effect of the different Tsc22 isoforms. Nevertheless, these observations demonstrate that Tsc22 proteins have a pro-survival effect in yeast.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>The conserved TSC22 domain defines a four-member gene family</title><p id="P19">Analysis of the <italic>TSC22</italic> sequence in GenBank also revealed a large number of human cDNAs that contained regions with high sequence identity to TSC22<sup>(86)</sup>. The highest sequence identity was present in the regions coding for the TSC22 domain. This suggested that the conserved TSC22 domain is part of a multi-gene family. Although most published studies pertaining to Tsc22 refer to the 144-residue product of the TSC22v3 transcript we described in the previous section (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), a level of ambiguity exists in the current literature as to which TSC22 containing gene and which alternatively spliced variant is actually being studied. In order to clearly describe the human gene family and classify the various gene products, we used BLAST to compare the sequences of all the available human cDNAs to the sequence of the human genome. The results of this analysis revealed that there are 4 different human genes containing TSC22 domain-encoding regions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Human <italic>TSC22-2</italic> consists of five exons that are spread over at least 51.1 kb of DNA located on chromosome 3 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Three different transcripts (v1 to v3) that are produced by alternative splicing were identified from the <italic>TSC22-2</italic> gene. Three different proteins all containing the TSC22 domain, ranging in size from 84 to 710 amino acids are also predicted to be produced (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Human <italic>TSC22-3</italic>, which encodes the well-studied GILZ protein (Asselin-Labatt, 2004), also consists of five exons that are spread over at least 62.6 kb of DNA that is located on chromosome X (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Three different transcripts (v1 to v3) that are produced by alternative splicing were identified from the <italic>TSC22-3</italic> gene. Three different proteins all containing the TSC22 domain, ranging in size from 77 to 200 amino acids are also predicted to be produced (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Human <italic>TSC22-4</italic> also consists of five exons that are spread over at least 12.7 Kb of DNA that is located on chromosome 7 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Similar to the other <italic>TSC22</italic> genes, <italic>TSC22-4</italic> is also predicted to generate three different transcripts (v1 to v3) that are produced by alternative splicing. Three different proteins ranging in size from 195 to 395 amino acids are also predicted to be produced (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In contrast to the other three <italic>TSC22</italic> genes, only two of the <italic>TSC22-4</italic> proteins, Tsc22-4v1 and Tsc22-4v3, contain the TSC22 domain. TSC22-4v2 is made up of exons1&#x02013;3 and lacks exons 4 and 5 that encode for the TSC22 domain. It should be noted that the <italic>TSC22-2</italic> and <italic>TSC22-3</italic> genes produce a respective 87 and 77 residue protein that contains the TSC22 domain at their N-terminus, similar to the 86 amino acid protein encoded by our TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> clone. This indicates that the <italic>TSC22-1</italic> gene encoding an 86-residue splice variant would not be unique in this regard and suggests that the TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> may represent a <italic>bona fide</italic> TSC22-1 transcript.</p><p id="P20">The sizes of the different exons and the sequences of the intron/exon boundaries were determined for TSC22-2, -3 and &#x02013;4 by comparing the sequences of the genomic DNA and the sequences of the different cDNAs (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Tables III</xref>, <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">IV</xref> and <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">V</xref>).

Apart from this, the sequence similarity between the four Tsc22 proteins is largely limited to the TSC22 domain. The amino acid sequences of the TSC22 domain of all four proteins are shown aligned in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>. All four proteins display a number of conserved residues including the presence of the previously described putative Leucine Zipper (LZ) motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jay <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). Pair-wise comparisons revealed that the TSC22 domain of Tsc22-1 is most similar to that of Tsc22-4 (84% sequence identity) while the TSC22 domains of Tsc22-2 and Tsc22-3 display slightly lower sequence identity at 75% each (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Although the TSC22 domain is highly conserved across a number of metazoan species, its precise function is at present uncertain. With the exception of the predicted leucine zipper motif, there are no other proteins with similar sequences in the GenBank database. Similarly, we found no clues as to the function of the non-TSC22 portion of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> in GenBank. We did discover a 46 amino acid region within the N-terminal non-TSC22 regions of the longest Tsc22 proteins, Tsc22-1v1 and Tsc22-2v1, that display considerable sequence identity (50% identity between residues 59&#x02013;103 of Tsc22-1v1 aligned to residues 145&#x02013;190 of Tsc22-2v1) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Since the products of the <italic>TSC22-1</italic> gene can protect from the effects of apoptotic stimuli in yeast (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), we examined the potential pro-survival functions of all Tsc22 proteins in yeast by expressing cDNAs corresponding to the TSC22 domains (including the variable C-terminal tail) from the four <italic>TSC22</italic> genes. Yeast transformants expressing the individual TSC22 domains were challenged with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, diluted and spotted onto nutrient agar plates to determine their ability to grow.

None of these proteins appear to be orthologs of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup>. Despite this, we hypothesized that the pro-survival effect of expressing TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> in yeast is the result of the protein competing with an endogenous LZ-containing TF protein for the formation of a dimeric complex. This hypothesis is based on the observation that Tsc22 appears to act as a transcriptional modulator in mammalian cells despite the absence of a transcriptionally active domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kester <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Further, TSC22 dimerization with an LZ-containing TF has also been proposed to be responsible for at least some of the functions of different Tsc22 proteins when overexpressed in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kester <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hino <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).

The yeast two-hybrid assay has been previously used to screen for interactions between LZ-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Strathmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Weltmeier <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). To try and identify potential Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup>-interacting proteins, we performed a genome-wide two-hybrid screen. Yeast strains carrying the Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> protein as a Gal4p DNA-binding domain hybrid were tested in duplicate against an array of approximately 6000 yeast colonies. Each colony is derived from a transformation with a plasmid containing a DNA fragment encoding a full-length <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> open reading frame (ORF) fused to the Gal4p activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hazbun <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; Uetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2003). Eight positives resulting from this high-throughput screen were retested for their ability to interact with Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup>, resulting in the confirmation of two interactions: Nkp1p, which was originally identified as positive in both screens and that yielded strong growth on two-hybrid selective plates, and Erg6p, a positive that came up in a single screen and showed weaker growth on the selective media. Both interactions were specific, as shown by the inability of either the Nkp1p or Erg6p protein to interact with Gal4p-DNA-binding domain alone or a Gal4p-DNA-binding domain fused to Rad17p (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Surprisingly, none of the 184 yeast LZ-containing proteins were identified as binding partners of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup>. This is in spite of the fact that the array contains transformants for all of them, although it is not known whether the Gal4p activation domain fusion proteins are expressed.</p><p id="P27">Even though both Nkp1p and Erg6p lack any apparent LZ motif in their primary sequence, we examined the possibility that an interaction with either of these proteins was necessary for the anti-apoptotic function of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup>. We tested two possible hypotheses under which these interactions might be required. The first is that the Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> -interacting proteins are pro-apoptotic and Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> serves to inhibit this effect. A second scenario involves the formation of an anti-apoptotic complex consisting of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> and Nkp1p or Erg6p. We initially asked if Nkp1p has a role in yeast programmed cell death responses. WT yeast cells treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 2.5 hours before plating on nutrient containing agar media display a reduced ability to form colonies when compared to untreated cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). As compared to WT, an isogenic strain deleted for <italic>NKP1</italic> displayed a marked resistance to the effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. As a control we also examined yeast cells lacking the Nkp1p-interacting protein encoded by the <italic>TRM7</italic> gene. In contrast to &#x025a1;<italic>nkp1</italic> cells, &#x025a1;<italic>trm7</italic> cells displayed a hypersensitive response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).

Many of these genes have been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression in response to different stressful stimuli. For example, Yap1p is known to induce the expression of genes, such as heat shock proteins, that are required for survival at elevated temperatures (Rodriguez-Pousada <italic>et al</italic>., 2005).

When spotted on galactose-containing synthetic minimal media, 4 of the strains (&#x00394;<italic>rtg1</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>rtg3</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>gcn4</italic>, and &#x00394;<italic>kcs1</italic>) displayed moderate to severe growth defects (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Deletion of one of the genes (<italic>CST6</italic>) resulted in only a slight impairment of growth, yet did not yield transformants with the TSC22<sup>(86)</sup>-expressing plasmid (not shown). There were no observable growth defects for the other deletion strains when spotted on galactose-containing media (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We therefore used these strains to ask if the expression of TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> retained its anti-apoptotic effect in the absence of these TFs (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). The strains were co-transformed with different combinations of plasmids expressing BAX, TSC22<sup>(86)</sup>, or Sup. 32. The expression of the pro-apoptotic BAX protein effectively inhibited the growth of all strains examined (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Upon co-expression of TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> with BAX, the growth of each of the 13 strains was markedly enhanced. The effect was not specific to TSC22<sup>(86)</sup>, however, since Sup. 32 also served to reverse the effects of BAX in these strains (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). This suggests that the anti-apoptotic effect of TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> is independent of any individual LZ-containing TF tested. Because this experiment required the use of galactose-containing minimal media to induce gene expression and maintain plasmid selection, we were unable to test the function of TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> for the 5 aforementioned strains displaying growth defects. As an alternate approach to determine if TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> acts by forming a complex with the remaining LZ motif-containing TFs that we were unable to test, we assayed for an interaction between TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> and the TFs in the 2-hybrid system. To this end, we fused the TSC22<sup>(86)</sup>-coding region in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain (LexA-DBD-Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup>), and constructed Gal4p Activation domain fusions of each of 3 genes (Gal4p-AD-Cst6p, Gal4p-AD-Rtg1p, and Gal4p-AD-Rtg3p). We were unable to test Met4p, Gcn4p, or Kcs1p by the 2-hybrid assay here because of difficulties generating stable plasmids with the PCR products of these genes. Neither any of the AD fusions nor LexA-DBD-Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> alone allowed for growth in the absence of exogenously added histidine, indicating that the constructs do not auto-activate the LexA-dependent <italic>HIS3</italic> reporter (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Yeast cells co-expressing two previously known interacting proteins (LexA-DBD-SMS1&#x003b1; and Gal4p-AD-WIPI49) served as a positive control since they were able to grow in the absence of exogenous histidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Each of the AD-fusions co-transformed with LexA-DBD-TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> lead to an undetectable level of growth in the absence of histidine, suggesting that these LZ-containing TFs do not interact with TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> in the 2-hybrid assay (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The series of experiments presented above indicates that finding a LZ-mediated binding partner of TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> is not a straight forward proposition and suggests that the functions of TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> may not be mediated by LZ-containing TFs in yeast (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>The leucine zipper motif of TSC22 is not necessary for its anti-apoptotic function</title><p id="P30">In order to directly test the requirement of the LZ motif of TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> in the observed anti-apoptotic effect, we constructed and evaluated a series TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> deletion mutants.

Among the sequences identified were 4 yeast proteins that were of potential interest since their anti-apoptotic potential could be easily tested using the yeast assays described in the current study. Working under the hypothesis that Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> acts by mimicking an endogenous yeast molecule, we predicted that yeast proteins possessing similarity to the 16 residues necessary for the function of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> might also be anti-apoptotic. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of Sno1p (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>) and Fyv10p (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>) with that of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> reveals a cluster of conserved residues corresponding to the 16-residue region required for anti-apoptosis.

These phenomena form the basis for the evolution of genetic diversity. The divergences that can be observed between paralogous genes (as a result of duplication events) or the generation of novel roles for genes that have gained an additional functional domain (as a result of exon shuffling) are extensively documented outcomes of these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Schmidt &#x00026; Davies, 2007</xref>).

The presence of the TSC22 domain within the human <italic>TSC22</italic> gene family is likely to be the result of exon shuffling events, with dissimilar pairs of genes being &#x0201c;converted&#x0201d; by gaining the TSC22 domain. The conserved TSC22 domain is indeed specified by a single exon in all 4 human and mouse genes and therefore appears to be in accordance with the principles of the exon shuffling theory (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fiol <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Liu &#x00026; Grigoriev, 2004</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>TSC22-1</italic> and <italic>TSC22-2</italic> share significant sequence identity outside the TSC22 domain, suggesting that these genes arose by duplication. Diversity involving both duplication and exon shuffling within the same gene family is commonly observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Jean-Baptiste <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P35">More than half of human genes are thought to encode alternately spliced products, suggesting the major importance of this mechanism in generating diversity within the proteome (Johson <italic>et al</italic>., 2003). It is widely recognized that the proportion of different isoforms encoded by the same gene is often altered in certain pathological states such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Venables, 2006</xref>). Often a spliced transcript that is selectively produced in pathological or stressful conditions encodes for a protein with a different or regulatory function with respect to the transcript expressed predominantly in basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Venables, 2006</xref>). The significance of this regulatory mechanism is clearly evident with regard to genes involved in apoptosis. For instance, the BCL-X pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced to produce both pro- (Bcl-xS) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xL) isoforms. In addition to being markedly upregulated in a number of tumors, the expression of Bcl-xL is reduced (concomitant with an upregulation of Bcl-xS) in cells treated with apoptotic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Boise <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>). As in this case, the selective up- or down-regulation of a given isoform through alternative splicing is often an important determinant of cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Venables, 2006</xref>). We found that in addition to our TSC22<sup>(86)</sup> clone, the N-terminally extended forms of the Tsc22-1 proteins are also anti-apoptotic when expressed in yeast (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).

It has been proposed that Tsc22 functions through the heterodimerization with cognate LZ motif-containing transcriptional regulators through an LZ mediated process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kawamata <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). This would likely involve either a gain-of-function or a dominant inhibitory interaction between Tsc22 and the putative LZ-containing protein. Similar paradigms have been documented in the study of other LZ-containing molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Vinson <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Rangatia <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Thuerauf <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Benito <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gonzalez <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). For instance, the LZ-containing transcriptional activators c-jun and C/EBP-&#x003b1; have opposing effects on cell proliferation. In a recent model of acute myeloid leukemia, c-jun was shown to act by binding in an LZ-mediated manner to the anti-proliferative C/EBP-&#x003b1; protein. This dominant negative inhibition of C/EBP-&#x003b1; prevented its ability to bind DNA and thereby promote oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Rangatia <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Another example of this mechanism pertaining to the regulation of apoptosis involves thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF) and D-site-binding protein (DBP), members of the proline- and acid-rich (PAR) basic region LZ (bzip) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Benito <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). TEF acts by forming LZ-mediated homodimers that bind to the promoter region to active the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-gS protein. An alternately spliced form of DBP (tDBP) that lacks the transcriptional activation domain was shown to prevent activation of the BCL-gS gene by competing with TEF monomers and impairing the formation of a functional heterodimer in a manner mediated by the LZ structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Benito <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).

By mating these strains with a strain expressing a bait-DNA-binding domain fusion, an interaction between any desired protein and the entire yeast proteome can be assayed in an automated, binary fashion. For example, the yeast regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) Sst2p was used as bait in a genome-wide two-hybrid screen that yielded 17 interacting proteins. This resulted in the identification of novel and critical components of the Sst2p-regulated signaling pathways as evidence by the altered pheromone response of strains lacking these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Burchett <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).

Many of these sORFs were also shown to be conserved across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kastenmayer <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the functional genomic analysis served to reveal biological functions for an important class of genomic elements. While studying the phospho-regulation of the amphiphysin yeast ortholog Rvs167p, the Andrews group screened a panel of yeast deletion strains to discover that a non-phosphorylatable mutant form of this protein prompted lethality in a subset of strains displaying defects in the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Friesen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).

Finally, the dependency that Bax-mediated cell death displays on the respiratory status of yeast was demonstrated by examining the function of Bax in a set of mutant yeast strains with specific respiratory-defects (Harris <italic>et al</italic>., 2002). By further demonstrating that expression of the heterologous Bax protein causes respiratory dysfunction in yeast, this study bulwarked the notion that Bcl-2 family members can act independently (the yeast genome is devoid of any apparent <italic>BCL-2</italic> orthologs) to alter mitochondrial physiology (Harris <italic>et al</italic>., 2002). Our functional genomic analysis of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> in strains lacking genes that encode LZ-containing TFs comprises the first description of the collective panel of strains deleted for LZ-containing TFs (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). A number of these proteins have been extensively implicated in the regulation of stress responses in yeast and therefore likely to be involved in the apoptotic programme. For instance, the expression of a number of genes encoding the LZ-containing TFs, such as <italic>YAP4</italic> and <italic>YAP6</italic>, are induced by a number of apoptotic stimuli, including heat, osmotic and oxidative stresses (Rodriguez-Pousada <italic>et al</italic>., 2005).

Kilili <italic>et al.</italic> identified a class of tomato Glutathione S-transferases that suppress oxidative stress-induced cell death in yeast. This protective effect was abrogated in strains lacking the <italic>YAP1</italic> gene, providing further evidence for the role of Yap1 in oxidative stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kilili <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Our results suggest that the anti-apoptotic function of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> is not dependent on any individual LZ-containing yeast TFs (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This is consistent with the lack of LZ-containing proteins in our findings from the global two-hybrid screen (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Structure/function studies using deletion mutants of Tsc22-1v3 have attributed roles to both the conserved and non-conserved regions of the protein. For instance, mutants of Tsc22-1v3 deleted for two independent regions at flanking ends of the conserved TSC22 domain displayed a reduced ability to act as a repressor in a reported-based transcriptional activity assay in COS-I cells. This allowed for the identification of two repressor domains (RD1 and RD2) in the non-conserved portions of the Tsc22-1v3 protein (Kester <italic>et al</italic>., 2002). Hino <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that overexpression of the LZ domain from the same Tsc22 protein resulted in a more pronounced inhibition of anchorage-independent colony formation in a salivary gland cancer cell and CHO cell lines when compared to the full length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hino <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). These results suggest that the LZ structure of Tsc22-1v3 is a functional domain that serves to suppress tumour cell growth. More recently, the expression of a mutant lacking the N-terminal 26 residues of the TSC22 domain (yet retaining the LZ motif) failed to promote the growth-inhibitory effect observed upon expression of full-length Tsc22 in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hashiguchi <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Therefore, there is evidence for both LZ motif-dependent and independent functions for Tsc22-1v3 in the literature. Our finding that deletion mutants lacking the LZ motif retain the anti-apoptotic function clearly demonstrates a LZ-independent function for Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> in yeast. In effect, our results suggest that a 16 amino acid stretch C-terminal to the LZ motif is necessary for the pro-survival effect. Our findings demonstrate the requirement of a previously unrecognized region in the pro-survival function of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>The &#x02018;Tsc-22 &#x02013;like&#x02019; motif predicts an anti-apoptotic role for SNO1 and FYV10</title><p id="P40">Deletion analyses have been tremendously successful at identifying functional domains for a large number of different genes (Reed <italic>et al</italic>., 1996). Examples include genes encoding the Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1-BH4), present in the Bcl-2 family of pro-and anti-apoptotic proteins (Reed <italic>et al</italic>., 1996). BH domains are comprised of short sequences that form common tertiary structures such as alpha helices. Their importance is demonstrated by the finding that deletion of any of the BH domains of Bcl-2, including the BH1 (28 amino acids), BH2 (15 amino acids), or BH3 (13 amino acids) abrogates its ability to mediate anti-apoptosis (Reed <italic>et al</italic>., 1996). Importantly, the presence of BH domains in other proteins has allowed the identification of other Bcl-2 family members with roles in the regulation of apoptosis (Adams &#x00026; Cory, 1999). In the current study, we have identified a 16-residue sequence, comparable in length to the BH domains, within the conserved TSC22 domain that is required for the anti-apoptotic effect of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> in yeast. In a manner analogous to the aforementioned BH domain studies, we used Blast to identify 19 different proteins that contain a sequence similar to the anti-apoptotic TSC22 motif. Thus, we predicted that these &#x0201c;TSC22-like&#x0201d; proteins might represent a novel class of anti-apoptotic sequences. We tested this prediction by analyzing 2 of the 4 yeast genes identified, namely <italic>SNO1</italic> and <italic>FYV10</italic> (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Both genes were found to be anti-apoptotic since their overexpression protected cells from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C &#x00026; 8D</xref>). Additionally, strains lacking these genes were considerably more sensitive to the effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E &#x00026; 8D</xref>). Thus, our characterization of Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> in yeast has served to functionally identify novel anti-apoptotic genes. Based on our data, other proteins possessing the Tsc22-like motif are strong candidates for proteins with anti-apoptotic function.</p><p id="P41"><italic>SNO1</italic> was originally identified on the basis of its proximity to <italic>SNZ1</italic>, a related gene with which it is coordinately regulated in a growth-phase dependent manner. For instance, both genes are upregulated during the diauxic shift that occurs upon entrance into stationary phase, and have been proposed to be involved in the adaptive response to nutrient limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Padilla <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). In addition, Sno1p has been reported to function as a glutaminase in a manner dependent on Snz1p, serving to promote pyridoxine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Rodriguez-Navarro <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dong <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). The ability of Sno1p to protect from oxidative stresses may be simply due to an elevation in the levels of vitamin B6, a molecule with known ROS scavenging functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Osmani <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). The deletion of <italic>SNO1</italic> had been previously reported to result in hypersensitivity to inhibitors of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, as well as ROS-generating agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Padilla <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). In yeast, <italic>SNO1</italic> is part of a multigene family that includes <italic>SNO2</italic> and <italic>SNO3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Padilla <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Although the 222 residue Sno2p and Sno3p differ in only 2 residues, they are only 65% identical to the 224 residue Sno1p. Of the 16 TSC22 motif present in Sno1p, only 11 are conserved in Sno2p and Sno3p. In addition, to differences in sequences and differences in their regulation, <italic>Sno2</italic> and <italic>3</italic> double knockouts, unlike &#x00394;<italic>sno1</italic> strains, have normal sensitivity to inhibitors of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis.

The regions corresponding to the 16-residue Tsc22<sup>(86)</sup> sequence responsible for its anti-apoptotic function are boxed. An asterisk (*) is used to indicate identical residues. Gaps denoted by dashes (&#x0201c;-&#x0201c;) are introduced to maximize the possible similarity between the aligned sequences. (C) Wild Type cells transformed with vectors expressing GFP alone (VECTOR) or GFP fused to the C-terminus of Sno1p or Fyv10p were grown to early logarithmic phase in galactose-containing minimal media. Separate cultures of each sample were left untreated (CTL) or treated with 4mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for 3 hours. Aliquots were removed and normalized for cell number, serially diluted, then spotted on nutrient-containing agar media and incubated for 3 days. (D) Wild-type cells expressing GFP (VECTOR) with either an empty vector, or vectors encoding C-terminal GFP fusions of Sno1p or Fyv10p were grown to logarithmic phase in treated with 4mM hydrogen peroxide. Aliquots were removed at the times indicated, and an equal number of cells from each sample were spotted on nutrient-containing media and incubated for 2 days. Colony forming units were then scored and the data expressed as &#x0201c;% of plated cells&#x0201d;. Data represent the mean of 3 independent experiments (+/&#x02212; SEM).

Aliquots were removed and normalized for cell number, serially diluted, then spotted on nutrient-containing agar media and incubated for 2&#x02013;3 days. Untreated samples were also spotted on plates that were subsequently irradiated with UV light at 100mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> (+UV), or incubated at elevated temperature (38&#x000b0;C), each with corresponding untreated control plates (CTL).
