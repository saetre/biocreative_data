The gene that is disrupted in this mutation encodes the transcription factor <italic>Sox6</italic>. P19CL6 cells were used as an <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiomyocyte differentiation system and revealed that <italic>Sox6</italic> is expressed exclusively when the cells are committed to differentiate to beating cardiac myocytes.

Using the P19CL6 cells stably transfected with noggin, an antagonist of BMP (Bone Morphogenic Protein), we found that BMP expression is required for Sox6 expression in cardiomyocyte differentiation.

Regulatory programs for myocyte transcription result from developmental cues and positional information that are mediated by specific transcription factors. The transcriptional expression pattern of muscle-specific genes is ultimately dependent on combinatorial interactions among the transcription factors that bind different regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c1">1</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Sox</italic> (<italic><underline>S</underline>ry</italic> related HMG b<underline>ox</underline>) gene family encodes an important group of transcription factors that are key regulators of embryonic development and cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c2">2</xref>). Mutations of <italic>Sox6</italic>, a member of this family, are associated with neonatal lethality in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c4">4</xref>). <italic>Sox6</italic> was initially isolated from an adult mouse testis cDNA library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c5">5</xref>), but its functional significance in this tissue is unknown. Sox6 has been suggested to play a role in the development of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c5">5</xref>), chondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c8">8</xref>) and cardiac and skeletal muscle cell maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c3">3</xref>). Mice homozygous for a <italic>Sox6</italic> null mutation, <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup>, show delayed growth and die within 2 weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c3">3</xref>). Analysis of the <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup> phenotype revealed that the <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup> mutant develops myopathy and arterioventricular (AV) heart block, a cardiac conduction defect associated with lethality in human cardiac myopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c9">9</xref>). Thus, among its diverse functions, the Sox6 protein is likely to be involved in maintaining the normal physiological function of muscle tissue, including the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c3">3</xref>). We have recently cloned and sequenced the human SOX6 cDNA, isolated from a myoblast cDNA library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c10">10</xref>). The human SOX6 protein shows 94.3&#x00025; amino acid identity to mouse Sox6 throughout the gene, and 100&#x00025; identity in the critical HMG box and coiled-coil domains. Northern blot analysis revealed that human SOX6, like mouse <italic>Sox6</italic>, is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, and is most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c10">10</xref>).</p><p>The muscle cell-specific effects of the Sox6 protein may be achieved by its interactions with other transcription factors. To identify Sox6 interactors in muscle cells and elucidate how the Sox6 protein achieves such remarkable cell type specificity, a yeast two-hybrid screening was performed. This identified the Prtb (Proline-rich transcript of the brain) protein as an interactor of the Sox6 protein.</p><p>To understand the role of <italic>Sox6</italic> in cardiac muscle development, we utilized P19CL6, a cell line that differentiates exclusively to beating cardiomyocytes in the presence of DMSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c11">11</xref>). <italic>Sox6</italic> is not expressed in untreated P19CL6 cells, but is up-regulated following DMSO exposure, reaching maximum levels when the cells have fully differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes. In addition, we found that <italic>Sox6</italic> is downstream of the BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) pathway in the cardiac system, using P19CL6noggin, a P19CL6 cell line stably transfected with noggin that antagonizes the BMP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c12">12</xref>).</p><p>To assess the effect of Sox6 in cardiac differentiation, we characterized the expression of the L-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> gene, encoding a subunit normally expressed in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c13">13</xref>). We found that the mRNA levels of the L-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> gene decreased when the P19L6 cells terminally differentiate or when they are transfected with Sox6. Moreover, in <italic>Sox6</italic> null mutant mice (<italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup>&#x0002f;<italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c3">3</xref>), the expression level of this calcium channel gene is &#x0223c;1.5-fold higher, correlating with the <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis. The Sox6 interactor, Prtb, also down-regulated the expression levels of the L-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> gene, whereas <italic>Prtb</italic> co-expressed with <italic>Sox6</italic> did not.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>DNA fragments for plasmid constructs were generated by PCR or RT&#x02013;PCR and confirmed by sequence analysis. To construct the plasmid pGBKT7 (Clontech) as bait for the yeast two-hybrid screen and for the co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), an amplified PCR fragment encoding amino acids 139&#x02013;304 (including the coiled-coil domain) of mouse Sox6 (GenBank accession no. U32614) was cloned in-frame into EcoRI&#x02013;SalI sites. To generate the plasmid pGADT7 (Clontech) for the Co-IP, the amplified PCR fragment encoding the first 108 amino acids of the Prtb gene (GenBank accession no. AF085348), and RT&#x02013;PCR of the entire gene (168 amino acids), were cloned in-frame into EcoRI&#x02013;XhoI sites. For transient transfection, complete cDNAs of the mouse <italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>Prtb</italic> genes were cloned into EcoRI, and EcoRI&#x02013;XhoI, respectively, to pCDNA3.1&#x0002f;Zeo vector (Invitrogen) driven by the CMV promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid screening</title><p>The MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech) was used according to the supplier&#x02019;s protocol with the Sox6 bait plasmid, detailed above. The screened library was mouse 11 day embryo MATCHMAKER cDNA (Clontech) that was pre-transformed to the Y187 yeast strain. The two-hybrid screening of the pre-transformed library was accomplished by yeast mating using the AH109 strain containing the bait plasmid. The screening was preformed for growth on minimal medium lacking histidine (His<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) and in the presence of 2.5 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Of 2.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cDNAs, approximately 300 positive colonies grew on His<sup>&#x02013;</sup>. To exclude false positive clones, the 300 colonies were replicated to high stringency plates, with simultaneous selection for three reporter genes (lacking histidine and adenine and containing X-&#x003b1;-Gal as substrate that employs blue&#x0002f;white screening directly on the plate). Approximately 200 of these clones grew under high stringency. These were sequenced and evaluated by BLAST search for being in frame with the activation domain, for the potential as a transcription factor and for expression in the developing heart. Of these, one, partially encoding Prtb, was selected for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> protein&#x02013;protein interaction assay</title><p>To confirm true protein interactions, we used the MATCHMAKER Co-IP kit (Clontech) for <italic>in vitro</italic> Co-IP, according to the supplier&#x02019;s protocol. The Co-IP contains two vectors: pGBKT7 (includes the mouse Sox6 coiled-coil domain), and pGADT7 (includes a library protein isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screening). These vectors contain a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and either a c-Myc or HA epitope tag, so they can be used directly in an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription&#x0002f;translation reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and northern blot analysis</title><p>At varying times and treatments, cells were harvested for total RNA isolation using the UltraSpec RNA Isolation kit (Biotecx). For northern blot hybridization, equal amounts of total RNA (10 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;lane) were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.2&#x00025; agarose gel in the presence of 5.5&#x00025; formaldehyde and transferred by the alkaline method to a nylon membrane (Hybond N&#x0002b;; Amersham). The membranes were hybridized with distinct cDNA probes obtained by PCR or RT&#x02013;PCR and confirmed by sequencing. The <italic>Sox6</italic> probe is a mouse cDNA fragment of 575 bp including nucleotides 1353&#x02013;1927 (GenBank accession no. U32614). The <italic>Prtb</italic> probe is a mouse cDNA fragment of 562 bp including nucleotides 15&#x02013;576 (GenBank accession no. AF085348). The <italic>Sox9</italic> probe is a mouse cDNA fragment of 278 bp including nucleotides 1049&#x02013;1326 (GenBank accession no. BC034264). The L-type Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup>&#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> probes are mouse cDNA fragments of 548 and 540 bp including nucleotides 6294&#x02013;6841 and 3072&#x02013;3611, respectively (GenBank accession no.

The hybridization was performed in phosphate buffered 7&#x00025; SDS hybridization solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c14">14</xref>). Blots were washed with 0.2&#x000d7; SSC, 1&#x00025; SDS at 60&#x000b0;C prior to exposure to X-ray film (Kodak) at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C from 3 h to 6 days. Human and mouse multiple tissue northern filters were purchased from Clontech. The filters were hybridized with mouse <italic>Prtb</italic> cDNA nucleotides 15&#x02013;576 (GenBank accession no.

The medium was changed every 2 days. The P19CL6 cells started to beat after 11 days, and virtually all of the cells on the plate were beating after 14 days. Days of differentiation were numbered consecutively (i.e. day 0, no DMSO treatment; day 1, 24 h after DMSO added).</p></sec><sec><title>Transient transfection assay</title><p>Transient transfections were performed in a 6-well dish using FuGENE6 reagent (Roche), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Bluescript II SK(-) plasmid was used as a control. To evaluate transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with a reporter vector containing the &#x003b2;-gal gene driven by the CMV promoter (pCMV SPORT&#x02013;&#x003b2;gal; Invitrogen). In each well of a 6-well plate, 3.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells were transfected with 1 &#x000b5;g of pCDNA3.1&#x0002f;Zeo harboring <italic>Sox6</italic> or <italic>Prtb</italic> or both plasmids, and 0.5 &#x000b5;g of pCMV SPORT&#x02013;&#x003b2;gal. Cells were harvested after 24 h post-transfection for RNA for northern blot analysis (as described above). The band intensities were determined with Quantity One software (GS-700 densitometer; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Also at this point protein extracts were used for the &#x003b2;-gal assay using the &#x003b2; galactosidase enzyme assay kit (Promega). The experiment was repeated three times, and the statistical analysis was done using <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec><title>RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of L-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> gene</title><p>Total RNA from embryonic day 18.5 heart was isolated from littermate wild-type and <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup>&#x0002f;<italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup> mutant mice. One microgram of RNA, Oligo (dT)<sub>12&#x02013;18</sub> primer and reverse transcriptase were used for cDNA production. L-type Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup> &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> cDNA analysis was performed by PCR amplification of a fragment of 548 bp using the primers: MHB1401, 5&#x02032;-TATCAGAGTGACAGCAGGGGCAAC-3&#x02032;; and MHB1402, 5&#x02032;-AGAGAGGCAGAGCGAAGGAAAC-3&#x02032;. PCRs were carried out with several dilutions of cDNAs and&#x0002f;or over a range of amplifying cycles to insure a linear range of amplification. A fragment of the mouse GPDH gene was amplified as internal control. Amplified products were electrophoresed on a 2&#x00025; agarose gel, visualized under UV light and analyzed using a densitometer (Gel Doc 1000; Bio-Rad).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Screening for a candidate protein that interacts with Sox6</title><p>To identify factors that interact with Sox6, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system. As bait, we used the coiled-coil domain including amino acids 139&#x02013;304 of the mouse Sox6 protein. The leucine zipper motif and the Q-box create a coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c6">6</xref>) that is 100&#x00025; conserved between the mouse and human SOX6, and has a 91&#x00025; identity to L-Sox5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c10">10</xref>). This domain mediates homodimerization and heterodimerization. We screened a cDNA library from an 11-day mouse embryo, at a stage when the <italic>Sox6</italic> gene is already expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c3">3</xref>). One cDNA clone was selected for detailed analysis based on numerous criteria (see Materials and Methods). A BLAST search revealed that this clone contained two-thirds of the <italic>Prtb</italic> gene, including 108 amino acids (of 168 total) at the N-terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c15">15</xref>). The full size cDNA of <italic>Prtb</italic> was subsequently isolated by RT&#x02013;PCR. Although the two-hybrid system in yeast provides an <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis, it does not necessarily demonstrate direct interaction between these two proteins. To verify protein&#x02013;protein interaction, we applied the Co-IP technique (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f1">1</xref>). A c-Myc epitope tag was attached to the Sox6 bait, and an HA epitope tag was attached to both the isolated Prtb fragment (108 amino acids) and the full-length protein. The tagged proteins were expressed <italic>in vitro</italic> and non-denatured proteins and complexes were precipitated by anti-Myc or anti-HA. The proteins and complexes were then denatured and resolved by PAGE, verifying the interaction between the Sox6 and Prtb proteins. Both the 108 amino acid Prtb peptide and the full-length protein were co-precipitated with Sox6, confirming the yeast two-hybrid system results (data not shown).</p><p>The Prtb protein has no known function. An analysis using the PROSITE motif search showed a possible &#x02018;paired box&#x02019; domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c16">16</xref>) that may function in sequence-specific DNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c17">17</xref>). There is a 92&#x00025; sequence identity between the human and mouse <italic>Prtb</italic> genes. This high conservation between the two species may suggest a shared, and perhaps crucial, function of this protein. <italic>Prtb</italic> is expressed in various levels in a variety of tissues. The expression patterns of <italic>Prtb</italic> in human and in mouse are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f2">2</xref>A and B, respectively. In both organisms <italic>Prtb</italic> is expressed at high levels in the heart, and at lower levels in skeletal muscle (when compared with Sox6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>Prtb</italic> expression during differentiation of P19CL6 cells and P19CL6noggin cells</title><p>Cardiomyocyte differentiation can be studied <italic>in vitro</italic> using P19CL6 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c11">11</xref>), a clonal derivative of P19 murine embryonal carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c18">18</xref>). Unlike the parental P19 cells, this subline efficiently differentiates into beating cardiomyocytes under adherent conditions when treated with DMSO. This cell line expresses BMPs that have been shown to play a pivotal role in the induction of the cardiac cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c20">20</xref>). To further investigate the functions of BMP in cardiac development, Monzen <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c12">12</xref>) established a variant P19CL6 cell line, P19CL6noggin, that constitutively over-expresses noggin, an antagonist of BMP. Because of the continual presence of noggin in P19CL6noggin cells, myogenic induction is suppressed and neither cardiac transcription factors nor contractile protein genes are expressed. To understand where in the cardiomyocyte developmental pathway Sox6 and Prtb may be acting, we used P19CL6 and P19CL6noggin to analyze the expression of these genes. The mRNA of <italic>Sox6</italic> is only detected when the cells are beating (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f3">3</xref>) or committed to differentiate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f4">4</xref>). <italic>Sox6</italic> mRNA was not detected in untreated or DMSO treated P19CL6noggin cells that do not differentiate into cardiomyocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f3">3</xref>). These results indicate that the expression of Sox6 in P19CL6 is associated with the initiation of the cardiomyogenic program and not with the DMSO treatment itself. In contrast to the <italic>Sox6</italic> expression in P19CL6, the expression of <italic>Prtb</italic> is less affected by the presence of noggin, since <italic>Prtb</italic> is expressed in both P19CL6 and P19CL6noggin cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f3">3</xref>). The highest expression of <italic>Prtb</italic> was observed when the P19CL6 cells are beating. In P19CL6noggin cells, DMSO treatment increased the <italic>Prtb</italic> mRNA level, but not to the level observed in beating P19CL6 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f3">3</xref>). It is, therefore, possible that DMSO treatment itself may have a partial effect on the expression of the <italic>Prtb</italic> gene.</p><p>The temporal expression of <italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>Prtb</italic> in DMSO-treated P19CL6 cells was also analyzed by northern hybridization. The expression of <italic>Sox9</italic> was also analyzed, because Sox9 has been shown to be required for the expression of <italic>Sox6</italic> in chondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c21">21</xref>).

The &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> subunit is expressed in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle, as well as in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c23">23</xref>). The L-type Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> channel is critical for cardiomyocyte contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c24">24</xref>).

This region contains seven consensus binding sites for Sox proteins (the potential binding sites of Prtb are unknown).

To determine the transfection efficiency, we co-transfected the cells with &#x003b2;-gal, driven by the CMV promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f6">6</xref>B).

They recognize a motif of only 6&#x02013;7 bp of DNA with considerable degeneracy. However, they appear to regulate different sets of target genes, depending on the cell type in which they are expressed. Cooperative interactions between Sox proteins and their partner factors may allow stable associations with their specific target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c2">2</xref>). To identify an interactor of the Sox6 protein we used the yeast two-hybrid system. Screening a cDNA library prepared from an embryonic day-11 mouse, we identified the <italic>Prtb</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c15">15</xref>) as an interactor with the Sox6 coiled-coil domain. The interaction was confirmed by Co-IP, demonstrating a physical interaction between the two proteins. Sequence analysis of the <italic>Prtb</italic> gene indicated a possible &#x02018;pair box&#x02019; domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c16">16</xref>), suggesting that Prtb may function as a transcription factor. <italic>Prtb</italic> is expressed in embryonic and adult stages in multiple tissues at different levels.</p><p>P19CL6 cells provide an <italic>in vitro</italic> model for cardiac myocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c11">11</xref>). <italic>Sox6</italic> is expressed exclusively when these cells are committed to differentiate to cardiac beating cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f4">4</xref>). <italic>Sox6</italic> is expressed at day 6 following DMSO induction in P19CL6 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f4">4</xref>). A minimum exposure time of 4 days of DMSO is required for differentiation of P19CL6 cells to beating myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c27">27</xref>). These findings correlate with the fact that <italic>Sox6</italic> is not expressed unless the cells are committed to beating, with the highest expression of <italic>Sox6</italic> on day 11, at which point rhythmic contractions begin. The temporal expression of <italic>Sox6</italic> in P19CL6 cells (and the mutant phenotype <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup>&#x0002f;<italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup> mice) suggests that Sox6 plays a significant role in cardiogenesis.</p><p>It has been shown that <italic>Sox6</italic>, together with L-<italic>Sox5</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic>, undergoes up-regulation by BMP-2 during murine fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c28">28</xref>). On the other hand, it has been shown that Sox6 is an important downstream mediator of BMP-2 signaling in chondrogenesis, whereas other signals control the expression and function of Sox9 as a chondrogenic transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c8">8</xref>). BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; super family and play a crucial role in chondrogenesis as well as in cardiomyocyte differentiation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c29">29</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that <italic>Sox6</italic> is regulated through the BMP pathway in the differentiation of cardiomyocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f3">3</xref>) using P19CL6 cells stably transfected with noggin, an antagonist of BMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c12">12</xref>). In addition, we have shown that <italic>Sox9</italic> expression was high and equal through the DMSO time course assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f4">4</xref>). Thus, we suggest that Sox6 is a downstream mediator of BMP signaling in cardiogenesis as well as in chondrogenesis, and <italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> are probably regulated differently in the cardiac system. Another study showed that <italic>Sox9</italic> is required for the expression of <italic>Sox6</italic> in chondrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c21">21</xref>). In cardiomycyte differentiation, the expression of <italic>Sox9</italic> may be required for the expression of <italic>Sox6</italic>, but it is clearly not sufficient. Hence, the inducible P19CL6 cells may make it possible to define additional factors that are upstream of <italic>Sox6</italic>.</p><p>Expression analysis of the <italic>Prtb</italic> gene in P19CL6 and P19CL6noggin cell lines showed that <italic>Prtb</italic> is up-regulated when the cells differentiate to beating cardiac cells. Although DMSO, by itself, has a moderate effect on the expression of this gene, its maximum expression is observed 11 days after DMSO treatment when the cardiomyocytes are beating (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f4">4</xref>). Thus, Prtb function might be specified by the cooperation of other genes such as <italic>Sox6</italic>.</p><p>In addition to playing a role in cardiac myocyte development, Prtb and Sox6 may also be involved in bone formation. It has been shown that <italic>Prtb</italic> is a serum-responsive gene in osteoblasts and is up-regulated during adhesion and possibly involved in processes such as cell cycle control and proliferation as a participant in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c16">16</xref>). L-Sox5 and Sox6 are essential for cartilage formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c4">4</xref>) and are required for notochord extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c30">30</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Sox6 and Prtb cooperate in bone formation.</p><p>Elucidation of the target genes of <italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>Prtb</italic> will be important to understand the process of cardiac myocyte differentiation. The correlation between beating cardiomyocytes and <italic>Sox6</italic> expression allows us to evaluate proteins important in contraction as potential targets of Sox6 regulation. For example, cardiac contraction is highly dependent on the gating function of the L-type calcium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c31">31</xref>). The &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> subunit of the calcium channel provides the pore structure for Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> ion entry. It has clinical relevance, since it contains the binding sites for multiple classes of drugs, collectively known as the calcium antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c13">13</xref>). To gain insights into the regulation of this channel, we analyzed its expression in P19CL6 cells. L-type Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> expression in these cells is dramatically down-regulated following DMSO induction to beating cardiac cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f5">5</xref>), opposite the expectation of a direct correlation between beating cells and calcium channel expression. The reduced expression of this gene might result from aberrant regulation by DMSO, as expression of L-type Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> was also down-regulated in P19CL6noggin cells treated with DMSO. Another possible explanation for this reduction is that the proliferation of the cells has an impact on expression of the L-type Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> channel. The cells beat when they grow in multilayers. In smooth muscle cells of the rat aorta it was shown that transcription of the L-type Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> channel &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> is down-regulated in the proliferative state and it is closely linked to cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c32">32</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> transfection data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f6">6</xref>A and B) suggest that the Sox6 or Prtb proteins might at least partially down-regulate the &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> channel in the P19CL6 cells treated with DMSO.</p><p>The regulatory region of the L-type Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> gene contains eight consensus binding sites for Sox proteins. Multiple Sox binding sites have been reported previously in several other genes regulated by Sox factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c35">35</xref>), suggesting that the L-type Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> gene might be similarly regulated. Sox6 heterodimerized with Sox5, and in the presence of Sox9, cooperatively activates the expression of col2a (a chondrocyte differentiation marker) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c6">6</xref>). On the other hand, Sox6 interacts with CtBP2 (C-terminal binding protein) and causes repression of Fgf-3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c36">36</xref>). Thus, Sox6 can function as activator or as a repressor. The transient transfection analysis showed that Sox6 and Prtb (each one by itself) down-regulated the expression level of the L-type Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> channel gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f6">6</xref>A and B). However, when Sox6 and Prtb are both over-expressed, they appear to antagonize the effects of each. Prtb might antagonize Sox6 repression (or vice versa) by interacting with Sox6 and creating a complex that can no longer interact with its DNA target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c37">37</xref>), or a Prtb-associated complex might change the chromatin structure and abrogate Sox6 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c38">38</xref>). It is known that Sox transcription factors bind to the minor groove of DNA causing a 70&#x02013;85&#x000b0; bend of the DNA, consequently introducing local conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c40">40</xref>). Therefore, Sox proteins may perform part of their function as architectural proteins by organizing local chromatin structure and assembling other DNA-bound transcription factors into biologically active, sterically defined, multiprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c42">42</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup>&#x0002f;<italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup> mutant mouse is a Sox6 null mutant characterized by early postnatal lethality, associated with progressive atrioventricular heart block and myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c3">3</xref>). The cardiac expression of L-type Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> is up-regulated by &#x0223c;1.5-fold in the <italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup>&#x0002f;<italic>p</italic><sup><italic>100H</italic></sup> mutant mouse (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f7">7</xref>). This <italic>in vivo</italic> result correlates with our cell line observations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg807f6">6</xref>). Interestingly, knockout mice for the L-type Ca<sup>2<bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> &#x003b1;<sub>1c</sub> die before embryonic day 14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg807c44">44</xref>). Deletion of this channel leads to a selective perturbation of cardiac morphogenesis and function in early embryonic development.
