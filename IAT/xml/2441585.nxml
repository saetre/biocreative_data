PGCs are normally specified during early development either by inductive cues (in mammals and in Urodele amphibians) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] or by inheritance of cytoplasmic determinants (e.g. in <italic>Drosophila, C. elegans</italic>, zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic>). These cytoplasmic determinants are comprised of electron dense material containing maternal RNAs and proteins, collectively termed germ plasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Transplantation experiments in <italic>Drosophila </italic>demonstrated that the germ plasm is sufficient for the induction of the germ cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Similarly, in zebrafish it has been shown that removal of germ plasm leads to loss of germ cell specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In zebrafish, the germ plasm is localized to the first and second cleavage furrows of the early embryo and this localization depends on the function of actin and microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. At the 32-cell stage the germ plasm is incorporated into four cells that become the progenitors of the germ cell lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. During division of these progenitor cells, the germ plasm is inherited by only one daughter cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], thereby maintaining the number of presumptive germ cells constant. However, after 4 hours of zebrafish development the germ plasm is segregated symmetrically, a change that coincides with an increase in PGC numbers. Later in development, Zebrafish germ cells contain unique granular structures organized around the germ cell nucleus. Several germ cell specific proteins, whose RNA is initially localized to the germ plasm, localize to these granules (e.g. Vasa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], Nanos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and Dead end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). Germ cell specific granules are a common feature of germ cells in metazoans, including species where germ cells are specified by induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although the precise function of these granular structures in germ cell development remains largely unknown, several RNAs and proteins localized to these structures were found to be essential for germ cell specification, survival and later development. One common marker for germ cell granules is the RNA helicase Vasa protein, which shows high sequence homology to the translation initiation factor eIF-4A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, while in <italic>Drosophila </italic>Vasa protein localizes early on to the germ plasm, in Zebrafish only the <italic>vasa </italic>RNA localizes to the germ plasm, while the protein is dispersed in the early embryo. Presumably only zygotically produced Vasa is later restricted to the germ line, where it localizes in granules around the germ cell nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In contrast to <italic>vasa </italic>for which no function in zebrafish PGC development has yet been attributed, other components of the Zebrafish germ cell granules, such as the RNA-binding proteins Dead end (Dnd) and Nanos1 (Nos1) are essential for germ-cell survival and maintenance of oocyte production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Zebrafish germ cell granules are organized around the nucleus after the cells arrive at the region of the gonad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Little is known however about their distribution and segregation during the first 24 hpf of Zebrafish embryonic development, in particular during cell division. Understanding these processes would contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that promote germ cell fate maintenance and those allowing for an increase in germ cell number (e.g. during the time of germ-cell migration).</p><p>Accurate inheritance of organelles and cytoplasmic components is a key requirement for symmetrical cell division. Current models of organelle distribution suggest two distinct partitioning strategies: a stochastic partition or an ordered one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Stochastic mechanisms rely on random distribution of multiple organelle copies that would provide each daughter cell with sufficient copies of the organelle, but not necessarily with the same total number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For example, the large cytoplasmic area covered by the ER in mammalian cells ensures that both daughter cells inherit sufficient amount of ER that is adequately facilitated by a stochastic mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The chromosome distribution during cell division on the other hand, proceeds in an ordered manner in a process that involves the mitotic spindle machinery. Central players in the ordered organization and segregation of cellular components during the cell cycle are the microtubule-dependent molecular motors such as Dynein and Kinesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study we show that at the onset of germ cell development, zebrafish germ cell granules exhibit a strong variation of size. This appearance changes however during the first day of embryonic development when germ-cell granules become homogenous in size. The change in granule size and granule segregation to daughter cells during mitosis appears ordered and depends on the microtubule network, the function of the molecular motor protein Dynein, as well as the tudor domain-containing protein, Tdrd7.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of the novel germ cell marker granulito</title><p>A novel germ cell marker, which we named <italic>granulito </italic>(<italic>gra</italic>) was identified in a microarray-based screen where the transcripts of isolated wildtype PGCs were compared to the ones in which the function of <italic>dead end </italic>(<italic>dnd</italic>), a gene essential for PGC survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] was knocked down. <italic>granulito </italic>was found to be expressed at very high levels in wild-type germ cells as compared to germ cells in which dead end was knocked down. <italic>granulito </italic>mRNA is enriched in the germ plasm at the 4-cell stage and is expressed in PGCs until the end of the first day of development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and data not shown). This expression pattern in the germ cells is similar to that of previously described germ cell markers such as <italic>dead end </italic>and <italic>nanos1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but differs from those in that it is expressed at significant levels in somatic cells as well. <italic>granulito </italic>mRNA encodes a 141 amino acid protein that exhibits significant homology only to proteins in the vertebrata (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), does not contain known protein domains and does not exhibit significant similarity to other genes. Granulito-EYFP fusion protein is localized to germ cell granules in PGCs, the structure in which the Vasa protein is found (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). To increase the confidence in the observed localization of the fusion protein, the fluorescent protein was fused both 3' and 5' of the Granulito protein, HA and FLAG tages were generated and the open reading frame of the fusion was linked to its own 3'UTR leading to the same result (data not shown). To determine whether Granulito plays a role in zebrafish PGC development, we knocked down its function using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides. While injection of antisense oligonucleotides directed against the 5' sequence of <italic>granulito </italic>efficiently blocked translation of <italic>granulito-eyfp-nos1</italic>-3'UTR (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), germ cell development proceeded normally at least until 24 hours post fertilization (hpf). When high amount of antisense oligonucleotides was injected, embryonic development was arrested during gastrulation, while germ cell development appeared unaffected (data not shown). We therefore conclude that if this protein plays a role in early PGC development, its function is either redundant with that of another gene product, or that maternally provided Granulito protein (which is not affected by the antisense oligonucleotides treatment) is sufficient for performing the early role of the protein. Despite the apparent lack of function for the protein, the localization of Granulito to the Zebrafish germ cell granules could serve as a tool for investigating these structures during early stages of PGC development.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression pattern of <italic>granulito </italic>RNA and subcellular localization of the Ganulito protein</bold>.

However, mRNA injection does not allow adequate visualization of granules before 6 hpf due to high fluorescent background in somatic cells and poor specific signal in primordial germ cells. Additionally, Nanos1-GFP and Dead end-GFP localization appears to be diffused at this stage and not unique to granules. In order to visualize the granules at an earlier developmental stage, we generated transgenic fish expressing <italic>granulito-dsRedEx-nos1-</italic>3'UTR under the control of the <italic>askopos </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In progeny of transgenic females expressing <italic>egfp-nos1-</italic>3'UTR fusion under the control of the maternal promoter of <italic>askopos</italic>, germ cells could be visualized as early as 3 hpf. The localization and specific translation of <italic>granulito-dsRedEx-nos1-</italic>3'UTR in PGCs allowed us to follow germinal granules from 4 hpf in live embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). At this stage and at 6 hpf, in most germ cells a single to few large granules were observed along with several smaller ones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,E</xref>). As development proceeds, the proportion of small granules increases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,E</xref>). Finally at 24 hpf, as the germ cells are located where the gonad will develop, most PGCs show a uniform distribution of granules around the nucleus with similar small sizes. This strong reduction in granule size variation within the first 24 hours of development is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>.</p><p>Given the critical role germ cell granules components play in PGC development, the question of the control over the morphology and distribution of these structures is a central one for understanding the development of PGCs. We therefore followed the granules during cell division in different developmental stages and examined the possible role cytoskeleton components and granule-specific proteins could play in this process.</p></sec><sec><title>Dynamic localization of Zebrafish germ cell granules</title><p>To elucidate the mechanism by which germ cell granules are distributed between daughter cells during mitosis, we analyzed this process during germ cell division in 10 hpf zebrafish embryos. To that end, we labeled germ cell granules using Vasa-DsRed, the nuclear envelope using LaminB2-GFP and the nuclear pores using NUPL1-GFP. We monitored nuclear envelope break down (NEBD) and granule segregation during cell division using confocal time-lapse microscopy.</p><p>At 10 hpf, germ cell granules of diverse sizes are organized around the nuclear envelope of germ cells at interphase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, arrow). At the onset of cell division, during early prophase, the nuclear envelope disassembles and the granules lose their perinuclear localization and scatter throughout the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, arrowhead). Granules may appear to transiently change their shape during nuclear envelope reorganization and recover their spherical shape when detached completely from the envelope during metaphase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> arrow).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Germ cell granule behavior during cell division in live embryos</bold>. A) During interphase and before nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), the granules (labeled with Vasa-dsRed) show an organized localization around the nucleus (visualized with LaminB2-GFP). During early prophase, the nuclear envelop disassembles and germ cell granules change their shape (arrow). Once the envelope is completely disassembled granules that changed their shape readopt their spherical shape (arrowhead). All granules spread in the cytoplasm and are segregated into daughter cells. B) After cytokinesis, the nuclear envelope reassembles (n) and a group of granules spread in the cytoplasm readopt perinuclear localization (asterisk). Granules are labeled with Vasa-dsRed, nuclear envelope with LaminB2-GFP, and plasma membrane with farnesylated GFP. C) Movement of granules towards the nuclear envelope labeled with NUP155-GFP and visualized by confocal microscopy. Granules move directly (asterisk) to the area where the nuclear envelope is reassembling (n) during cytokinesis.

Granular movement takes place after the nuclear envelope has reassembled as visualized by the reformation of the Lamin B2 network and the accumulation of the nuclear pore complex component NUP155 (asterisks in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that the spherical shape of granules is not dependent on the nuclear envelope integrity. Moreover, during nuclear envelope re-assembly, all of the granules regain their perinuclear localization.</p></sec><sec><title>Ordered segregation of germ cell granules to daughter cells during mitosis</title><p>To investigate the partition of germ cell granules during cell division, we analyzed their distribution within the two daughter cells after mitosis. In all 13 cells undergoing mitosis that were analyzed, the granule distribution among daughter cells was equal for even numbers of granules or &#x000b1; 1 granule for odd number of granules (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> for table). However, the amount of granule material was not necessarily equally distributed. We therefore concluded that segregation of the granules in zebrafish germ cells during mitosis is not a random process but rather a regulated event that ensures segregation of similar units of this important structure.</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of germ cell granules with respect to microtubules</title><p>The process of germ plasm assembly during oogenesis has been studied extensively in invertebrates. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the assembly of germ plasm is dependent on the localization of <italic>oskar m</italic>RNA to the posterior pole of the oocyte, a process that requires microtubule function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Similarly, zebrafish germ plasm assembly occurs during the first hours following fertilization and involves microtubules as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To determine whether proper localization of germ cell granules at later stages of development depends on microtubules as well, we examined the positioning of microtubules relatisve to the germ cell granules during interphase and mitosis.</p><p>During interphase, germ cell granules appeared to be adjacent to microtubular structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Furthermore, &#x003b1;-Tubulin staining could be observed closely localized near germ cell granules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B,D</xref> arrowheads in tubulin panel, n depicts nucleus).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Microtubules colocalize with germ cell granules</bold>.

E) A close-up view of a germ cell of a 11 hpf embryos reveals flow of cytoplasmic granules not associated with microtubules (arrowhead) into the protrusion (asterisk) while others remain stable in colocalization with microtubules projected from the MTOC (arrow).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-8-58-3"/></fig><p>To investigate the relationship between microtubules and granule localization in live embryos, we performed time-lapse confocal microscopy of germ cells expressing Clip170-GFP fusion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In this analysis we found that a cage of microtubules, which originates from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> arrow) is formed around the germ cell nucleus. Microtubules appear to traverse perinuclear granules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, detail) and can project towards more distant granules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, detail). Interestingly, we observed that some distant germ cell granules do not appear to be associated with microtubules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, arrowheads) and as such, flow with the cytoplasmic stream into newly forming protrusions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, asterisk). In contrast, microtubule-associated granules remain fixed in the vicinity of the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> arrows). These observations are consistent with the idea that during interphase the association of the perinuclear granules with microtubular structures serves to anchor the granules in proximity to the nucleus, where they presumably exert their function.</p><p>Consistent with this notion is the finding that granule structure and localization are affected when microtubule depolarization is induced. Specifically, exposure of zebrafish embryos expressing H1M-GFP (which labels the chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]) along with Vasa-dsRed to nocodazole leads to aggregation of Vasa-positive granules resulting in enlarged structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> arrow). Control cells on the other hand, that are exposed to the solvent alone exhibit normal perinuclear distribution characteristic of that stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> arrow). Time-lapse microscopy of embryos expressing LaminB2-GFP and Vasa-dsRed treated with nocodazole revealed that following exposure to the drug granules fuse forming larger structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, asterisks). Such phenotype resulted from the complete disruption of microtubular structures, as judged by staining of microtubules and by loss of cell polarity needed for migration and motility (data not shown). These results suggest that microtubules and possibly nuclear envelope components are needed for proper structural maintenance of individual granules.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Granules structure is affected after microtubule disruption</bold>.

All experiments were done in 11 hpf embryos.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-8-58-4"/></fig><p>Next, we sought to determine whether microtubules could be involved in granule segregation during mitosis. During cell division, microtubule organization and dynamics serve to ensure proper distribution of different cellular components such as chromosomes and the Golgi apparatus to the forming daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We therefore followed the localization of granules of zebrafish germ cells during different stages of cell division with respect to microtubules. We observed that in germ cells stained for Vasa and &#x003b1;-Tubulin, some microtubular structures originating from the mitotic spindle appear to associate with germ cell granules during different stages of mitosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,B,C</xref> arrowhead, arrow and details). When analyzing fixed material (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), not all granules appear associated to microtubular structures. However, this is likely to result from microtubule disruption upon fixation and rather than absence of colocalization between these structures. In support of this notion, in live embryos germ cell granules move directionally and continuously along the spindle extension (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref> arrowhead) towards the forming nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, n depicts nucleus) during division (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> for movie). Granules elongate as they move from one cell to the other and re-adopt their spherical shape once they reach the area of the re-assembling nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref> arrowheads). Functional experiments using microtubule-depolymerizing agents could not be performed, since upon disruption of the microtubular network, mitosis was arrested.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Microtubules localization relative to germ cell granules during different stages of germ cell mitosis</bold>.

To examine the possibility that contraction of the cytokinetic ring might be the driving force for relocalization of germ cell granules to the nucleus, we inhibited cytokinesis by germ cell-specific expression of dominant negative RhoAN<sup>19</sup>. These cells are unable to form a contractile actin ring during cytokinesis due to the lack of functional RhoA, a protein known to regulate acto-myosin contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

DynL2-GFP is found in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of the germ cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,B</xref>), and significantly, it is also localized to germ cell granules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Interestingly, DynL2-GFP shows a dynamic localization pattern in the granules, varying from ring-like structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> left panel), small dots within granules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> middle panel), to asymmetric accumulations at the periphery of granules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> right panel).

The observation that DynL2-GFP localizes preferentially to large granules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;C</xref>,) is in line with the hypothesis that Dynein is required for granule fragmentation.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Dynein localize to germ cell granules and is involved in granule fragmentation</bold>.

For this purpose, we inhibited Dynein function by overexpression of the Dynactin subunit Dynamitin (also referred to as p50) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] in germ cells. Dynamitin overexpression is believed to disrupt the Dynactin complex, thereby inhibiting Dynein binding to its cargo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Strikingly, in 24 hpf embryos, primordial germ cells in which Dynein function is inhibited show a strong reduction in the number of Vasa-positive granules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E&#x02013;F</xref>). Namely, whereas germ cells of wild type (wt) embryos exhibit an average of 30 &#x000b1; 2.2 granules per cell, germ cells overexpressing Dynamitin contain on average only 15 &#x000b1; 0.6 granules per cell (p &#x0003c; 0.001). Concomitant with the reduction in granule number, a dramatic increase in granule size was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D,E,G</xref>). While the average cross section area of germ cell granules in control germ cells is 1.0 &#x003bc;m<sup>2 </sup>(&#x000b1; 0.1) (n = 191 granules in 17 cells from 10 embryos), in cells overexpressing Dynamitin the average area is 2.1 &#x003bc;m<sup>2 </sup>(&#x000b1; 0.2) (n = 154 granules in 26 cells from 10 embryos). These results indicate that Dynein is not involved in determining the total amount of germ cell granule material in the cell (which is roughly similar in control and experimental cells). Rather, dynein is involved in controlling the size of individual granules during the first 24 hours of zebrafish embryonic development. In addition to the effect on germ cell granules size and number, Dynamitin overexpression in germ cells resulted in a reduction in the number of germ cells to 78% (p &#x0003c; 0.001). We postulate that this phenotype reflects an additional role for Dynein in cell division.</p></sec><sec><title>Tdrd7 plays a crucial role for structural integrity of granules in PGCs</title><p>We assumed that in addition to the microtubule network and the associated machinery, granule-specific components are likely to participate in regulating granules distribution, size and number in germ cells. We chose to focus on the zebrafish tudor-repeat-containing gene <italic>Tdrd7</italic>, whose transcription was found to be higher in germ cells as compared with somatic cells in a microarray screen. <italic>Tdrd7 </italic>belongs to a family of genes, some of which we found to be expressed in zebrafish germ cells (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).

No effect on PGC specification, division or migration upon inhibition of <italic>Tdrd7 </italic>translation was observed, as the number of PGCs in control embryos and Tdrd7 knock down embryos was equal at 20 hpf and the PGCs migrated properly to the position where the gonad develops (data not shown). Moreover, early PGC markers such as vasa, nanos, dead end, h1m, as well as the expression of the differentiation marker ziwi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] were normally expressed in PGCs of Tdrd7 knock down embryos (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). Consequntly, embryos injected with Tdrd7 morpholino developed into fertile males and females (data not shown). However, a prominent phenotype of abnormal germ cell granule morphology was observed in 24 hpf treated embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> middle panel). In these embryos we observed large granules that resembled those observed in early developmental stages in wild-type embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In PGCs lacking Tdrd7, the average size of the largest granule in a cell is significantly increased (from 1,9 &#x003bc;m to 3,5 &#x003bc;m, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C,E</xref>). In addition, we observed an increase in the number of small granules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>), which is reflected by an alteration of granule size distribution in favor to extreme sizes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). This phenotype was readily reverted by co-injection of a morpholino-resistant mRNA encoding Tdrd7, confirming the specificity of the antisense oligonucleotide-induced phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> right panel). Thus, Tdrd7 function is important to guarantee the development of homogenous medium size granules over time and for normal number of granules in the germ cells. This phenotype was also demonstrated using Granulito as a marker for germ cell granules (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8A,B</xref>). Tdrd7 function appears be required in maintaining germ cell granule integrity independently of microtubules and dynein function as the distribution of microtubules and dynein is not affected in Tdrd7 knock down PGCs (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8C,D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have identified a novel germ cell component <italic>granulito</italic>. The mRNA of this gene is maternally provided and becomes localized to the germ plasm, while the protein fusion localizes to zebrafish germ cell granules. Knock down experiments using <italic>granulito </italic>morpholino antisense oligonucleotides failed to induce a discernible phenotype. This suggests that the function of the protein might be either masked by a redundant protein(s), or that <italic>granulito </italic>function is not essential during early development. Alternatively, maternally-provided Granulito protein could be sufficient for carrying out the role at the stages tested.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have taken advantage of the newly identified gene and generated <italic>granulito-dsRedEx </italic>transgenenic fish to serve as a valuable tool for investigating germ cell granule distribution during very early stages of PGC development, stages that previously had been inaccessible for <italic>in vivo </italic>analysis in live embryos. We found that the morphology of germ-cell granules is transformed from large aggregates seen at early developmental stages into small granules that assume perinuclear localization in the cell. Such a transition is believed to allow the symmetrical distribution of the material to both daughter cells during cell division, thereby enabling an increase in germ cell number as the cells proliferate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Following the distribution of germ-cell granules during the first 24 hours of embryonic development, we observed that as PGCs proliferate, the variation in granule sizes decreases. Analyzing the segregation of granules among daughter cells, we provide evidence that this process is not a random but rather follows an ordered segregation. Segregation of other cellular components (e.g. chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]) also follows an ordered partition and is dependent on microtubule function. Studies in <italic>C.elegans </italic>and zebrafish showed that microtubules are required for proper localization of germ plasm and germ cell specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Here we extended these studies to stages following PGC specification and demonstrate the presence of &#x003b1;-Tubulin within the granules and association of microtubules with granular structures. Furthermore, we show that during mitosis granules are found in close proximity to microtubules of the mitotic spindle, consistent with a role for microtubules in the ordered segregation of granules during cell division.</p><p>Granules are associated with microtubules during all stages of the cell cycle and seem to move along microtubule tracks during mitosis suggesting a functional interaction. We propose that microtubules of the spindle apparatus are part of a mechanism that ensures inheritance of granules by daughter cells after cell division. In this model, microtubules encounter and bind granules during centrosome repositioning in early stages of mitosis when these structures migrate towards the poles. Indeed, we could detect such an interaction during early germ-cell mitosis when presumed centrosomes are divided and move towards the poles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Attachment of the granules to microtubules upon disassembly of the nuclear envelope and movement towards the forming poles by spindle microtubule pull, would allow a controlled segregation of these structures during the subsequent steps of mitosis.</p><p>Although we could not functionally address the role of microtubules for granule segregation during cell division due to their requirement for cell division <italic>per se </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], exposure to the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole demonstrated the importance of intact microtubule organization for the structural properties of germ cell granules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The effect on granule morphology is unlikely to represent an indirect effect of the drug on nuclear envelope structure, as nuclear envelope disassembly alone during mitosis does not affect granule structure.</p><p>The notion that microtubules are important for the morphology and translocation of the granules is further supported by the finding that the motor protein Dynein localizes specifically to germ cell granules. Moreover, inhibition of Dynein cargo-loading function by inhibiting Dynein-Dynactin interaction resulted in an increase in granule size and a reduction in their number (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F,G</xref>). Dynein is thus implicated in the breaking up granules into smaller units during development. Interestingly, the novel <italic>Xenopus </italic>protein Germes, which is important for germ plasm morphology, germ cell survival and migration of these cells in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, localizes specifically to germ plasm and directly interacts with Dynein light chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The presence of germ plasm components that directly interact with Dynein motors in <italic>Xenopus </italic>is consistent with the role we propose it plays in granule morphology and distribution in zebrafish. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that Dynein interacts with components of germ cell granules in zebrafish PGCs and that granules use microtubules to slide on, to be pulled and to break apart. Another possible scenario of dynein-granule interaction would be the association between components of the dynactin complex like Arp1 with Actin through Spectrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Such possibility is supported by the finding that actin is abundant in germ cell granules (data not shown). As described in the results, inhibition of dynein by dynamitin over expression led to a mild (20%) reduction in the total number of germ cells, cells that undergo 2&#x02013;4 cell divisions during the first 24 hours of development. If the number of cell divisions is important for the developmental age perceived by the cells, then inhibition of cell division would result in germ cells having the germ plasm morphology of PGCs at an earlier developmental stage thus contributing to the severity of the observed germ plasm morphology phenotype.</p><p>In order to identify genes that are specifically expressed in granules and are involved in granule structural maintenance, we analyzed proteins containing tudor-repeat domains that were previously shown to be involved in polar granule structural integrity in Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and mice nuage maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Similar to the <italic>Drosophila tudor </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], <italic>Tdrd7 </italic>is localized to the germ plasm yet, formation of germ cells in Tdrd7-depleted zebrafish embryos appears unaffected. As our experimental approach does not inhibit maternal protein function, we cannot exclude a role for Tdrd7 protein in germ cell specification during early stages of zebrafish development.</p><p>Despite normal PGC specification and migration observed in <italic>Tdrd7 </italic>morphants, germ cell granule structure integrity is abnormal. This finding is in agreement with the findings of Arkov <italic>et al</italic>. that proposed that Tudor-domains serve as a docking platform for polar granule assembly in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and demonstrated that specific Tudor domains are required for proper granule architecture and germ cell formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In Drosophila embryos lacking Tudor function, polar granules fail to assemble and no PGCs are specified. Hypomorphic alleles show reduced number and size as well as abnormal morphology for polar granules, a phenotype that might signify a common function for the zebrafish and <italic>Drosophila </italic>proteins. As granule size at 4 hpf wt PGCs appeared larger than that in Tdrd7 knock-down cells at 24 hpf (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref><italic>4 hpf wt </italic>with 7E <italic>24 hpf Tdrd7 knock down</italic>), we assume that the observed phenotype is primarily caused by defects in the maturation process, although we could not exclude some Tdrd7 function required for keeping small granules separated.</p><p>The severe disruption of granule architecture due to Tdrd7 protein loss-of-function in early stages may hint at a critical role of the protein during later stages of germ cell development. For example, germ cells of mice deficient in Tdrd1 initially migrate and develop normally. However, male mice are sterile due to lack of mature sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In these mutants, the inter-mitochondrial cement, an essential subset of nuage in mouse, is strongly reduced. Mice carrying mutant forms of RNF17, another Tudor domain containing protein, show a similar phenotype to that of Tdrd1 knockouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. RNF17 localizes to a new form of nuage, RNF17-granules; RNF17 knockouts lack these granules and the male mice are infertile as well. As embryos injected with Tdrd7 morpholino (that inhibits translation only transiently) gave rise to fertile males and females we conclude that the early Tdrd7 function is not essential for fertility.</p><p>Since several genes contain tudor domains, <italic>Tdrd7 </italic>could be redundant with another yet-to-be-identified gene of the same family. As presented in the supplemental figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, we sought to identify other tudor domain containing proteins that are expressed in zebrafish germ cells. Indeed, we found that following the second day of development, <italic>Tdrd1 </italic>and <italic>RNF17 </italic>are specifically expressed in germ cells along with <italic>Tdrd7</italic>, suggesting a possible role for these genes in zebrafish germ cell development at later stages. Yet, Tdrd7 has been the only identified tudor domain-containing gene to be expressed during early zebrafish germ cell development.

To inhibit cytokinesis, mRNA of pSP64T-<italic>N19RhoA-nos1</italic>-3'UTR was injected.</p><p>Full length <italic>Tdrd7 </italic>was cloned and confirmed with 5'Race (accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EF643554">EF643554</ext-link>). For studying the subcellular localization of Tdrd7 protein, pSP64-<italic>egfp-Tdrd7-</italic>3'UTR was used.

To examine the functionality of the morpholino, <italic>vasa-dsRedEx-nos1-</italic>3'UTR and <italic>granulito-EYFP-nos1</italic>-3'UTR (each 300 pg RNA) were co-injected with 0.3 pmol <italic>granulito </italic>morpholino into the yolk of one-cell stage embryos and specific inhibition of EYFP expression was observed. Knockdown experiments with <italic>Tdrd7 </italic>morpholino antisense oligonucleotide injection (0.3 pmol, GeneTools) were performed using two independent morpholinos Mo1 (AACCAACTCCACGTCACTCATCCTG) and Mo2 (TCCTGCCGTTTTCTCTTCACACTTG). To examine the function of the morpholinos, <italic>vasa-dsRedEx-nos1-</italic>3'UTR (300 pg RNA) and <italic>Tdrd7-eyfp-nos1</italic>-3'UTR (600 pg RNA) were co-injected with 0.3 pmol Tdrd7 morpholino into the yolk of one-cell stage embryos and a specific inhibition of EYFP was observed. In addition, the <italic>Tdrd7 </italic>morpholino induced phenotype was reverted by injection of a morpholino resistant <italic>Tdrd7 </italic>mRNA. For this, <italic>Tdrd7 </italic>was amplified with a forward primer containing mutations at the morpholino-binding site 5'TTTAGATCTACCATGAGCGATGTCGAATTAGTGAAGAAGATGCTGCGAGC3' and reverse primer 5'AAATCTAGATAATACAACAAAACCTGAACACC3' from ovary cDNA.</p><p>Nocodazole (CALBIOCHEM) was prepared as a stock solution of 10 mg/ml in DMSO, and used at a concentration of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml.

Alternatively, when labeling cytoskeleton structures, 100% methanol at -20&#x000b0;C was used in order to preserve structures. After fixation, the embryos were washed three times for 5 minutes with PBTX (PBT, 0.2% Triton &#x000d7;-100) and subsequently blocked with PBTB (PBT, 0.2% Triton &#x000d7;-100, 1% BSA) for 1 hour. The embryos were incubated in the blocking solution containing the primary antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. anti-GFP antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology 1:200, anti-vasa antibody 1:2000 (Kindly provided by C. N&#x000fc;sslein-Volhard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). The monoclonal antibody against &#x003b1;-tubulin (Sigma clone DM1A) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Anti-nucleoporin monoclonal antibody (MAb414, Covance Research (Hiss Diagnostics) catalog number MMS-120R) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. The embryos were then washed with PBTX 8 times for at least 30 minutes each. Thereafter, they were incubated with the secondary antibody (1:200 Alexa Fluor488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and 1:200 Alexa Fluor546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Molecular Probes) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The embryos were then washed with PBTX for several hours and observed by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SL).</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence microscopy and imaging of live cells</title><p>Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope controlled by the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging).
