Using retroviral transduction of bone marrow progenitors followed by transplantation into mice, we demonstrate that inhibition of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation impairs competition, promoting the expansion of progenitors that acquire oncogenic mutations which restore cell cycle progression. Conditions that impair DNA replication dramatically enhance the proliferative advantage provided by the expression of Bcr-Abl or mutant p53, which provide no apparent competitive advantage under conditions of healthy replication. Furthermore, for the <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic> oncogene the competitive advantage in contexts of impaired DNA replication dramatically increases leukemogenesis. Impaired replication within hematopoietic progenitor cell pools can select for oncogenic events and thereby promote leukemia, demonstrating the importance of replicative competence in the prevention of tumorigenesis. The demonstration that replication-impaired, poorly competitive progenitor cell pools can promote tumorigenesis provides a new rationale for links between tumorigenesis and common human conditions of impaired DNA replication such as dietary folate deficiency, chemotherapeutics targeting dNTP synthesis, and polymorphisms in genes important for DNA metabolism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The authors show that the replicative competence of normal body cells can influence the rate of outgrowth of cells that carry an oncogene, helping explain a poorly understood aspect of carcinogenesis. </p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite significant advances in leukemia research, the factors that promote the selection and expansion of mutated cells leading to leukemia are not well known.

Acquired mutations contributing to leukemogenesis, including chromosomal translocations that generate oncogenic fusion genes, may need to occur in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as these cells have sufficient lifespan necessary for the acquisition of additional mutagenic hits.

As we find that c-Kit is down-regulated on Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Sca1<sup>+</sup> cells post-BMT (unpublished data), we have been unable to further examine Bcr-Abl expression among highly defined HSC. In summary, Bcr-Abl expression provides a dramatic competitive advantage to progenitor cells in the replication-impaired DKO background, but not in the replication-competent <italic>E2f1</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>2</italic><sup>+</sup> background.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The Expression of Bcr-Abl Restores S Phase Progression in DKO Progenitor Cells</title><p>The competitive expansion of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells relative to untransduced cells in the DKO background could be the result of overcoming cell cycle defects observed in DKO progenitors. To test this possibility, we assayed the effect of Bcr-Abl expression on S-phase progression rates in DKO progenitor cells using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-chase method &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Two weeks post-BMT, at which point no signs of leukemia development were evident, mice were injected with BrdU and then sacrificed after 2 h. BrdU injection essentially provides a short pulse of the label, since BrdU half-life in vivo is very short &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Following flow cytometric isolation of GFP<sup>+</sup> Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> progenitors from the spleen, the average DNA content of BrdU-positive cells was assayed by propidium iodide (PI) intensity profiling. The rates of S phase progression were determined as the shift of the average PI intensity from the middle of S phase toward the G2 peak using formulas described by Begg et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the calculated progression rates do not provide accurate absolute values for S phase length, since the presumption that the average PI intensity lies in the middle of S phase is not true for DKO cells (which accumulate in early S phase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b07">7</xref>&#x0005d;), this method can still accurately analyze the changes of the rates caused by Bcr-Abl expression. Significantly, while S phase progression is substantially slowed in DKO progenitor cells, as previously reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b07">7</xref>&#x0005d;, the expression of Bcr-Abl in these cells essentially restored S phase progression to control progression rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, the expression of Bcr-Abl had no noticeable effects on S phase progression in wild-type progenitors. In addition, we previously showed that a fraction of DKO BM progenitors appear arrested in S phase, exhibiting S phase DNA content but no detectable BrdU incorporation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b07">7</xref>&#x0005d;. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, Bcr-Abl expression in DKO progenitors prevents the accumulation of this S phase-arrested population.</p><p>Thus, the competitive advantage provided by Bcr-Abl expression to DKO progenitors appears to derive from restored cell cycle progression. Furthermore, as we find that the expression of Bcl2 does not provide an advantage to DKO progenitors relative to wild-type progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>), the ability of Bcr-Abl to block apoptosis does not appear to underlie the selective advantage conferred by Bcr-Abl expression in the DKO background, although decreased apoptosis could be a contributing factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The DKO Background Promotes Bcr-Abl-Mediated Leukemogenesis</title><p>As leukemogenesis appears to require initiating mutations in stem or progenitor cell populations, we addressed whether the greater competitive advantage provided to Bcr-Abl-expressing DKO progenitors translates to increased tumor incidence in transplanted mice. Strikingly, all recipients of <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic>-transduced DKO progenitors developed rapid pre-B ALL-like disease using both low and high initial transduction efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g004">4</xref>B), preceded by rapid increases of peripheral GFP<sup>+</sup> B220<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g002">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">S1</xref>). In contrast, only about half of the recipients of <italic>E2f1</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells transduced at high efficiency, and none of the recipients at low transduction efficiency, developed leukemia (also pre-B ALL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g004">Figure 4</xref>). For leukemias arising in both genetic backgrounds, leukemic infiltrates were evident in spleen, liver, and lung, and peripheral blood GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressed low B220, exhibiting a large, immature morphology with pale-staining nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and unpublished data).

To directly address this issue, we included <italic>E2f1</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>2</italic><sup>+</sup> untransduced competitor cells with <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic>-transduced DKO progenitors; amazingly, these competitors were able to almost completely eliminate leukemogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g004">4</xref>B). <italic>E2f1</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>2</italic><sup>+</sup> competitors also substantially reversed the selective advantage conferred by Bcr-Abl expression in the DKO background as reflected in peripheral blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g002">Figures 2</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g002">2</xref>B, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">S1</xref>) and within stem cell-enriched populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Similarly, transplantation of <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic>-transduced DKO progenitors into sublethally irradiated recipients resulted in the rebound of host (wild-type) hematopoiesis and complete prevention of leukemias (unpublished data). Thus, enhanced leukemogenesis is not primarily due to cell autonomous effects of <italic>E2f1</italic> and <italic>E2f2</italic> loss, but most likely results from the poor ability of DKO progenitor cells to compete with Bcr-Abl-expressing DKO progenitors.</p><p>Importantly, these results suggest that the failure of many recipients of <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic>-transduced <italic>E2f1</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>2</italic><sup>+</sup> (particularly at low transduction efficiency) to develop leukemia was not due to our inability to introduce <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic> into the appropriate progenitor cells, but to the inability of <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitors to be maintained in the face of replication competent competitors. Finally, while it remains formally possible that DKO stem/progenitor cells home poorly to BM niches and that Bcr-Abl restores homing to DKO progenitors, the fact that a low percentage of cotransplanted <italic>E2f1</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>2</italic><sup>+</sup> BM can reverse the selective expansion of <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic><sup>+</sup> DKO progenitors and leukemogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">S1</xref>) strongly argues against a role for differential homing in genotype-dependent leukemia rates.</p><p>In summary, a DKO progenitor pool promotes Bcr-Abl-dependent leukemogenesis due to the inability of untransduced DKO progenitors to provide effective competition.

The rapid competitive advantage provided by Bcr-Abl specifically following HU treatment in vivo, together with the almost immediate selection for Bcr-Abl expression by HU ex vivo, argues that HU-induced mutagenesis does not account for the effects of HU on the competitive expansion of <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitors.</p><p>To understand why Bcr-Abl provides such an advantage specifically following HU treatment, we analyzed cell cycle progression in Bcr-Abl-expressing progenitors in vivo using the same method used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g003">Figure 3</xref>.

This result provides a mechanistic insight into why HU treatment improves the competitive expansion of Bcr-Abl-expressing progenitors in vivo and ex vivo: While HU impedes the proliferation of competing progenitors, Bcr-Abl overcomes this block.

By treating with HU starting 2 wk post-BMT, potential effects of HU on retroviral infection efficiency or homing to BM niches are avoided. Strikingly, all of the HU-treated mice developed a pre-B ALL-like disease within 2 mo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g007">Figure 7</xref>A) preceded by increases in the percentages of <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in the B220<sup>+</sup> subset (unpublished data).

Studies in search of connections between genetic polymorphisms, dietary factors, and environmental exposures that predispose to cancer are often predicated on the assumption that increased cancer rates in part result from the enhancement of proliferation by these conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;. We show that the opposite can be true. Our data indicate that the reduced ability of progenitor cell pools to proliferate actually promotes tumorigenesis, in that cells acquiring mutations that improve proliferation outcompete poorly replicating competitors. In contrast, a replication-competent pool is inherently tumor-suppressive, and otherwise oncogenic mutations may not be favored.</p><p>We have shown that within a wild-type, healthy progenitor cell pool, Bcr-Abl expression or p53 inhibition does not provide an apparent selective advantage. In contrast, in contexts of impaired DNA replication of blood progenitors, expression of Bcr-Abl or inhibition of p53 provides an immediate advantage within progenitor pools. The expression of Bcr-Abl bypasses the S phase blocks imposed by <italic>E2f</italic> mutation or HU treatment, consistent with the known ability of Bcr-Abl to abrogate cell cycle checkpoints. As Bcr-Abl expression provides an immediate competitive advantage following HU treatment ex vivo, the advantage appears to result from the better proliferation of <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic><sup>+</sup> cells relative to untransduced peers, not effects of HU on mutagenesis or the immune system, or other potential complications found in vivo. Most importantly, replication-impaired contexts (both genetic and chemotherapeutic) can substantially promote Bcr-Abl-dependent leukemias. That Bcr-Abl-expressing cells with restored S phase progression outcompete untransduced cells with highly impaired replication provides a logical explanation for the promotion of leukemogenesis by HU treatment and <italic>E2f1/E2f2</italic> loss. Indeed, the promotion of Bcr-Abl-dependent leukemias by <italic>E2F</italic> mutation is not due to cell autonomous contributions of <italic>E2f1/E2f2</italic> loss, as <italic>E2f1</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>2</italic><sup>+</sup> competitors virtually eliminate leukemias resulting from Bcr-Abl expression in DKO progenitors. Thus, healthy competitors are potently tumor-suppressive.</p><p>The presented results support a model whereby the reduced proliferation of blood progenitors provides a powerful selection for oncogenic mutations that improve cell cycle progression. In essence, impeded proliferation of progenitor cells provides for poor competition, promoting the expansion of progenitors that acquire oncogenic mutations which relieve cell cycle blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030401-g009">Figure 9</xref>). In addition, the ability of some oncogenic mutations to impede apoptosis resulting from checkpoint activation might further contribute to a net competitive advantage. It has been previously proposed that carcinogen-mediated inhibition of cell survival or proliferation can select for oncogenically mutated cells resistant to these conditions (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d; and references therein). Analogously, we show that conditions that impair DNA replication in the entire population of progenitor cells select for oncogenic mutations that initiate tumorigenesis. In contrast, oncogenic mutations prove less advantageous or even disadvantageous in a normal hematopoietic system, as cell cycle progression in the progenitor pool is already efficient, and checkpoints should not be activated. Finally, contexts that involve nucleotide deprivation and DNA damage, and thus impeded DNA replication, may enhance mutation accumulation, and mutator phenotypes should synergize with poor competition to promote tumorigenesis. Thus, these conditions provide not only an increased chance for the acquisition of initiating mutations, but also a poorly competitive environment that favors the expansion of these oncogenically mutated cells. In this regard, it is unlikely that all conditions that globally impair cell cycle progression in a stem cell pool will promote tumorigenesis, particularly if these impaired contexts cannot be easily overcome by oncogenic mutation or do not sufficiently promote mutation accumulation. Moreover, while impaired replication can clearly select for the expression of oncogenes such as Bcr-Abl and DNp53, other oncogenic events (like Bcl2 overexpression) may not be selected for and may even be selected against.</p><p>The low leukemia incidence that we observed in the replication competent-backgrounds may seem at odds with previous reports of efficient induction of CML-like disease in recipients of MSCV-<italic>Bcr-Abl</italic>-transduced BM cells using high-efficiency infections &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;. So why would MSCV-<italic>Bcr-Abl</italic> transduction result in rapid and penetrant onset of leukemia with high- but not low-efficiency infection, given that normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and thus healthy competitors, are still present in both cases? One possibility is that the resulting high percentage of cells expressing Bcr-Abl could result in substantial autocrine stimulation, which may not reflect the normal context of a rare <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic> fusion event. Indeed, expression of Bcr-Abl in cytokine-dependent cell lines leads to growth factor-independent proliferation associated with autocrine production of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte/monocyte-colony stimulating factor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b40">40</xref>&#x0005d;, and increased levels of IL-3 are detected in serum in murine models of CML &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

Autocrine stimulation by Bcr-Abl-expressing cells and inhibition of normal hematopoiesis should have a far greater impact when a large percentage of cells express Bcr-Abl, as compared to the physiological context of an initiating mutation leading to the expression of the oncogene in a single clone. Nonetheless, these activities could still be very relevant to the progression of <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic><sup>+</sup> leukemias, in that once a <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic><sup>+</sup> clone has reached some critical mass, the clone may promote its own competitive expansion even in the face of normal hematopoietic competitors. Finally, high-efficiency transduction of progenitors should increase the chance of secondary mutations that promote Bcr-Abl-dependent leukemogenesis, including gene alterations mediated by retroviral integrations.</p><p>An important point is that most of the recipients of control (<italic>E2f1</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>2</italic><sup>+</sup> or wild-type without HU) progenitors transduced with Bcr-Abl did not develop leukemia. Indeed, for surviving mice, GFP expression in peripheral blood became undetectable (unpublished data), indicating that Bcr-Abl expression is disfavored in stem cell pools in the long-term. The facts that (1) the same pool of <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic>-transduced BM progenitors was transferred into recipients that subsequently were mock- or HU-treated, and (2) all HU-treated <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic> recipients rapidly developed leukemia, indicate that most of the nonleukemic mice in the control group did receive <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitors capable of causing leukemia, but that these cells were not maintained. In contrast, HU treatment clearly promoted the expansion of <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, stimulating leukemogenesis. Analogously, <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic>, <italic>IgH-Bcl2</italic>, and <italic>LMO2-TCR</italic> translocations are frequently found in nonleukemic individuals who do not subsequently develop leukemias &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b45">45</xref>&#x0005d;.

In light of the data presented here, we suggest that the relative inability of progenitor cells possessing <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic> translocations to competitively expand and to acquire additional mutations under most contexts limits the development of leukemia.</p><p>Our result that HU promotes Bcr-Abl-dependent leukemias may seem surprising, given that HU is used for cytoreduction of CML cells in patients. However, in human disease the leukemic cells are already established and dominant, while our experiments are more relevant to the context of leukemia initiation. Thus, our use of HU may be less pertinent to the use of this drug to treat CML, but can be viewed as a general means to suppress S phase progression in the hematopoietic system, which is relevant to the effects of clinically used drugs or other conditions that inhibit DNA replication in progenitor populations. Indeed, a number of contexts that have been presumed or demonstrated to reduce dNTP production are associated with increased cancer rates, including folate deficiency &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d; and polymorphisms resulting in decreased thymidylate synthase expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b47">47</xref>&#x0005d;. These contexts of dNTP restriction are thought to promote cancer in part by increasing mutation rates, and our results suggest that poorly competitive stem cell pools also play an important role. While links between <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic><sup>+</sup> CML or ALL incidence and dietary variables or polymorphisms affecting dNTP metabolism have not been sufficiently examined, based on our demonstration that the inhibition of dNTP synthesis by HU promotes Bcr-Abl-dependent leukemias, such studies are warranted.</p><p>HU induces replication-associated double-stranded DNA breaks in cultured cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;, although whether HU induces DNA damage or mutagenesis in vivo is still unresolved.

While clinical experiences are insufficiently controlled to conclude that antimetabolite therapies contribute to secondary leukemias, our demonstration that a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits dNTP synthesis can promote leukemia suggests that this issue needs to be further addressed in the clinic. The inhibition of DNA replication by antimetabolites may promote the competitive expansion of progenitor cells acquiring etoposide-induced oncogenic mutations, much as HU promotes the expansion of Bcr-Abl-expressing progenitors. Thus, conditions that generally impair DNA replication, such as drugs that inhibit dNTP synthesis, may function as tumor promoters for oncogenically initiated cells by creating a poorly competitive environment. This view contrasts with the generally described function of tumor promoters as enhancers of proliferation.</p><p>Finally, while numerous properties of E2F1 and E2F2, including gene repression and the promotion of apoptosis and DNA repair, have been suggested to underlie observed increases in tumors in <italic>E2f1</italic> and <italic>E2f2</italic> mutant mice (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030401-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;), we demonstrate that the promotion of Bcr-Abl-dependent leukemias and the expansion of <italic>p53</italic> mutant cells by <italic>E2f1/E2f2</italic> disruption result from non-cell autonomous consequences of <italic>E2f</italic> loss. According to our model, <italic>E2f1/E2f2</italic> mutations at least in part predispose mice to tumors, since the <italic>E2f</italic> genes are disrupted in all cells in the mouse, thus providing a poorly competitive progenitor population. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in <italic>E2f1</italic> or <italic>E2f2</italic> in an individual cell would not be expected to provide an advantage to the cell, and thus would not contribute to tumorigenesis, thus perhaps explaining the paucity of such mutations in human tumors. Poor competition should select for oncogenic mutations only when the entire population of competing cells are similarly debilitated.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that impaired DNA replication in hematopoietic progenitor pools contributes to a powerful selection for mutations (such as Bcr-Abl translocation) that improve cell cycle progression, providing a selective advantage over the poor competition offered by replication-debilitated progenitors and thus promoting leukemogenesis. As cancer development has attributes clearly reminiscent of Darwinian evolution, it is logical that it should become easier for a mutant cell clone to be the &#x0201c;fittest&#x0201d; as the quality of the competition declines.
