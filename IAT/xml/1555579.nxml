The effectors of repression are large multimeric complexes which contain both the repressor proteins that bind to transcription factors and a number of co-repressors that actually mediate transcriptional silencing either by inhibiting the basal transcription machinery or by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>TBLR1 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM024665">NM024665</ext-link>] is a co-repressor of nuclear hormone transcription factors. A single highly conserved gene encodes a small family of protein molecules. Different isoforms are produced by differential exon utilization. Although the ORF of the predominant form contains only 1545 bp, the human gene occupies ~200 kb of genomic DNA on chromosome 3q and contains 16 exons. The genomic sequence overlaps with the putative DC42 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM030921">NM030921</ext-link>] locus. The murine homologue is structurally similar and is also located on Chromosome 3. TBLR1 is closely related (79% homology at the mRNA level) to TBL1X and TBL1Y, which are located on Chromosomes X and Y. The expression of TBLR1 overlaps but is distinct from that of TBL1. An alternatively spliced form of TBLR1 has been demonstrated in human material and it too has an unique pattern of expression. TBLR1 and the homologous genes interact with proteins that regulate the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors. In resting cells TBLR1 is primarily cytoplasmic but after perturbation the protein translocates to the nucleus. TBLR1 co-precipitates with SMRT, a co-repressor of nuclear hormone receptors, and co-precipitates in complexes immunoprecipitated by antiserum to HDAC3. Cells engineered to over express either TBLR1 or N- and C-terminal deletion variants, have elevated levels of endogenous N-CoR. Co-transfection of TBLR1 and SMRT results in increased expression of SMRT. This co-repressor undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation and we suggest that the stabilization of the co-repressors by TBLR1 occurs because of a novel mechanism that protects them from degradation. Transient over expression of TBLR1 produces growth arrest.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TBLR1 is a multifunctional co-repressor of transcription. The structure of this family of molecules is highly conserved and closely related co-repressors have been found in all eukaryotic organisms. Regulation of co-repressor expression and the consequent alterations in transcriptional silencing play an important role in the regulation of differentiation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>TBLR1 is a transcriptional regulator interacting with the co-repressors of nuclear hormone receptor activity. We cloned the gene encoding this protein and identified it as a member of a small family of proteins that include at least two isoforms encoded by the same gene and closely related, X- and Y linked proteins, called TBL1X and TBL1Y. The TBLR1 protein interacts with NHR (nuclear hormone receptors), a class of molecules that plays a critical role in transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These co-repressors mediate the down-regulation of gene expression and play important roles in the life and death choices that regulate normal development.</p><p>The nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily is a large family of mainly ligand-dependent transcription factors that play a role in the regulation of reproduction, growth, differentiation, and homeostasis. Members of the family share several structural features including a conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) that targets the receptor to hormone response element (HRE) sequences. The carboxyl-end of the receptors contains a ligand-binding domain (LBD) in which is embedded a hormone-dependent transcriptional activation domain. The LBD serves as a molecular switch that recruits co-activator or co-repressor proteins that regulate transcription of the target genes. Ligand-dependent receptors like the thyroid hormone receptor (T3R) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) stimulate transcription when ligand is bound and repress it when the ligand is absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>N-CoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] were the first identified co-repressors. They fill overlapping but non-redundant roles in regulating transcription. Both SMRT and N-CoR exist in multi- protein complexes that have an estimated size of 1.5&#x02013;2 mDa. A SMRT complex, isolated by a combination of conventional and immunoaffinity chromatography has been shown to contain histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and transducin (beta)-like I (TBL1). The HDAC3-containing, SMRT and N-CoR complexes can bind to unliganded thyroid hormone receptors (T3Rs) <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although both co-repressors are expressed widely, extensive hematological abnormalities, including blocks in erythrocyte and T-cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], follow targeted deletion of N-CoR.</p><p>Co-repressors mediate transcriptional silencing by inhibiting the basal transcription machinery and by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] Histone deacetylation, which produces a more compact chromatin structure that is inaccessible to transcriptional activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], appears to be the predominant means of chromatin modification. Studies of RAR and T3R show that ligand binding leads to the displacement of an HDAC-containing complex from the nuclear receptor in exchange for a histone acetyltransferase (HAT)-containing complex and this may serve as a general mechanism for switching nuclear receptors from a transcriptionally repressive to a transcriptionally active state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Changes in repression correlate with alterations in the level of N-CoR and/or SMRT. These levels are regulated by both the rate of synthesis of the co-repressors and, more dramatically, by their rate of degradation. Targeted proteolysis of transcriptional co-regulators has been established as a mechanism for cell-specific regulation of gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although the composition of the repressor complex is not fully understood, both TBLR1 and a protein called TBL1 that is highly homologous to TBLR1, are present and in some cells, the extent of transcriptional repression correlates with the amount of TBL1 present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>We originally isolated TBLR1 as a 201 bp fragment in a cDNA library prepared from a bone marrow preparation highly enriched for human hematopoietic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This fragment, which had no homology with any sequence in the GenBank, hybridized with RNA from K562 (a human erythroleukemia cell line) and a placental library and cDNAs prepared from these tissues were used as a source of mRNAs for subsequent analysis. 5' RACE identified an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative 514 a.a. protein. In this paper, we report the structure of the TBLR1 gene and analyze its pattern of expression. These results indicate that alternative splicing of the mRNA results in the formation of at least two protein isoforms (termed &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;). Over expression of TBLR1 interferes with cell replication. Like TBL1, TBLR1 forms a complex with nuclear co-repressors and appears to play a role in stabilizing the active co-repressor complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The TBLR1 family</title><p>Human TBLR1 exists as two isoforms that differ at their carboxyl end. The original isolate (now termed TBLR1&#x003b1; [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM024665">NM024665</ext-link>] was characterized using 5' extension of an mRNA fragment identified by differential amplification of subtracted cDNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This sequence contained a complete open reading frame (ORF) and <italic>in vitro </italic>translation of an RNA prepared from the full-length cDNA, yielded a product of the predicted size (data not shown). Because the size of the assembled sequence (3.9 kB) was significantly smaller than the 7.6 kB message identified by Northern blotting (see below), a series of primers were constructed for use in 3' RACE in an attempt to identify RNA sequences that extended beyond the poly A site that characterized the 3' end of the original molecule. While none of these attempts was successful, primers selected from the middle of the ORF (bridging exons 13 and 14) revealed the existence of two messages that were identical at their 5' ends but differed at their 3' ends. The second of these mRNAs is termed TBLR1&#x003b2; [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF268194">AF268194</ext-link>]. Examination of the genomic sequence encoding TBLR1 revealed that these were produced by the failure of recognition of the splice donor site that normally demarcates the end of exon 14. In the variant, the following intron is not removed from the transcribed mRNA. It is translated to produce the alternative beta form. Thus the two isoforms are identical through exon 14 but the 15<sup>th </sup>exon of the beta variant is encoded by a sequence that begins immediately after exon 14 without an intervening splice. while the exon 15 of the alpha form is encoded by a sequence located 6000 bp down stream. The deduced amino acid sequences of the divergent carboxyl-ends are included in the Materials and Methods section.</p><p>The nucleic acid sequence encoding TBLR1&#x003b1; is highly conserved. At the nucleic acid level the similarity in the open reading frame between the human and mouse genes is 89% but interestingly, in the 3' UTR, the first 500 bp have the same degree of similarity (88%) as the open reading frame. The next several 100 bp contain several smaller regions (40 &#x02013; 70 bp) of almost complete identity. The sequence of the human mRNA recorded in GenBank [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM024665">NM024665</ext-link>] is 3950 bp; the homologous murine sequence [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF268195">AF268195</ext-link>] containing the open reading frame is 1800 bp but the 3' end of this sequence shares a 400 bp overlap with the 5' end of a 1750 bp cDNA sequence [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BCO18512">BCO18512</ext-link>], suggesting that the full-length message is actually at least 3150 bp. The human [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP078941">NP078941</ext-link>] and mouse proteins are remarkably similar (98% identity).</p><p>TBLR1 has a high degree of similarity (90% identity or conservative substitution) to a pair of proteins encoded on the X and Y chromosomes (TBLX1 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP005638">NP005638</ext-link>] and TBLY1 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP150600">NP150600</ext-link>]. The mouse TBL1 protein [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XP135950">XP135950</ext-link>] is equally well conserved (92% similar). These proteins are also highly homologous to a drosophila protein known as <italic>Ebi </italic>[GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EA.A.12470">EA.A.12470</ext-link>; 85% similar] as well as to <italic>Anopheles gambiae </italic>[GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EA.A.12470">EA.A.12470</ext-link>; 82% similar] and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>[GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP201533">NP201533</ext-link>; 73% similar] proteins. The yeast protein SIF2p, a SIR4 interacting factor [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP009661">NP009661</ext-link>] is 43% similar, indicating wide evolutionary conservation. Highly homologous proteins have also been found in chimpanzees, dogs, cows fish and chickens.

The gene occupies ~200,000 bp and the coding structure is assembled from 18 exons. Neither the first nor the last of these are included in the current Genebank assembly but are included here as result of Northern blotting evidence. The translational start site is located in the 5<sup>th </sup>exon and is ~150 kb downstream from the first exon. The actual 3' end of the gene extends at least 2.2 kB beyond the sequence that we originally reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A probe synthesized to detect the hypothetical protein DC42 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM030921">NM030921</ext-link>] which is located 3' of the previously characterized end of <italic>TBLR1</italic>, hybridizes with the mRNA encoding TBLR1 (see below). The sequence reported for <italic>DC42 </italic>encodes a putative small (102 a.a.) intronless protein that has no significant similarity to any other protein in GenBank from any organism. The mouse sequence is assembled from 16 exons and is located on chromosome 3 (between 3A2 and 3A3). The structure of the human gene is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Map of exons from TBLR1&#x003b1; and TBLR1&#x003b2; transcripts on the human chromosome 3q23 genomic sequence</bold>.

The results are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>. Expression varies widely from tissue to tissue. In many tissues, including thymus, spleen, thyroid, lung and brain TBLR1 expression exceeded TBL1. On the other hand, in ovary, prostate and placenta, which have the highest overall levels of these mRNAs TBL1 greatly exceeded TBLR1. Little correlation was found between TBLR1 expression and TBL1 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>) but expression of TBLR1&#x003b2;, the splice variant, generally correlated with the expression of the predominant alpha form (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). The proportion of the splice variant varied from tissue to tissue but in no case was it the predominant form. Northern analyses with probes from different regions of the TBLR1 message (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>) produced complex results. A probe from the 3' untranslated region detects a 7.6 kb transcript in many tissues. Hybridization with a probe containing the 5' end of the ORF identified 3 mRNAs. In addition to the 7.6 kb band there is an abundant 3.9 kb message and a variably expressed band of ~4.9 kb that is most often detected in hematopoietic tissues. Mouse tissues show a similar pattern. An oligonucleotide probe specific for the 3' end of TBLR1&#x003b2; detected only the 4.9 kb mRNA. Hybridization with a probe designed to detect the theoretical protein DC42, which maps 2.2 kb downstream from the presumed 3' terminus of the message, hybridizes with a 7.6 kb message that appears to be identical to the one detected by probes that hybridize with the ORF. Hybridization with a probe designed to detect the cDNA sequence [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AK02 2268">AK02 2268</ext-link>] also detects the 7.6 kb transcript of TBLR1. This sequence was identified in a human mammary cDNA library and maps in the large first intron deduced from the genomic sequence. It is not present in either our original isolate or any of the subsequently isolated clones. Its presence in the predominant transcript detected by Northern analysis of TBLR1 indicates the presence of additional splice variants of this gene. Hybridization with this probe also detects an ~3.7 kb RNA whose origin is unknown.

This later antiserum does not react with TBL1 at all and enabled us to distinguish between TBLR1 and TBL1 in mouse tissues. TBLR1 was first isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using the antiserum that distinguishes between TBLR1 and TBL1 and the eluted material was electrophoresed and then blotted with anti TBLR1&#x003b1; and anti TBLR1&#x003b2; antisera. The pattern produced by anti TBLR1&#x003b1; using mouse tissues is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>. The anti TBLR1&#x003b2; antiserum is unfortunately not useful for western blotting. Despite our inability to detect the mouse beta form by western blotting, complex patterns that varied from tissue to tissue were observed when the antibody that detects both isoforms was used. A component with the molecular mass (~56 kD) predicted by the sequence of the ORF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) is present in most tissues but in some tissues, an additional component at ~60 kDa was also detected. The larger component was found in both mouse and human hematopoietic tissues (data not shown) and is prominent in extracts of mouse testes. The addition of soluble peptide to the diluted antiserum inhibited all of the staining (data not shown). In mouse bone marrow the predominant form is also a 56 kDa peptide. The highest levels of TBLR1 are present in fetal liver and immunohistochemical staining shows strong staining of hematopoietic cells in the developing liver (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>).

The results obtained with the antibody that distinguishes between TBLR1 and TBL1 are also shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>. This antibody, made with a peptide unique to TBLR1, is directed at an epitope shared by both the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; isoforms and detects both bands. The results are particularly informative since they demonstrate; 1) more than one form of TBLR1 exists. 2) the &#x003b2;-isoform identified by 5'RACE and quantified by quantitative real time PCR, encodes an expressed protein; 3) a single cell type produces more than one isoform; and 4) the higher molecular weight form detected by the antibody to the C-terminal fragment of the &#x003b2; form is likely to be TBLR1 and not TBL1. Although the peptide used for the immunization of the animals that made the affinity absorbed antibody is not present in TBL1, the possibility that TBL1 forms a heterodimer with TBLR1 and is thus co-precipitated by anti TBLR1 has not been completely eliminated.</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular localization of TBLR1</title><p>To determine the intracellular localization of TBLR1, the anti-peptide antibodies described above were used in an indirect immunofluorescence assay.

These are due to both the presence of alternatively spliced messages and the presence of multiple polyadenylation sites. The 4.7 kb form is more abundant in hematopoietic tissues. In addition to the heterogeneity in message size, the protein also has several isoforms. The isoforms are produced by the use of alternative splice donor sites. TBLR1&#x003b2;, differs from the original sequence at the carboxyl-terminus (3' end of the ORF). The mouse homologue shows mRNA size heterogeneity that is similar to the human RNA. Both the human and mouse genes have a complex and somewhat unusual genomic structure. The human gene contains 18 highly conserved exons spread over 230 kb of genomic DNA. The first and second exons are ~140 kb upstream of the third, which in turn, is separated from the fourth exon by 33 kb of intronic DNA. The translational start site is located an additional 11 kb downstream in the middle of the fifth exon. The gene also has an extremely long 3'UTR that includes a sequence deposited in GenBank as DC42. This is described as an intronless gene for which there is no independent evidence of expression and may not actually encode a functional message. Human TBLR1 maps to chromosome 3q26 while mouse TBLR1 is located between 3A2 and 3A3.</p><p>The broad evolutionary conservation of this gene family is of note. Homologs are present in yeast, plants, fish and flies as well as in mammals and the insect proteins are &#x0003e; 80% similar to the mammalian ones. No homology was detected to prokaryotic genomes.</p><p>The cDNAs for TBLR1 encode members of the &#x003b2;-transducin or WD-repeat family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Eight WD-repeats are present in both the human and mouse proteins. The splice site that distinguishes between TBLR1&#x003b1; and TBLR1&#x003b2; is immediately 3' of the last WD-repeat sequence signature. At the nucleotide level, the sequence of TBLR1&#x003b1; has 79% homology to Homo sapiens mRNA for transducin (&#x003b2;)-1 like protein (TBL1) [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Y12781">Y12781</ext-link>]. The only homology of TBLR1 and TBL1 to the prototypic signal transducing guanine nucleotide binding regulatory (G) protein &#x003b2; sub- unit is in the WD-repeat domains. TBL1 has been mapped to the X chromosome and deletions in the region containing TBL1 are associated with adult onset sensorineural deafness[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Both TBLR1 and TBL1 are homologous to a Drosophila protein called <italic>ebi </italic>The regions of maximal nucleotide conservation between TBL1 and <italic>ebi </italic>are at the N-terminal end of the molecule and in the WD40 repeats. The C-terminal ends of these proteins are not homologous. The carboxyl terminal exon of TBLR1&#x003b1; has some homology to several members of the Arp2/3 complex of proteins that control actin polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The equivalent region of TBLR1&#x003b2; has no homology to any known protein. The N-terminal 100 amino acids of TBLR1 co-precipitates with both HDAC3 and SMRT. The data indicate that TBLR1 binds directly to SMRT, which in turn binds HDAC3. SMRT binding of HDAC3 plays an important role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] The homologous region of TBL1 also co-precipitates with these co-repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and has been reported to form an effective transcriptional repressor. This portion of the molecule contains a LisH motif. LisH is a &#x003b2;-propeller-binding motif and is thought to mediate the dimerization of WD-40 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] Sif2p, the yeast homolog of TBLR1, is a tetramer and contains an unusual eight-bladed &#x003b2;-propeller structure, that apparently mediates tetramerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Mutations in conserved LisH amino acids significantly reduced the half-life of TBL1 and altered its intracellular localization. TBL1 mutated in the LisH domain was not imported into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our data indicates that elimination of the LisH domain prevents interaction with SMRT.</p><p>The actual role that the TBLR1 family plays in cell physiology remains unclear. Like the proverbial blind man trying to describe an elephant, each laboratory has found a role for family members in their own system. Presumably, TBL1 and TBLR1 are multi-functional proteins. We found TBLR1 in a screen for messages over-expressed in early hematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. TBL1 deletions are associated with deafness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The drosophila homolog, <italic>ebi </italic>has been reported to regulate epidermal growth factor receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] promote the degradation of a repressor of neuronal differentiation (Ttk88), and to limit S phase entry. A cDNA, described as the "human homologue of <italic>ebi</italic>" was reported to encode a protein that plays a role in the ubiquitin pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. More recently, both TBL1 and TBLR1 were reported to be required for transcriptional activators of nuclear hormone receptors and other regulated transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Cofactor exchange through ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was proposed to account for the transcriptional activation dependent on TBL1 and/or TBLR1. Yoon <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] were unable to find any evidence for transcriptional activation in their studies, which postulated a role for TBL1/TBLR1 in histone code reading. Knock-down experiments using small interference RNA (siRNA) techniques indicate that TBL1 and TBLR1 are functionally redundant but essential for repression by unliganded thyroid hormone receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Tomita <italic>et al. </italic>used the frog oocyte system to demonstrate that unliganded TBLR1 interacts with T3R and recruits TBLR1 to its chromatinized target promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, accompanied by histone deacetylation and gene repression and showed that the recruitment of TBLR1 or related proteins is important for repression by unliganded T3R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Yoon <italic>et al. </italic>have demonstrated that there is an additional site of interaction between a site near the most N-terminal of the WD-40 repeats of TBL1 and the RD4 region of N-Cor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These interaction sites on SMRT flank the SANT motifs and it has been suggested that they play a role in interpreting the histone code and promoting histone deacetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Expression of a TBLR1 fragment that contains this interaction site, but lacks the C-terminal two-thirds of the molecule including the WD-40 repeats, leads to a partial proliferation arrest, suggesting again, the multiplicity of roles that these family member play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The proteins of the TBLR1 family also contain variant F-box near the N terminus of the molecule. F-box proteins, in combination with <italic>Skp</italic>1 and Cullin, form part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in the targeting of phosphorylated proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Because proteolysis is irreversible, proteasomal degradation provides a unidirectional regulatory switch. The initiation of DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and exit from mitosis are all triggered by the destruction of key regulatory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] [38-39] The F-boxes in TBLR1, TBL1 and <italic>ebi </italic>all lack a tryptophan near the NH2-end of the motif that is associated with <italic>Skp1 </italic>binding to F-box proteins that recognize phosphorylated protein [40]. A cDNA, described only as the "human homologue of <italic>ebi</italic>" encodes a protein that the authors believe plays a role in the ubiquitin mediated destruction of &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and they suggest that this <italic>ebi </italic>can bind <italic>Skp</italic>1 and is a key component in a pathway that targets unphosphorylated proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] [41].</p><p>Ectopic expression of full-length TBL1 potentiates repression by unliganded T3R. TBL1 does not bind directly to T3R; it binds to SMRT and/or N-CoR and this interaction was reported to contribute an autonomous repression function to the complex. The methods used in these experiments could not distinguish among the possibilities; 1) that TBL1 changed the structure of N-CoR, perhaps by altering the accessibility of the SANT motifs, producing increased repression, 2) that it increased the quantity of N-CoR present in the target cells or 3) that it facilitated the recruitment of an additional co-repressor. We have shown that over expression of TBLR1 or either the C- or N-terminal truncates increases the expression of NHR co-repressors. Co-transfection of TBLR1 with SMRT(1-300) leads to greatly enhanced expression of a truncated SMRT in a transient expression model and cells in which TBLR1 is stably over expressed have elevated levels of endogenous N-Cor. Co-transfection with the wild type TBLR1 as well as both the N- and C-terminal truncates leads to a significant increase in both SMRT(1-300) and endogenous N-CoR expression. Thus, both ends of the molecule can independently contribute to co-repressor stabilization. Alternatively, the region between a.a. 80 and 175, and shard in all of our constructs) may play an autonomous role in increasing co-repressor expression. Since SMRT(1-300) is degraded via a ubiquitin-mediated mechanism and inhibition of ubiquitination leads to elevation of SMRT, our data suggest the possibility that TBLR1 may act by preventing the degradation of nuclear co-repressors. This stabilization appears to be part of a complex regulatory network that governs the level of unliganded nuclear receptor. Although this result is the opposite of what might have been predicted on the basis of the results described above for <italic>ebi</italic>-mediated targeting of &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]both sets of data suggest that the TBLR1 family interacts with proteins subject to proteasomal degradation and the actual outcome, protection or targeting, may depend on either the nature of the target protein or the identity of the other proteins that interact with TBLR1. It may also be controlled by which of the TBLR1 family members does the interacting.</p><p>The mechanism through which the steady state level of SMRT and N-CoR expression is regulated is not obvious. The truncated construct of TBLR1 [TBLR1[&#x003b4;N] containing the C-terminal half of the molecule lacks the sequence involved in binding to the RD1 region of the co-repressors but has the greatest effect on both SMRT and N-CoR expression. Although this fragment contains most of the sequence that Yoon <italic>et al. </italic>suggested is responsible for binding the RD4 region of the co-repressor, the SMRT(1-300) fragment that we used lacks this RD4 region. Thus can not identify the binding partner responsible for the increased co-repressor levels found in cells over-expressing TBLR1. It may be that oligimerization of TBLR1 is required co-repressor stabilization and that a heteromeric multimer of a truncated form with the wild type may form a complex with SMRT that is an unsuitable substrate for proteasomal degradation. Pulse-chase experiments with co-transfected SMRT(1-300) suggest that ectopically expressed TBLR1 [&#x003b4;N] stabilizes SMRT (data not shown) but the pulse chase experiments do not provide an explanation for the increased level of SMRT expression associated with co-transfection of either the N-terminal fragment of TBLR1 or the whole molecule.</p><p>The fluorescence studies show that the intracellular distribution of TBLR1 is influenced by the metabolic state of the cells. The increase in nuclear staining may either represent translocation to the nucleus or nuclear trapping. In either case, it is likely that the TBLR1 that accumulates in the nucleus is degraded with different kinetics than the cytoplasmic material and that differential localization as well as alterations in proteasomal targeting, are the explanation for the effect of increased TBLR1 expression on co-repressor levels.</p><p>These results suggest that the TBL1-TBLR1 family plays a role in the regulation of N-Cor and/or SMRT expression; the amino terminal end docks the molecule to the co-repressor, perhaps altering its intracellular localization and targeting it for degradation. The carboxyl end appears to contribute to this activity but also appears to be the source of tissue specificity.</p><p>In summary, we have identified TBLR1 as a transcriptional regulator interacting with the co-repressors of nuclear hormone receptor activity. We have cloned the gene encoding this protein and identified it as a member of a small family of proteins that include at least two isoforms encoded by the same gene and closely related, X- and Y linked proteins, called TBL1X and TBL1Y. The evidence suggests that these proteins act by altering the stability of the co-repressor complex and that they may also contribute, or recruit other proteins that provide, an autonomous repressor function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, reagents and plasmids</title><p>COS7 cells are grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO2.
