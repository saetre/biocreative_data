Emerging evidence indicates that ciliary dysfunction can contribute to human obesity but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are unknown. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous human obesity syndrome associated with ciliary dysfunction. BBS proteins are thought to play a role in cilia function and intracellular protein/vesicle trafficking. Here, we show that BBS proteins are required for leptin receptor (LepR) signaling in the hypothalamus. We found that <italic>Bbs2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Bbs6</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are resistant to the action of leptin to reduce body weight and food intake regardless of serum leptin levels and obesity.

Impaired LepR signaling in BBS mice was associated with decreased <italic>Pomc</italic> gene expression. Furthermore, we found that BBS1 protein physically interacts with the LepR and that loss of BBS proteins perturbs LepR trafficking. Our data indicate that BBS proteins mediate LepR trafficking and that impaired LepR signaling underlies energy imbalance in BBS.

The environmental and genetic factors contributing to the obesity &#x02018;epidemic&#x02019; are currently under intense investigation but our understanding of the molecular, cellular and physiological processes that regulate energy homeostasis and the defects leading to energy imbalance and obesity is still far from complete. In mammals, body weight and energy homeostasis are controlled by the interplay between the peripheral signals and the brain, particularly the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C1">1</xref>). Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that circulates in proportion to the amount of body fat in order to inform the brain about the peripheral fat storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C3">3</xref>). Within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, a major site for leptin action, leptin is known to act on at least two neuronal populations: proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, which are activated by leptin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons [co-expressing agouti-related protein (AgRP)] and are inhibited by leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C4">4</xref>). In rodents and humans, mutations in genes encoding leptin and the leptin receptor lead to severe obesity, infertility and endocrine dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C5">5</xref>).</p><p>Recent discoveries indicate that ciliary dysfunction is associated with human obesity. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is the prototypical human genetic disorder associated with ciliary dysfunction and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C7">7</xref>). To date, more than 12 BBS genes have been identified and mutations in BBS genes are associated with obesity, polydactyly and retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C8">8</xref>). Additional clinical features of BBS include diabetes, hypertension, cognitive impairment, renal anomalies and hypogenitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C8">8</xref>). Although BBS proteins are involved in microtubule-based protein/vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C10">10</xref>), the precise molecular function of each BBS protein has not been characterized. Likewise, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to each component of the BBS phenotype are unknown.</p><p>Previously, we demonstrated that obesity in BBS mice is associated with hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C11">11</xref>). However, since leptin production is proportional to the amount of body fat and, hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance are frequently associated with obesity in animal models and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C14">14</xref>), leptin resistance in BBS mice could be secondary to obesity, as opposed to being the cause of obesity. Here, we addressed this question and uncovered the molecular defects leading to energy imbalance in BBS. Using a BBS knockout mouse model (<italic>Bbs2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C15">15</xref>), which recapitulate the major components of the human phenotype including obesity, we demonstrate that BBS proteins are required for LepR signaling. We confirmed this with additional BBS knockout mouse models (<italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Bbs6</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C17">17</xref>). We also demonstrate that BBS proteins physically interact with the LepR and mediate LepR trafficking. Our findings indicate that attenuated LepR signaling owing to altered trafficking of the LepR is the major cause of obesity in BBS.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bardet-Biedl syndrome mice have defects in the hypothalamic leptin&#x02013;melanocortin axis</title><p>To test whether the leptin resistance in BBS mice is secondary to obesity, we examined the appetite-suppressing and weight-reducing effects of exogenous mouse leptin in BBS mice that had their circulating leptin levels normalized by calorie restriction. <italic>Bbs2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Bbs6</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were given 70&#x02013;80% of the chow pellets normally consumed daily by sex- and age-matched wild-type mice.

Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of leptin caused a significant reduction in food intake and body weight in wild-type mice.

Food intake adjusted to body weight yielded similar results (data not shown). These results indicate that leptin resistance in BBS mice is not secondary to obesity. Rather, these results suggest leptin resistance as the cause of obesity in BBS mice.</p><fig id="DDP031F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Bardet-Biedl syndrome mice are resistant to leptin.

Therefore, we examined whether the ability of the melanocortin receptors to alter metabolism is also impaired in BBS mice. For this, we tested the effect of ICV administration of melanotan II (MTII), a melanocortin receptor agonist, on body weight and food intake (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F2">2</xref>A and B).

In addition, MTII administration reduced brown and white adipose tissues in both control and BBS animals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F2">2</xref>C and D). These data indicate that the ability of the melanocortin receptors to influence metabolism is intact in BBS mice. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results also demonstrated that the expression of melanocortin-3 and -4 receptors was normal in BBS mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp031/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). Combined, these data indicate that obesity in BBS animals is owing to defect(s) downstream or at the level of LepR but upstream of melanocortin receptors in the hypothalamic leptin&#x02013;melanocortin axis.</p><fig id="DDP031F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>Bardet-Biedl syndrome mice are responsive to melanocortin receptor agonist, MTII.

The mRNA levels of LepRb were not altered in <italic>Bbs2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Bbs6</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with wild-type controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F3">3</xref>A). To examine whether the signaling capacity of the LepRb is normal in BBS mice, we compared the ability of leptin to activate hypothalamic signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) between wild-type and BBS mice. As above, leptin levels in BBS mice were normalized by calorie restriction to avoid leptin resistance secondary to obesity. In control mice, leptin caused a robust increase in STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F3">3</xref>B). However, leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was greatly reduced in <italic>Bbs2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Bbs6</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (to 17&#x02013;39% of the control) albeit normal serum leptin levels in those mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F3">3</xref>B and C). These data demonstrate that leptin resistance in BBS mice is caused by inability of the LepR to activate the downstream intracellular machinery associated with this receptor. In diet-induced obese mice, leptin resistance is thought to be owing to an increase in suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (Socs-3), one of the targets induced by STAT3 and a negative feedback inhibitor of the LepR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C21">21</xref>). We found that both mRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F3">3</xref>D) and protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F3">3</xref>E) levels of Socs-3 were decreased in <italic>Bbs2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Bbs6</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals, indicating that leptin resistance in BBS mice was not because of increased expression of <italic>Socs-3</italic> in contrast to what is observed in diet-induced obesity model. The potential role of other mechanisms such as protein&#x02013;tyrosine phosphatase 1B and the cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein-1 (Creb1)-regulated transcription coactivator-1 in the leptin resistance associated with BBS remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C23">23</xref>).

However, this reduction in POMC neurons cannot explain the approximately 40% reduction in <italic>Pomc</italic> gene expression or the more than 60% decrease in STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, immunostaining of POMC in BBS animals was often weak (which is consistent with the lower levels of POMC mRNA) suggesting that the number of POMC neurons might be underestimated in BBS mice. Combined with our biochemistry and gene expression data, these results indicate that leptin resistance in BBS mice is mostly because of attenuated LepR signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins interact with LepRb and mediate LepRb trafficking</title><p>Recently, it was found that seven BBS proteins (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8 and BBS9) form a stable complex known as the BBSome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C9">9</xref>). This complex is proposed as the functional unit that mediates protein/vesicle trafficking to cilia. We postulated that some of the BBSome subunits might interact with the LepRb and/or STAT3 to mediate their trafficking. Strikingly, we found that BBS1 protein specifically interacted with the LepRb in transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F5">5</xref>A). No other BBSome subunits showed interaction with LepRb. In addition, the interaction between BBS1 and LepR was specific to the signaling isoform of the receptor, LepRb, because the non-signaling isoform, LepRa, did not interact with BBS1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F5">5</xref>B). Consistent with this, we found that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of LepRb, which is unique to the LepRb, was sufficient to interact with BBS1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F5">5</xref>C). We did not detect any interaction between STAT3 and BBS proteins (data not shown). The BBS1 M390R mutation, which is the most common mutation found in human BBS patients and sufficient to induce BBS phenotypes including obesity in a knock-in mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C25">25</xref>), greatly reduced the ability of BBS1 to interact with the LepRb (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F5">5</xref>D). The BBS1 M390R mutant also showed decreased interaction with the LepRb cytoplasmic domain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F5">5</xref>C). To test whether the interaction between BBS1 and LepRb occurs in living cells, we transfected ARPE-19 cells with BBS1 either alone or with the LepRb. We found that although overexpressed BBS1 proteins were detected throughout the cytoplasm, co-transfection of LepRb with BBS1-restricted BBS1 localization to small punctuates in ARPE-19 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp031/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>), supporting the physical interaction of LepR with BBS1. Altogether, these findings indicate that LepRb can be associated with the BBS1 subunit of the BBSome.</p><fig id="DDP031F5" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5.</label><caption><p>Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins mediate LepRb trafficking.

Some of the small vesicles showing immunoreactivity for LepRb were positive for TGN46, a marker for post-Golgi vesicles as well as TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C28">28</xref>), suggesting that these vesicles are in the secretory pathway or recycling endosomes.

We found similar mistrafficking of LepRb when BBS2 protein was depleted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP031F6">6</xref>), indicating that the requirement of BBS proteins for LepRb trafficking is not limited to BBS1.

However, how this general function is associated with individual components of the BBS phenotype was unknown. The present study provides the pathophysiological mechanism of obesity in BBS at the molecular level. Our study provides evidence that leptin resistance resulting from aberrant LepR trafficking and attenuated LepR signaling in the hypothalamus is a cause of obesity associated with BBS. We demonstrate that eliminating obesity and hyperleptinemia does not restore leptin sensitivity in BBS mice, indicating that leptin resistance is intrinsic rather than secondary to hyperleptinemia and obesity. We also demonstrate that the BBS1 protein physically interacts with the signaling isoform of LepR, LepRb and that BBS proteins are required for proper trafficking of the LepRb.</p><p>Our data suggest that BBS proteins mediate LepRb trafficking between the Golgi and specific areas of the plasma membrane (e.g. lipid raft, ciliary membrane). In the absence of BBS proteins, LepRb trafficking was perturbed and LepRb signaling was attenuated. This is consistent with the previous findings that the BBS proteins are necessary for the localization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to neuronal cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C30">30</xref>). Although we tested several antibodies against LepR, we were not able to detect LepRb in the mouse brain slices. This may be owing to the low level of surface expression and fast turnover of the LepRb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C27">27</xref>). However, LepRb has been found in the cilium of the olfactory epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C31">31</xref>), suggesting that LepRb may localize to the cilium of hypothalamic neurons.</p><p>Of the BBSome subunits, only BBS1 showed physical interaction with LepRb. We previously demonstrated that BBS1 also interacted with Rabin8, a GDP/GTP exchange factor for Rab8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C9">9</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that BBS1 is the cargo-binding subunit of the BBSome. Thus, it is of interest to test whether the GPCRs mislocalized in BBS mutant neurons (e.g. Sstr3 and Mchr1) also interact with BBS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C30">30</xref>). However, similar LepRb trafficking defects observed in BBS2 depleted cells and no obvious genotype&#x02013;phenotype correlation among various BBS mutations indicate that integrity of the BBSome is important for its function in trafficking and that loss of any BBSome subunits could lead to the same phenotype (mistrafficking of the cargo).</p><p>Interestingly, in BBS animals loss of LepRb function appears to be selective. Indeed, although expression of <italic>Agrp</italic>, <italic>Npy</italic> and <italic>Pomc</italic> are all regulated by leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C1">1</xref>), only <italic>Pomc</italic> gene expression was affected in BBS mice. Thus, the loss of leptin action appears to be restricted to the POMC neurons. Genetic ablation of LepRb specifically in POMC neurons leads to hyperphagia and increased fat mass in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C33">33</xref>). In BBS mice, attenuated LepRb signaling in POMC neurons is likely the main cause of obesity. These results are consistent with the recent findings by Davenport <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C34">34</xref>) showing that disruption of intraflagellar transport proteins, Tg737 or Kif3a, which are required for ciliogenesis, specifically in POMC neurons resulted in hyperphagia and obesity in mice. In addition, while BBS mice are resistant to leptin's action to decrease body weight and food intake, they have a preserved sympathetic/cardiovascular response to leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C11">11</xref>), supporting the selective loss of LepRb function in BBS mice. In fact, leptin signaling is not completely abolished in BBS mice. A fraction of the LepRb signaling is present as shown by residual STAT3 activation following leptin treatment. Thus, BBS proteins appear to be required for &#x02018;efficient&#x02019; LepRb signaling, which is necessary to control feeding behavior, while &#x02018;low&#x02019; level of LepRb signaling is still transduced in the absence of BBS proteins and this level of signaling is sufficient to increase sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure. Localization of the LepRb to a specific domain in the plasma membrane may be required for this &#x02018;efficient&#x02019; signaling, while LepRb elsewhere in the plasma membrane may be sufficient to transduce the &#x02018;low&#x02019; level of signal. Alternatively, the requirement for BBS proteins in the LepRb signaling may be specific to certain cell types and/or downstream effectors. These are interesting questions that warrant further studies.</p><p>In humans, variants of <italic>BBS2</italic>, <italic>BBS4</italic> and <italic>BBS6</italic> genes have been reported to be associated with obesity in non-BBS individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C35">35</xref>). Indeed, a variant in the <italic>BBS2</italic> gene was related to common adult obesity, and polymorphisms in <italic>BBS4</italic> and <italic>BBS6</italic> genes were associated with common early-onset childhood obesity and common morbid adult obesity. Whether the specific variants of the <italic>BBS</italic> genes associated with common obesity affect LepRb signaling and/or trafficking remains to be determined.</p><p>In summary, we have identified the specific defect that accounts for obesity in mouse models of BBS. Our findings indicate that mistrafficking and attenuated signaling of the LepRb is the main cause of energy imbalance leading to obesity in BBS. This defect represents a novel pathophysiological mechanism of leptin resistance with potential implication for common human obesity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>For a detailed description of the Materials and Methods, please see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp031/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>, which is published as supporting information on the <italic>Human Molecular Genetics</italic> website.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Generation of <italic>Bbs2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Bbs6</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and genotyping was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP031C17">17</xref>).
