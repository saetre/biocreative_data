It is currently under intense investigation how this structure is modulated, in particular in the context of proliferation and differentiation. Compelling evidence suggests that the transcription factor NF-Y acts as a master regulator of cell cycle progression, activating the transcription of many cell cycle regulatory genes. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Here we show that NF-Y exerts its effect on transcription through the modulation of the histone &#x0201c;code&#x0201d;. NF-Y colocalizes with nascent RNA, while RNA polymerase II is I phosphorylated on serine 2 of the YSPTSPS repeats within its carboxyterminal domain and histones are carrying modifications that represent activation signals of gene expression (H3K9ac and PAN-H4ac). Comparing postmitotic muscle tissue from normal mice and proliferating muscles from mdx mice, we demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that NF-Y DNA binding activity correlates with the accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4 on promoters of key cell cycle regulatory genes, and with their active transcription. Accordingly, p300 is recruited onto the chromatin of NF-Y target genes in a NF-Y-dependent manner, as demonstrated by Re-ChIP. Conversely, the loss of NF-Y binding correlates with a decrease of acetylated histones, the recruitment of HDAC1, and a repressed heterochromatic state with enrichment of histones carrying modifications known to mediate silencing of gene expression (H3K9me3, H3K27me2 and H4K20me3). As a consequence, NF-Y target genes are downregulated in this context. In conclusion, our data indicate a role of NF-Y in modulating the structure and transcriptional competence of chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic> and support a model in which NF-Y-dependent histone &#x0201c;code&#x0201d; changes contribute to the proper discrimination between proliferating and postmitotic cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major question in biology today is how the chromatin environments are interrelated with the machinery that drives transcription, and how this impacts on biological processes. It is well known that the covalent modifications in the N-terminal tails of histones represent a key mechanism of transcriptional control in all eukaryotic cells, and that the functional link between chromatin structure and transcriptional activation is determined by the histone &#x0201c;code&#x0201d;. Two major players of this code consist in acetylation and methylation of specific lysine residues within histones H3 and H4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-EhrenhoferMurray1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Strahl1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

The histone-like transcription factor NF-Y is composed of three highly conserved subunits, NF-YA, -YB, and -YC, all required for binding of target sequences (CCAAT-boxes). NF-YA contains a transactivation domain at the N-terminus, whereas its DNA binding domain and the regions of interaction with NF-YB and NF-YC are located at the C-terminal portion of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Mantovani1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Romier1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings strongly support the concept of the NF-Y complex as a key player in the regulation of proliferation and viability. It has been reported that the expression of a dominant negative NF-Y mutant blocks cell cycle progression in G1 and G2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Hu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Grskovic1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, it is not known whether NF-Y directly recruits HATs to chromatin, whether NF-Y leads to chromatin remodeling of its target promoters, and whether NF-Y acts upstream rather than downstream of histone tail modifications.</p><p>The data presented here clearly support the model of a direct role for NF-Y in chromatin remodeling <italic>in vivo</italic>. NF-Y binding leads to local histone hyperacetylation and correlates with hypo-methylation, while NF-Y target genes are actively transcribed. Local histone acetylation correlates with the recruitment of p300 and NF-Y. Loss of NF-Y binding, as induced by overexpressing a dominant-negative NF-Y protein, inhibits the activity of its target promoters and leads to local enrichment of methylated histones. Most notably, in terminally differentiated cells and muscle tissue, where NF-Y DNA binding is absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Gurtner1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, NF-Y target genes exhibit a repressed heterochromatic state with the typical enrichment of H3K9me3, H4K20me3 and HP1&#x003b1;, and their expression levels are reduced. By contrast, in muscles from mdx mice, a murine model of human Duchenne muscular dystrophy with high rate of proliferating cells, NF-Y is expressed and binds its target promoters. In this system, NF-Y target genes are actively transcribed, and their promoters have an open chromatin structure. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that NF-Y regulates epigenetic modifications, and the NF-Y-dependent histone &#x0201c;code&#x0201d; changes contribute to the discrimination between a proliferative and a postmitotic status of the cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>NF-Y co-localizes with nascent mRNA and a transcription-permissive histone &#x0201c;code&#x0201d;</title><p>The involvement of NF-Y in transcription has been thoroughly reported. In agreement with this, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g001">Figure 1A</xref> that in the nuclei of living cells, the NF-Y transcription factor colocalizes with nascent RNA Polymerase II (RPII) transcripts. We used a technique based on the incorporation of BrUTP into nascent RNA predominantly transcribed by RPII in living cells (run-on). Proliferating HeLa cells were transfected with BrUTP for 5&#x02032; at 4&#x000b0;C and then incubated for 5&#x02032; at 37&#x000b0;C; in this condition, most of the BrUTP-labeled RNA is still nascent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Wansink1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. After fixation, nascent RNA and endogenous NF-Y were visualized in a double-labeling experiment by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy, using antibodies against BrUTP and the NF-YA subunit, respectively. The anti BrUTP signal exhibited the typical distribution pattern of small spots which predominantly represent regions transcribed by RPII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Wansink1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, panel i). Of note, a large amount of NF-YA (panel ii) colocalizes with nascent RNA (panel iii). Similar results have been obtained with an antibody against the NF-YB subunit (data not shown). To investigate whether NF-Y colocalizes with transcriptionally active RPII complexes, we used an antibody directed against the RPII protein phosphorylated at the serine 2 residue of the consensus repeat (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7) contained in its carboxyterminal domain (CTD), the transcriptionally active form of RPII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Cho1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, panel v). In agreement with the results of the run-on, we found a significant colocalization (panel vii) between RPIIS2 (panel v) and NF-YA (panel vi). Since it is known that this phosphorylation occurs during transcriptional elongation, these results, together with the localization of NF-YA at nascent RNA , strongly support the notion that NF-Y is present at active transcription foci. As a control, we also show the colocalization (panel xi) of NF-YA (panel x) with total RPII (panel ix). Next, we asked whether NF-Y colocalizes with post-translational modifications on histones that are known as positive marks of transcription. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows that the majority of NF-YA (panels vii-xii) colocalizes (panels xiii, xiv) with the transcription permissive histone modifications H3K9ac and PAN-H4ac (panel i and ii), while poor colocalization is observed with marks of close chromatin conformation, H3K27me2 (panel iv) and H4K20me3 (panel v). NF-YA weakly colocalized (panel xv) with H3K9me3 (panel xv). As a positive control, the colocalization of NF-YA and -YB subunits is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, panel xviii). Interestingly, we observed that NF-YA could also localized in to the nucleoli. This result is in agreement with our previous observations with endogenous and exogenous overexpressed NF-YA (G.P. personal observation). The amount of NF-YA in the nucleoli is variable, being more detectable in some cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, panels vi and x) then in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, panels xiii-xviii). We never observed a completed exclusion of this protein from the nucleoli, thus it will be interest in the future investigate which could be the meaning of NF-YA nucleolar localization. Taken together, these results indicate a direct interaction between NF-Y and actively transcribed chromatin regions with an open chromatin structure.</p><fig id="pone-0002047-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002047.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>(A) NF-Y is associated with active transcription sites in living cells.

This cells line is a very useful physiological system to study the relationship between NF-Y and the mitotic status. Indeed, when C2C12 cells are actively proliferating, NF-Y serves as a common transcription factor for several key cell cycle control genes, and when cells are induced to differentiate in myotubes, upon growth factors withdrawal, a permanent down regulation of NFY-A expression leads to the inhibition of NF-Y binding to its target promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Gurtner1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with these findings, ChIP analysis demonstrates that in P cells, NF-Y is recruited onto all tested promoters (<italic>Cyclin A2</italic>, <italic>Cyclin B1</italic>, <italic>Cyclin B2, Cdk1, Cdc25C, Dhfr, Topoisimerase II &#x003b1;, Tk)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 2).

In contrast, in TD cells, the lack of NF-Y binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, lower panel, lane 2) correlates with the lack of RPII binding (lane 1) and the induction of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 (lanes 5 and 6). The presence of methylated histones is accompanied by the recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (lane 7), a chromodomain protein that specifically recognizes H3K9me3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Bannister1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> and is thought to be involved in organizing a higher-order chromatin structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Lachner1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

We quantify these results by Q-Re-ChIP analysis performed on P and TD C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Although at different extent, we confirm that NF-Y and p300 are co-recruited on several NF-Y target promoters. As expected, no recruitment of p300 is observed in TD C2C12 cells, where NF-Y is not expressed. In agreement with this, by Q-ChIP analysis performed on murine muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), we observed that the absence of NF-Y binding on its target promoters is associated with the absence of p300 recruitment. Notably, also in murine muscle tissue, as observed in different cell lines (16, 43, 44, AG unpublished data), HDAC1 recruitment is inversely correlated to that of p300. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g005">Figure 5</xref> D) The results shown here strongly support a direct role of NF-Y on the p300 recruitment to the NF-Y targets we have analyzed.

This molecule is a NF-YA protein with a triple amino acid substitution in the DNA binding domain that impairs its ability to bind DNA. It is still able to interact with a NF-YB/-YC dimer, but the resulting trimer is inactive in terms of CCAAT recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Mantovani2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. First, we investigated whether DN-NF-YA affects the expression of NF-Y target genes. RT-PCR analysis performed 24 hours post infection with an adenovirus vector expressing DN-NF-YA (Ad-DN-NF-YA) shows that cyclin A2, B2, cdk1, cdc25C, topoisomerase II&#x003b1; mRNAs were greatly down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 3). The cell cycle gene expression is only transiently repressed in the presence of DN-NF-YA, as indicated by RT-PCR analysis performed 48 hours after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 4). The transient effect observed might be attributed to the short half-life of the mutant protein whose expression 48 hours after infection is strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 3). Next, we investigated the DNA recruitment of NF-Y, p300 and different histone post-translational modifications after transduction with the adenovirus vector expressing DN-NF-YA . Q-Chip analysis shows that, although to different extents, the overexpression of DN-NF-YA leads to a decrease in the recruitment of NF-Y to <italic>Cyclin B2, A2, Cdk1, Cdc25C, Topoisomerase II&#x003b1;,</italic> and <italic>Dhfr</italic> promoters at 16 and 24 hours post transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Of note, the decrease of NF-Y DNA binding activity caused a strong increase of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3, with a peak at 24 hours, while it caused only a partial reduction of H3K9ac and p300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In good agreement with the short half-life of the mutant NF-YA, the NF-Y binding activity is restored 48 hours post infection. Concomitantly we observe a strong decrease of methylated histones accompained by a partial recovering of the p300 binding and H3K9ac levels. Thus, the most significant event induced by loss of NF-Y binding is an increased recruitment of closed chromatin markers, and not a decrease of open chromatin markers. The extent of the effect of the DN-NF-YA, both on NF-Y and chromatin marks binding, is variable on the different tested promoters. This might depend on the different dynamic with which the wt NF-Y trimer is replaced by the ones carrying the mutant NF-YA protein, in the context of the different chromatin structures of the promoters. However, the biological effect in terms of chromatin structure and transcription is very similar. Interestingly, the results of the Q-ChIP experiments performed after infection with the DN-NF-YA expression vector indicate that the heterochromatin protein HP1&#x003b1; does not bind these promoters although a week recruitment is observed on cyclin B2 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002047-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002047.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Lack of NF-Y DNA binding activity induces hypermethylation of histones and target gene inactivation.</title><p>(A) RT-PCR amplification of the indicated genes from uninfected MEFs (lane 1), MEFs 24hours after infection with Ad-GFP (lane 2), MEFs 24hours and 48hours after infection with Ad-DN-NFYA (lanes 3 and 4).

In good agreement with the results reported above for terminally differentiated C2C12 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002047-g005">Figure 5B</xref> (lane 1) shows that in the absence of NF-Y binding to its target promoters a specific induction of methylated histones (H3K9me3 and H4K20me3) is detectable (lanes 6 and 8, respectively), which corresponds to the absence of the acetylated ones (H3K9ac and PAN-H4ac) (lanes 5 and 7, respectively). Thus, adult muscle tissues are characterized by loss of NF-Y binding , concomitant accumulation of negative and reduction of permissive marks of transcription. These features concur to the maintenance an irreversible close chromatin conformation of NF-Y target genes.

The concomitant presence of acetylated and methylated histones H3K9 is not of obvious explanation, since histone H3K9 cannot be simultaneously acetylated and methylated within an individual histone amino tail. It might be speculated that different histone amino tail molecules are either acetylated or methylated, and that the balance between these two signals will result in the appropriate chromatin configuration. Indeed, it has been recently demonstrated that the distribution of these two histone marks on the promoter regions of transcriptionally active genes overlap each other (53).

This is achieved mainly by regulating the dynamic association of DNA with histone and non-histone proteins, thus by regulating chromatin structure. The results presented in this work provide evidences that there is a spatial relationship between newly synthesized RNA transcription-permissive histone &#x0201c;code&#x0201d; and NF-Y <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with this, NF-Y DNA binding activity modulates the chromatin structure of its target genes through the local maintenance of post-translationally modified histones, resulting in gene transcription modulation.

By contrast, in the absence of NF-Y binding to promoter of cell cycle genes, there is a substantial local recruitment of heterochromatic markers, such as H3K9me3, H3K27me2, H4K20me3 and HP1, known to be signals of gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Barski1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-Nielsen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002047-deWit1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.

It has been previously demonstrated that the HMT suv39h is required for myoblastic differentiation.

In the present paper we demonstrate that, throughout muscle differentiation, also NF-Y target genes are silenced by epigenetic gene regulation. Indeed, the absence of NF-Y binding to promoters of cell cycle regulatory genes, involved in the S/G2 and G2/M transitions, is associated with the local enrichment of negative marks of transcription such as H3K9me3, HP1&#x003b1; and H4K20me3. The recruitment of the heterochromatic protein HP1&#x003b1; on NF-Y target promoters could explain how they are irreversibly locked in a repressed state. Our results obtained after overexpression of the DN-NF-YA and upon terminal differentiation <italic>in vitro,</italic> demonstrate that the major event induced by loss of NF-Y is an increase of histones methylation, rather than a decrease of acetylation, supporting the idea that NF-Y binding activity prevents the hypermethylation of histones, allowing the transcription of cell cycle genes. This could mean that the recruitment of methylated histones is sufficient to silence the transcription of cell cycle regulatory genes, inducing an arrest of proliferation. On the other hand, the data obtained on muscle tissues <italic>in vivo</italic> show that the loss of NF-Y activity leads also to a loss of acetylated histones.
