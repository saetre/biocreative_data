We report here that the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> complex, a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets the postsynaptic spine-associated Rap GTPase activating protein (SPAR) for degradation in neurons. SPAR degradation by SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> depended on the activity-inducible protein kinase Polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2). In the presence of Plk2, SPAR physically associated with the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> complex through a canonical phosphodegron. In hippocampal neurons, disruption of the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> complex by overexpression of dominant interfering &#x003b2;-TRCP or Cul1 constructs prevented Plk2-dependent degradation of SPAR. Our results identify a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates degradation of a key postsynaptic regulator of synaptic morphology and function.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grants <grant-num>AG11085</grant-num> and <grant-num>GM54137</grant-num> (to J.

The size and morphology of dendritic spines are correlated with their function. Thus, large mushroom-shaped spines tend to be more stable than small thin spines, contain more &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid receptors, and mediate stronger synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). The morphology of spines, which changes during development and in response to synaptic activity, is influenced by multiple signaling pathways that emanate from postsynaptic glutamate receptors and act upon the actin cytoskeleton and associated proteins in the postsynaptic density (PSD)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">5</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>).</p><p>SPAR (spine-associated Rap GTPase activating protein (GAP)) is a PSD protein that regulates spine morphogenesis and forms a complex with the scaffold protein PSD-95 and <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Overexpression of SPAR results in enlargement of spine heads, an effect dependent upon the ability of SPAR to rearrange actin and function as a RapGAP. In contrast, dominant-negative SPAR produces long and thin spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). SPAR, in turn, is regulated by polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2; also known as serum-inducible serine/threonine kinase (SNK)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Synaptic activity induces Plk2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), leading to degradation of SPAR, a mechanism recently shown to be critical in activity-dependent synaptic scaling (a principal form of homeostatic plasticity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>).</p><p>SPAR turnover depends upon the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) since ubiquitinated SPAR accumulates in the presence of active Plk2 when proteasomes are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). This necessitates the involvement of at least one E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase targeting SPAR. More generally, the UPP is known to play an important role in the activity-dependent turnover of several proteins in the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), a process that likely involves activity-driven redistribution of proteasomes into spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). However, as is the case for many neuronal processes in which the UPP has been implicated, the molecular and regulatory components upstream of the proteasome responsible for targeting the ubiquitination of SPAR and other PSD proteins are unknown.</p><p>Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein (SCF) complexes are one of the best understood E3 Ub-ligases with regard to mechanism of substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). By recruiting substrates to the SCF complex, F-box proteins dramatically increase the specificity and rate of ubiquitin transfer to substrates. The F-box protein &#x003b2;-TRCP has been shown to target critical signaling proteins for degradation, including I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-catenin, and Cdc25A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Its function in neurons, however, has remained unexplored. Here, we identify&#x003b2;-TRCP as the F-box protein that targets Plk2-phosphorylated SPAR for degradation in neurons. Biochemical studies revealed that SPAR interacted with the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> complex through a canonical &#x003b2;-TRCP phosphodegron. Induction of Plk2 activity led to SPAR turnover, and this was prevented by dominant negative disruption of the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> complex or point mutations in the phosphodegron of SPAR preventing SPAR from interacting with &#x003b2;-TRCP.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>DNA Plasmids</italic>&#x02014;Expression plasmids expressing cDNA with a CMV promoter for myc-SPAR, HA-Plk2, and HA-Plk2<sup>K108M</sup> were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). pCMV-HA-Plk2<sup>D201A</sup> was created from pCMV-HA-Plk2 using PCR-based mutagenesis. cDNA for full-length SPAR as well as SPAR fragments were amplified from pGW1-myc-SPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) and cloned into pENTR-6, compatible with the GATEway cloning system (Invitrogen).

Such regulation is reminiscent of the mechanism employed by most SCF E3 Ub-ligases, where substrate recognition depends upon upstream kinase signaling cascades. A central subunit of the SCF complex is the Cul1 scaffold protein. To explore the idea that SPAR turnover is regulated by an SCF E3 Ub-ligase, we made use of a previously reported dominant-negative version of Cul1 (<sup>DN</sup>Cul1). This C-terminal-truncated protein binds substrates but fails to associate with ubiquitin-charged E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, thereby preventing substrate turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Plk2-induced SPAR degradation requires a Cul1-based E3 Ubligase.</bold><italic>A-C</italic>, dominant negative Cul1 constructs block Plk2-dependent loss of SPAR in hippocampal neurons.

This system facilitated biochemical studies that were otherwise limited by the physical properties of dendritic spines and allowed the use of molecular reagents previously developed for study of the human SCF pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). We found that expression of SPAR alone (as an Myc-tagged fusion protein) led to its accumulation in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>lane 3</italic>). In contrast, co-expression with Plk2 (but not a catalytically inactive mutant Plk2<sup>D201A</sup>) promoted the degradation of myc-SPAR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>lane 2</italic> compared with <italic>lanes 4-6</italic>, and <italic>B, lanes 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>). Co-expression of SPAR with wild type Plk2 correlated with the appearance of a slower mobility form of SPAR (presumably phosphorylated) that is sensitive to Plk2-induced degradation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>myc-SPAR-P</italic>; see also <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). Our recapitulation of Plk2-dependent SPAR turnover in HEK293T cells provides a convenient system in which to search for components of the Plk2-dependent degradation pathway.</p><p>Consistent with the idea that SPAR is a target of one of the SCF complexes, overexpression of dominant-negative Cul1 (<sup>DN</sup>Cul1) in HEK293T stabilized myc-SPAR despite cotransfection of active Plk2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>lane 3</italic>), in agreement with our findings in neurons (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). Moreover, these cells accumulated the slower migrating form of myc-SPAR that presumably corresponds to phosphorylated SPAR. In contrast, a dominant-negative form of the related Cullin4 (<sup>DN</sup>Cul4) had no effect on SPAR turnover (<italic>lane 4</italic>), indicating that the effect of <sup>DN</sup>Cul1 was specific.</p><p>F-box proteins serve as substrate receptors in Cul1-based E3s. To uncover candidate F-box proteins for SPAR, we performed a cell-based interaction screen in HEK293T cells between SPAR and a panel of co-expressed GST-tagged F-box proteins. Potential complexes between SPAR and GST-tagged F-box proteins were isolated by incubating cell lysates with GSH-Sepharose beads. Previous studies had indicated that the interaction of F-box proteins with substrates can be detected in tissue culture cells that co-express the F-box protein and substrate in the presence of <sup>DN</sup>Cul1, which blocks substrate degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Among a panel of F-box proteins individually co-transfected with myc-SPAR and HA-Plk2, we identified an interaction between myc-SPAR and both GST-&#x003b2;-TRCP1 and GST-&#x003b2;-TRCP2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>lanes 3</italic> and <italic>4</italic>). Our ability to assay for endogenous interactions was precluded by the unavailability of suitable antibodies for immunoprecipitation. Although produced from different genes, &#x003b2;-TRCP1 and &#x003b2;-TRCP2 are &#x0223c;85% identical and are believed to have largely redundant functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Importantly, the binding of &#x003b2;-TRCP1 and &#x003b2;-TRCP2 to myc-SPAR required co-transfection of active (wild type (WT)) Plk2 and was undetectable in the presence of catalytically defective Plk2<sup>K108M</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>lanes 5</italic> and <italic>6</italic>). Together with the Plk2-dependent slower gel mobility of SPAR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>A-C</italic></xref>), this suggests that SPAR associates with &#x003b2;-TRCP in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, as is the case for all other &#x003b2;-TRCP substrates identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>).

These results suggest that there may be some SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> complex-dependent turnover of endogenous SPAR in hippocampal neurons cultured under basal conditions.</p><p>As expected, endogenous SPAR levels were close to undetectable in Plk2-infected neurons that were otherwise untransfected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>A-C</italic></xref>, <italic>arrowheads</italic>, and <italic>E</italic>) as well as in Plk2-infected cells that had been previously transfected with Skp2&#x00394;F (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>, compare SPAR staining in cells marked by <italic>arrowheads</italic> (infected) and <italic>arrows</italic> (transfected and infected); quantified in <italic>E</italic>). In contrast, cells transfected with &#x003b2;-TRCP1&#x00394;F or &#x003b2;-TRCP2&#x00394;F showed no reduction in SPAR levels after infection with Plk2 Sindbis virus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>, quantified in <italic>E</italic>). These results are consistent with disruption of the SCF complex through expression of <sup>DN</sup>Cul1, which also prevented Plk2-dependent loss of SPAR (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), and together they demonstrate that the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> pathway is required for Plk2-induced SPAR degradation in neurons.</p><p>Because changes in SPAR expression can affect spine morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) and synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>), we wondered if blocking the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> pathway might also affect these aspects of neuronal function. Infection of DIV16 neurons with Plk2 led to a significant decrease in the size and number of spines, consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). The additional overexpression of &#x003b2;-TRCP&#x00394;F in cells infected with Plk2, however, did not prevent the decrease in size and number of spines (supplemental Fig. S1, <italic>A-C</italic>). Similarly, blocking &#x003b2;-TRCP function had no effect on synaptic strength as assessed by recording of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (supplemental Fig. S1, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>). These results are perhaps not surprising given that SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> is likely to regulate additional synaptic substrates besides SPAR. Although we have clearly established the Plk2-SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup>-SPAR degradative pathway, its function in neurons remains to be resolved.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The UPP has received increasing attention in neurobiology as an important regulator of synapse development, synaptic transmission and plasticity, and the dynamic turnover of PSD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). Aberrant UPP function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative disorders, <italic>e.g.</italic> Parkinson, Alzheimer, Huntington, and prion diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). To date most E3 substrate pairs in neurobiology have been identified in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>), and relatively little is known about the specific E3s that regulate synaptic proteins in the mammalian brain.</p><p>In this study we have uncovered a role for the E3 Ub-ligase SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> in the degradation of a key postsynaptic scaffolding protein and enzyme (the RapGAP SPAR) that regulates the morphology of dendritic spines and the strength of synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). Mammalian SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> has been implicated in the ubiquitin-dependent turnover of several cell cycle and other signaling proteins, including I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-catenin, Cdc25A, Emi1, and the Period protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Moreover, it has been connected to the differentiation of neural progenitors through its targeting of REST transcription repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). Although we have defined the residues that are critical for SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup>-mediated degradation of SPAR, it is possible that SPAR degradation is also regulated by additional E3s, possibly in response to other signals and involving different determinants in the SPAR protein.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that &#x003b2;-TRCP interacts with its substrates in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The majority of &#x003b2;-TRCP substrates identified to date contain a DpSG&#x003a6;<italic>X</italic>pS sequence (where pS is phosphoserine) that functions as a phosphodegron and directly binds to the WD40 repeats of &#x003b2;-TRCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). A variety of kinases have been implicated in the phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-TRCP phosphodegrons, and in many cases, multiple kinases collaborate to generate the phosphodegron, <italic>e.g.</italic> GSK3&#x003b2;/CKI (for &#x003b2;-catenin), Chk1 and another unknown kinase (for Cdc25A), and Cdc2/Plk1 (for Emi1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). Interestingly, Emi1 is one of several cell cycle regulators, in addition to Wee1, Emi2, and Claspin, that is phosphorylated by Plk family member Plk1 for degradation by the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>). Thus, Plk family members seem to collaborate with &#x003b2;-TRCP to regulate the degradation of a variety of substrates in different cellular contexts.</p><p>We found that SPAR contains a canonical &#x003b2;-TRCP phosphodegron sequence (<sup>1304</sup>DSGIDT) in its Act2 domain. Point mutations in Ser-1305 and Thr-1309 within SPAR inhibited Plk2-dependent SPAR degradation and its binding to &#x003b2;-TRCP, providing evidence that this sequence functions as a phosphodegron.</p><p>Currently, the identity of the kinase that phosphorylates <sup>1304</sup>DSGIDT in SPAR is not definitively established. A direct demonstration that Plk2 phosphorylates Ser-1305 and Thr-1309 is currently lacking due, in part, to difficulty in purifying modified full-length SPAR. Thus, further studies are required to definitively correlate that these candidate sites are phosphorylated by Plk2. Nevertheless, because Plk2 promotes the SPAR-&#x003b2;-TRCP interaction and can phosphorylate SPAR <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), we favor the idea that Plk2 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Ser-1305 and Thr-1309 in this phosphodegron. Supporting this idea is that Plk2 also binds to the Act2 domain of SPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), so the kinase would be recruited to the vicinity of the phosphodegron. However, we cannot rule out the possibilities that Plk2 activity is required but not sufficient for phosphorylation of Ser-1305 and Thr-1309, that additional kinases are involved, or that additional phosphodegrons exist in SPAR. Plk2 is thus far the only kinase reported to promote SPAR degradation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), although it is possible that other kinases could contribute as well. During early <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish development, casein kinase I&#x003b5; has been implicated in the decrease of SPAR protein through Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>).</p><p>SPAR levels influence spine shape and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), and SPAR degradation is involved in activity-dependent synaptic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). Our results here show that the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> complex targets SPAR for turnover in response to Plk2 activity. Nevertheless, blocking Plk2-dependent SPAR degradation through overexpression of the dominant-negative &#x003b2;-TRCP construct did not prevent Plk2-dependent changes in spine morphology. This suggests that the exact role of the Plk2-SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup>-SPAR pathway in neurons is still unclear. Plk2 may regulate the function or expression of additional proteins besides SPAR that are unaffected by disruption of the &#x003b2;-TRCP degradation pathway. Similarly, by globally disrupting the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> complex in the neuron, additional &#x003b2;-TRCP substrates may accumulate that offset the effects of accumulated SPAR protein. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the &#x003b2;-TRCP ortholog Lin-23 targets &#x003b2;-catenin/<italic>bar-1</italic> for destruction in the ventral nerve cord, leading to altered glutamate receptor density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>).</p><p>Endogenous Plk2 expression is induced during periods of elevated neuronal activity and causes degradation of SPAR protein as well as thinning and elongation of spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). The accumulation of SPAR in spines upon inhibition of the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> pathway as well as the recent report that proteasomes redistribute into spines with synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) is consistent with the possibility that phosphorylation of SPAR by Plk2 leads to local interaction with &#x003b2;-TRCP and degradation of SPAR at postsynaptic sites. Because SPAR is a large scaffolding protein in the PSD that forms complexes with <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors and PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), regulation of SPAR degradation through the SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> complex may be predicted to play a significant role in regulating the composition of proteins in the spine. Given the critical role of the proteasome in turning over many PSD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), it is likely that additional specific E3s will be identified that regulate synaptic composition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M802475200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M802475200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Azad Bonni (Harvard Medical School) for critical reading of the manuscript and Nelly Khidekel (Massachusetts of Technology) for the &#x003b2;-TRCP2&#x00394;F construct.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Kasai, H., Matsuzaki, M., Noguchi, J., Yasumatsu, N., and Nakahara, H.
