Here we show that a microRNA controls zonation morphogenesis by targeting hyaluronan receptor CD44. We have developed a novel system to study microRNA functions by generating constructs expressing pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs. Using this system, we have demonstrated that expression of <italic>miR-328</italic> reduced cell adhesion, aggregation, and migration, and regulated formation of capillary structure. Protein analysis indicated that <italic>miR-328</italic> repressed CD44 expression. Activities of luciferase constructs harboring the target site in CD44, but not the one containing mutation, were repressed by <italic>miR-328</italic>. Zonation morphogenesis appeared in cells transfected by miR-328: miR-328-transfected cells were present on the surface of zonating structures while the control cells stayed in the middle. <italic>MiR-328</italic>-mediated CD44 actions was validated by anti-CD44 antibody, hyaluronidase, CD44 siRNA, and CD44 expression constructs. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments showed that CD44-silencing cells appeared as layers on the surfaces of nodules or zonating structures. Immuno-histochemistry also exhibited CD44-negative cells on the surface layers of normal rat livers and the internal zones of Portal veins. Our results demonstrate that <italic>miR-328</italic> targets CD44, which is essential in regulating zonation morphogenesis: silencing of CD44 expression is essential in sealing the zonation structures to facilitate their extension and to inhibit complex expansion.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec

However, it is not known which microRNA(s) is the key player in this process.</p><p>In animals, miRNA genes are transcribed to generate long primary transcripts (called pri-miRNAs), which are first cropped by the RNase III-type enzyme Drosha to generate some hairpin intermediates (called pre-miRNAs) in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002420-Lee1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002420-Tomari1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although miRNAs have emerged as key regulators of gene expression, our understanding of the specific roles of miRNAs has been limited due to the difficulty in tracking the functions of a particular miRNA. Exogenous miRNAs are readily degraded by enzymes, making it impossible to obtain stable cell lines expressing miRNAs for long-term studies <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although expression of a large fragment of DNA harboring the promoter and sequence for microRNA(s) has made stable expression possible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002420-Dickins1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, in many cases microRNAs are expressed as a cluster, making it difficult to distinguish the function of a particular microRNA. To allow long-term studies of miRNA functioning <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have developed an expression vector harboring two copies of pre-microRNAs, a GFP tracking unit, and an antibiotic selection marker. This allows stable expression of high levels of the miRNA of interest in cells for functional and complementation studies. Using this technique, we have successfully expressed a number of miRNAs in mammalian cells including <italic>miR-328</italic>.

We have generated a construct that can express the pre-microRNA of <italic>miR-328</italic> and GFP, with an antibiotic selection marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002420-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, all primers used in this study are listed as Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002420.s001">Table S1</xref>). The advantage of this construct is the stability of miRNA expression after stable transfection. Furthermore, transfection of this construct allows selection with neomycin, as well as rescue of positive clones by monitoring GFP-positive colonies, or by sorting GFP-positive cells. We have detected the expression of pre-miR-328 by RT-PCR using RNA prepared from A431 cells stably transfected with miR-328 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002420-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The pre-miR-328 was then successfully processed to mature <italic>miR-328</italic>, as detected by RT-PCR with primers designed by us (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002420-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, for diagram illustrating reaction see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002420.s002">Figure S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002420.s001">Table S1</xref>). The advantage of using RT-PCR for mature microRNA analysis was the limited primer used for annealing to template to avoid non-specific detection. In the reaction, we only designed 15-base-pair-annealing for reverse transcription and 12-base-pair-annealing for PCR. This should greatly reduce non-specific interaction that can occur during Northern hybridization. To assure that processing of the expressed <italic>miR-328</italic> did not interfere with the RNAi/miRNA pathways, we analyzed a few endogenous microRNAs and observed that transfection with miR-328 did not affect expression of endogenous microRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002420.s002">Figure S1B</xref>).

This may be the reason why A431 cells cannot form large tumors in the skin location, as the stroma cells may be able to guild the tumor cells to form certain smaller structures. Although the CD44-positive cells can potentially form large tumors, as there is an advantage for the same type of cells to assemble together for survival, the CD44-negative stroma cells seemed not to allow this to occur and were able to facilitate the formation of certain shape of structures guided by the stroma cells. In the case of <italic>miR-328</italic>-expressing cells, the levels of CD44 were low and some were negative. Although these CD44-negative cells now served as the guide cells for CD44-positve cells (low levels of CD44) to form some tumor structures, they would not push the CD44-positive as hard as the stroma cells did. As a result, the miR-328-transfected cells were able to form relatively larger tumor nodules than the GFP-transfected cells did. The fact that cells expressing high levels of CD44 formed more but smaller nodules suggests that high levels of CD44 would promote tumor metastasis.

As tissues become mature, CD44 expression decreases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002420-Gakunga1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Each organ seems to have particular mechanisms to form the shape of its preference, and regulation of CD44 expression appears to be one of them. We have thus proposed a CD44 expression model for zonating morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002420-g008">Fig 8B</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that a construct harbouring a duplicate of pre-microRNA miR-328 can be successfully expressed and processed to mature microRNA.
