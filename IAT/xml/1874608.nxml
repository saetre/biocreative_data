A <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium <italic>mlc</italic> mutant showed reduced levels of invasion and cytotoxicity compared to the wild-type, and exhibited reduced expression levels of <italic>hilD</italic>, <italic>hilA</italic> and <italic>invF</italic>, which are regulatory genes in the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1). However, the effects of Mlc on <italic>hilD</italic> expression and bacterial invasiveness were not seen in the <italic>hilE</italic> mutant, and <italic>hilE</italic> expression was increased in the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant, which suggests that Mlc exerts positive effects on the expression of SPI1 genes by reducing the expression of HilE, which is known to down-regulate the expression of SPI1 genes through direct interaction with HilD. We found that the two known promoters of <italic>hilE</italic> were not modulated by Mlc, and we identified a third promoter, designated P3, which was repressed by Mlc. The gel mobility shift assay and footprinting analysis revealed that Mlc repressed <italic>hilE</italic> in a direct manner by binding to two distinct sites in the <italic>hilE</italic> P3 promoter region. The specific down-regulation of <italic>hilD</italic> observed in the presence of Mlc regulon-inducible sugars, such as glucose and mannose, could not be detected in the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant. Based on these results, we propose that Mlc functions to sense the availability of sugars and is linked to virulence gene regulation by its ability to control <italic>hilE</italic> expression in <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that initiates disease, which is normally limited to gastroenteritis in humans. However, this bacterium causes systemic disease in mice and has been used as an animal model of typhoid fever. Since <italic>Salmonella</italic> is acquired usually by oral ingestion of contaminated materials, a key step in the infection process is passage across the intestinal epithelium by invasion of M cells in Peyer's patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Many of the genes required for intestinal penetration and invasion of host cells are carried on the 40-kb region at centisome 63, which is called <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). SPI1 contains at least 37 genes, which encode various components of the type III secretion systems (T3SSs), its regulators and its secreted effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The effector proteins mediate actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, in the form of large membrane ruffles, which engulf the bacteria into the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>The expression of SPI1 is controlled in response to a specific combination of environmental signals, including pH, oxygen tension, medium osmolarity, bile, Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAS), and growth stage of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Although many factors and a complex mechanism related to environmental stimuli are involved in the modulation of SPI1 genes, they are thought to converge on the activation of several transcriptional regulators encoded within SPI1, such as HilA, HilC, HilD and InvF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). HilA plays a crucial role in the expression of genes that encode the SPI1-T3SS apparatus, the <italic>prg</italic> and <italic>inv</italic>/<italic>spa</italic> operons, by binding upstream of <italic>prgH</italic> and <italic>invF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The expression of <italic>invF</italic> leads to the induction of several effector genes encoded both within SPI1 (<italic>sic</italic>/<italic>sip</italic> operon) and outside SPI1 (<italic>sigD</italic>/<italic>sopB</italic> and <italic>sopE</italic>), with SicA as a co-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). HilC and HilD, which are members of the AraC/XylS family, have been postulated to act as a derepressor of <italic>hilA</italic> expression by counteracting the action of negative regulatory elements at the <italic>hilA</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, it has been shown that HilD provides an essential activating function for <italic>hilA</italic> in the absence of negative regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). HilC and HilD also directly activate the alternative promoter of the <italic>invF</italic> operon, which is independent of HilA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Similar to HilC and HilD, RtsA activates the expression of SPI1 genes by binding upstream of the master regulatory gene, <italic>hilA</italic>, to induce its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Recently, Baxter and Jones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) have shown that HilE is an important <italic>Salmonella</italic>-specific regulator of <italic>hilA</italic> expression. A null mutation in <italic>hilE</italic> causes an increase in <italic>hilA</italic> expression and invasion. Using two-hybrid analysis, it has been shown that HilE interacts with HilD, which suggests that HilE represses <italic>hilA</italic> expression by inhibiting the activity of HilD through a protein&#x02013;protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Several other genes have been identified that exert positive or negative effects on these direct regulators of SPI1 in response to the changes in environmental conditions. These genes include those that encode several two-component regulatory systems (PhoP/Q, PhoBR, OmpR/EnvZ and SirA/BarA), post-transcriptional systems (CsrAB, RNase E, PNPase and Lon), nucleoid proteins (HU, FIS, H-NS and Hha), signaling molecules (ppGpp and Np<sub>n</sub>N), and other regulatory proteins (FliZ, FadD and CpxA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>The phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the major sugar transport system in many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. In the animal model, attenuation of virulence has been noted for <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains that carry mutations in the <italic>pts</italic>, <italic>crr</italic>, <italic>cya</italic> or <italic>crp</italic> genes, which encode the general energy-coupling enzymes of the PTS, enzyme IIA<sup>Glc</sup> of the PTS, adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP receptor protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Mlc is a global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism and controls several genes involved in sugar utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). Therefore, it seemed possible that Mlc also affects the virulence of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. In the present study, a <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium <italic>mlc</italic> mutant was constructed to investigate the contribution of Mlc to the virulence phenotype. We have found that Mlc activates SPI1 gene expression by repressing <italic>hilE</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and growth condition</title><p>The strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

When necessary, the medium was supplemented with ampicillin (100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml) or kanamycin (100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml). Tryptone broth (TB) (1% bactotryptone, 0.8% NaCl) buffered with 0.1&#x02009;M MOPS (pH 7.0) was used to investigate the effect of various carbohydrate sources on the expression of <italic>hilE</italic> and <italic>hilD</italic>. As needed, the following supplements were added to the TB: 0.2% (w/v) glucose, mannose, arabinose or glycerol. Low oxygen bacterial growth condition (SPI-inducing condition) was used to induce invasion gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Briefly, a stationary-phase culture that had been grown overnight with shaking was used as the stock culture.

SR1304 exhibited a &#x0003e;10-fold reduction in <italic>hilA</italic> and HilA-dependent <italic>invF</italic> (<italic>invF</italic><sub>A</sub>) expression, and about a 3-fold reduction in <italic>hilD</italic> and HilC/D-dependent <italic>invF</italic> (<italic>invF</italic><sub>D</sub>) expression, compared to SL1344. However, <italic>hilC</italic> expression was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). We also observed reduced expression of the <italic>prgH</italic> and <italic>sigD</italic> genes, which are known to be regulated by HilA and InvF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), in SR1304 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The expression levels of <italic>hilA</italic> and <italic>invF</italic> were previously shown to be affected by both HilC and HilD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) but since <italic>hilC</italic> levels are unaffected by the <italic>mlc</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) we speculated that Mlc was regulating <italic>hilA</italic> and <italic>invF</italic> expression indirectly probably by modulating the expression of <italic>hilD</italic> or the higher regulator of <italic>hilD</italic>. </p></sec><sec><title>Mlc modulates the expression of SPI1 genes by repressing <italic>hilE</italic></title><p>Subsequently, we studied whether <italic>hilE</italic> expression was affected by Mlc. Baxter <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) have found that HilE plays an important regulatory role in the expression of the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-invasive phenotype by affecting <italic>hilA</italic> transcription through direct interaction with HilD. To study the effect of Mlc on <italic>hilE</italic> expression, we measured the expression of <italic>hilE-lacZY</italic> on the low-copy plasmid pMAB69, which contains the <italic>hilE</italic> promoter region from &#x02212;886 to +121, relative to the translation start site. When these cells were grown in static cultures to exponential phase, SL1344-pMAB69 expressed 28.9 &#x000b1; 3.5 Miller units of &#x003b2;-galactosidase, whereas SR1304-pMAB69 expressed 49.5 &#x000b1; 5.3 Miller units of &#x003b2;-galactosidase; the level of <italic>hilE</italic> expression in the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant was almost 1.8-fold higher than that in the wild-type strain. The <italic>hilE</italic> mRNA level measured by real-time PCR also revealed that <italic>hilE</italic> expression was increased in SR1304 by about 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). These results suggest that Mlc can act as a negative regulator of <italic>hilE</italic>. </p><p>The role of HilE in the regulation of SPI1 gene expression by Mlc was further studied by comparing the invasive abilities of the <italic>hilE</italic> and <italic>hilE/mlc</italic> mutant strains of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Invasiveness for HEp-2 cells was reduced to 39.1% of the wild-type level by <italic>mlc</italic> mutation, whereas it was increased by 1.57-fold by <italic>hilE</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). However, the <italic>hilE/mlc</italic> double mutant showed an almost similar invasion ability to that of the <italic>hilE</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), which suggests that the effect of the <italic>mlc</italic> mutation on the invasive phenotype is mainly dependent upon HilE function. The requirement of <italic>hilE</italic> for Mlc function was reflected in the levels of <italic>hilD</italic> transcription. While <italic>hilD</italic> expression was reduced in the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant, it was slightly higher than the wild-type level in both the <italic>hilE</italic> and <italic>hilE/mlc</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Additionally, the over-expression of HilD from the plasmid pJB3 containing <italic>hilD</italic> gene under the control of a <italic>lac</italic> promoter caused the induction of <italic>hilA</italic> by &#x0223c;2-fold and <italic>invF</italic> by &#x0223c;6-fold irrespective of <italic>hilE</italic> or <italic>mlc</italic> mutation when real-time PCR was used to compare the expression levels (data not shown). Since HilD activates the transcription of <italic>hilA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), which in turn can activate HilA-dependent <italic>invF</italic><sub>A</sub> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and directly activates HilC/D-dependent <italic>invF</italic><sub>D</sub> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), these results establish that the <italic>mlc</italic> mutation exerts a negative effect on SPI1 gene expression, mainly by increasing the level of <italic>hilE</italic> expression. The low level of <italic>hilD</italic> expression in the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant can be explained by the fact that the increased level of HilE in the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant can repress the activity of HilD, which is known to act as an activator of its own expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>hilE</italic> P3 promoter is repressed by Mlc</title><p>Baxter and Jones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) have identified two independent <italic>hilE</italic> promoters, P1 and P2. We performed a primer extension assay of total RNA isolated from SL1344 grown to exponential phase in static culture, using the primer described by Baxter and Jones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), to discover which promoter is regulated by Mlc. The transcriptional start site of one transcript, designated P1, agreed with the previous report, although the promoter activity was very low under the conditions used in our experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). We detected a stronger transcript, designated P2, upstream of P1, although the transcription start site of P2 was mapped 12 nucleotides upstream of that reported by Baxter and Jones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C). This difference could be attributed to differences in the experimental model conditions; in our study, total RNA from a <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain was used in the primer extension assay, whereas Baxter and Jones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) used total RNA prepared from <italic>E. coli</italic> harboring the <italic>hilE</italic> reporter plasmid pMAB69. However, the activities of the two promoters were not changed by <italic>mlc</italic> mutation. Using a primer extension assay with the hilE5 primer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), the promoter of <italic>hilE</italic>, which is designated as P3, was newly identified; this promoter initiates 335 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site of <italic>hilE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 1). We observed putative &#x02212;10 (TTAAAT) and &#x02212;35 (ATAACA) motifs for <italic>hilE</italic> P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Transcription from the P3 promoter was increased substantially by <italic>mlc</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 2). The specificity of the Mlc effect was verified by complementation, as the plasmid pKB, which expresses <italic>mlc</italic>, restored the transcriptional level of <italic>hilE</italic> in SR1304 almost to that of the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 4). </p></sec><sec><title>Mlc directly represses <italic>hilE</italic> by binding to the P3 promoter</title><p>A gel mobility shift assay was performed with purified Mlc, to test whether Mlc directly represses the <italic>hilE</italic> P3 promoter. The Mlc-His6 protein was produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified to &#x0003e;90% homogeneity by Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity chromatography. The activity of the purified Mlc-His6 protein was verified with the control gel mobility shift experiment employing the <italic>Salmonella ptsG</italic> DNA fragment that contains the known Mlc-binding site (data not shown). When the labeled <italic>hilE</italic> promoter DNA was incubated with 2-fold dilutions of the purified Mlc-His6 protein (100&#x02013;800&#x02009;nM) in the presence of the non-specific DNA competitor poly dI-dC, the concentration-dependent formation of protein&#x02013;DNA complexes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The addition of cold probe released the labeled probe from the retarded complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, right panel), which indicates specific binding of Mlc to the <italic>hilE</italic> P3 promoter DNA.</p><p>The precise locations of the Mlc-binding sites were determined by DNase I footprinting with His-tagged Mlc. Two Mlc-binding sites, one at position &#x02212;10 to +12 (Mlc 1) and the other at position &#x02212;86 to &#x02212;108 (Mlc 2) with respect to the transcriptional start site of <italic>hilE</italic> P3, were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Inspection of the DNA sequences at these sites showed high-level homology with the known consensus Mlc-binding sequence, which has the conserved TT-9&#x02009;bp-AA motif and an AT-rich region at positions &#x000b1;7 to &#x000b1;11, showing imperfect dyad symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). These results clearly demonstrate that Mlc can regulate directly the <italic>hilE</italic> P3 promoter by binding to the promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Sugars that induce the Mlc regulon repress <italic>hilD</italic> expression by activating <italic>hilE</italic></title><p>Sequestration of Mlc by the unphosphorylated form of glucose permease, enzyme IICB<sup>Glc</sup>, is known to displace Mlc from its DNA-binding sites, thereby allowing transcription of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). The Mlc regulon can be induced by glucose and, to a lesser extent, by mannose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The effects of various carbon sources on the expression of <italic>hilE</italic> and <italic>hilD</italic> were studied with two Mlc regulon-inducing sugars, glucose and mannose, and two Mlc regulon-non-inducing carbohydrates, arabinose and glycerol. SL1344 and SR1304 carrying either pMAB69 (<italic>hilE-lacZY</italic>) or pJB5 (<italic>hilD-lacZY</italic>) were cultivated in TB that was buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.1&#x02009;M MOPS, to minimize pH effects arising from growth in the presence of the various carbon sources. In the wild-type strain, glucose and mannose increased <italic>hilE</italic> expression 2-fold and <italic>hilE</italic> activation reduced <italic>hilD</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The expression levels of <italic>hilE</italic> and <italic>hilD</italic> remained almost unaffected in the presence of glycerol. Interestingly, arabinose also activated <italic>hilE</italic>, albeit to a lesser degree than either glucose or mannose. Nevertheless, this caused a minute increase in <italic>hilD</italic> expression. In the absence of sugars, the <italic>mlc</italic> mutation increased <italic>hilE</italic> expression 1.5-fold, with a concomitant reduction in <italic>hilD</italic> expression. On the other hand, the expression in SR1304 of both <italic>hilE</italic> and <italic>hilD</italic> was increased in the presence of glucose, mannose or arabinose. These results imply that multiple regulatory pathways are involved in the regulation of <italic>hilE</italic> and <italic>hilD</italic> by carbohydrates. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Analysis of the <italic>Salmonella mlc</italic> mutant revealed that invasiveness for epithelial cells was impaired by the <italic>mlc</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). It is well known that SPI1 is required for the invasion of host cells and induction of macrophage apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). The genetic evidence to date is consistent with a regulatory cascade of transcriptional activation, in which HilD, HilA and InvF act sequentially to activate SPI1 expression. In brief, HilD binds directly to sites upstream of <italic>hilA</italic> and <italic>invF</italic><sub>D</sub> and acts as an activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). HilA activates the transcription of <italic>invF</italic><sub>A</sub> and SPI1-T3SS apparatus genes required for the secretion of effector proteins, whereas the expression of effector proteins is regulated by InvF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). This regulatory cascade implies that the reduced invasive phenotype of <italic>mlc</italic> mutant is the result of <italic>hilD</italic> repression, which affects both <italic>hilA</italic> and <italic>invF</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The 2&#x02013;3-fold decrease in <italic>hilD</italic> expression caused by the <italic>mlc</italic> mutation is sufficient to account for the nearly 10-fold decrease in <italic>hilA</italic> and <italic>invF</italic><sub>A</sub> transcription, owing to the nature of the feed-forward regulatory loop, in that moderate effects on HilD production are amplified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Although the <italic>Salmonella mlc</italic> mutant was less invasive for epithelial cells than the wild-type strain, the extent of the reduction in invasiveness and cytotoxicity of the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant was not as great as we had expected, considering the observed reduction in SPI1 gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This may be partly due to the expression of <italic>hilC</italic>, a de-repressor of <italic>hilA</italic>, which was not reduced in the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The <italic>hilC</italic> mutation had little effect on SPI1 gene expression or the invasive phenotype, whereas the over-expression of <italic>hilC</italic> suppressed the <italic>hilD</italic> mutation, thereby promoting high levels of <italic>hilA</italic> and <italic>invF</italic> expression, which suggests that HilC can partially compensate for the loss of function of HilD and the invasive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). We have reported previously that there may be an independent <italic>hilC</italic> regulatory pathway that is not applicable to <italic>hilA</italic> or <italic>invF</italic><sub>A</sub> regulation when bacteria respond to changes in osmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Our data clearly demonstrate that Mlc directly regulates <italic>hilE</italic> expression by binding to the <italic>hilE</italic> P3 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The two Mlc-binding sites in <italic>hilE</italic> P3 identified by the gel mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting analysis show high-level homology with the known consensus Mlc-binding sequences; additionally, the two Mlc-binding sites are separated by 98&#x02009;nt, as is the case for other promoters that have two Mlc-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The transcriptional start site of the <italic>hilE</italic> P3 promoter lies 335&#x02009;nt upstream of the ATG start codon of <italic>hilE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C). It is unusual that the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA is more than 300&#x02009;nt in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). However, this length of 5&#x02032;-UTR has been observed in other SPI1 regulators. The HilC/D-dependent transcriptional start site of the <italic>invF</italic><sub>D</sub> promoter is 631&#x02009;bp upstream of the <italic>invF</italic> open reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The UTR of the <italic>hilA</italic> gene is also up to 350&#x02009;nt in length, and is suggested to be involved in the complex regulation of <italic>hilA</italic> in response to environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the region 190&#x02013;270-bp upstream of the <italic>hilE</italic> promoter is required for the activation of <italic>hilE</italic> P2 expression by FimYZ, which is a response regulator that is involved in the expression of type 1 fimbriae and motility genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional <italic>cis</italic>- or <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory elements, which have not yet been characterized, are involved in <italic>hilE</italic> expression.</p><p>Glucose and mannose induce the Mlc regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) by dephosphorylating EIICB<sup>Glc</sup>, which then sequesters Mlc from its binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). It has been suggested that glucose plays a negative role in the expression of invasion-associated genes in <italic>Salmonella</italic>. The addition of excess glucose to the culture medium results in the reduction of cell association by <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). The glucose present in DLB (LB broth diluted 1:5) decreased <italic>hilA</italic> expression 2.5-fold, as compared to DLB without glucose, while lactose and arabinose had little effect on <italic>hilA</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). The results presented in this study support the notion that <italic>hilE</italic> expression is activated as a result of Mlc sequestration by unphosphorylated EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> in the presence of glucose. We observed a 2-fold activation of <italic>hilE</italic> and concomitant repression of <italic>hilD</italic> in the presence of glucose or mannose, which are known inducers of the Mlc regulon, when TB was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). However, the effect of the sugar was not seen when LB was used (data not shown). We speculate that the nutrient-rich LB broth may mask the effect of the sugar on <italic>hilE</italic> expression because the effect of sugar addition on <italic>hilA</italic> expression was more distinct in DLB than LB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In addition, <italic>hilE</italic> expression was also increased in the presence of arabinose, which suggests an additional regulatory mechanism mediated by arabinose.</p><p>Interestingly, carbohydrate regulation of <italic>hilE</italic> and <italic>hilD</italic> expression in the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant created a different story. All of the carbohydrates tested in this study, with the exception of glycerol, increased <italic>hilD</italic> expression by &#x0223c;1.1&#x02013;1.2-fold, even though <italic>hilE</italic> expression in the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant was increased by &#x0223c;30% in the presence of the sugars tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). These results suggest that the presence of complex regulatory mechanisms for <italic>hilE</italic> is required for optimal regulation of the SPI1 genes, as can be expected from the complex regulatory networks identified in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). It has been suggested that the two-component regulatory system PhoR-PhoB leads to increased <italic>hilE</italic> P2 expression and subsequent repression of <italic>hilA</italic> and invasion genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The PhoR sensor kinase phosphorylates PhoB when extracellular P<sub>i</sub> levels are low, and the phosphorylated PhoB then binds and activates the promoters in the Pho regulon. However, even in the absence of PhoR, many carbon sources are known to activate the Pho regulon via CreC, which is a PhoR homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Thus, carbon metabolism sensed by PhoB/R may also affect <italic>hilE</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and this may be one of the reasons for the elevated <italic>hilE</italic> expression in the presence of carbohydrates in the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A).</p><p>Recently, Teplitski <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) have reported that the expression of <italic>sirA</italic>, which is a response regulator for BarA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), is decreased in the presence of 50&#x02009;mM glucose. The repressive effect of glucose was also observed for the downstream members of the SirA regulon, such as <italic>csrB</italic>, <italic>csrC</italic> and <italic>hilA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Collectively, these results show that SPI1 is not activated when <italic>Salmonella</italic> is grown in the presence of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Since the environmental conditions faced by <italic>Salmonella</italic> change constantly during passage through the intestine of the animal host, this bacterium should use multiple signals to modulate the virulence genes needed for survival. It is known that <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium uses bile or SCFAs including acetate, propionate and butyrate, as environmental signals to modulate its invasion of the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50 B51 B52">50&#x02013;52</xref>). We propose that <italic>Salmonella</italic> can use the glucose concentration of the mammalian intestinal tract as one of many signals for the regulation of invasion genes. <italic>Salmonella</italic> may use Mlc to sense the availability of sugars, thereby allowing decisions as to when and where to initiate the expression of genes involved in invasion. <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium typically invades the distal small intestine (ileum) of the mammalian upper gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Simple sugars, such as glucose, are rarely encountered in the distal ileum, as most are absorbed in the proximal portion of the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). The relatively high glucose concentration in the proximal small intestine may repress SPI1 gene expression through Mlc, perhaps together with PhoR-PhoB and/or SirA, whereas upon transit to the distal ileum, the glucose concentration becomes low enough to activate the invasion genes of SPI1. The effects of various sugars on the differential regulation of SPI1 genes require further investigation to understand their roles in <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by a grant of the Korea Health 21 R&#x00026;D project, Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare, Republic of Korea (01-PJ10-PG6-01GM02-0002 and 00-PJ1-PG3-22000-0008).
