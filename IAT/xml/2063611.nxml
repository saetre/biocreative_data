Recent studies indicate that one member of the family, Rab27a, regulates transport of lysosome-related organelles in specialized cells, such as melanosomes and lytic granules. Very little is known about the related isoform, Rab27b. Here we used genetically modified mice to study the involvement of the Rab27 proteins in mast cells, which play key roles in allergic responses. Both Rab27a and Rab27b isoforms are expressed in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) and localize to secretory granules. Nevertheless, secretory defects as measured by &#x003b2;-hexosaminidase release <italic>in vitro</italic> and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis <italic>in vivo</italic> were found only in Rab27b and double Rab27 knockout (KO) mice. Immunofluorescence studies suggest that a subset of Rab27b and double Rab27-deficient BMMCs exhibit mild clustering of granules. Quantitative analysis of live-cell time-lapse imaging revealed that BMMCs derived from double Rab27 KO mice showed almost 10-fold increase in granules exhibiting fast movement (&#x0003e;1.5 &#x003bc;m/s), which could be disrupted by nocodazole. These results suggest that Rab27 proteins, particularly Rab27b, play a crucial role in mast cell degranulation and that their action regulates the transition from microtubule to actin-based motility.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mast cell</kwd><kwd>organelle motility</kwd><kwd>Rab27</kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Mast cells play central roles in allergic and T-helper lymphocyte type 2-mediated immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Mast cell secretory granules store various inflammatory mediators including histamine and serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), and the activation of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor induces exocytosis of the granules, resulting in inflammatory mediators release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The study of mast cell secretion is thus of great relevance to therapeutically modulate the activity of mast cells in the control of allergic diseases, such as asthma.</p><p>The Rab family of Ras-like GTPases, which comprise more than 60 members in mammalian cells, have been implicated in regulated secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Rab3 proteins have been studied for many years in neuronal and non-neuronal regulated exocytotic events, but the precise mechanism by which they operate remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). More recently, Rab27a has been implicated as a positive regulator of regulated exocytosis in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), neuroendocrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and prostate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Rab27a appears to promote the switch between microtubule (MT)-based organelle motility to actin-based motility by recruiting myosin-interacting proteins, such as Melanophilin and Myrip. These proteins in turn bind to unconventional myosins such as Myosin Va, thereby promoting tethering and movement along the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Mutations in the human <italic>RAB27A</italic> gene cause Griscelli syndrome. This disorder is characterized by partial albinism of the skin and the hair associated with variable immunodeficiency, and caused by motility defects in melanosomes and lytic granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Furthermore, Rab27a recruits effectors of the synaptotagmin-like protein family (such as granuphilin) and Munc13-4, which may act downstream of myosin in the docking of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). The present evidence thus suggests that Rab27a acts as a positive regulator of regulated secretion in either conventional Golgi-derived granules in exocrine and endocrine cells, or lysosome-related organelles in hematopoietic cells and melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>The mast cell secretory granules are considered lysosome-related organelles as they share features with lysosomes, such as containing lysosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Rab3d was proposed to be a regulator of mast cell secretory granule exocytosis, because overexpression of Rab3d results in a reduction of exocytosis in the model cell line, RBL-2H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). However, mast cell secretion in Rab3d knockout (KO) mice is unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). More recently, Rab27a and its effector Munc13-4 were implicated in secretory granule exocytosis in RBL-2H3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>The Rab27 subfamily consists of two isoforms sharing 71% amino acid sequence similarity, Rab27a and Rab27b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Rab27a is widely expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), whereas the expression of Rab27b is more restricted and detectable in platelets, the pituitary gland and the digestive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Very little is known about the function of Rab27b other than being implicated as a positive regulator of exocrine gland exocytosis, namely, of zymogen granules in pancreatic acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) and amylase granules in parotid acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). We have recently generated a Rab27b KO using a conditional Cre&#x02013;loxP strategy, which enabled analysis of Rab27 functions in specialized cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). We have shown that <italic>Rab27b</italic> KO and double <italic>Rab27a/Rab27b</italic> KO mice exhibit significant hemorrhagic disease. Platelets exhibited impaired <italic>in vitro</italic> aggregation properties, and reduced number and secretion of dense granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). In this paper, we describe mast cell function studies using Rab27a KO, Rab27b KO and double KO mice. We show surprisingly that despite expression of both isoforms, mast cells exhibit opposite phenotypes in individual KOs. Rab27b appears to be the critical regulator of mast cell degranulation by enabling peripheral actin-mediated retention of granules near the plasma membrane prior to exocytosis.</p><sec><title>Results</title><p>To determine the expression of Rab27 isoforms in mast cells, we prepared interleukin-3 (IL-3) and stem cell factor-dependent bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) from Rab27a KO or more precisely the naturally occurring <italic>ashen</italic> (<italic>ash</italic>) strain, <italic>Rab27a<sup>ash/ash</sup></italic>, the recently created Rab27b KO (<italic>Rab27b</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), the double Rab27 KO resulting from the cross of these two strains (<italic>Rab27a<sup>ash/ash</sup></italic>; <italic>Rab27b</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice and respective heterozygote control littermates. All BMMCs studied expressed both c-Kit and high-affinity IgE receptor, markers that are characteristic of mature BMMCs (data not shown). We detected expression of both Rab27a and Rab27b proteins using isoform-specific antibodies in wild-type BMMC lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>). The absence of reactivity in the respective KO lines confirms that these lines indeed are defective in the expression of the respective Rab27 isoform. We conclude that both Rab27a and Rab27b proteins are expressed in BMMCs and that their expression appears to be dispensable for the cytokine-dependent emergence and differentiation of BMMC.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Rab27 proteins in BMMCs</title><p>A) Bone marrow-derived mast cells derived from C57BL/6J wild-type, Rab27a KO (<italic>Rab27a<sup>ash/ash</sup></italic>), Rab27b KO (<italic>Rab27b</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and double KO (<italic>Rab27a<sup>ash/ash</sup></italic><italic>Rab27b</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described under <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>.

Immunostaining with the anti-Rab27b antibody indicated that Rab27b exhibited a punctate vesicular staining pattern throughout the cytoplasm, which overlapped with the signal obtained from the anti-serotonin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>). The Rab27a immunostaining pattern was more diffuse, although some discrete punctate staining was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>). These results suggest that Rab27b and to a lesser extent Rab27a are associated with serotonin-containing mast cell secretory granules.</p><p>The presence of the Rab27 isoforms in BMMCs raised the possibility that they could be controlling regulated secretion in these cells and thus allergic responses in mice. As a first test, we assessed the ability of the single and double Rab27 KO lines to react against immune challenge using the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) response because anaphylaxis mediated via high-affinity IgE receptor is regarded predominantly as a mast cell-dependent event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Mice were challenged intradermally with IgE or saline in different locations of the dorsal dermis. After sensitization, mice were injected intravenously with antigen and dye, and PCA responses were measured after 1 h. A marked reduction in PCA response was observed in Rab27b and double KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B,C</xref>), despite the presence of toluidine-positive cells in the dorsal dermis (Figure S1). Surprisingly, the PCA response was enhanced in Rab27a KO mice dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2A</xref>). These differences were statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>&#x0003e;Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assays in Rab27-deficient mice</title><p><italic>Rab27a<sup>ash/ash</sup></italic>(ash/ash) or heterozygote littermate (ash/+) mice (A), <italic>Rab27b</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) or heterozygote littermate (&#x02212;/+) mice (B), and <italic>Rab27a<sup>ash/ash</sup>Rab27b</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) or heterozygote littermate (&#x02212;/+) mice (C) were subjected to PCA assays as described under <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>.

Thus, we next examined the effects of Rab27 KOs on antigen-induced &#x003b2;-hexosaminidase release from BMMC <italic>in vitro</italic>. These <italic>in vitro</italic> assays are rather variable from experiment to experiment as they depend on the culture conditions and can only be compared within experiments. Furthermore, the experiments shown are only qualitatively representative as the magnitude of the response and the differences observed also varied in independent experiments. The antigen, dinitrophenyl (DNP)-BSA, induced &#x003b2;-hexosaminidase release from BMMC cells sensitized with anti-DNP IgE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). In Rab27b KO BMMCs, we observed a small decreased in the secretory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B</xref>). In Rab27a KO BMMCs, we observed a small increase in stimulated secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A</xref>). Strikingly, &#x003b2;-hexosaminidase release was more consistently reduced in double Rab27 KO BMMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3C</xref>). The general trend of these experiments was confirmed in antigen-induced histamine release assays (data not shown). These results were consistent with the PCA assay <italic>in vivo</italic> and suggested that Rab27 proteins are key regulators of antigen-induced secretion in mast cells.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Antigen-induced &#x003b2;-hexosaminidase release in BMMCs derived from Rab27-deficient mice</title><p>Bone marrow-derived mast cells derived from <italic>Rab27a<sup>ash/ash</sup></italic> (ash/ash) or heterozygote littermate (ash/+) mice (A), <italic>Rab27b</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) or heterozygote littermate (&#x02212;/+) mice (B) and <italic>Rab27a<sup>ash/ash</sup>Rab27b</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) or heterozygote littermate (&#x02212;/+) mice (C) were subjected to &#x003b2;-hexosaminidase release assay as described under <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>.

Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy allows real-time imaging of fluorescence near the plasma membrane. We used LysoTracker Red DND-99 as a marker for secretory granules as we observed its concentration in serotonin-positive granules (data not shown). In general, we observed that the vast majority of granules in BMMCs was stationary and a minority of granules was motile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref>; Movie S1). However, quantitative analysis revealed significant differences between strains. Granules exhibiting displacements over 1.5 &#x003bc;m were increased by almost 10-fold in double KO BMMCs (and Rab27b KO BMMCs, data not shown) as compared to double heterozygote controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; Movie S2). Conversely, the percentage of motile granules defined as those with displacements exceeding 0.5 &#x003bc;m and average velocity exceeding 0.1 &#x003bc;m/s decreased in double KO BMMCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, and given the large increase of fast-moving granules (&#x0003e;1.5 &#x003bc;m/s) in double KO cells, the twofold decrease in motile granules can be accounted by a decrease in slow moving granules (&#x0003c;1.5 &#x003bc;m/s displacement). We hypothesized that the fast movements observed were attributable to MT-based motility; so we treated cells with nocodazole, a MT-disrupting agent. Consistently, nocodazole treatment inhibited the fast and long-range movements of LysoTracker-labeled granules in double KO BMMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6C</xref>; Movie S3).

Our data indicate that simultaneous loss of both Rab27a and Rab27b leads to a severe secretory defect <italic>in vitro</italic> and poor reactivity <italic>in vivo</italic>. The granule dynamics are affected in double KO mice with a dramatic increase in fast-moving granules, suggesting that the underlying defect could be impaired transition between MT-based and actin-based motility prior to exocytosis. Single KO of Rab27 isoforms further suggests that Rab27b may be the key regulator in mast cells given that the Rab27b phenotype mimics, albeit less dramatically, that of the double KO.</p><p>The mode of action of Rab27a in melanocytes as a key regulator of melanosome motility to recruit myosin motors to mature melanosomes and thus induce their peripheral retention has been intensively investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Our present studies suggest that a similar mechanism may be operating in mast cell granule dynamics. Rab27 isoforms appear to be required for the transition from MTs to actin, as revealed by our live-cell imaging and quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; Movies S1, S2 and S3). Our data suggest that MT-dependent secretory granule movements are increased in double Rab27 KO mast cells, presumably because of a disconnection between MT and actin motor systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In Rab27b KO mast cell, a similar but more subtle phenotype is observed, both morphologically with some cells showing evidence of perinuclear granule clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref>) and functionally with increased numbers of fast-moving granules (data not shown). Therefore, our data is consistent with the involvement of Rab27 proteins, particularly Rab27b in MT-actin transition as previously established for Rab27a in skin melanocytes. We speculate that Rab27 proteins recruit a Rab-and-Myosin linker effector such as Melanophilin or Myrip, which will then recruit an unconventional myosin. Further studies should aim at identifying the Rab27 molecular partners in mast cell granule dynamics.</p><p>Mast cells represent a cell type where both Rab27a and Rab27b are expressed, providing an opportunity to determine the relative contributions of each isoform and address redundancy issues. Our studies suggest that when Rab27b is absent, then Rab27a may partially compensate for its loss as a positive regulator of exocytosis, given that the secretory defect in the double KO cells is more severe than in the single <italic>Rab27b</italic> KO. The partial redundancy of the Rab27 isoforms was expected given our previous studies on the pathogenesis of Griscelli syndrome where we showed that transgenic heterologous expression of Rab27b in melanocytes could compensate for melanosome clustering and coat color dilution in <italic>Rab27a</italic> KO (<italic>ash</italic>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). So far, only a few cases of functional redundancy have been reported for the Rab family, namely the requirement for simultaneous KO of all four Rab3 isoforms to achieve lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) and the redundant role of Rab38 and Rab32 in melanosome biogenesis in skin melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>).</p><p>One surprising result obtained here was the increased secretory responses in BMMCs derived from <italic>Rab27a<sup>ash/ash</sup></italic> mice, raising the possibility that Rab27a and Rab27b might have distinct roles in mast cell secretion. A possible interpretation is that Rab27a performs an inhibitory function on regulated exocytosis in mast cells. Interestingly, the secretory actions attributed to the related Rab3 proteins in the neuroendocrine PC12 cell line are also inhibitory. Overexpression of any Rab3 isoform leads to a strong decrease in Ca<sup>++</sup>-regulated exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). However, more detailed analysis revealed that the inhibitory effect on regulated exocytosis is indirect and results from an activation of constitutive exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Therefore, one interesting possibility is that Rab27a may be performing a similar action in mast cells. It is noteworthy that Rab27 and Rab3 are able to interact with the same effectors, such as Rabphilin, Granuphilin and Noc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>The findings presented here highlight some of the limitations of studying cultured cell lines and conversely the importance of studying primary cells in specialized systems of medical relevance. A previous study using RBL-2H3 cells, a rat basophilic leukemia-derived cell line commonly used as a model for mast cells implicated Rab3d in regulated exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). However, Rab3d KO mice exhibit normal mast cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Recent studies suggested that Rab27a and its effector Munc13-4 regulate exocytosis of secretory granules in the same cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Our studies with primary cells suggest instead that Rab27a performs an inhibitory role.</p><p>The identification of severely reduced mast cell responses <italic>in vivo</italic> in the <italic>Rab27b</italic> KO mouse is the first report that Rab27b contributes to allergic responses in mammals and suggests that Rab27b may be a future drug target for allergic diseases, such as asthma. In fact, the restricted pattern of expression observed for Rab27b compared with Rab27a further strengthens this possibility, suggesting that interfering with Rab27b function may lead to rather specific effects. Future studies should assess the therapeutic potential of interfering with Rab27b function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>The primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-Rab27a antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab27a antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab27b antibody were as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>).
