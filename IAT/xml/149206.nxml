Following antigenic stimulation of T cells the two central cytokines IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1; are co-expressed and co-regulated. Two important transcription factors, i.e., early growth response (EGR) protein EGR-1 and nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) protein NFATc, regulate transcription of the human IL-2 cytokine and the same combination of EGR and NFAT proteins seems relevant for coordinated cytokine expression. Here we demonstrate that the zinc finger protein EGR-1 and two members of the NFAT protein family bind simultaneously to adjacent elements position &#x02013;168 to &#x02013;150 within the TNF&#x003b1; promoter. Both promoter sites are important for TNF&#x003b1; gene transcription as shown by transfection assays having the IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1; promoters linked to a luciferase reporter. The use of promoter deletion constructs with the zinc finger protein (ZIP), the NFAT binding element or a combination of both deleted show a functional cooperation of these elements and of their binding factors. These experiments demonstrate that EGR-1 as well as EGR-4 functionally cooperate with NFAT proteins and induce expression of both cytokine genes. Using tagged NFATc and NFATp in glutathione S-transferase pull down assays showed interaction and physical complex formation of each NFAT protein with recombinant, as well as native, EGR-1 and EGR-4 proteins. Thus EGR-NFAT interaction and complex formation seems essential for human cytokine expression as adjacent ZIP and NFAT elements are conserved in the IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1; gene promoters. Binding of regulatory EGR and NFAT factors to these sites and the functional interaction and formation of stable heterodimeric complexes indicate an important role of these factors for gene transcription.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The four &#x02018;early growth response&#x02019; proteins EGR-1 to EGR-4 represent a family of DNA-binding zinc finger proteins that act as nuclear effectors of extracellular signals. EGR genes are transiently and coordinately induced upon activation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c2">2</xref>). In addition EGR-genes are expressed in a wide range of cell types, including lymphoid and myeloid cells such as thymocytes, B cells and monocytes, as well as non lymphoid cells such as fibroblasts, kidney cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c4">4</xref>). The individual cDNAs have been isolated from several sources and consequently different names are used for EGR-1 (zif268, Krox24, tis8, NGFI-A and pAT 225) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c7">7</xref>), EGR-2 (Krox 20, pAT591) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c9">9</xref>), EGR-3 (PILOT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c11">11</xref>) and EGR-4 (NGFI-C, pAT133) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c12">12</xref>). EGR transcripts are induced by a wide range of stimuli, such as activation and differentiation signals, tissue injury and apoptotic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c4">4</xref>).</p><p>The four EGR proteins have highly related DNA-binding zinc finger domains, but their divergent flanking regions indicate specific functions of the individual proteins. Binding of all four recombinant EGR proteins to the same consensus sequence GCG G&#x0002f;TGG GCG is in agreement with the high conservation of their zinc finger domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c13">13</xref>). EGR-binding elements, indicative of EGR target genes, have been identified in a large panel of gene promoters, including immune effector genes, such as the cytokine IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c14">14</xref>), the pro-inflammatory immune mediator TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c15">15</xref>), and cell surface molecules such as the IL-2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c16">16</xref>), Fas&#x0002f;CD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c17">17</xref>), ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c18">18</xref>) and FasL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c19">19</xref>). In addition EGR-1 binding elements are reported within the promoter domains of genes coding for transcription factors such as EGR-1, EGR-4, junD and nur77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c22">22</xref>), growth factors, such as insulin like growth factor-II, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tissue growth factor (TGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c28">28</xref>), cell cycle regulators, including the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene Rb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c29">29</xref>), cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c30">30</xref>) and in hormones, like the luteinizing hormone &#x003b2; (LH-&#x003b2;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c31">31</xref>).</p><p>The DNA binding role of the four EGR proteins is well established, but their contribution to gene transcription, tissue specific gene expression and precise mode of action are poorly defined so far. Over-expression of individual EGR factors in reporter gene assays shows rather low transcriptional activities, while in contrast deletion of the EGR-binding sites in the promoter reveals significant effects of these elements in gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c31">31</xref>). A selective and specific role of individual EGR proteins in gene transcription is confirmed by the distinct phenotype of EGR knock-out animals: EGR-1 knock-out mice show infertility of female animals, due to the lack of luteinizing hormone &#x003b2; (LH-&#x003b2;) gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c32">32</xref>), EGR-2 knock-out mice have defective nerve development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c33">33</xref>), EGR-3 knock-out mice lack formation of muscle spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c34">34</xref>) and EGR-4 knock-out mice show infertility of male animals due to arrest in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c35">35</xref>).</p><p>Despite the ubiquitous synthesis of EGR proteins, EGR-regulated genes are expressed in a tissue-restricted manner. Thus specificity of EGR function may be due to interaction with other proteins, most likely transcription factors that bind to adjacent sites in a given promoter context, or by factors of the basic transcription network. Synergistic function of EGR-1 with other nuclear factors has been reported, e.g., with the homeobox protein Ptx1 and the steroidogenic factor 1 (Sf-1) for regulation of the pituitary luteinizing hormone &#x003b2; (LH-&#x003b2;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c32">32</xref>), with RelA in the regulation of NFkB1 (p50) transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c36">36</xref>), with the cAMP response element-binding protein (CBP)&#x0002f;p300 in transcription of the lipoxygenase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c37">37</xref>) and with NFATc in IL-2 gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c14">14</xref>). In addition functional interaction of EGR-1 with Sp1 is reported for macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c38">38</xref>) and interaction of EGR-1 with the viral proteins Tat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c39">39</xref>), Tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c40">40</xref>), HBx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c41">41</xref>) and IE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c42">42</xref>) results in upregulation of genes like FasL, PDGF-B or TGF-&#x003b2;. In contrast complexes of EGR-1 with NAB1 or NAB2 are described as transcriptional inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c44">44</xref>).</p><p>Given the unique role of EGR-1 in the transcriptional regulation of T-cell growth factor IL-2, the mechanism by which this ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein mediates T cell-specific gene transcription is of special interest. Cytokine gene expression is a hallmark for T cell effector function and consequently transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 and the pro-inflammatory TNF&#x003b1; gene are studied in great detail. In addition TNF&#x003b1; expression is deregulated in a number of human inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c45">45</xref>). Previously we described a functional, synergistic interaction of EGR-1 with the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc) in regulation of IL-2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c46">46</xref>). NFAT proteins are considered key regulators of cytokine expression such as IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulated factor and TNF&#x003b1; genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c48">48</xref>). Five members of this protein family have been identified: NFATp (NFAT1, c<sub>2</sub>), NFATc (NFAT2, c<sub>1</sub>), NFAT3, NFATx (NFAT4, c<sub>3</sub>) and NFAT5. NFATp and NFATc are predominantly expressed in lymphoid cells, while NFATx is specifically detected in the thymus, NFAT3 is preferentially synthesized in non-lymphoid tissues and NFAT5 is a constitutive nuclear protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c49">49</xref>).</p><p>Here we identify a regulatory 35 bp promoter region which is conserved in sequence, position and orientation in the human IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1; gene promoters. These regions include binding sites for zinc finger proteins EGR-1 and Sp1 and for NFAT proteins and seem responsible for the coordinated expression of the two cytokine genes. Mobility shift assays show that the individual elements serve as binding sites for unique zinc finger&#x02014;and for NFAT proteins. The ubiquitously expressed Sp1 and the inducible EGR-1 zinc finger protein bind to the ZIP elements of both promoters, while EGR-4 binds to the TNF&#x003b1;, but not the IL-2 site. Similarly NFATp binds to both promoters, while NFATc binds specifically to the IL-2 promoter. On a functional level interaction of EGR and NFAT proteins, but not of Sp1 contributes to transcription of both cytokine genes. This interaction is mediated by stable physical heterodimeric protein complexes. In summary these results explain how ubiquitously expressed transcription factors like EGR-proteins contribute to tissue or cell specific gene expression, like that of T cell specific effector genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The TNF&#x003b1; reporter deletion constructs p-191T-Luc, p-163T-Luc, p-142T-Luc, p-41T-Luc and p-191Tm-Luc contain various domains of the human TNF&#x003b1; promoter.

As the pro-inflammatory TNF&#x003b1; and the IL-2 gene are co-expressed in T cells, it is of interest to identify regulatory elements that mediate co-expression. A sequence alignment reveals a stretch of highly related sequences, which include the regulatory ZIP and NFAT elements in a similar position, distance and orientation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f1">1</xref>). This conservation suggested a conserved role of the ZIP and the NFAT sites for TNF&#x003b1; gene regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>The conserved promoter elements play a role in TNF&#x003b1; gene transcription</title><p>Reporter gene constructs were created in order to functionally characterize the ZIP and the NFAT sites of the human <italic>TNF</italic>&#x003b1; gene promoter. The four constructs represent either the wild type configuration (p-191T-Luc), have the individual ZIP or NFAT binding elements deleted (p-191Tm-Luc and p162T-Luc) or lack both elements (p-143T-Luc) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f2">2</xref>A). This set of constructs was tested for expression and regulation in Jurkat T cells. Upon transfection all four constructs showed only background activity in unstimulated cells (1&#x00025; of that of activated cells) and responded differently to PHA&#x0002f;PMA activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f2">2</xref>B). The wild type construct (p-191T-Luc), containing both the EGR and NFAT sites, and the construct with the deleted NFAT site (p-191Tm-Luc), were induced 17.5- and 16.7-fold, respectively. In contrast, the constructs which had either the EGR site (p-162T-Luc) or both the EGR and NFAT sites deleted (p-143T-Luc) showed a reduced activity (9.8- and 11.5-fold induction). These activities represent &#x0223c;50 and 67&#x00025; of those obtained with the activated wild type construct (100&#x00025;), thus showing that the EGR site together with the NFAT element contribute to TNF&#x003b1; promoter activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Proteins binding to the conserved promoter regions</title><p>Having demonstrated a regulatory effect of both the ZIP and the NFAT consensus sites within the human TNF&#x003b1; gene promoter we were interested to identify which proteins bind to these sites. Recombinant EGR-1, EGR-4, Sp1 and NFAT proteins were used in EMSA with oligonucleotides representing the ZIP-NFAT region either of the human IL-2 (ZN) or the TNF&#x003b1; gene promoter (T). EGR-1 and Sp1 bound to the IL-2, as well as to the TNF&#x003b1; sites although with different affinities. A stronger binding is observed to the IL-2 element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f3">3</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 5 and 6). In contrast recombinant EGR-4 bound rather weakly to the IL-2 site, but strongly to the TNF&#x003b1; element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f3">3</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Similarly NFATc and NFATp proteins showed different binding. NFATc bound to the IL-2, but not the TNF&#x003b1; site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f3">3</xref>, lanes 7 and 8), while NFATp bound to both promoter elements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f3">3</xref>, lanes 9 and 10). These data demonstrate different binding of the inducible EGR and NFAT proteins to the human IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1; gene promoters.</p></sec><sec><title>EGR-1 and EGR-4 regulate the TNF&#x003b1; reporter gene transcription in combination with NFATc and NFATp</title><p>Having demonstrated binding of three different zinc finger proteins to the ZIP site and specific binding of NFATp to the NFAT site of the TNF&#x003b1; gene promoter, we wanted to identify the factor or the combination of factors which mediate transcription of the TNF&#x003b1; gene. To this end, cotransfection experiments were performed in non-TNF&#x003b1; expressing 293T cells using several expression vectors together with reporter construct pTZN3-Luc. This reporter construct has three copies of the TNF&#x003b1; ZIP-NFAT region and a minimal promoter element linked to the firefly luciferase gene. Expression of the zinc finger protein Sp1 alone or in combination with NFATc or NFATp showed minimal effects on reporter gene expression (2&#x02013;3-fold, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f4">4</xref>A). Thus neither Sp1 nor NFATc or NFATp proteins alone, or a combination of these factors, contribute to TNF&#x003b1; gene expression.</p><p>Expression of EGR-1 resulted in a 5-fold increase in reporter gene activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f4">4</xref>B), which is in agreement with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c15">15</xref>). Co-expression of EGR-1 with either NFATc or NFATp resulted in a 20-fold induction of reporter gene expression, demonstrating synergistic interaction of EGR-1 with both NFAT proteins. Expression of EGR-4 as a single protein showed &#x0223c;3-fold induction of the reporter construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f4">4</xref>C). This zinc finger protein showed a similar cooperative effect with the analysed NFAT proteins, resulting in a 10-fold increase in reporter gene activity. Although three zinc finger proteins Sp1, EGR-1 and EGR-4 bind to the ZIP element of the human TNF&#x003b1; gene promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f3">3</xref>), the two inducible EGR proteins, but not the constitutively expressed Sp1 protein cooperate with NFATc and NFATp in TNF&#x003b1; gene expression. Interaction of EGR-1 with both NFAT proteins results in a 20-fold induction of the reporter construct.</p></sec><sec><title>EGR-1 and EGR-4 cooperate with NFAT proteins in context of the wild type TNF&#x003b1; promoter</title><p>Having demonstrated synergistic cooperation of EGR and NFAT proteins in the regulation of a synthetic construct, we also tested their effect on a wild type construct, that includes the complete 191 bp of the TNF&#x003b1; promoter. Used as single proteins both EGR proteins induced transcription &#x0223c;1.7-fold and both NFAT proteins induced transcription &#x0223c;5-fold. In combination EGR and NFAT proteins showed higher activities, ranging from 7.5- to 11-fold induction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f5">5</xref>). The highest levels, &#x0223c;11-fold activation was observed with EGR-4 in combination with NFATp. This value corresponds to 65&#x00025; of the induction of the same reporter construct by PHA and PMA (17.5-fold induction; data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>EGR-1 and EGR-4 interact with NFATc and NFATp proteins in activation of a IL-2 reporter gene</title><p>The functional interaction of EGR-1 and EGR-4 with the two NFAT proteins was also tested for the IL-2 gene promoter. To this end cotransfection assays were performed in 293T cells using a synthetic reporter construct which includes three copies of the IL-2 ZIP:NFAT binding elements and a minimal IL-2 promoter linked the luciferase gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f6">6</xref>). As single proteins EGR-1 and EGR-4 showed little activity on reporter gene transcription (1.25-fold) and NFATc and NFATp induced luciferase expression 11- and 17.6-fold. Synergistic effects were observed upon coexpression of EGR and NFAT proteins. In combination with NFATc EGR-1 enhanced transcription 65-fold and together with NFATp 80.5-fold. EGR-4 coexpressed with NFATc or NFATp showed similar effects, reaching &#x0223c;90-fold induction of the reporter gene. These results demonstrate a strong functional interaction of both EGR proteins with the two analysed NFAT proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant EGR and NFAT proteins form stable complexes</title><p>Given the functional synergy between the analysed EGR and NFAT proteins in the regulation of TNF&#x003b1; and IL-2 gene transcription (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f6">6</xref>), we next asked whether these proteins form physical complexes. EGR-1 and NFATc bind simultaneously to adjacent sites within the human IL-2 promoter, thus in their promoter bound context the two factors are in close contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c46">46</xref>). By mobility shift assays we were unable to demonstrate a direct physical interaction of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c12">12</xref>, and data not shown). Therefore an affinity based system was used to analyse heterodimer formation. NFATp and NFATc expressed as GST tagged fusion proteins were attached to a gluthatione matrix and binding of recombinant and native EGR proteins was assayed. Cell extract, prepared from insect cells expressing either recombinant EGR-1 or EGR-4 was applied to the NFAT matrix and after extensive washing bound proteins were eluted, separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and analysed by western blotting. Specificity of coupling, binding and elution of NFATc is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>A. Even in the presence of protease inhibitors proteolytic degradation occurred, as detected by the appearance of additional bands of lower molecular mass (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>A, lanes 1 and 7). Recombinant EGR-1 and EGR-4 proteins were detected by western blotting as 80 and 79 kDa proteins (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>B, lane 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>C, lane 1). Both EGR proteins did not bind completely to the NFATc matrix, and were still detectable in the flow through fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>B, lane 2 and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>C, lane 2). Specific attachment is observed as both proteins were present in the elute, but not in the wash fractions (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>B, lanes 5 and 6; with Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>C, lanes 5 and 6). These experiments demonstrate a direct physical interaction between EGR-1 and EGR-4 with NFATc. Specificity of the interaction was further demonstrated by using cell extract from cells expressing an unrelated protein &#x0005b;a deletion mutant of complement factor H (SCRs 15&#x02013;20)&#x0005d; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>D). In this control assay no bound proteins were detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>D, lane 6). To exclude non-specific binding of EGR-1 and EGR-4 to the GST matrix, recombinant proteins were incubated with the GST matrix and wash and elute fractions were tested for the presence of EGR proteins. Neither EGR-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>E) nor EGR-4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>F) bound to the matrix.</p><p>The same approach was used to analyse interaction of recombinant EGR-1 and EGR-4 with NFATp. NFATp was expressed as GST-tagged fusion protein, coupled to the matrix and analysed for binding. Both recombinant EGR-1 and EGR-4 were detected in the elute, but not in the wash fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f8">8</xref>B lanes 5 and 6; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f8">8</xref>C lanes 5 and 6). These experiments demonstrate a direct physical interaction between recombinant EGR-1 and EGR-4 proteins with NFATp.</p></sec><sec><title>Native EGR-1 and EGR-4 expressed in Jurkat cells interact with NFATc and NFATp</title><p>The relevance of the interaction observed with recombinant proteins was confirmed using native EGR proteins expressed in Jurkat T cells. Jurkat T cells were stimulated by PHA&#x0002f;PMA and the three zinc finger proteins Sp1, EGR-1 and EGR-4 were detected by western blotting as 99, 80 and 79 kDa bands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f9">9</xref>A, lanes 1, 2 and 3). This extract was applied to NFATc or NFATp matrixes and interaction was tested by analysing the proteins in the elute fractions. Sp1 was detected in the flow through, but not in the elute fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f9">9</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f9">9</xref>C lanes 1 and 2), showing that Sp1 did not bind to NFATc or to NFATp. In contrast both Jurkat derived EGR proteins were detected in the elute fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f9">9</xref>B, lanes 4 and 6, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f9">9</xref>C, lanes 4 and 6). These experiments demonstrate physical interaction between native, Jurkat expressed EGR-1 or EGR-4 with both NFATc and NFATp and show formation of stable EGR&#x02013;NFAT protein complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Binding of extracellular ligands to the T-cell receptor complex generates cytoplasmic signals that are transferred to the nucleus and consequently a large panel of transcription factors are induced. These nuclear factors include EGR, NFAT, AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B proteins which initiate transcription of immune effector genes including the T-cell specific growth factor IL-2 and the proinflammatory mediator TNF&#x003b1;. The activated transcription factors bind to adjacent promoter elements where they may interact with each other. Here we show that members of the EGR and NFAT protein families form stable heterodimeric complexes and cooperate in tissue specific expression of the immune effector genes IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1;. These stable EGR&#x0002f;NFAT complexes may help or even initiate assembly of the higher ordered protein complex, which controls gene transcription. Consequently a higher ordered protein complex can form, which combines inducible transcription factors and proteins of the basal transcriptional machinery like transcription associated factors (TAFs). Such a network of proteins is responsible for positioning RNA-polymerase II and initiation of mRNA transcription.</p><p>The human cytokine gene IL-2 and the pro-inflammatory mediator TNF&#x003b1; are co-expressed and co-regulated in human T-lymphocytes and based on their central immune regulatory roles both genes represent paradigms for cytokine gene expression. A 300 bp promoter element of the human IL-2 gene is essential for T cell specific expression and mediates the effects of the immune suppressive drug CSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c51">51</xref>). Similarly a 250 bp region of the human TNF&#x003b1; gene is sufficient for T cell specific expression. The essential pro-inflammatory role of TNF&#x003b1; is highlighted by the deregulated expression in a number of diseases e.g. consequently low TNF&#x003b1; levels contribute to the pathophysiology rheumatoid arthritis and septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c45">45</xref>).</p><p>In the human IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1; cytokine gene promoters, the sequence, position, distance and orientation of the EGR&#x0002f;Sp1 (ZIP) and NFAT binding sites are highly conserved. In the human IL-2 gene promoter the 37 bp promoter region, which includes the zinc finger protein (ZIP), the NFAT and the AP-1 binding elements (position &#x02013;297 to &#x02013;261) is important for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c14">14</xref>). The ZIP-element serves as a binding site for two distinct zinc finger proteins Sp1 and EGR-1. In non IL-2 producing cells the ubiquitously expressed Sp1 protein binds to this site and in IL-2 secreting cells Sp1 is replaced by the transiently induced EGR-1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c46">46</xref>). Individual members of the NFAT protein and AP-1 protein families bind to the NFAT and the adjacent AP-1 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c52">52</xref>). The human TNF&#x003b1; gene promoter contains a similar region located at positions &#x02013;169 to &#x02013;150, which represents binding sites for the zinc finger proteins Sp1, EGR-1, EGR-4 and NFATp (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c53">53</xref>).</p><p>The conservation of these regulatory sites indicates a general role for cytokine expression. The importance of the ZIP and NFATp sites for TNF&#x003b1; gene transcription is demonstrated by transfection experiments, as the intact wild type promoter conferred transcriptional activity in T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f2">2</xref>). Deletion of the ZIP site reduces transcriptional activity by &#x0223c;50&#x00025; and deletion of both the ZIP and NFAT sites by &#x0223c;40&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f2">2</xref>). Thus the ZIP promoter element contributes to TNF&#x003b1; promoter activity and gene expression. These experiments also reveal a regulatory role for the additional downstream elements, which include a cAMP response element (CRE) that binds STF-2&#x0002f;Jun and a <italic>k3</italic> and a proximal NFAT binding site (position &#x02013;121 to &#x02013;67) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c54">54</xref>).</p><p>Although highly related in sequence, distance and orientation the ZIP and NFAT elements display sequence differences which affect protein binding. The ZIP sites of both the IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1; promoter serve as binding sites for Sp1 and EGR-1, but EGR-4 binds specifically to the TNF&#x003b1; and not, or rather weakly to the IL-2 element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f3">3</xref>). Similarly NFATp, but not NFATc binds to the TNF&#x003b1; promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f3">3</xref>), and both NFATc and NFATp bind to the IL-2 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f3">3</xref>). The difference in sequences affects the affinity for each protein and thus selects binding of specific proteins. Formation of unique heterodimeric protein complexes at the particular promoter site seems of functional relevance as combinations of distinct EGR and NFAT proteins affect transcription differently (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f6">6</xref>).</p><p>Upon binding to adjacent promoter sites EGR and NFAT proteins are in close contact to each other and as demonstrated by GST pull down assays, form heterodimers (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f9">9</xref>). Clearly EGR-1, as well as EGR-4 form stable physical complexes with both NFATc and NFATp (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f9">9</xref>). These complexes are specific; as (i) the components are detected in the elute but not in the wash fractions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f9">9</xref>); (ii) are observed with both recombinant and the native proteins expressed in insect cells or Jurkat T cells, respectively (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f9">9</xref>); (iii) are not detected with the transcription factor Sp1, which also binds to the ZIP site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f9">9</xref>); and (iv) are independent of the surface, as they are not detected with a matrix lacking NFAT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f7">7</xref>).</p><p>Physical complex formation and the functional interaction highlights the cooperative effects of these DNA binding EGR and NFAT proteins on human cytokine gene transcription. As heterodimer formation is observed in the absence of DNA, promoter binding of one single component seems sufficient. The functional cooperativity is also observed for combinations, where only one partner binds to the promoter &#x0005b;e.g. NFATc in combination with EGR-1 and EGR-4 in TNF&#x003b1; context (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f5">5</xref>) and for EGR-4 in IL-2 gene transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg186f6">6</xref>)&#x0005d;.</p><p>Due to their sequence specific DNA-binding activities, EGR-proteins are considered transcription factors which regulate in positive and negative manner transcription of specific target genes. However in reporter gene assays, the single proteins display only marginal effects on transcription. This lack of activity indicates the requirement for cooperating factors. EGR-1 interacting proteins, with highly tissue specific expression have been identified for specific promoter contexts such as: (i) the homeobox protein Ptx1 and the steroidogenic factor 1 (Sf-1) in regulation of luteinizing hormone &#x003b2; (LH-&#x003b2;) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c32">32</xref>); (ii) the p65 protein in NFkB1 (p50) gene induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c36">36</xref>); (iii) the CBP&#x0002f;p300 upon upregulation of the lipoxygenase gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c37">37</xref>); (iv) the tumour suppressor p53 in programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c26">26</xref>); (v) the NFATc in FasL promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c19">19</xref>); and (vi) the repressor proteins termed NAB1 and NAB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg186c56">56</xref>). In summary this functional cooperation explains how inducible and ubiquitously expressed nuclear factors, like the EGR-proteins, contribute to tissue specific gene transcription.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg186f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Comparison of the human IL-2 and TNF&#x003b1; promoter segments.
