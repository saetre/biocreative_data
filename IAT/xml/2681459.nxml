MIF protein is present in most cells including pituitary cells, T cells, macrophages/monocytes, and is released in response to infection and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Plasma MIF concentrations are elevated in patients with inflammatory diseases such as sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, plasma concentration of MIF is positively correlated with the severity of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, mice deficient in the MIF gene, or those in which the MIF protein has been neutralized, are protected from lethal endotoxemia and septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In lung inflammation and injury models, MIP-2 and KC play key roles in neutrophil accumulation into the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Neutrophils are an important component of the inflammatory response in acute lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The elimination of neutrophils can markedly decrease the severity of lung injury in animal lung inflammation models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. MIF levels are increased in BAL fluid in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and MIF neutralizing antibody blocks LPS-induced pulmonary neutrophil accumulation in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], suggesting that MIF can influence neutrophil accumulation into the lungs.</p><p>CD74 (also known as a MHC class II invariant chain) is a type II transmembrane protein, reported to be part of the MIF receptor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Several studies have shown that CD74 is expressed both intracellularly and on the cell surface in B cell lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], T cell lymphoma, melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and gastric epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. MIF binds to cell surface CD74, and induces p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation and cell proliferation. Moreover neutralization of CD74 inhibits MIF-induced cell proliferation in B cells and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Other recent studies have shown that anti-CD74 antibody blocks MIF-CD74 binding on the cell surface of gastric epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and anti-CD74 antibody attenuated proliferation of prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. CD74 has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 28 amino acids and appears to lack intracellular signaling domains. Recently, CD44 has been identified as an accessory protein required for MIF-CD74 signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>MIF is found at increased levels in BAL fluids from both LPS induced lung inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and polymicrobial sepsis models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. BAL fluid-MIF levels in ARDS patients were also significantly increased compared with healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in MIF-induced lung inflammation. We have previously shown that MIF itself causes neutrophil accumulation into the alveolar space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. MIF is an intracellular protein that can be released into the extracellular environment where it acts as a potent inflammatory stimulant. Extracellular MIF can bind to the cell surface molecule CD74.</p><p>Therefore we focused on the MIF receptor CD74 in an animal model. We hypothesized that MIF, in the alveolar space, results in neutrophil accumulation via activation of the CD74. Here we used intra-tracheal instillation of MIF, and studied the contribution of CD74 in MIF-induced neutrophil accumulation in a mouse model.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that MIF instillation increased the concentration of MIP-2 and KC as well as the number of neutrophils in the alveolar space. This study shows that CD74 expressed on the cell surface of alveolar macrophages, contributes to the MIF-induced neutrophil accumulation into the alveolar space.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mouse model</title><p>All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research at North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System.

To examine the kinetics of MIF-induced leukocytosis, C57Bl/6 mice were instilled intratracheally with r-MIF and the influx of neutrophils was examined over time. The number of neutrophils in BAL fluid at 3, 6 or 20 hours after instillation of MIF significantly increased compared to control animals in which normal saline was instilled alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The number of neutrophils was highest at 6 hours post instillation (total number of neutrophils, saline; 0.09 &#x000b1; 0.04 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>, 3 hours; 2.95 &#x000b1; 1.13 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>, 6 hours; 5.10 &#x000b1; 1.35 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>, 20 hours; 4.18 &#x000b1; 1.31 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>).

To determine the involvement of CD74 in the MIF-induced responses, we examined CD74 expression in several cell types. We used RAW264.7 cells and the MLE-12 cells as models of alveolar macrophages and type II alveolar epithelial cells respectively, and assayed for the presence of CD74 in RAW264.7, MLE-12 and lung tissues. Two isoforms of CD74 (p41 and p31) were observed. There was higher expression of CD74 protein in RAW264.7 and lung tissues than in MLE-12 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). To confirm CD74 expression in primary alveolar macrophages in BAL fluid, we used immunofluorescence microscopy.

However, there was no significant activation of p38 MAPK or JNK signaling pathways (data not shown). To investigate whether MIF stimulation induces the release of neutrophil chemokines, we measured MIP-2 and KC in cell culture supernatants. There was a significant accumulation of MIP-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, MIP-2 at 100 ng/ml stimulation; 1243.1 &#x000b1; 35.3 pg/ml) but not KC (data not shown) in the culture media following stimulation with MIF. To confirm that activation of MIP-2 is downstream of p44/p42 MAPK following MIF stimulation, specific MAP kinase inhibitors were used. The p44/p42 MAPK specific inhibitor PD98059 attenuated the MIF-induced MIP-2 accumulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, MIF; 1219.7 &#x000b1; 48.1 pg/ml, MIF + PD; 752.2 &#x000b1; 42.6 pg/ml, p &#x0003c; 0.05).

MIF exists as a homotrimer, each monomer being approximately 12.5 kDa. MIF has enzymatic activities, and is a potent regulator of innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. MIF has immunoregulatory functions in sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], ARDS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], bronchial asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and tumorgenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Neutrophils play an important role in the inflammatory response, and can be associated with severe lung injury in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Previous studies suggest that MIF participates in neutrophil accumulation into the lung after intraperitoneal LPS injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the LPS intratracheal instillation model, neutralization of MIF attenuated capillary leak and the levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 in BAL fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The elimination of neutrophils, using anti-neutrophil antibody, markedly decreases the severity of animal acute lung injury in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Neutrophil recruitment from blood into tissue at sites of inflammation usually occurs in post-capillary venules and requires capture, rolling and adhesion on endothelial cells in acute lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A multitude of molecules including selectin, integrin, and immunoglobulin adhesion molecules, cytokines and chemokines participate in this sequential process in a variety of vascular beds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The CXC chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) has been implicated in mediating the influx of neutrophils into the lung in ARDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], particularly sepsis-associated ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The murine equivalents of IL-8, MIP-2 and KC, have been reported to be the two most crucial chemokines for neutrophil recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Neutralization of MIP-2 significantly decreases neutrophil recruitment into the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Both MIP-2 and KC bind to CXCR2 receptors, and blockade of CXCR2 attenuates neutrophil influx into the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the contribution of macrophage CD74 in MIF-induced neutrophil accumulation into the alveolar space. We showed previously that MIF has the ability to induce neutrophil accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These data suggest that MIF stimulates some types of cells in the alveolar space, to release MIP-2 and KC, which result in neutrophil accumulation in the alveolar space. Although the number of neutrophils in the alveolar space was less than in bacteria or bacterial component induced lung injury models, the current study showed that MIF administration can result in neutrophil accumulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). While MIF has potent inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties, the mechanisms of cellular binding and activation remain to be fully elucidated. The extracellular domain of CD74 has been shown to bind MIF with high affinity and act as a surface membrane receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Theoretically, MIF signaling is initiated after MIF binding to cell surface CD74. Recently, others have reported that expression of CD74 in mouse lung sections was predominantly localized to alveolar macrophage and type II alveolar epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Therefore we examined CD74 protein level and CD74 cell surface expression in macrophages and epithelial cells. Interestingly, we found that CD74 is expressed on the alveolar macrophage cell surface, suggesting that macrophages could respond to extracellular MIF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In addition, we have shown that macrophages can release MIP-2 following MIF stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), and MIF-induced MIP-2 accumulation depends, at least in part, on p44/p42 MAPK signaling pathways as indicated in the specific inhibitor study in macrophages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>The neutralization of MIF is a promising approach to develop new anti-inflammatory agents and treatments for diseases that involve increased MIF production or release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In fact, an administration of neutralizing anti-MIF antibodies has proven therapeutically effective in animal models of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and in LPS-induced lung injury models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. X-ray crystallography studies show that ISO-1, an MIF-specific inhibitor, binds to the inflammatory active site of MIF in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Treatment with ISO-1 has been reported to be effective in endotoxemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], polymicrobial sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and autoimmune diabetes models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Leng and colleagues have shown that anti-CD74 antibody can block MIF-induced cell proliferation in B cells and fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Other recent studies have demonstrated that anti-CD74 antibody blocks MIF-CD74 binding in the cell surface of gastric epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and anti-CD74 antibody attenuated proliferation of prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Moreover, a humanized anti-CD74 monoclonal antibody (hLL1) treatment has been reported to have therapeutic potential for B-cell malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In our study, we have shown that anti-CD74 antibody significantly inhibited the MIF-induced p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation and MIP-2 accumulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), suggesting that the MIF-induced MIP-2 accumulation depends, at least in part, on cell surface CD74 of macrophages.</p><p>We used anti-CD74 antibody in our mouse model, and have shown that anti-CD74 antibody significantly inhibited the MIF-induced neutrophil accumulation into the alveolar space as well as accumulation of MIP-2, KC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The results revealed that anti-CD74 antibody has the ability to inhibit MIF-induced neutrophil accumulation in vivo. In this study, we have instilled mixtures of either MIF and ISO-1 or MIF and anti-CD74 antibody to ensure that MIF and inhibitor are delivered to an identical segment of the lung. This is important, because we believe that the native MIF binds to the receptor (CD74) to effect the inflammatory response and that the inhibitor or antibody blocks the MIF-receptor interaction. Future studies will address the question of whether the inflammatory response induced by MIF-CD74 interactions can be attenuated by intravenous administration of ISO-1 or anti-CD74 antibody, and the effective time course of administration. We believe a combination of CD74 antibody and other anti-inflammatory agents might be beneficial for treatment of neutrophilic lung inflammation.</p><p>Anti-CD74 antibody treatment reduced the number of neutrophils compared to control at 43%. This suggests that anti-CD74 antibody had a partial inhibitory effect in MIF-induced neutrophil accumulation. The data raises the possibility that MIF could activate via other signaling pathways, not CD74 alone. Indeed, an MIF endocytotic pathway has been proposed, in which MIF is taken up by the cell and binds to Jun activation domain-binding protein (Jab1) (COP9 signalosome subunit 5; CNS5). MIF would thereby inhibit Jab1-enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. A recent study has shown that MIF activates p44/p42 MAPK pathway rapidly and transiently in a Jab1 dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that CD74 is expressed on the cell surface of alveolar macrophages, and potentially contributes to MIF-induced neutrophil accumulation into the alveolar space. We have demonstrated that anti-CD74 antibody inhibits MIF-induced p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation and MIP-2 release in macrophages. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that anti-CD74 antibody treatment inhibits MIF-induced MIP-2, KC accumulation and neutrophil accumulation in mouse model. The data suggest that MIF and its receptor CD74 may be useful targets to reduce neutrophilic lung inflammation, and acute lung injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KT carried out the experimental work, the data analysis and drafted the manuscript.
