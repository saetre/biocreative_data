Multiple subtypes of TLRs were expressed on B16 cells and several human cancer cell lines; TLR2 mediated the invasive activity of these cells. High metastatic B16 cells released more heat shock protein 60 than poor metastatic B16-F1 cells. Importantly, heat shock protein 60 released by tumor cells caused a persistent activation of TLR2 and was critical in the constitutive activation of transcription factor Stat3, leading to the release of immunosuppressive cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, targeting TLR2 markedly reduced pulmonary metastases and increased the survival of B16-bearing mice by reversing B16 cells induced immunosuppressive microenvironment and restoring tumor-killing cells such as CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and M1 macrophages. Combining an anti-TLR2 antibody and a cytotoxic agent, gemcitabine, provided a further improvement in the survival of tumor-bearing mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and Significance</title><p>Our results demonstrate that TLR2 is an attractive target against metastasis and that targeting immunosuppressive microenvironment using anti-TLR2 antibody is a novel therapeutic strategy for combating a life-threatening metastasis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor metastases are the most common cause of death in cancer patients but there are no effective therapies to target the development and progression of metastases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Kopfstein1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent evidence highlights that tumor metastasis requires collaborative interactions between tumor cells and immune cells at both primary and secondary tumor locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-DeNardo1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Actually, immune response functions as a double-edged sword: it is recognized as the surveillance component for the host to eliminate tumor cells and attenuate the development of metastases on one hand; it is also accepted as the mediator promoting primary tumor metastasis on the other hand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Huang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. A large number of infiltrating immune cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), tumor-related macrophages, and mast cells, contribute to cancer growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumor immune tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Chen1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, an accumulation of suppressive factors and a reduction of tumoricidal factors in the tumor microenvironment are responsible for the fail of tumor immunosurveillance, leading to tumor progression and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Curiel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although the mechanism is still to be elucidated, transcription factor Stat3 is constitutively activated at a very high level in cancer cell lines and tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Kortylewski1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The constitutively-activated Stat3 (cStat3) mediates a crosstalk between tumor cells and host immune cells to direct immunosuppressive response in tumor tissues. Blocking Stat3 in highly metastatic melanoma cells suppresses the invasion of the cells and lung metastases; enforcing the expression of cStat3 converts poorly metastatic melanoma cells into highly metastatic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Huang2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, Stat3 provides a link between oncogenesis and immunosuppression and plays a central role in the establishment of immunosuppressive environment and the progression of tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Kortylewski2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>TLRs have recently emerged as critical components of the immune system to sense danger signals, initiate innate immune response, and direct the polarization of adaptive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Huang3">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. TLRs induce an acute inflammation against various pathogens by recognizing highly conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the pathogens. Also, TLRs induce chronic inflammation or immune tolerance after being activated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as HMGB1, HSPs, and S100 proteins released from injured tissue or tumor tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Foell1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Ehlers1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In general, stimulation of TLR3, 4, 7, 8, or 9 induces a TH1 or TH17 type of immune response; whereas stimulation of TLR2 induces a TH2, Treg, or TH17 type of immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Beutler1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Marta1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Obviously, TLR2 has an unique position in the regulation of tumor tolerance, cancer progression and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Huang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, we recently find that targeting TLR2 reverses pulmonary fibrosis through regulating immunosuppressive microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Yang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore wonder if TLR2 signaling has a role in the regulation of tumor metastasis. We found that the basal activity of TLR2 determines the evasive capacity and the level of immunosuppressive factors in tumor cells. Targeting TLR2 significantly attenuated pulmonary metastases of B16 melanoma and animal death. Our study provides strong evidence to directly demonstrate that targeting TLR2 to overcome tumor cell-induced immunosuppressive microenvironment is a novel therapeutic strategy against tumor metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>TLR2 mediated the invasion capacity and the production of immunosuppressive factors in B16-F10 melanoma cells</title><p>To determine the potential roles of TLRs in the regulation of the tumor cell-induced immune tolerance, we first examined if tumor cells expressed TLRs. We found that TLR2 and TLR4 were expressed on B16 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006520.s002">Figure S1A and B</xref>). The expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 on B16 cells were significantly inhibited by a corresponding TLR2- or TLR4- shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006520.s002">Figure S1A</xref>) and up-regulated by LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006520.s002">Figure S1B</xref>). B16 cells also expressed other members of the TLR family including TLR1, TLR3, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006520.s002">Figure S1C</xref>). We further examined the roles of TLR2 and TLR4 on cell migration and growth of B16 cells. TLR2 knockdown (KD), but not TLR4 KD, significantly inhibited the invasive activity of B16 cells by about 35&#x00025; compared with the vector control (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006520-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). Additionally, agonist of either TLR2 or TLR4 promoted the growth of B16 cells (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006520.s002">Figure S1D</xref>). However, TLR2 or TLR4 KD did not affect the growth of B16 cells (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006520.s002">Figure S1D</xref>). Since TLR2 functions via dimerization with TLR1, TLR6, or Dectin-1, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006520-Medzhitov1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, we examined the dimerizing partners of TLR2 in these cells and found that TLR2 co-localized with TLR6 or Dectin-1, but not TLR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006520-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Thus, treatment of B16 cells with shRNA against either TLR2 or TLR6 attenuated the invasive activity of B16 cells, and treatment of these cells with TLR2-shRNA plus TLR6-shRNA further inhibited the invasive activity of B16 cells compared to TLR2-shRNA or TLR6-shRNA treatment alone (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006520-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Also, Dectin-1 shRNA significantly inhibited the invasion of B16 cells, and Dectin-1-shRNA plus TLR2-shRNA synergized the inhibitory effects on the invasive ability of B16 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006520-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Importantly, TLR2 was expressed on several human tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006520.s001">Methods S1</xref>). Activation of TLR2 by LPS significantly enhanced the expression of TLR2 on these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006520.s002">Figure S1E</xref>). Knockdown of TLR2 markedly reduced the invasive capability of the high-metastatic cancer cell lines, including A549, H7402, HCT8 and MDA-MB231, but did not affect the invasive activity of the low-metastatic cell MCF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006520-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).

This conclusion is derived from and supported by our and other's observations. Firstly, the highly metastatic B16 cells not only release higher level of HSP60, but also have a higher-level expression of TLR2 and basal activity of Stat3 compared to low metastatic B16-F1 cells. Secondly, HSP60 activation of TLR2 mediates the expression and phosphorylation of Stat3 in tumor cells.
