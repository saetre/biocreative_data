merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) of malaria parasites, a strong vaccine candidate, plays a key role during erythrocyte invasion and is a target of host protective immune response. <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>, the most widespread human malaria parasite, is closely related to parasites that infect Asian Old World monkeys, and has been considered to have become a parasite of man by host switch from a macaque malaria parasite. Several Asian monkey parasites have a range of natural hosts. The same parasite species shows different disease manifestations among host species. This suggests that host immune responses to <italic>P. vivax</italic>-related malaria parasites greatly differ among host species (albeit other factors). It is thus tempting to invoke that a major immune target parasite protein such as MSP-1 underwent unique evolution, depending on parasite species that exhibit difference in host range and host specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We performed comparative phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of the gene encoding MSP-1 (<italic>msp1</italic>) from <italic>P. vivax </italic>and nine <italic>P. vivax</italic>-related simian malaria parasites. The inferred phylogenetic tree of <italic>msp1 </italic>significantly differed from that of the mitochondrial genome, with a striking displacement of <italic>P. vivax </italic>from a position close to <italic>P. cynomolgi </italic>in the mitochondrial genome tree to an outlier of Asian monkey parasites. Importantly, positive selection was inferred for two ancestral branches, one leading to <italic>P. inui </italic>and <italic>P. hylobati </italic>and the other leading to <italic>P. vivax</italic>, <italic>P. fieldi </italic>and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>. This ancestral positive selection was estimated to have occurred three to six million years ago, coinciding with the period of radiation of Asian macaques. Comparisons of <italic>msp1 </italic>polymorphisms between <italic>P. vivax</italic>, <italic>P. inui </italic>and <italic>P. cynomolgi </italic>revealed that while some positively selected amino acid sites or regions are shared by these parasites, amino acid changes greatly differ, suggesting that diversifying selection is acting species-specifically on <italic>msp1</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present results indicate that the <italic>msp1 </italic>locus of <italic>P. vivax </italic>and related parasite species has lineage-specific unique evolutionary history with positive selection. <italic>P. vivax </italic>and related simian malaria parasites offer an interesting system toward understanding host species-dependent adaptive evolution of immune-target surface antigen genes such as <italic>msp1</italic>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Malaria, a parasitic infection transmitted by the anopheline mosquito, is caused by the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Of the five parasite species that infect humans, <italic>Plasmodium vivax </italic>is arguably the most prevalent in South and Central America, Melanesia, Asia and the Middle East, accounting for 80 - 90 million cases annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Unlike <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, which often causes severe malaria, <italic>P. vivax </italic>infections are rarely lethal but a major cause of morbidity in endemic countries. An ideal control strategy is the development of effective vaccines, with potential targets in the asexual blood stage responsible for the clinical manifestation of the disease. The 200 kDa merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1), a vaccine candidate antigen that is abundantly expressed on the surface of merozoites and plays critical role in erythrocyte invasion, is one of the major targets of the host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. MSP-1 is conserved in all <italic>Plasmodium </italic>species. Disruption of the <italic>Plasmoium </italic>MSP-1 gene has been demonstrated to have a deleterious effect on the parasite growth in experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The 200 kDa precursor of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>MSP-1 undergoes proteolytic processing, producing four major polypeptides of approximately 83, 30, 38 and 42 kDa from the N-terminus to C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These polypeptides are on the merozoite surface as a non-covalently associated complex. Coincident with erythrocyte invasion the C-terminal 42 kDa is further cleaved to produce the N-terminal 33 kDa and C-terminal 19 kDa, and except for the latter, all processed fragments are shed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The 19 kDa C-terminal, which contains two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, remains anchored to the merozoite membrane and is carried into the invaded erythrocytes. These processing events appear to be conserved in <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, a <italic>P. vivax</italic>-related simian malaria parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Both the 42 kDa and 19 kDa polypeptides are considered to be promising vaccine candidates for <italic>P. falciparum </italic>and <italic>P. vivax </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the gene encoding MSP-1 (<italic>msp1</italic>), which is present as a single copy per haploid parasite genome, is highly polymorphic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and thus, presents a major obstacle to effective vaccine development. There is evidence showing that allelic diversity of MSP-1 is strongly associated with strain-specific protective immunity in experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Sequence variation in <italic>msp1 </italic>has previously been studied for <italic>P. falciparum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A large proportion of <italic>P. falciparum msp1 </italic>has a dimorphic structure, with alleles classified as belonging to either K1 or MAD20 type. Divergence between these dimorphic alleles is estimated to have occurred approximately 27 - 35 million years ago (mya) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although the biological significance of allelic dimorphism in <italic>P. falciparum msp1 </italic>is unknown, it is likely that K1 and MAD20 alleles are maintained by balancing selection as part of the parasite immune evasion mechanism. We have shown that <italic>P. vivax msp1 </italic>also shows extensive allelic variation but that the polymorphism pattern is clearly different from the dimorphic nature of <italic>P. falciparum msp1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, in contrast to the presumed ancient origin of <italic>P. falciparum msp1</italic>, the origin of <italic>P. vivax msp1 </italic>polymorphism is relatively recent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p><italic>P. vivax </italic>has a unique evolutionary history as compared with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. It is believed that <italic>P. falciparum </italic>and the closely related chimpanzee parasite, <italic>P. reichenowi</italic>, co-diverged alongside that of humans and chimpanzees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>P. vivax </italic>is closely related to parasites such as <italic>P. knowlesi </italic>and <italic>P. cynomolgi </italic>that infect Asian Old World monkeys (OWMs), though <italic>P. vivax </italic>does not infect the OWMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>P. vivax </italic>has recently been proposed to have become a parasite of man by host switch from a macaque malaria parasite sometime between 50,000 to 300,000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] or 460,000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. <italic>P. hylobati</italic>, a parasite of gibbons in Southeast Asia, is also considered to have originated by host switch from a macaque parasite. Several Asian macaque malaria parasites have a range of natural hosts, e.g., <italic>P. inui </italic>and <italic>P. cynomolgi </italic>infect multiple species of the genera <italic>Macaca </italic>and <italic>Presbytis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>P. knowlesi </italic>infects not only macaques, leaf monkeys and langurs but also has recently been recognized as the fifth human malaria parasite based from studies in Southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Experimental infections of the rhesus macaque, <italic>M. mulatta</italic>, and the Japanese macaque, <italic>M. fuscata</italic>, by <italic>P. coatneyi, P. knowlesi, P. cynomolgi </italic>or <italic>P. inui </italic>result in acute manifestations of malaria with high parasitemia, whereas these parasites produce less symptoms and low-grade infections in the long-tailed or crab eating macaque, <italic>M. fascicularis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This indicates the same parasite species causes different disease manifestations among host species. Such differential disease manifestations may suggest that immune responses to <italic>P. vivax</italic>-related malaria parasites greatly differ among host species (although other factors, such as the ability of the parasites to infect a wider range of red blood cells, e.g., reticulocytes vs. mature red cells, can also contribute to virulence). It is thus tempting to invoke that a major immune target parasite protein gene such as <italic>msp1 </italic>underwent unique evolution, depending on parasite species that exhibit difference in host range and host specificity. As such, <italic>P. vivax </italic>and <italic>P. vivax</italic>-related simian malaria parasites are invaluable resources in our attempts to understand adaptive evolution in malaria parasites.</p><p>In this study, we investigate (i) the occurrence of natural selection on <italic>msp1 </italic>in lineages of <italic>P. vivax </italic>and related simian malaria parasites through comparative analysis of phylogenetic trees between <italic>msp1 </italic>and the mitochondrial genome, and (ii) using comparative analysis of <italic>msp1 </italic>polymorphism between <italic>P. vivax</italic>, <italic>P. inui </italic>and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>, we examine the species-specific diversifying selection on <italic>msp1</italic>. Results obtained here show that <italic>msp1 </italic>evolved under positive selection in ancestral lineages including the one leading to <italic>P. vivax </italic>and its closely related simian parasite species, three to six mya, coinciding with the period of radiation of Asian macaques. Also, a signature of species-specific diversifying selection was detected in <italic>P. vivax</italic>, <italic>P. inui </italic>and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Divergence of <italic>msp1 </italic>sequence</title><p>We obtained 20 new <italic>msp1 </italic>sequences from <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, <italic>P. inui</italic>, <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>, <italic>P. fieldi</italic>, <italic>P. fragile </italic>and <italic>P. gonderi </italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). An alignment of the sequences, together with previously published sequences including <italic>P. vivax</italic>, <italic>P. simiovale</italic>, <italic>P. hylobati </italic>and <italic>P. coatneyi</italic>, revealed considerable sequence variations between species with substantial sequence length difference between 5097 bp to 5787 bp (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). These variations include numerous substitutions, extensive indels and varying numbers of repeats (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Since indels and repeats were unreliably aligned, these were excluded, leaving 4176 bp aligned positions that were used for further analysis (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Nucleotide divergence in the aligned 4176 bp sequences and amino acid divergence were 39% - 42% and 41% - 47%, respectively, between <italic>P. gonderi</italic>, an African OWM parasite and <italic>P. vivax </italic>and related simian malaria parasites. Between <italic>P. vivax </italic>and the seven Asian monkey parasite species divergence was 15% - 21% and 24% - 36% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial genome and <italic>msp1</italic></title><p>The mitochondrial genome of <italic>Plasmodium </italic>has been shown to be free from strong positive selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In this work, we obtained 28 new sequences of the mitochondrial genomes from <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, <italic>P. fragile</italic>, <italic>P. inui</italic>, <italic>P. cynomolgi </italic>and <italic>P. fieldi</italic>. Together with reported sequences, we constructed the Maximum likelihood (ML) tree of the mitochondrial genome of <italic>P. vivax </italic>and related simian parasites and compared the tree with that constructed from <italic>msp1</italic>. The mitochondrial ML tree revealed two major clades using <italic>P. gonderi </italic>as an outgroup: one for a clade of <italic>P. coatneyi </italic>and <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, and the other for a clade of <italic>P. fieldi</italic>, <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>, <italic>P. vivax</italic>, <italic>P. hylobati </italic>and <italic>P. inui </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>).

Differences in the phylogenetic trees between the mitochondrial genome and <italic>msp1 </italic>of <italic>P. vivax </italic>and related simian malaria parasites suggest that <italic>msp1s </italic>have evolved under positive selection. Positive selection was detected in an ancestral lineage leading to <italic>P. inui </italic>and <italic>P. hylobati </italic>(branch C) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and weak positive selection in an ancestral branch leading to <italic>P. vivax, P. fieldi</italic>, and <italic>P. cynomolgi </italic>(branch B). In these branches, positive selection was not detected at the whole gene level but in separate <italic>msp1 </italic>regions. It is rare to find a gene showing evidence for positive selection at the whole gene level or a long gene region because most genes are under purifying selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and thus small regions that are under positive selection, if any, may not be readily detectable. We do not therefore exclude the possibility that smaller <italic>msp1 </italic>regions and/or limited amino acid sites were under positive selection in ancestral branches other than branches B and C of <italic>P. vivax</italic>-related simian malaria parasite lineages.</p><p>Estimated time frame of these lineages was between 3.0 and 6.3 mya. It should be noted that 6.3 mya is a conservative estimate because of the lack of an appropriate calibration point to estimate a common ancestor of branches B and C. With this in mind, the estimated time frame seems to coincide well with the period of radiation events of Asian macaques (3.7-5.1 mya) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It is plausible that Asian macaque malaria parasites radiated along with radiation events of host monkey species. Natural infections in macaques such as <italic>M. fascicularis </italic>with several Asian simian malaria parasites like <italic>P. cynomolgi </italic>and <italic>P. inui </italic>are relatively benign, whereas experimental infections with these parasites are severe and frequently lethal to non-natural macaque hosts that inhabit areas free of simian malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. To survive in such partially resistant hosts, parasites would have developed a mechanism(s) to evade host immune attacks and thus favorable mutations were probably accumulated in immune target antigen genes such as <italic>msp1</italic>. During the radiation of macaques in Southeast Asia, sympatric speciation of macaques occurred and this may have provided a niche for a potential expansion of host range of ancestral malaria parasites. Some ancestral parasites that successfully gained favorable mutations for immune evasion in major antigen genes during the radiation period may have succeeded in adapting to newly appeared macaque species, thus leaving a signature for ancestral positive selection on <italic>msp1</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Diversifying selection in <italic>P. vivax</italic>, <italic>P. inui </italic>and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic></title><p>Polymorphisms of the whole <italic>msp1 </italic>sequences or sequences of three separate <italic>msp1 </italic>regions do not show evidence for diversifying selection in <italic>P. vivax </italic>and <italic>P. cynomolgi </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We confirmed this for <italic>P. inui </italic>(data not shown). This is not unexpected because MSP-1 is essential for the parasite survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, we obtained a signature for diversifying selection at specific amino acid sites in these parasite species. Interestingly, three positively selected sites/regions were shared by the three parasite species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), suggesting a common structural feature of diversifying selection. However, amino acid substitutions in these sites/regions greatly differed among the three parasite species. Also, other positively selected sites/regions were not shared among the three species. These indicate that the evolution of <italic>msp1 </italic>polymorphism is species-specific in <italic>P. vivax </italic>and related simian parasite species. The species-specific feature of diversifying selection on <italic>msp1 </italic>underscores the importance of understanding the protective immune response to the vaccine candidate MSP-1 in a species-specific context.</p><p>Little structural information is available for MSP-1, except for the C-terminal 19 kDa polypeptide, which contains cysteine-rich two epidermal growth factor-like domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A hydropathy profile suggests that most of MSP-1 regions, apart from the N-terminal signal peptide and the 19 kDa polypeptide, are hydrophilic (data not shown), being consistent with the prediction that MSP-1 is a component of the merozoite surface coat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It is thus presumed that positively selected sites are antibody-binding epitopes. Amino acid substitutions are mostly radical ones in terms of chemical properties affecting, for example, the acidity/basicity and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity nature, likely exerting influence in the antibody binding epitopes of the protein. Alternatively, amino acid changes in these positively selected sites may alter the ability of antigen-derived peptides to bind to allelic forms of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC), resulting in specific loss of an immune recognition by particular T cells.</p><p>In <italic>P. vivax</italic>, positively selected sites/regions appears to be clustered in the 5' region of <italic>msp1</italic>. Seroepidemiology studies suggest that the 5' region is subjected to diversifying selection by immune pressures. A high proportion of individuals infected with <italic>P. vivax </italic>in Colombia contain IgG antibodies against Pv200L, a N-terminal protein of <italic>P. vivax </italic>MSP-1 (residues 69 to 430 of the Belem strain).

Clinical protection has, likewise, been correlated to IgG antibodies against the N-terminal part of MSP-1 (residues 170 to 675) in western Brazilian Amazon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Similarly, positively selected amino acid sites were detected in the C-terminal 33 kDa fragment that corresponds to one of the cleaved fragments of the 42 kDa polypeptide of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>MSP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In individuals living in an endemic area in Sri Lanka, naturally acquired antibodies were directed more strongly to the 42 kDa polypeptide of <italic>P. vivax </italic>MSP-1 than to the 19 kDa fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], suggesting stronger immunogenicity of the 33 kDa polypeptide. It is therefore probable that diversifying selection on the 3' region of <italic>P. vivax msp1 </italic>corresponding to the 33 kDa region is driven by host's immune pressure. Although positively selected sites/regions were also detected in the central region, no immunological study has been done to date, thus no clear inference can be made for diversifying selection at this region.</p><p>In the present study, highly polymorphic sequence regions consisting of indels and different numbers of tandem repeats with varying repeat units and lengths (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>) were not analyzed due largely to limitations in reliably aligning sequences.

In block 2 of <italic>P. falciparum msp1</italic>, different types of tripeptide repeats have been shown to be involved in protective immunity in individuals living in a malaria endemic area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

Initially, a short conserved region (about 500 bp) in the 5' part of <italic>msp1 </italic>was amplified using Pgo-f92: 5'-TTTTYGTTACCAAATGTCAATGTGAA-3' and Pgo-r2: 5'-ACAACTTTCTTCAGCATGTCCA-3', and sequenced. To extend this short region outwards from both directions, amplifications were done using primers derived from the short region sequence and random primers. PCR fragments were cloned into TOPO TA and XL vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) prior to sequencing. Using newly identified sequenced regions as a scaffold for further extensions, the uneven PCR was repeated until the whole <italic>P. gonderi msp1 </italic>coding region was obtained. Finally, the following primers were designed to amplify the full length <italic>msp1</italic>, Pgo-f19: 5'-TGCTACATCTTAAAACATTCGAATAT-3' and Pgo-r17: 5'-TTAAAGCTCACTGCATAGCAGAATA-3'. Cycling conditions were 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 40 cycles at 94&#x000b0;C for 20 sec, 58&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, and 72&#x000b0;C for 6 min, and a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Sequences were obtained using an automated sequencer 3100 Genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, CA), and reads were verified at both directions with at least two independent amplifications.</p><p>The 6-kb <italic>Plasmodium </italic>mitochondrial genome was amplified using the following primers to cover the complete genome, PvmtF5488: 5'-GGTATAATTCCATTATCTCATCCAGA-3', PvmtR3088: 5'-CAACATAACATTTTTTAGTCCCATGCT-3', PvmtF2959: 5'-TACTAAGATAAAGAACTCCAGGCGT-3' and PvmtR0: 5'-TTAACATAATTATAACCTTACGGTCTGT-3'. PCR conditions and sequencing procedures were the same as those for <italic>msp1</italic>. Sequences obtained in this study have been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank with accession numbers AB444049-AB444069 and AB444106-AB444136. We noted an inconsistency of <italic>P. knowlesi </italic>sequences in the present study and the recently published genome report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The sequences of <italic>msp1 </italic>and the mitochondrial genome of the <italic>P. knowlesi </italic>H strain obtained from ATCC did not match the sequence reported in the genome project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] using the H strain; but those of the ATCC <italic>P. knowlesi </italic>Malayan strain were completely identical to sequences of the genome project. We are uncertain on how to explain this discordance between datasets.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence alignment</title><p>The nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and alignments were further checked manually. Nucleotide divergence between species and intra-specific nucleotide diversity (&#x003c0;), the average pairwise nucleotide difference per site, were calculated using DnaSP version 4.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Average of pairwise amino acid difference was calculated using MEGA version 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of phylogenetic tree</title><p>ML phylogenetic trees were constructed using the mitochondrial genome (5818 bp) and <italic>msp1 </italic>(4176 bp) sequences by PAUP v4.0 &#x003b2;10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In the construction of phylogenetic trees, <italic>P. fieldi </italic>and <italic>P. simiovale </italic>were found to be very closely related to each other (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Their morphological similarity has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For these reasons, <italic>P. simiovale </italic>was grouped to the same taxon of <italic>P. fieldi </italic>in this study. Since there are a large number of available <italic>P. vivax </italic>sequences for the mitochondrial genome (n = 282) and <italic>msp1 </italic>(n = 43), two to three distantly related sequences were used for constructing trees. The appropriate nucleotide substitution model was selected by the Modeltest 3.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. A general time-reversible substitution model where rate heterogeneity among sites was taken into account by a mixture of Gamma-distributed positive rates and a point mass at rate zero (GTR+I+G) was used for both mitochondrial genome and <italic>msp1</italic>. One hundred bootstrap replicates were done for constructing ML trees. Difference between phylogenetic trees of mitochondrial genome and <italic>msp1 </italic>was statistically evaluated using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] implemented in the PAML version 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of positive selection in ancestral lineages</title><p>To assess lineage-specific positive selection on <italic>msp1</italic>, the ratio of kA to kS (= &#x003c9;), in which kA and kS are the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes per nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, respectively, was estimated for branches in a tree using the branch model implemented in PAML version 4. The &#x003c9; ratio measures the direction and magnitude of selection on amino acid replacements, with values of &#x003c9; &#x0003c; 1, &#x003c9; = 1, and &#x003c9; &#x0003e; 1 indicating purifying selection, neutral evolution, and positive selection, respectively. The heterogeneity of &#x003c9; among branches was incorporated using the free-ratio model where each branch has its independent &#x003c9; value. For branches with &#x003c9; &#x0003e; 1, a LRT was conducted between the free-ratio model and a constrained model with &#x003c9; of a branch of interest fixed at one.</p></sec><sec><title>Estimation of divergence time of lineages</title><p>To date the time frame, in which positive selection is predicted, the divergence time of lineages of interest was inferred from the phylogeny of the mitochondrial genome constructed here. Evolutionary rate constancy was tested for various lineages using Tajima's relative rate test for the molecular clock hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The mitochondrial genomes of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>, a rodent malaria species, (GenBank accession number: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB379671">AB379671</ext-link>) and <italic>P. gonderi </italic>were used as outgroups. When lineages showing rate constancy were identified, the genetic distance between lineages was calculated with the Jukes and Cantor correction. We adopted the divergence time of 10 mya for a common node of <italic>P. gonderi </italic>and Asian monkey malaria parasites, and 6.3 mya for a common node of <italic>P. knowlesi </italic>and other Asian monkey malaria parasites as calibration points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of positively selected amino acid sites</title><p>In order to detect the sites under positive selection, we must be able to distinguish the signatures of selection from recombination. If the sequences have undergone recombination, we can spuriously infer selection within a model that assumes a common phylogeny for all sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. We accomplished this by analyzing datasets independently under population genetic and phylogenetic approaches taking into account the effect of recombination.</p><p>The population genetics method employed is the one implemented in the omegaMap software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It is a Bayesian method to infer the posterior distribution of &#x003c9; (= dN/dS), in which dN and dS are the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes per nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, based on a coalescence approach with recombination, where the codon model is an extension of the NY98 model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] which incorporates a rate for insertion/deletions. In the omegaMap implementation the population recombination rate &#x003c1; and the selection parameter &#x003c9; are allowed to vary along the alignment following independent change-point processes and are sampled through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In our analyses we set the prior expected length of blocks for &#x003c1; and &#x003c9; at 30 codons. Two independent MCMC chains were run for 1,000,000 iterations with a burn-in of 10% of the total number of iterations. Upon convergence the two chains were merged to infer &#x003c9;. Due to constraints in omegaMap, we randomly sampled 25 out of the 43 sequences of <italic>P. vivax</italic>.</p><p>The phylogenetic approach assumes that the sequences are free from recombination and consequently all sites follow the same phylogenetic tree. Even when there is a moderate-to-low signal of recombination, we can still infer selection provided that we can detect the recombination breakpoints. In such cases, we may apply the phylogenetic procedure for each non-recombinant segment - defined by the breakpoint locations. HyPhy/Datamonkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] is a likelihood-based procedure that can handle potentially recombinant sequences when inferring positively selected sites under the phylogenetic assumption. The recombination breakpoints were first predicted by using the Genetic Algorithm Recombination Detection (GARD) algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] implemented in HyPhy/Datamonkey. The detection of positive selection was then conducted for each non-recombinant segment. For each segment a neighbor-joining tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] was constructed using MEGA 4. To estimate &#x003c9; (= dN/dS) at each codon, a fixed-effects likelihood method that directly estimates dN and dS at each site was used. This method involves 3 steps: first, the nucleotide substitution model parameters and branch lengths are obtained by ML given the alignment segment and the neighbor-joining tree. Second, values for dN and dS are estimated for each site using the parameters found at the first step and the MG94 codon model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], with and without the constraint that dN = dS. Finally, an LRT is performed to infer whether dN is significantly different from dS. Owing to computational limitations of GARD, the maximum number of sequences analyzed within the phylogenetic approach was set to 14 per analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>MSP-1: Merozoite surface protein-1; <italic>msp1</italic>: merozoite surface protein-1 gene; mya: million years ago; OWMs: Old World monkeys; kDa: kilodaltons; ML: maximum likelihood; LRT: likelihood ratio test; dS: the number of intraspecific synonymous changes per synonymous sites; dN: the number of intraspecific nonsynonymous changes per nonsynonymous sites; kS: the number of interspecific synonymous changes per synonymous sites; kA: the number of interspecific nonsynonymous changes per nonsynonymous sites; MHC: major histocompatibility complex; MCMC: Markov chain Monte Carlo; GARD: Genetic Algorithm Recombination Detection.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KT conceived the study.
