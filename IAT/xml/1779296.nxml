In this study, we have investigated the ability of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, KZ52, to protect against Ebola virus in rhesus macaques. This antibody was previously shown to fully protect guinea pigs from infection. Four rhesus macaques were given 50 mg/kg of neutralizing human monoclonal antibody KZ52 intravenously 1 d before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units of Ebola virus, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg antibody 4 d after challenge. A control animal was exposed to virus in the absence of antibody treatment. Passive transfer of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody not only failed to protect macaques against challenge with Ebola virus but also had a minimal effect on the explosive viral replication following infection. We show that the inability of antibody to impact infection was not due to neutralization escape. It appears that Ebola virus has a mechanism of infection propagation in vivo in macaques that is uniquely insensitive even to high concentrations of neutralizing antibody.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Ebola virus is one of the most feared of human pathogens with a mortality that can approach 90&#x00025; and an extremely rapid disease course that can lead to death within days of infection. Antibodies able to inhibit viral infection in culture, neutralizing antibodies, can typically prevent viral infection in animals and humans when present prior to infection, at sufficient concentration. Such neutralizing antibodies may be provided through passive administration or induced by vaccination. We have previously shown that a human neutralizing antibody can protect guinea pigs against Ebola virus. However, here we show that this antibody does not protect monkeys against Ebola virus and surprisingly appears to have very little impact upon the rapid course of infection, despite being present at very high levels in the blood of the monkeys. We conclude that administering antibody prior to or immediately following exposure to Ebola virus, for example, after an accident in a research setting or a bioterrorist attack, is unlikely to be effective in preventing disease. Recent successes in protecting monkeys against Ebola virus through vaccination may be independent of antibody, or, more likely, critically dependent on the cooperation of antibody and cellular immunity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Oswald WB, Geisbert TW, Davis KJ, Geisbert JB, Sullivan NJ, et al.

Therefore, we used a high dose of 50 mg/kg KZ52, which was close to the maximum practically achievable. In addition, we gave a second bolus of 50 mg/kg of KZ52 on day 4 following infection. The results for the four antibody-treated animals show a steady increase in plasma viremia up to 10<sup>5</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>7</sup> pfu/ml on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030009-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Three of the treated animals were euthanized when moribund at day 9 or 10 post infection. The fourth treated animal showed a decrease in plasma viral load after the peak and survived to day 28 before becoming moribund when it too was euthanized. Although monkey CH46 had less severe symptoms than the other animals in the study, it was concluded that this animal, too, was suffering from disease due to ZEBOV, as evidenced, for example, by copious Ebola virus antigen in the lungs (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Serum Antibody Levels in Treated Animals</title><p>Serum antibody (KZ52) loads were measured 1 d before virus challenge (day &#x02212;1) and 4 d after challenge but before antibody boosting (day 4) by an ELISA designed to detect KZ52 as a human antibody that has bound to immobilized ZEBOV glycoprotein. The serum KZ52 antibody levels on day 4 were in the approximate range 200&#x02013;400 &#x003bc;g/ml (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030009-t001">Table 1</xref>). The two control monkeys, EHD (untreated and challenged), and a negative monkey (neither treated nor challenged), had very similar background levels of reactivity to the glycoprotein and anti-human antibody as each of the treated monkeys before treatment.

Accordingly, virus was isolated from a selection of plasma from day 4 (monkeys CH56, CH57, and CH83) and day 7 (monkeys CH56 and CH57). All of these viruses were sensitive to KZ52 so that essentially 100&#x00025; neutralization was observed in vitro at 40 and 400 &#x003bc;g/ml KZ52 in a plaque assay (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) using Vero E6 target cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Virus Levels in Different Organs and Immunohistochemistry</title><p>In order to gain a better understanding of any differences in pathology between the control and antibody-treated animals, the levels of virus in different organs were surveyed postmortem. Viral levels in the liver, spleen, kidney, adrenal glands, lung, and mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes were high (10<sup>4</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>6</sup> pfu/g) in the control and three of the four treated animals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030009-t002">Table 2</xref>). However, monkey CH46, who survived much longer than the other animals (to day 28) showed some major histopathological differences from the other infected monkeys and from the norm for ZEBOV infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Relatively low viral levels were observed in most of the organs of CH46, and none in the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands. In addition, large immunoreactive monocytes were found in the blood of monkeys CH56, CH57, and CH83, but not in CH46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030009-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Typically, smaller immunoreactive monocytes are seen with ZEBOV infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. The presence of large immunoreactive monocytes may simply reflect uptake of antibody-coated virions via Fc receptors and subsequent viral clearance. However, it is interesting to note that previous studies have implicated mononuclear phagocytes as vehicles for transport of filovirus particles to specific organs such as liver and spleen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b021">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. If virus particles could remain infectious following Fc receptor-mediated uptake in a subset of cells (compare DC-SIGN mediated uptake of HIV-1 by dendritic cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;), then the course of disease in monkeys CH56, CH57, and CH83 might represent the net result of inhibition by neutralization and enhancement by antibody-mediated cellular uptake. Interestingly, monkey CH46, who fared somewhat better than the others and lacked virus in the liver and spleen, did not show the presence of large immunoreactive monocytes. This is suggestive of lowered Fc receptor-mediated uptake of virus or reduced activity of the mononuclear phagocytic system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we describe the case of a potent neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, administered to give a high serum concentration, which is shown to be unable to protect macaques against challenge with a lethal dose of ZEBOV. The antibody appeared to have very little effect on the course of virus replication or disease in three of four treated animals. Neutralization escape does not appear to explain the lack of protection observed by the antibody. In one animal, a more limited infection was observed, but this macaque did also eventually succumb to the effects of viral disease.</p><p>The challenge dose of 1,000 pfu used corresponds to the amount of EBOV contained in a relatively small quantity of fluid (on the order of 1 &#x003bc;l) from an infected individual given the high titers of virus typically found in such individuals (on the order of 10<sup>6</sup> pfu/ml of blood, for example). Therefore, the challenge dose was not unreasonable in terms of a natural exposure to virus.</p><p>The negative results with passive antibody contrast strongly with recent successes in preventing EBOV infection in macaques through vaccination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Does this mean that neutralizing antibody is unimportant in vaccine protection? The answer to this question must await further studies. However, a plausible hypothesis to explain all the data would still allow for an important contribution of antibody to vaccine protection. This hypothesis would argue that passive antibody is unable to completely block all EBOV entry to cells, and once a few cells are infected, virus replication is so explosive that it cannot be contained by a de novo generated cellular immune response. Vaccination, on the other hand, will provide CD8&#x0002b; memory T cells that can be rapidly recruited to become effector cells and limit infection. Certainly, although mAb KZ52 was able to provide protection from disease following ZEBOV challenge in the guinea pig model, immunity was not sterilizing and some viral replication was noted &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Since 1 pfu of EBOV is a lethal dose for primates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, a failure of passive antibody to achieve sterilizing immunity may be critical. Immunohistochemistry, as discussed above, gives some intriguing hints that uptake of antibody-coated virions by monocytes may possibly have a role to play in the course of infection following antibody treatment. We note, however, that previous in vitro studies using isolated human monocytes/macrophages did not find evidence of infectivity-enhancing antibodies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. More detailed in vitro and in vivo investigations will be required before any firm conclusions can be drawn. We also note that our experiments were carried out with a single neutralizing monoclonal antibody. It is possible that a more favorable outcome may have been apparent for a combination of neutralizing antibodies or even a combination of neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. However, these possibilities should be weighed against the very high concentrations of neutralizing monoclonal antibody used in the experiments and the efficacy of the antibody in the guinea pig model.</p><p>In summary, the inability of high concentrations of neutralizing antibody to even slow viral replication in infected macaques is remarkable and implies a mechanism of infection propagation that is virtually insensitive to antibody. Overall, the results suggest that monoclonal antibody prophylaxis or post-exposure prophylaxis alone are unlikely to be effective strategies in protecting against EBOV, for example, following a needle-stick accident in a research setting or a bioterrorist attack.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Passive transfer experiment.</title><p>50 mg/kg of KZ52 IgG1 human antibody &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030009-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d; was given intravenously to rhesus macaques (weight, 3.9&#x02013;4.4 kg) 1 d before challenge (day 0) with 1,000 pfu intramuscularly of the 1995 ZEBOV (Kikwit) isolate and again 4 d later (day &#x0002b;4).
