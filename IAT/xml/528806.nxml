Earlier studies of yeast FACT, which indicated the apparent dispensability of conserved sequences at the N terminus of the FACT subunit Cdc68&#x0002f;Spt16, prompted genetic and biochemical studies reported here that suggest the domain organization for Spt16 and the other FACT subunit Pob3, the yeast homolog of the metazoan SSRP1 protein. Our findings suggest that each FACT subunit is a multidomain protein, and that FACT integrity depends on Pob3 interactions with the Spt16 Mid domain. The conserved Spt16 N-terminal domain (NTD) is shown to be without essential function during normal growth, but becomes important under conditions of replication stress. Genetic interactions suggest that some functions carried out by the Spt16 NTD may be partially redundant within FACT.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>FACT (<underline>Fa</underline>cilitates <underline>C</underline>hromatin <underline>T</underline>ranscription) is an abundant complex that functions at the interface between chromatin and several enzymes that affect DNA. FACT has been identified biochemically in metazoans and yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), and the genes encoding FACT subunits are conserved in the eukaryotic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c4">4</xref>). For yeast-cell viability the subunits of FACT are essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c6">6</xref>), almost certainly due to important chromatin-related processes that FACT mediates. These processes include transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair.</p><p>FACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c7">7</xref>) was initially identified as an agent that facilitates the passage of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) enzyme along a simple nucleosomal DNA template <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c7">7</xref>). FACT counteracts negative effects of the nucleosomal configuration of DNA on transcription elongation <italic>in vitro</italic>, most likely through its activities as a histone chaperone involved in the reversible reconfiguration of the nucleosome [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c9">9</xref>)]. FACT binds nucleosomes and H2A&#x02022;H2B dimers <italic>in vitro</italic>, an activity correlated with the transcription of nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c11">11</xref>). FACT also destabilizes interactions between H2A&#x02022;H2B dimers and (H3&#x02022;H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c11">11</xref>), and may therefore mediate transcription by facilitating H2A&#x02022;H2B displacement from the nucleosome. Displacement of an H2A&#x02022;H2B histone dimer facilitates transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c13">13</xref>), and is also seen upon transcription activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c15">15</xref>). Genetic studies in yeast support a role for FACT in nucleosome reconfiguration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c16">16</xref>), and highlight the involvement of FACT in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c17">17</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, FACT is distributed along transcribed regions in parallel with RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c20">20</xref>) and can be found physically associated with the transcriptionally engaged form of RNAPII, further evidence for a role for FACT in transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c21">21</xref>). FACT also has chromatin-independent positive effects on transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> that are exerted at a post-initiation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c22">22</xref>), and FACT interaction with at least one sequence-specific DNA-binding protein is important for transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c10">10</xref>).</p><p>FACT also has a negative role <italic>in vivo</italic>, mediating the repressive effects of chromatin on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c27">27</xref>). This activity of FACT is seen in the chromatin repression that normally prevents transcription when activators are absent or ineffective; FACT mutations can disrupt this repression, perhaps by impairing the reestablishment of proper nucleosome organization after the passage of RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c27">27</xref>).</p><p>FACT is also involved in DNA replication. Immunodepletion of FACT from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes compromises <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c3">3</xref>), and mutations affecting yeast FACT show genetic interactions with a <italic>pol1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>cdc17</italic> mutation affecting DNA polymerase &#x003b1;, the catalytic subunit of the lagging-strand DNA polymerase &#x003b1; complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c28">28</xref>). Indeed, yeast FACT can be affinity-purified using immobilized Pol1&#x0002f;Cdc17 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c6">6</xref>), and copurified with the 4-subunit polymerase &#x003b1; complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c29">29</xref>). Other evidence comes through the use of hydroxyurea (HU), a free-radical scavenger that causes replication stress by inhibiting the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and limiting the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. Sensitivity to HU is conferred by many mutations that affect replication, as well as by mutations that impair the responses to replication stress. Several mutations affecting yeast FACT cause sensitivity to HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c28">28</xref>).</p><p>A DNA-repair role for FACT is also evident. In human cells, DNA damage caused by UV irradiation is potentiated in part through transcription-activation functions of p53 [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c31">31</xref>)]; one facet of this potentiation is the phosphorylation of serine 392 at the C terminus of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c34">34</xref>). This phosphorylation can be carried out by a complex of FACT and casein kinase II (CK2), with FACT providing p53 specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c36">36</xref>). Yeast FACT also associates with CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c37">37</xref>).</p><p>The subunits of FACT, encoded by single genes in the genomes of eukaryotes examined so far, are highly conserved. The smaller FACT subunit is named Pob3 (yeast) or SSRP1 (human). Pob3 and SSRP1 are closely related sequences, but SSRP1 has an additional domain at its C terminus that is not found in Pob3. This domain, a high mobility group (HMG) fold, can bind damaged and distorted DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c39">39</xref>). Pob3 lacks this HMG domain; however, the small HMG protein Nhp6 associates with yeast FACT and facilitates the binding of FACT to nucleosomes and the resulting nucleosome reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c41">41</xref>). A Pob3&#x02013;Nhp6 fusion protein that mimics the structure of SSRP1 provides all essential Pob3 functions and many of the functions of Nhp6, including the restoration of chromatin repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c40">40</xref>). Thus Pob3 and Nhp6 may comprise a bipartite version of SSRP1. This difference between yeast and metazoan FACT may reflect additional roles for Nhp6 that do not involve FACT.</p><p>The larger subunit of FACT has been variously termed Cdc68 or Spt16, for its original discoveries in the yeast system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c17">17</xref>). Despite end-to-end conservation of the Spt16 protein in a wide variety of eukaryotes, the N-terminal 30% of the yeast Spt16 polypeptide can be deleted without loss of essential functions, as shown by the <italic>cdc68-&#x00394;922</italic> (<italic>spt16-&#x00394;922</italic>) mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c26">26</xref>). However, chromatin repression is compromised by this mutation, and <italic>spt16-&#x00394;922</italic> mutant cells are also temperature sensitive for cell proliferation, indicating that essential functions are compromised at elevated growth temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c26">26</xref>).</p><p>The apparent dispensability of conserved sequences at the N terminus of FACT subunit Spt16 has prompted genetic and biochemical investigations of the domain organization for yeast FACT. Our data suggest that each FACT subunit is a multidomain protein and that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Spt16 is indeed dispensable during normal growth, in part through redundant function with the rest of FACT. Previously reported temperature-sensitive mutations in the Spt16 NTD were found to destabilize the entire Spt16 polypeptide, accounting for the temperature sensitivity of mutations in this non-essential domain. The Spt16 NTD does become important under conditions of replication stress, where it mediates adaptation to stress conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>The <italic>spt16-&#x00394;</italic>(6&#x02013;435) mutation was identified in strain DE4B-17b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c26">26</xref>).

The resulting polypeptide lacks residues 6&#x02013;435, with the residues IDPSED in their place (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f1">1</xref>A). This truncated Spt16 protein, termed Spt16-&#x00394;(6&#x02013;435), provides essential functions even at elevated temperatures and thus is more effective that the original Spt16-&#x00394;922 protein, which misses only residues 6&#x02013;306. Improved function due to the intragenic suppressing deletion in the <italic>spt16-&#x00394;</italic>(6&#x02013;435) mutant allele is also seen with respect to chromatin repression of transcription, which is compromised by the <italic>spt16-&#x00394;922</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c26">26</xref>).

Whereas the <italic>spt16-&#x00394;922</italic> mutant allele allows the growth of cells on these deficient media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c26">26</xref>), the <italic>spt16-&#x00394;</italic>(6&#x02013;435) allele significantly decreases growth under these conditions, and thus restores a significant degree of chromatin repression at these reporter genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f1">1</xref>A).

Like the original deletion allele <italic>spt16-&#x00394;922</italic>, the internal deletion <italic>spt16-&#x00394;369</italic> causes temperature sensitivity and allows (weak) growth on His<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and Lys<sup>&#x02212;</sup> media, indicating that chromatin repression of the Spt reporter genes <italic>his4-912&#x003b4;</italic> and <italic>lys2-128&#x003b4;</italic> is compromised (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f1">1</xref>A). Thus, the combined deletion of two adjacent segments of the Spt16 protein, residues 6&#x02013;306 and 312&#x02013;435 [resulting in the Spt16-&#x00394;(6&#x02013;435) protein described above], has only limited effects under the conditions tested, while the presence of either of the N-terminal polypeptide segment in the absence of the other causes problems related to chromatin regulation (summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>A more extensively deleted mutant allele was created using convenient restriction sites. This allele, <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f1">1</xref>A), lacks codons 2&#x02013;484 but provides all essential functions of Spt16. Cells in which the Spt16-&#x00394;NTD polypeptide is the only version of Spt16, grow at high temperature and maintain a significant degree of chromatin repression at the <italic>his4-912&#x003b4;</italic> and <italic>lys2-128&#x003b4;</italic> reporter genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f1">1</xref>A). These findings suggested that the Spt16-&#x00394;NTD protein, and the Spt16-&#x00394;(6&#x02013;435) protein described above, maintain effective interactions with the other subunit of yeast FACT, Pob3. This conjecture was tested directly by competitive co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Anti-V5 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate epitope-tagged Pob3-(V5&#x0002b;His<sub>6</sub>) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c40">40</xref>) from cells harboring two versions of Spt16 protein, full-length Spt16 and either Spt16-&#x00394;(6&#x02013;435) or Spt16-&#x00394;NTD. Under these conditions, in which the total amount of Spt16 polypeptide was in excess, the truncated versions of Spt16 co-immunoprecipitated with Pob3, although somewhat less effectively than full-length Spt16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f1">1</xref>B). This <italic>in vivo</italic> Pob3 binding by N-terminally truncated Spt16 polypeptides, and their ability to provide essential functions, indicate that sequences downstream from residue 484 fold properly in the absence of upstream sequences, and begin to suggest a domain organization for Spt16. The more extensively deleted Spt16-&#x00394;CS polypeptide [Cdc68-&#x00394;CS, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c26">26</xref>)] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f1">1</xref>A) lacking N-terminal residues down to position 556 cannot supply essential function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c26">26</xref>), consistent with a domain boundary in the 485&#x02013;555 region.</p></sec><sec><title>Spt16 domains suggested by partial proteolysis of native FACT</title><p>In parallel with the above genetic studies, we assessed domain boundaries using limited proteolysis. Proteases with different cleavage specificities, namely trypsin, chymotrypsin and endoprotease Glu-C (V8 protease), were used to digest purified FACT, and the sizes of the resulting fragments were estimated by denaturing gel electrophoresis. FACT composed of epitope-tagged Spt16 and Pob3 proteins was used, which allowed direct identification of N-terminal and&#x0002f;or C-terminal polypeptides.</p><p>FACT containing N-terminally HA-tagged Spt16 supplies all essential functions, as does FACT containing C-terminally (V5&#x0002b;His<sub>6</sub>)-tagged Pob3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c43">43</xref>). A version of FACT composed of HA-Spt16 and Pob3-(V5&#x0002b;His<sub>6</sub>) is similarly functional <italic>in vivo</italic> (data not shown). This doubly tagged FACT was digested with trypsin for increasing times, proteolysis was halted with soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the digest was analyzed by western blotting. Anti-HA antibody detected a major 55 kDa N-terminal fragment of Spt16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>A, NTD). This disjoined N-terminal fragment, the NTD, was stable to incubation with trypsin after all full-length Spt16 protein had been cleaved, indicating that the trypsin-generated NTD maintains a folded state. Glu-C also generated an HA-tagged Spt16 NTD of similar size (data not shown), consistent with preferential proteolytic cleavage in a boundary region defining the 55 kDa NTD (excluding the HA tag) as an independently folded domain.</p><p>The above trypsin digestion of FACT that contained HA-tagged Spt16 also generated smaller HA-tagged polypeptide fragments, suggesting that the NTD may be folded into subdomains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>A; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>D). This possibility is supported by NTD sequence considerations (see Discussion).</p><p>Partial proteolysis also produced HA-tagged polypeptides larger than the NTD, highlighting downstream cleavage sites that suggested the presence of a C-terminal domain (CTD). To assess the presence of an independently folded CTD of Spt16, we used purified FACT that contained Spt16 tagged at its C terminus with the <sc>flag</sc> epitope. Spt16-<sc>flag</sc> provides all essential functions (data not shown), even when combined with Pob3-(V5&#x0002b;His<sub>6</sub>) or with Pob3 HA-tagged at its N terminus [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c1">1</xref>); data not shown]. Both of these doubly tagged versions of FACT were separately subjected to limited digestion with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or Glu-C. All three enzymes generated a C-terminal Spt16 fragment of 28 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>B, and data not shown), indicating that the boundary between this Spt16 CTD and the upstream &#x02018;middle&#x02019; domain is highly accessible. Trypsin and Glu-C also produced a major Spt16-<sc>flag</sc> fragment of 62 kDa, consistent with Spt16 minus its NTD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>B, Spt16-&#x00394;NTD); Glu-C, but not the other enzymes, also produced a 46 kDa C-terminal fragment (data not shown). These findings suggest that, as a subunit of FACT, Spt16 is folded into three major domains: a 55 kDa NTD, a 28 kDa CTD, and a 34 kDa middle (Mid) domain, which itself may comprise subdomains.</p><p>The 62 kDa fragment (Spt16 minus its NTD) generated by trypsin cleavage was analyzed by Edman sequencing, which showed that trypsin cleaved at arginine 485. This residue is at the downstream end of a &#x0223c;30-residue span that shows limited sequence conservation. This span is devoid of cleavage sites for chymotrypsin, consistent with the absence of a disjoined NTD fragment in chymotrypsin digests (data not shown). The NTD boundary suggested by partial proteolysis is consistent with the activity of the Spt16-&#x00394;NTD mutant polypeptide created genetically as described above, which comprises the intact Mid and C-terminal domains.</p><p>The domain structure of Spt16 suggested above is supported by the trypsin cleavage pattern of FACT purified to homogeneity. The resistance of Pob3 to low levels of trypsin (see below) allowed the identification of silver-stained Spt16 fragments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>C, lanes 2 and 3). In this analysis the NTD and the combined Mid&#x0002b;CTD (Spt16-&#x00394;NTD) were especially resistant to proteolysis, while the CTD was more labile (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>C, and data not shown). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>D summarizes Spt16 domain organization.</p><p>To assess the folded nature of the disjoined Spt16 NTD, affinity-purified FACT containing HA-Spt16 was treated lightly with trypsin to an extent that generated some Spt16 NTD cleavage product but which also left some FACT undigested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>A). This mixture was then resolved by exclusion chromatography to size-fractionate the NTD, FACT minus the NTD, and undigested FACT, which runs at &#x0003e;200 kDa [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>E; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c1">1</xref>)]. Western analysis of the column eluate showed that, while a portion of the NTD fractionated as a monomer, much of the disjoined NTD co-migrated with intact FACT as indicated by undigested, full-length Spt16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>E), most likely as a result of the maintenance of NTD non-covalent interactions after trypsin cleavage.</p><p>A different result was obtained by similar analysis, using the same buffer conditions, of the Spt16 CTD. Size-fractionation of trypsin-digested FACT that contained Spt16-<sc>flag</sc> showed that the bulk of the disjoined CTD fractionated away from Pob3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>F), indicating little non-covalent association with other domains of FACT.</p><p>The results in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>F suggest that the Pob3 interacts with the Spt16 Mid domain. To learn more about this interaction, the blot in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>F was reprobed with polyclonal anti-Spt16 antibody, which detected an untagged Mid domain co-migating with Pob3 (data not shown). Thus the Spt16 CTD is not necessary for Pob3 binding. This result was confirmed by Pob3 co-immunoprecipitation of tagged Spt16-&#x00394;CTD polypeptide from trypsin-treated FACT, and by the purification of a complex of Pob3 and Mid domain from an extract of cells harboring a plasmid expressing the Mid-domain tagged with the <sc>flag</sc> epitope and the SV40 NLS (data not shown). These <italic>in vivo</italic> findings are also supported by the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments described below. Pob3 interaction is thus provided mainly by the Spt16 Mid domain.</p></sec><sec><title>Pob3 domains suggested by partial proteolysis</title><p>In the context of FACT, Pob3 is more resistant than Spt16 to proteolytic treatments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>C, and data not shown). However, a higher concentration of trypsin cleaved the Spt16-<sc>flag</sc>&#x02022;Pob3-(V5&#x0002b;His<sub>6</sub>) version of FACT to generate two major C-terminal Pob3 fragments, of apparent sizes 62 and 50 kDa including the tag (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f3">3</xref>). Glu-C gave similar Pob3 fragments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f3">3</xref>, and data not shown). [Electrophoretic mobilities of the 551-residue Pob3 protein and tagged derivatives are lower than that predicted by molecular mass; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c1">1</xref>)]. Probing the same blots with anti-<sc>flag</sc> antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f3">3</xref>) showed that the appearance of the Pob3-(V5&#x0002b;His<sub>6</sub>) fragments coincided with extensive cleavage of Spt16, suggesting that protease-sensitive sites in Pob3 are shielded by Spt16 protein. Assignment of Pob3 cleavage sites is complicated by the uncertainty in molecular weight estimates due to the anomalous electrophoretic mobilities noted above, and the instability of Pob3 fragments produced by FACT cleavage. Nonetheless, some insight was provided by the expression of Pob3-(V5&#x0002b;His<sub>6</sub>) in <italic>E.coli</italic> cells, which yielded C-terminal fragments due to cleavages at residues 214 and 221 (data not shown). Based on all of these findings, our preliminary prediction is that Pob3 has 23 kDa NTDs and 40 kDa CTDs that are stabilized by association with the Mid domain of Spt16. The resistance of Pob3 to cleavage suggests that this boundary region may be sequestered in FACT.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> dissection of Spt16&#x02022;Pob3 interactions</title><p>FACT subunit interactions were assessed directly using GST-pulldown assays with recombinant Spt16 and Pob3 polypeptides.

Stronger binding to GST&#x02013;Pob3 was repeatedly found for an &#x0223c;45 kDa S-tagged proteolytic fragment of THS&#x02013;Spt16(436&#x02013;1035), even though this fragment was not abundant in the input or unbound material (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f4">4</xref>B, arrowhead). The presence of the S-tag shows that this fragment contains Mid-domain sequences (436 to &#x0223c;700, taking into account the THS tag), indicating the expected strong Pob3 binding by the Mid domain.</p><p>The Mid and C-terminal domains of Spt16 were tested separately for Pob3 binding. The CTD polypeptides THS&#x02013;Spt16(710&#x02013;1035) and THS&#x02013;Spt16(771&#x02013;1035) each failed to associate with GST&#x02013;Pob3 (data not shown), as expected from the results of partial proteolysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>F). The Mid-domain polypeptides THS&#x02013;Spt16(436&#x02013;786) and THS&#x02013;Spt16 (436&#x02013;821) associated non-specifically with the GST-bound agarose beads (data not shown), but higher-stringency washes indicated specific and strong binding to GST&#x02013;Pob3 by the Mid domain THS&#x02013;Spt16(436&#x02013;786) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f4">4</xref>C). THS&#x02013;Spt16 (635&#x02013;1035) and THS&#x02013;Spt16(308&#x02013;642), containing Mid-domain fragments, associated far less avidly with GST&#x02013;Pob3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f4">4</xref>B), suggesting that the Mid domain needs to be intact for effective Pob3 binding.</p><p>The NTD polypeptide THS&#x02013;Spt16(1&#x02013;435) bound weakly but reproducibly to GST&#x02013;Pob3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f4">4</xref>B), analogously to the binding of the Spt16 NTD to the rest of FACT after partial proteolysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>E). Thus the NTD may also be involved in Pob3 binding.</p><p>Experiments to determine the Spt16-interacting region(s) of Pob3 used GST fusions mimicking the domains suggested by partial proteolysis.

The THS&#x02013;Spt16(436&#x02013;1035) Mid&#x0002b;CTD polypeptide bound specifically to both GST&#x02013;Pob3N and GST&#x02013;Pob3C polypeptides, and not to the GST-bound beads (data not shown), and at higher stringency the two Spt16 Mid-domain polypeptides interacted specifically with both GST&#x02013;Pob3N and GST&#x02013;Pob3C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f4">4</xref>D). Pob3 may therefore have two binding surfaces for Cdc68.</p></sec><sec><title>NTD point mutations destabilize the Spt16 polypeptide</title><p>The finding that the Spt16 NTD is dispensable for essential functions appears inconsistent with the presence of point mutations in this domain that compromise essential functions. Several mutant versions of Spt16 with substitutions only in the NTD bring about temperature sensitivity for cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c17">17</xref>). For at least one Spt16 NTD mutation, causing a G132D substitution, temperature sensitivity is accompanied by destabilization of the mutant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c43">43</xref>). Increased expression of the <italic>spt16-G132D</italic> mutant allele (<italic>cdc68-1</italic>), using a multicopy plasmid, alleviates much of this temperature sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c24">24</xref>), consistent with temperature sensitivity due to an abnormally short Spt16 half-life. We therefore tested several other temperature-sensitive <italic>spt16</italic> mutant alleles with point mutations affecting the NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c4">4</xref>). Isogenic strains were created in which four mutant alleles encoding NTD point mutations, <italic>spt16-16a</italic> (R204W,A273V,C290V,D318N), <italic>spt16-8</italic> (G369D,R373T), <italic>spt16-24</italic> (T434I), and <italic>spt16-12</italic> (A417T plus downstream substitutions), present on centromeric (low-copy) plasmids, supplied only the Spt16 protein. These mutant proteins, plus deleted proteins described here and analogously expressed, were evaluated for half-life as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c43">43</xref>). Logarithmically growing cells were treated with the protein-synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to stop the production of new polypeptides, and the relative abundance of pre-existing Spt16 protein was determined by western analysis. In each case the addition of cycloheximide immediately halted cell proliferation (data not shown). With the exception of the Spt16-&#x00394;369 polypeptide, all mutant proteins were relatively stable at 23&#x000b0;C, as indicated by polypeptide abundance in the growing cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f5">5</xref>). In contrast, every tested protein with an NTD alteration, with the exceptions of Spt16-&#x00394;922 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c20">20</xref>) and Spt16-&#x00394;(6-435), showed significant decreases in abundance during high-temperature incubation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f5">5</xref>). The temperature sensitivities displayed by cells with these N-terminal <italic>spt16</italic> mutations may therefore be related to the shorter half-lives of the mutant proteins at a restrictive temperature. Consistent with this idea, the <italic>spt16-16a</italic>, <italic>spt16-8</italic>, <italic>spt16-24</italic> and <italic>spt16-12</italic> mutant alleles, like <italic>spt16-G132D</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c24">24</xref>), allow high-temperature growth when present on multicopy plasmids (data not shown).</p><p>Spt16-312 and Spt16-319, two novel temperature-sensitive proteins with substitutions in the Mid and C-terminal domains (A.F. O'Donnell, G.C. Johnston and R.A. Singer, in preparation) had longer half-lives at the restrictive temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f5">5</xref>), and increased expression from multicopy plasmids did not alleviate temperature sensitivity (data not shown). Thus <italic>spt16</italic> temperature sensitivity is not invariably accompanied by Spt16 polypeptide instability.</p></sec><sec><title>The Spt16 NTD influences essential FACT functions</title><p>The NTD of Spt16, although dispensable under normal growth conditions, is conserved in sequence across the eukaryotic spectrum, suggesting an important function for this domain.

Combining the deletion mutation of <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> with the downstream point mutations characterizing the <italic>spt16-312</italic> allele mentioned above, or with the E857K substitution mutation encoded by <italic>spt16-E857K</italic> (A.F.

It is even more striking to note that combining the <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> deletion with the point mutations of <italic>spt16-319</italic> created a version of Spt16 unable to support growth even at 30&#x000b0;C (data not shown). Polypeptide degradation may not contribute to these effects; the Spt16-&#x00394;N,319, Spt16-&#x00394;N,312 and Spt16-&#x00394;N,E857K polypeptides are abundant and stable when expressed from a low-copy plasmid in wild-type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f6">6</xref>B), and Spt16-&#x00394;N,312 and Spt16-&#x00394;N,E857K, as the sole Spt16 polypeptide in cells, are also stable at the restrictive temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f6">6</xref>C). These findings suggest that the Spt16 NTD, although without essential function, can influence the essential functions(s) of downstream Spt16 domains.</p><p>More insight was provided by the use of mutations altering the other FACT subunit, Pob3. Temperature-sensitive <italic>pob3</italic> mutations affect cells in ways that implicate Pob3 in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c28">28</xref>).

These findings suggest that the NTD of Spt16 influences replication-related function(s) of Pob3, and may have a role in replication.</p></sec><sec><title>A replication function for the Spt16 NTD</title><p>Involvement of the Spt16 NTD in replication was substantiated by investigations involving HU. This free-radical scavenger causes replication stress by inhibiting the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and decreasing the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides needed for DNA replication. Several FACT mutations cause sensitivity to HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c28">28</xref>). Cells lacking the Spt16 NTD also exhibit sensitivity to HU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>A). These cells also are sensitive to methylmethane sulfonate, another inducer of replication stress [data not shown; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c48">48</xref>)]. Therefore the Spt16 NTD, although dispensable for normal DNA replication, becomes important during times of replication stress.</p><p>Sensitivity to HU can indicate several deficiencies, including impaired checkpoint signaling during DNA replication. When replication-fork activity stalls, as in response to a shortage of deoxynucleotide substrates, the replication checkpoint is activated. This checkpoint signaling has several effects, including inhibition of mitosis, relief of transcriptional repression for genes encoding ribonucleotide reductase, and ultimately the restoration of replication-fork function [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c49">49</xref>)]. Malfunction of this checkpoint signaling causes sensitivity to chronic exposure to HU, as in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>A. A more direct measure of checkpoint function is the degree of resistance to acute, short-term HU exposure, which indicates whether checkpoint-mediated activities can spare a cell from irreversible damage related to replication-fork collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c52">52</xref>). Control cells lacking the checkpoint proteins, Mre11 or Xrs2 were subjected to an 8 h exposure to a high concentration (200 mM) of HU and then transferred to solid HU-free medium to assess colony formation. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c53">53</xref>), these mutant cells with impaired checkpoint signaling failed to survive the acute HU treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>B). In marked contrast, the same HU treatment (at 30&#x000b0;C) of <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> and <italic>spt16-&#x00394;</italic>(6-435) mutant cells did not impair colony-forming ability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>B, and data not shown), and the treated cells were uniformly of the big-bud phenotype characteristic of checkpoint arrest (data not shown). This sensitivity to chronic HU treatment but normal resistance to acute HU treatment was seen in both the S288c and W303 genetic backgrounds. Similar assessment at 35&#x000b0;C, or with a 24 h HU exposure, also indicated that checkpoint signaling is intact in <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> and <italic>spt16-&#x00394;</italic>(6-435) mutant cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>B, and data not shown). Thus the absence of the Spt16 NTD does not prevent this critical aspect of checkpoint signaling.</p><p>Checkpoint signaling was also assessed biochemically. Activation of checkpoint signaling leads to phosphorylation of the checkpoint protein Rad53, stimulation of the protein kinase activity of Rad53 for downstream signaling and decreasing Rad53 electrophoretic mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c54">54</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>C shows that Rad53 protein has shifted to a lower electrophoretic mobility upon HU treatment of <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> and wild-type cells at both 30 and 35&#x000b0;C, indicating that Rad53 is phosphorylated effectively upon HU treatment of <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> mutant cells.</p><p>One important consequence of replication-checkpoint signaling is an increase in ribonucleotide reductase expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c55">55</xref>). Direct assessment of endogenous mRNA levels for <italic>RNR1</italic> and <italic>RNR3</italic>, which encode ribonucleotide reductase subunits, indicated that both genes were activated in <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> mutant cells upon HU treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>D). Therefore the existence of at least two responses to checkpoint signaling, ribonucleotide reductase activation and maintenance of replication-fork stability as indicated by resistance to acute HU treatment, as well as Rad53 phosphorylation, indicate that checkpoint signaling is active in <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> mutant cells.</p><p>Despite this checkpoint signaling, <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> mutant cells are sensitive to HU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>A). We noted that during HU treatment high levels of <italic>RNR1</italic> and <italic>RNR3</italic> mRNAs were maintained in wild-type cells, whereas mRNA abundances had declined in <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> mutant cells by the 4 h timepoint, especially at 35&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>D). This decline paralleled the decline in Rad53 phosphorylation seen for <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> mutant cells at this 35&#x000b0;C timepoint (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>C). The Spt16 NTD may therefore facilitate sustained checkpoint signaling. The decline in checkpoint signaling and in <italic>RNR</italic> gene transcription in <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> mutant cells upon extended HU exposure raised the possibility that ribonucleotide reductase activity in these mutant cells might become insufficient for the restart of stalled replication forks. However, two lines of evidence suggest that ribonucleotide reductase activity is not deficient in <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> mutant cells. Ectopic expression of plasmid-borne <italic>RNR1</italic> or <italic>RNR3</italic> from the constitutive GAP promoter can alleviate HU sensitivity for checkpoint-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c50">50</xref>). However, overexpression of <italic>RNR1</italic> or <italic>RNR3</italic> from these plasmids did not alter the HU sensitivity of <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> mutant cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>E). We also eliminated the Sml1 protein, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c56">56</xref>). Checkpoint signaling causes the phosphorylation and degradation of Sml1, releasing preexisting ribonucleotide reductase enzyme from inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c57">57</xref>). A <italic>sml1&#x00394;</italic> mutation makes cells resistant to HU and allows growth in the absence of checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c58">58</xref>). However, <italic>sml1&#x00394;</italic> did not abrogate the HU sensitivity of <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>F). These experiments suggest that the Spt16 NTD may mediate an activity downstream of checkpoint signaling itself, perhaps related to the resumption of replication by stalled replication forks.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic indications of several replication functions for yeast FACT</title><p>Sensitivity to HU has been reported for yeast FACT mutants that have an intact Spt16 NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c28">28</xref>). To determine whether these HU sensitivities are related to the actions of the NTD, genetic interactions between FACT mutations were assessed. These experiments showed that the <italic>spt16-&#x00394;N,E857K</italic> mutant allele described above causes a degree of HU sensitivity greater than that shown by either <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> or <italic>spt16-E857K</italic> themselves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>G). Similarly, several <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD pob3</italic> double-mutant derivatives exhibited synthetic HU sensitivity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>H). These findings suggest that FACT is involved in replication-fork activities in several ways, both dependent on and independent of the Spt16 NTD.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We report here an initial analysis, through genetic and biochemical analysis, of the domain organization of the subunits of yeast FACT. The domain interactions responsible for FACT integrity as determined here, and the functional aspects of the NTD of the Spt16 subunit, suggest that FACT functions may also be partially compartmentalized to domains.</p><sec><title>Domain organization of the FACT subunits</title><p>The Spt16 protein may be folded into three major domains, as indicated by partial-proteolysis experiments, N-terminal sequence data and genetic findings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>D). The domain boundaries map to localized regions of low sequence conservation among Spt16 homologs from diverse species. Our findings suggest that Pob3 may be folded into two domains, separated by a short yeast-specific insert within the conserved Pob3&#x0002f;SSRP1 family. The SSRP1 members of the Pob3&#x0002f;SSRP1 protein family also have an HMG domain appended C-terminally. This HMG sequence is likely to be another independently folded portion of the polypeptide, given that this type of HMG domain is an independently folded entity in many contexts. The small HMG protein Nhp6 may provide this domain for yeast FACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c40">40</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>FACT integrity</title><p>The Spt16 Mid domain is intact in Spt16 derivatives that bind Pob3 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and also binds Pob3 polypeptides <italic>in vitro</italic>. FACT is therefore stabilized through Pob3 interactions with the Spt16 Mid domain. Conversely, Spt16 binds <italic>in vitro</italic> to two different recombinant Pob3 polypeptides encompassing the NTDs and CTDs. Although these two Pob3 fragments have residues 178&#x02013;215 in common, much of this &#x02018;overlap&#x02019; sequence is absent from metazoan Pob3 homologs and most likely comprises a domain boundary. This 38-residue region is therefore unlikely to be responsible for the similar interactions of these two Pob3 fragments with Spt16. An internal duplication in Pob3&#x0002f;SSRP1 proteins has been reported that may produce similar polypeptide folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c59">59</xref>). This duplication spans Pob3 residues 4&#x02013;104 and 374&#x02013;475, placing one duplicated subdomain in each of the Pob3 domains that binds Spt16. This tandem duplication may provide binding surfaces for Spt16, one within each of the suggested Pob3 domains.</p><p>Analogous <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction studies have been carried out for human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> FACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c36">36</xref>). Fragments of human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spt16, corresponding to yeast residues 337&#x02013;657 (for the human fragment), and &#x0223c;460&#x02013;1035 and &#x0223c;630&#x02013;1035 (for <italic>Drosophila</italic> fragments), were sufficient for <italic>in vitro</italic> SSRP1 binding. Thus in both metazoan cases, regions corresponding to the yeast Mid domain were involved. Note, however, that the 645&#x02013;1035 fragment of yeast Spt16, analogous to the SSRP1-binding <italic>Drosophila</italic> fragment, did not bind Pob3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f4">4</xref>B), perhaps as a consequence of improper folding. The expected lack of interaction was also seen; human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spt16 polypeptide fragments that did not bind SSRP1 corresponding to N-terminal Spt16 sequences that are dispensable for yeast FACT integrity.</p><p>Correspondence between interactions within metazoan and yeast FACT is less evident for SSRP1&#x0002f;Pob3. Human SSRP1 was found to interact <italic>in vitro</italic> with hSpt16 through N-terminal sequences, whereas the downstream hSSRP1 fragments that were tested did not interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c36">36</xref>). For <italic>Drosophila</italic> FACT, the opposite pattern was seen, with C-terminal dSSRP1 sequences mediating dSpt16 interaction and N-terminal sequences remaining inert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c10">10</xref>). Resolution of these differences awaits further study.</p></sec><sec><title>The Spt16 CTD</title><p>The CTD of Spt16 does not make stable associations with Pob3 or upstream Spt16 domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>F), and therefore may be tethered loosely to the rest of FACT. We found that an <italic>spt16-&#x00394;CTD</italic> mutant allele cannot keep cells alive, but attempts to understand the biological effects of the CTD have so far been stymied by the <italic>in vivo</italic> instability of Spt16-&#x00394;CTD polypeptide (J. R. Stevens, G.C.J. and R.A.S., unpublished observations). However, recombinant human Spt16 lacking C-terminal residues corresponding to most of the CTD also lacks the histone-binding activity of full-length hSpt16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c11">11</xref>), suggesting that the Spt16 CTD may function as a mobile histone-binding domain.</p></sec><sec><title>NTD fragments and FACT function</title><p>The phenotypes of the <italic>spt16-&#x00394;</italic>(5-435) and <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> alleles, encoding Spt16 polypeptides lacking the NTD, indicate that the NTD is not essential for growth at 37&#x000b0;C or for chromatin repression of transcription, and therefore these properties depend on Spt16 Mid and CTD domains. However, Spt16 polypeptides in which only a fragment of the NTD is appended to Mid&#x0002b;CTD, such as Spt16-&#x00394;922 and Spt16-&#x00394;369, are compromised for these functions. These observations suggest that the NTD fragments in these polypeptides may be misfolded to an extent that they interfere with proper Mid&#x0002b;CTD function or with Pob3 function.</p><p>Structure predictions support the notion that the NTD fragments in the Spt16-&#x00394;922 and Spt16-&#x00394;369 polypeptides may indeed be misfolded. The Spt16 NTD resembles members of the &#x02018;pita-fold&#x02019; family of aminopeptidase enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c60">60</xref>), with a type-I fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c61">61</xref>) predicted for an aminopeptidase-like NTD subregion. Eukaryotic aminopeptidases have another domain, of heterogeneous structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c62">62</xref>). This added NTD of eukaryotic aminopeptidase enzymes is mimicked, in size and position, by a potential subdomain of the Spt16 NTD, so that the entire Spt16 NTD resembles a type-Ib enzyme structure. NTD subdomains are in fact suggested by partial-proteolysis results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f2">2</xref>A). In any case, the Spt16 NTD fragments studied here, in the Spt16-&#x00394;922 and Spt16-&#x00394;369 polypeptides, each lack approximately half of the putative &#x02018;pita-fold&#x02019; subdomain.</p></sec><sec><title>Spt16 NTD function</title><p>The experiments reported here, and related ones concerning metazoan FACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c36">36</xref>), suggest that the NTD of the FACT subunit Spt16 is not critical for FACT integrity. This domain is almost certainly, therefore, involved in interactions with other proteins. However, these interactions are not important for global transcription if the rest of FACT is intact. On the other hand, NTD interactions are important under conditions of replication stress, as evidenced by the phenotype of <italic>spt16-&#x00394;NTD</italic> mutant cells. Even during replication stress these interactions may not affect transcription, because the Spt16 NTD is not necessary for transcriptional activation of the <italic>RNR</italic> genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh922f7">7</xref>D). The Spt16 NTD may therefore be important for the restart of stalled replication forks that accumulate upon replication stress.</p><p>The postulated NTD interactions during replication stress are not obvious. The NTD interacts with the Sas3 component of the NuA3 histone acetyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c63">63</xref>). Although this interaction has certain transcription-related effects, an appreciation of the consequences of this interaction awaits further investigation. A more relevant interaction for replication stress may involve the protein kinase CK2. A fragment of human Spt16 encompassing a majority of the NTD interacts <italic>in vitro</italic> with the &#x003b1;&#x02032; catalytic subunit of CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c36">36</xref>) in a complex that phosphorylates and activates p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c36">36</xref>). Activation of p53 takes place upon replication stress brought on by HU treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c64">64</xref>), and p53 becomes localized to stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c65">65</xref>). An analogous CK2&#x02022;FACT association exists in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh922c37">37</xref>), but its significance is currently unclear.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh922f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Spt16 polypeptides.
