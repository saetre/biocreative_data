The only known target of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates is farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, which ensures prenylation of prosurvival proteins, such as Ras. However, it is likely that the action of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates involves additional unknown mechanisms. To identify novel targets of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, we used a genome-wide high-throughput screening in which 5,936 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>heterozygote barcoded mutants were grown competitively in the presence of sub-lethal doses of three nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (risedronate, alendronate and ibandronate). Strains carrying deletions in genes encoding potential drug targets show a variation of the intensity of their corresponding barcodes on the hybridization array over the time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With this approach, we identified novel targets of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, such as tubulin cofactor B and ASK/DBF4 (Activator of S-phase kinase). The up-regulation of tubulin cofactor B may explain some previously unknown effects of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates on microtubule dynamics and organization. As nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates induce extensive DNA damage, we also document the role of DBF4 as a key player in nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate-induced cytotoxicity, thus explaining the effects on the cell-cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The dataset obtained from the yeast screen was validated in a mammalian system, allowing the discovery of new biological processes involved in the cellular response to nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and opening up opportunities for development of new anticancer drugs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>We exploited the molecular tools available for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>to investigate potential targets of the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) alendronate (ALE), ibandronate (IBA) and risedronate (RIS). N-BPs are pyrophosphate analogs used to treat osteoporosis and, at high doses, cancer-induced bone disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The primary target of N-BPs is farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), whose inhibition prevents protein prenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies conducted on tumor cell lines suggest that N-BPs are able to exert a broad spectrum of actions, including inhibition of invasion, and promotion of cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. In this context, we performed a large-scale competition experiment with different yeast mutants in the presence of sub-lethal doses of N-BPs to unravel their secondary cellular targets and to understand the molecular changes occurring in cells exposed to such compounds.</p><p>The yeast experimental system consists of a collection of 5,936 heterozygote deletant strains encompassing all yeast's open reading frames (ORFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Each mutant carries two molecular barcodes (TAGs), which are 20-bp unique sequences acting as strain identifiers. The mutants are grown together in competition under different selective pressures, and the molecular TAGs are discriminated on a hybridization array. The strains carrying deletions in genes that are crucial for the yeast growth in the given conditions will loose the competition, scored by a progressively lower intensity of their barcodes on the array over the time. This approach has been successfully used to functionally characterize all yeast ORFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], to identify human genes involved in mitochondrial diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and to identify drug targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, genes that are quantitatively important in different environments, so that, when one allele is missing, the resulting phenotype is either severely compromised (haploinsufficient) or slightly favored (haploproficient), can be detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In our experiment, the haploinsufficient and haploproficient phenotypes detected in the presence of the N-BPs reveal alleles whose gene products are affected by the specific condition and, therefore, likely to be drug targets. With this approach we confirmed FPPS as the main <italic>in vivo </italic>target of N-BPs action and we identified additional biological processes affected by N-BPs, such as vacuolar acidification, microtubule dynamics, and DNA replication, underlying the complex cellular effects that bisphosphonates have on cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Competition experiments</title><p>The wild type <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>strain BY4743 was tested for its response to ALE, IBA and RIS in order to select a sub-lethal dose to use with the collection of deletion mutants. RIS and IBA were powerful growth inhibitors, whereas ALE had a much weaker effect on the yeast cells (Figure S1 in Additional data file 1). Competition experiments with 5,936 hemizygous yeast mutants were carried out in the presence of each drug. Strains showing a significant change in their growth rate were identified. The significance threshold was chosen to give a false discovery rate of q &#x0003c; 0.001 for the haploinsufficient strains, and of q &#x0003c; 0.01 for the haploproficient ones since only a smaller number of strains displayed an increase in growth rate (see Materials and methods; Additional data files 2, 3, 4 and 5). Some strains (197 for RIS, 250 for ALE and 283 for IBA) were so compromised by N-BPs that they disappeared from the population after 10 to 12 generations (Additional data file 2). These strains are referred to as quick disappearing (QD) and, for such mutants, there are no 'growth rate difference' values.</p><p>Lists of strains showing haploinsufficient and haploproficient profiles in the presence of the drugs are shown in Additional data file 2 and Additional data file 3, respectively. From these lists we subsequently removed the strains that carried a mutation in a dubious ORF (according to the <italic>Saccharomyces </italic>Genome Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]), those known to harbor erroneous TAGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and those showing a slow growing phenotype on a minimal medium (according to the <italic>Saccharomyces </italic>Genome Database), since their haploinsufficiency could depend on the nutrient limiting-medium rather than on the specific drug. Lists of haploinsufficient and haploproficient strains after the filtering process are given in Additional data files 4 and 5, respectively. About 45% of the haploinsufficient strains (including the QD) overlapped across the three conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and there is a common fingerprint when strain growth rates are compared between the three conditions (Figure S2 of the Additional data file 1).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Venn diagram of numbers of haploinsufficient and haploproficient genes after removal of bad tags and dubious ORFs. Haploinsufficient genes are often shared between all three drug conditions; genes involved in heat shock response show a similar phenotype. IBA and ALE appear to have an overlapping mode of action on genes associated with secondary N-BP targets, such as chromatin structure, but not on primary, mevalonate-dependent interactions, while RIS and IBA share the main N-BP target, the farnesyl transferase ERG20, part of the mevalonate pathway.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2009-10-9-r93-1"/></fig><p>The highest numbers of haploinsufficient and haploproficient genes were scored in the presence of IBA. The sensitivity and reliability of the 'barcode' method were demonstrated by the severe haploinsufficiency, in the presence of RIS and IBA, of the gene <italic>YJL167W</italic>, which encodes the yeast farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase Erg20p, the only known molecular target of N-BPs in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, ALE, which had only a very weak effect on <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>(Figure S1 in Additional data file 1), does not seem to compromise the growth rate of a <italic>YJL167W </italic>hemizygous mutant, suggesting that its interaction with FPPS is limited or inefficient in yeast. Gene Ontology analysis applied to the data showed enrichment in categories such as chromatin remodeling and, more generally, DNA packaging. A detailed analysis of their human orthologs revealed the presence of several genes encoding components of a complex that responds to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], including <italic>SMARCB1 </italic>(yeast <italic>YLR321C</italic>), <italic>MCM5 </italic>(yeast <italic>YLR274W</italic>), <italic>MCM6 </italic>(yeast <italic>YGL201C</italic>) and <italic>DBF4 </italic>(yeast <italic>YDR052C</italic>). In particular, <italic>DBF4 </italic>was found to be haploproficient in the presence of IBA. This was confirmed by growing separately both a hemizygote <italic>DBF4 </italic>mutant and the wild-type strain in the presence and absence of IBA. The results showed that the <italic>DBF4 </italic>mutant presents a quantitatively significant increase in final biomass (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 6.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6</sup>; Additional data file 6), suggesting that such a hemizygous mutant can partially counterbalance the N-BP's toxicity.</p><p>Among the strains showing a marked haploinsufficient profile in the presence of the three drugs, we found genes related to proton pumps, which were suggested as N-BP targets before the discovery of FPPS's involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Several regulators of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump PMA1 (encoded by <italic>YGL008C </italic>(<italic>PMA1</italic>)) were highly haploinsufficient: <italic>YDR033W </italic>(<italic>MRH1</italic>; of unknown function), QD in all three conditions, may be involved in PMA1 regulation according to its similarity to HSP30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; <italic>YBL069W </italic>(<italic>AST1</italic>), which plays a role in targeting Pma1p to the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], is also haploinsufficient in all three conditions; and <italic>YCR024C-A </italic>(<italic>PMP1</italic>), which encodes a regulatory subunit of PMA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], is severely haploinsufficient in the presence of IBA. No human ortholog of <italic>MRH1 </italic>has been found, although this does not exclude the possibility of a functional homolog that could represent a new effector of N-BPs. Several proteins whose functions are linked to microtubules were also significantly affected by the treatments. The strains hemizygous for <italic>ATG11 </italic>(<italic>YPR049C</italic>), <italic>ATG14 </italic>(<italic>YLR295C</italic>) and <italic>ATG15 </italic>(<italic>YCR068W</italic>), whose gene products are involved in autophagy and vacuolar processing, display a haploinsufficient profile in at least one of the drug conditions used. Moreover, the deletion mutant for <italic>ATG4 </italic>(<italic>YNL223W</italic>), haploinsufficient in the presence of RIS, encodes a mediator for the attachment of autophagosomes to microtubules via its interaction with Tub1p and Tub2p and has a human homolog, <italic>ATG4B</italic>. The hemizygous mutants for alpha-tubulin (<italic>TUB3</italic>), ADP ribosylation factor (<italic>ARF1</italic>) and alpha-tubulin folding protein (<italic>ALF1</italic>) also show clear haploinsufficient profiles. In particular, the growth disadvantage of <italic>ALF1 </italic>mutant (<italic>YNL148C</italic>), homologous to the mammalian tubulin cofactor B gene (<italic>TBCB</italic>), was confirmed by growing individually both the hemizygote mutant and the wild-type strain in the presence of IBA (quantitatively significant decrease of final biomass yield, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0043; Additional data file 6).</p><p>About 135 strains were haploproficient (q &#x0003c; 0.01), and the most marked phenotypes were those related to the internalization of molecules. For example, <italic>RAV1 </italic>(<italic>YJR033C</italic>) encodes one of the subunits of the RAVE complex responsible for the assembly of the yeast V-ATPase and vacuolar acidification. These data indicate that a defect in either the assembly of the RAVE complex or in the acidification of the vesicles confers an advantage to the cell in the presence of N-BPs (its human homolog encodes DmX-like 1 protein). Overall, our data strongly suggest the involvement of other effectors, besides FPPS, in N-BP-induced toxicity. The human homologs of the haploinsufficient and haploproficient genes were studied in human cell lines to see whether they display similar functions. In particular, since we could identify DNA damage and cytoskeleton dynamics as the novel processes affected by N-BP treatment, we focused our attention on genes that constitute fundamental nodes in these processes.</p></sec><sec><title>N-BPs induce DNA damage, modulate <italic>DBF4 </italic>expression and trafficking and induce cell cycle arrest</title><p>N-BP-induced toxicity in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>suggested the possible involvement of a group of human gene orthologs to those involved in yeast fitness variation and connected to DNA damage: <italic>SMARCB1</italic>, <italic>MCM5</italic>, <italic>MCM6 </italic>and <italic>DBF4</italic>. Since evidence of DNA damage upon N-BP treatment has been reported after treatment with zoledronic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we chose to evaluate the formation of DNA double strand breaks in the presence of ALE, IBA and RIS by measuring the phosphorylation status of the histone variant H2A.x (that is, &#x003b3;H2A.x) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Immunofluorescence microscopy, performed on MCF-7 cells using a specific antibody directed against &#x003b3;H2A.x revealed the formation of positive double strand break foci after treatment with the three N-BPs for 72 h at 10<sup>-4 </sup>M (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The percentage of cells presenting &#x003b3;H2Ax foci, evaluated by counting the foci-positive cells on six different fields in three different experiments was 83 &#x000b1; 15, 75 &#x000b1; 14, 75 &#x000b1; 9, and 98 &#x000b1; 4 in ALE, RIS, IBA and etoposide treated cells, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>N-BPs induce DNA double-strand breaks.

Both DBF4-Cdc7 and MCM proteins are phosphorylated by the protein kinases ATM and ATR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Cells that are hemizygous for <italic>DBF4 </italic>are severely haploinsufficient; however, this study shows that such a disadvantage is compensated for by the presence of N-BPs, suggesting the occurrence of epistatic interactions involving the <italic>DBF4 </italic>gene. Since DBF4 protein accumulates in the nuclei of G<sub>1</sub>-, S-, and M-phase-arrested cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], we decided to follow its localization upon N-BP stimulation via immunoblot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of MCF-7 cells. Upon stimulation with ALE, RIS and IBA, DBF4 protein accumulates within the nuclear compartment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). These data have also been confirmed by immunofluorescence experiments through confocal analysis, where the presence of DBF4 in the nuclei of cells treated with N-BPs is particularly evident in the merged picture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Interestingly, DBF4 appeared to have a molecular weight of about 118 kDa, instead of the nominal 77 kDa, suggesting that a hyperphosphorylated form of the protein was present in the cell. This has been confirmed by phosphatase treatment experiments (data not shown). Flow cytometry analysis after 72 h of 10<sup>-4 </sup>M N-BP treatment showed that the drugs were able to block the cell cycle of MCF-7 cells in the S-phase (Figure S3a in Additional data file 1). In particular, the number of cycling cells in the S-phase increased from 16% to 21% for IBA, to 28% for RIS and to 38% for ALE. This observation was concomitant with a reduction of cells in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase: 78% in control cells versus 75%, 64% and 60% in IBA, RIS and ALE treated cells, respectively. Moreover, the same treatment led to an increase in the amount of dead cells in the sub-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase from 13% to 17%, 49% and 58% for IBA, RIS and ALE, respectively (Figure S3b in Additional data file 1). Notably, the three drugs showed different potency, with ALE being the more active both in cell-cycle arrest and in the induction of cellular death.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>N-BPs modulate <italic>DBF4 </italic>expression and trafficking.

Western blots were performed on total protein extracts from cells treated with high doses of N-BPs (10<sup>-4 </sup>M) for 24, 48 and 72 h, using a specific antibody directed against TBCB. All three N-BPs used were able to increase TBCB protein levels and each showed a peculiar trend of induction, with ALE peaking at 48 h after stimulation, and RIS and IBA at 24 h after stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). Electron microscopy on MCF-7 cells showed a marked effect of N-BPs on protrusions and lamellipodia/filopodia, where the parallel organization of the microtubules was replaced by a totally irregular one (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Under basal conditions, the MCF-7 cell cytoplasm showed a system of regularly arranged microtubules running parallel to each other, with close bundle formation at the level of lamellipodial protrusions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>, top panels). After ALE treatment, dramatic tubulin involvement was evident since microtubules were markedly reduced in number and showed structural alterations such as irregularly wavy course and abrupt breakdowns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>, top right). In addition, the concurrent presence of a lot of filamentous structures together with decoration by colloidal gold particles detectable after anti-tubulin antibody immunogold labeling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>, bottom right) was visible. This completely new finding could be correlated to the effect that N-BPs have on TBCB. Preliminary experiments with nocodazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] suggested that N-BPs may affect microtubule dynamics (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Effect of N-BPs on microtubule structure. <bold>(a) </bold>Effect of N-BP treatment on TBCB expression levels.

It has been previously shown that these drugs inhibit the growth of various cancer cell lines through a similar mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To assess the contribution of FPPS inhibition on the increase of DBF4 and TBCB protein levels, we performed rescue experiments with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) in MCF-7 cells. Cells were grown with 10<sup>-4 </sup>M ALE for 48 h and the accumulation of unprenylated Rap1A was used as a marker for the inhibition of the pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

Interestingly, while the ALE-induced increase of DBF4 was reversed by simultaneous addition of 25 &#x003bc;M of GGPP, the increase in TBCB remained unaffected by GGPP treatment, suggesting that different pathways are involved in the N-BP-induced upregulation of DBF4 (mevalonate-dependent) and TBCB (mevalonate-independent).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>N-BP-induced accumulation of unprenylated Rap1A and increase of DBF4, but not of TBCB, can be reversed by GGPP.

Furthermore, several <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies have reported the ability of N-BPs to exert a direct anti-tumor effect on cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The actions of N-BPs on tumor cell lines include the promotion of apoptosis and the inhibition of cellular adhesion and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, besides the established inhibition of protein prenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], little is known about other potential mechanisms involved in N-BP-induced toxicity. In recent years, with the emerging field of chemogenomics, several large scale efforts have been made to efficiently identify new therapeutic targets. In this work we used the 'haploinsufficiency profiling approach', pioneered in yeast by Giaever and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], in order to identify secondary targets of N-BPs. <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>is very versatile and easily managed and several high-throughput tools are in place for this it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, over 30% of human genes involved in diseases have a homolog in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], making it an ideal experimental system to open new promising perspectives for translational medicine. We carried out a series of competition experiments with a barcoded collection of 5,936 hemizygous mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] in the presence of ALE, IBA and RIS in order to identify potential drug targets and gain insight into the molecular changes occurring in cells exposed to such drugs.</p><p>Interestingly, from our study it emerged that several different molecular players contribute to N-BP-induced toxicity, suggesting that, besides FPPS, which is the primary enzymatic target and was confirmed by our analysis, there are other molecules whose functions or expression levels are altered by the treatment. Moreover, these effectors could help in defining the exact mechanisms at the root of the different degrees of potency observed with each N-BP. Notably, some of the targets we found have already been proposed as molecules affected by N-BPs. First, in the presence of all three drugs, the most compromised yeast strains in the competition experiment were the hemizygous mutants for <italic>MRH1 </italic>and <italic>AST1</italic>, which are related to ATPase-proton pumps. <italic>MRH1</italic>, as a homolog of <italic>HSP30</italic>, has a putative function in the regulation of the expression of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, <italic>PMA1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], while <italic>AST1 </italic>is responsible for its correct targeting onto the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, the product of <italic>PMP1</italic>, a small single-span membrane protein that regulates the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], was also haploinsufficient with IBA. Interestingly, the <italic>PMA1 </italic>hemizygous mutant itself shows no significant haploinsufficient phenotype, suggesting that the regulation of this gene, rather than its genome copy number, is responsible for the pharmacological effects of the N-BPs. Other genes emerged as a consequence of their involvement in N-BP uptake or internalization. As an example, we found that the <italic>RAV1 </italic>hemizygous mutant strain is haploproficient when grown in the presence of N-BPs. <italic>RAV1 </italic>belongs to the RAVE complex, which is responsible for vacuolar acidification via the V-ATPase. Recent experiments in osteoclast cell lines have shown that N-BPs are internalized via endocytosis and that endosomal acidification is required for their translocation into the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our data support this hypothesis; in fact, a deficiency in the acidification of the endocytic vesicles preventing the release of the N-BPs into the cytosol would confer a growth advantage on the cell in the presence of the drugs.</p><p>The 'barcode' technology allowed us to identify two novel biological processes that appeared to be particularly affected by the treatments: DNA damage and cytoskeleton dynamics. DNA damage has been suggested in earlier studies as the cause of the activation of <italic>ATM </italic>and <italic>ATR </italic>after zoledronic acid stimulation, but clear evidence was still missing for other N-BPs with different side chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We have demonstrated for the first time that, in MCF-7 cells, IBA, RIS and ALE are able to cause a significant accumulation of double strand breaks. Among the DNA damage-related genes that emerged from our analysis, we found that encoding the regulatory subunit of the DBF4-Cdc7 complex, which is involved in DNA replication. In our mammalian model, DNA damage is followed by DBF4 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, events that we hypothesized to be the triggers of cell cycle arrest observed in S-phase. Moreover, <italic>DBF4 </italic>seems to be a key player in the mechanisms of N-BPs toxicity, since its downregulation protected the cells from the anti-proliferative effect exerted by the N-BPs. In general, this finding opens the possibility that reverting to a haploproficient phenotype may constitute a mechanism by which cells become resistant to N-BPs. The second detected mechanism related to the N-BPs' effects is microtubules dynamics. In particular, we identified <italic>ALF1</italic>, a regulator of alpha-tubulin folding, whose human homolog is <italic>TBCB</italic>, as the most interesting gene. In MCF-7 cells, we observed a significant upregulation of TBCB protein levels after N-BP treatment and the simultaneous loss of microtubule architecture in sites of active microtubule assembly, such as protrusions. Therefore, <italic>TBCB </italic>upregulation represents a novel mechanism through which N-BPs could affect cellular viability, and further experiments will be performed to define the effects of N-BPs on microtubule-related processes, such as mitotic spindle formation and vesicular transport.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has exploited the heterozygous yeast mutant collection for mode-of-action discovery of secondary targets of N-BPs, the elected drugs for the treatment of bone resorption and cancer-induced bone diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In particular, this work allowed the discovery of two novel biological processes involved in the cytotoxic effects of the N-BPs, DNA damage and microtubule assembly, and, thanks to the 'barcode' approach, these could be linked directly to the responsible genes, <italic>DBF4 </italic>and <italic>TBCB</italic>. In this case, a strong conservation between yeast and mammalian targets was seen, since their involvement was confirmed also in our human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, used as a mammalian model. Neither <italic>DBF4 </italic>nor <italic>TBCB </italic>have been described before as N-BP targets, and these findings may open up new opportunities for the development of new compounds with antitumor activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>All the chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich Co.
