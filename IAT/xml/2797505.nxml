Several chromosomal regions and candidate genes have been implicated in asthma or atopy susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Genome wide association (GWA) studies have been successful in the identification of loci contributing to complex diseases, included asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However a limitation of GWA studies is the high economic cost required. A cost-effective alternative is the use of pooled DNA followed by individual genotyping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this study, we performed a pooling-based GWA for asthma and atopy, with further validation of most promising regions in the individual pooled samples as well as in a second set of cases and controls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Pooling GWA</title><p>In the first stage we conducted a GWA analysis using a DNA-pooling approach. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina HumanHap 300 Whole-Genome Genotyping BeadChip. The genome-wide analysis was conducted in three different sets of pooled samples: (1) subjects with atopy and asthma; (2) subjects with atopy and without asthma, and (3) control subjects with neither asthma nor atopy (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Samples for this analysis were randomly selected from United Kingdom, Spain and Germany cohorts of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Atopy was defined as sensitization (IgE levels &#x0003e;0.35 kU/L) to specific allergens (<italic>D. Pteronyssinus</italic>, cat, timothy grass. or <italic>C. herbarum</italic>). Asthma was defined as the presence of attacks of asthma in the last 12 months or taking currently medication for asthma. All asthmatics subjects had also atopy. For pool construction, DNA samples were diluted and measured twice by double stranded DNA quantification using PicoGreen<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>dsDNA reagent Kit (Invitrogen), and then normalized at 50 ng/&#x003bc;l. After visual inspection in 0.7% alkaline agarose gels, selected DNA samples were pooled in three independent pools of 75 individuals each one. We have controlled the quality of the Illumina genotyping process including a sample from HapMap (GM12873) with known genotype for the panel of 300K markers. We verified the concordance of genotypes with the HapMap database (concordance = 99.91%) and inconsistent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were excluded from the analysis (n = 296, 0.09%). A pool of HapMap (n = 57) subjects were also performed and genotyped to validate the allele frequency estimation. SNPs with a poor performance in the estimation of allele frequency were excluded from the analysis (n = 3271, 1.03%) using a threshold of &#x0003e; 12% of difference, as shown in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], Finally, three replicates of each pool of ECRHS subjects were constructed to account for sampling errors in the analysis.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Population characteristics of asthma and atopy analyzed samples</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center" colspan="3">Pooling Samples</th><th align="center" colspan="3">Replication samples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td align="center"><bold>Control</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Atopy</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Atopic asthma</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Control</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Atopy</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Atopic asthma subsample</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Subjects, n</td><td align="center">75</td><td align="center">75</td><td align="center">75</td><td align="center">222</td><td align="center">429</td><td align="center">198</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Subjects excluded*, n (%)</td><td align="center">14 (19)</td><td align="center">17 (23)</td><td align="center">14 (19)</td><td align="center">47 (21)</td><td align="center">98 (23)</td><td align="center">48 (24)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Age, mean (sd)</td><td align="center">35.87 (6.79)</td><td align="center">32.21 (7.78)</td><td align="center">32.07 (6.95)</td><td align="center">35.36 (7.16)</td><td align="center">33.32 (7.15)</td><td align="center">33.19 (7.14)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Gender</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Males, n (%)</td><td align="center">37 (49)</td><td align="center">38 (51)</td><td align="center">37 (49)</td><td align="center">106 (48)</td><td align="center">205 (48)</td><td align="center">84 (42)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Females, n (%)</td><td align="center">38 (51)</td><td align="center">37 (49)</td><td align="center">38 (51)</td><td align="center">116 (52)</td><td align="center">224 (52)</td><td align="center">114 (58)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Smoking</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Current, n (%)</td><td align="center">19 (25)</td><td align="center">23 (31)</td><td align="center">28 (38)</td><td align="center">56 (25)</td><td align="center">100 (23)</td><td align="center">37 (19)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ex, n (%)</td><td align="center">20 (27)</td><td align="center">18 (24)</td><td align="center">16 (22)</td><td align="center">58 (26)</td><td align="center">96 (22)</td><td align="center">47 (24)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Never, n (%)</td><td align="center">36 (48)</td><td align="center">34 (45)</td><td align="center">30 (41)</td><td align="center">107 (48)</td><td align="center">232 (54)</td><td align="center">114 (58)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Subjects excluded at the individual genotyping (stage 2)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Allele frequencies for each SNP were estimated from pooled samples correcting by the ratio of intensity of both alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Only promising SNPs that were still significant after correction by multiple testing were followed up. Target regions were delimited by non significant SNPs (p &#x0003e; 0.05) upstream and downstream from the SNP significant associated after multiple testing corrections in the first stage (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: table S1). Complex regions with genomic structural variants were discarded for this study (chr 1 and chr 5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. For the saturation we used a tag SNP approach forcing the inclusion of the polymorphisms detected in the first stage, or their perfect tags (r<sup>2 </sup>&#x02265; 0.8). From the HapMap project data set, we utilized genotypes from the public release 21a (phase II; NCBI35, dbSNPb125) corresponding to 90 individuals from the CEPH 30 trios of European descent. The selection of tag SNPs was performed using the pair-tagging strategy implemented in Haploview software (v.4.0) with a MAF &#x02265; 0.05 and an r<sup>2 </sup>&#x02265; 0.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

We identified <italic>SGK493 </italic>as a new potential gene associated to atopy. <italic>MAP3K5, COL18A1 </italic>and <italic>COL29A1 </italic>genes were found to lesser extent associated with atopy.</p><p>The most significant results were observed for <italic>SGK493 </italic>gene, in chromosome 2, with similar results for atopy and for atopic asthma, probably due to sharing predisposing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Significant polymorphisms were located in two different linkage disequilibrium blocks. The first block includes the putative promoter region of <italic>SGK493 </italic>(5' upstream) and the second block covers part of the gene and the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and 3'downstream region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Haplotype based analysis confirmed results obtained in single marker analysis. We could not elucidate which is the functionality of these SNPs and a fine mapping of the region within a more powered sample would be required. We cannot exclude that the functional variant could be tagged by these SNPs and located in another close gene. <italic>SGK493 </italic>gene was identified during the creation of a catalogue of human protein kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], but its particular function is unknown. <italic>SGK493 </italic>could be involved in pathological states as protein kinases mediate most of the signal transduction in eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We reported that <italic>SGK493 </italic>gene is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, however a higher expression on lung and uterus was previously identified by microarray experiment from 73 human tissues <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.gnf.org/">http://biogps.gnf.org/</ext-link>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recently, the knock out of <italic>Sgk493 </italic>(also known as <italic>Pkdcc</italic>) in mouse has been described presenting extreme phenotypes that are not <italic>a priori </italic>related with atopy or asthma. The knock out mice showed abnormal respiration and died within a day possibly due to cleft palate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Another kinase <italic>MAP3K5 </italic>was also related to atopy as well as atopic asthma in this study. <italic>MAP3K5 </italic>encodes for a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family that regulates the activation of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP1) in leukotriene D (4) (LTD(4)) stimulated airway smooth muscle cells and in nitric oxygen (NO) stimulated bronchial epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. AP1 play a role in the production of airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Polymorphisms in <italic>COL18A1 </italic>and <italic>COL29A1 </italic>were not consistently replicated. The <italic>COL18A1 </italic>polymorphism shown to be significantly associated with atopy in the pooling sample is located at the 3' coding region of the gene. <italic>COL18A1 </italic>encodes a protein expressed in epithelial and endothelial basement membranes, involved in regulation of angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The <italic>COL29A1 </italic>polymorphism was previously found to be associated with atopic dermatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Finally, a region situated in chromosome 8, which contains a predicted gene (NT_007995.50), was also analyzed in detail. Nominally associations were observed in the pooling sample for atopy, but they were not replicated.</p><p>Signals described in previous GWA for atopy, asthma and related phenotypes have not been detected in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The lack of replication of the GWA results can be caused by differences in the definition used to classify affected individuals, genetic coverage of the genome and the p value threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In particular, the region detected by Moffatt et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] on chromosome 17 has been associated with childhood onset asthma, while in this study the asthmatic individuals were selected independently of their asthma onset. We have not detected the <italic>FCER1A </italic>region identified by Weidinger et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] for atopy, but a different genotyping platform was used.</p><p>Despite significant replication values of most promising SNPs found in the GWA in pooled DNA, we acknowledge some limitations as the lack of replication for some of the loci identified in the pooling based analysis. Non-replication of the initial findings is a common feature of the initial findings in GWA studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], mainly due to heterogeneity in the aetiology of the disease and biases. In addition, the impossibility of detection and adjustment by potential confounders in the analysis of DNA pooling could produce the inconsistencies observed.</p><p>Another of the main limitation is the sample size for pool construction and replication. Regarding DNA pooling, the method for measure allele frequency differences corrects by the number of subjects included in each pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. After this correction we obtained some signals at very low p-values, which reinforce the strength of these results. Given limited sample, our study was able to detect variants with larger effects in this population and probably other variants with smaller effects would not be detected. False positives are controlled in the replication phase by individual analysis. Other pooling strategies such as use of different sub-samples of pools would allow capture more biological variation. We acknowledge that with having larger pools we may be losing positive signals but we consider this as a less crucial issue for this analysis. Power calculation shows that replication sample was powered to detect reported associations given the parameters observed in the analysis of individual pooling data (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: table S3). For this reason, some of the results were replicated and significance for a SNP in <italic>SGK493 </italic>reaches Bonferroni level. Although this type of correction by multiple testing is over-conservative and induces false negatives, it is a good indicator of the significance level. In addition to the significance level, some of the results were replicated in the additional sample and replication is considered essential to establish the validity of associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Finally, another limitation is the small number of regions analyzed in detail in the individual analysis. We discarded complex regions with segmental duplications and putative insertions or deletions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] because their complexity could <italic>a priori </italic>result in reducing power to detect associations due to non-classical inheritance patterns of markers located on them. In contrast, disease definition is a positive feature of this study since it is highly homogeneous among patients derived from different ECHRS centre, and this is a keystone for valid inferences in association studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we identified a region related to atopy on chromosome 2p21 that contains <italic>SGK493 </italic>gene. A non-synonymous SNP in <italic>COL18A1</italic>, intronic variants in <italic>MAP3K5 </italic>and a polymorphism in <italic>COL29A1</italic>, previously related to atopic dermatitis, were also associated with atopy, but not consistently replicated.
