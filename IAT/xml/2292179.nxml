As the disease progresses there are well-documented structural and phenotypic changes in the airways that have been termed 'airway remodeling'. These structural changes include epithelial damage, goblet cell metaplasia in the airway epithelium, subepithelial fibrosis in the lamina reticularis, smooth muscle cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy, and hyperemia. It is generally thought that these structural changes are the result of inflammation and airway injury and contribute to the chronic progression of the disease. Therapies using corticosteroids and &#x003b2;2 agonists alleviate inflammation and improve pulmonary airflow in mild to moderate asthma; however, their efficacy in reversing structural remodeling in the airways of chronic asthmatics has been limited leading to an impaired quality of life, significant airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and decline in lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying these airway structural changes are complex, and only partially understood.</p><p>The role of the epithelium in orchestrating subepithelial structural changes in asthma is of keen interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In embryogenesis, the epithelium can dictate mesenchymal differentiation and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In asthma, the epithelium is injured in a repetitive fashion, and also exposed to chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The result is an altered phenotype which may modulate subepithelial tissue differentiation and growth by influencing the phenotype of numerous neighboring cells including the fibroblast, endothelial cell, and smooth muscle cell through the secretion of various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, most forms of asthma are characterized by abundant Th2 cytokine secretion (e.g IL-4, 5, 9 and, in particular, IL-13), and the over-expression of these cytokines in transgenic mouse models has been shown to reproduce numerous features of asthma including subepithelial fibrosis.</p><p>In separate and isolated experiments, it is known that 1) mechanical perturbations and Th2-type cytokine exposure (e.g., IL-13) to the bronchial epithelium can cause the release of profibrotic factors (e.g., TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and induce goblet cell metaplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; and 2) that exogenous TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>stimulates collagen production and secretion from fibroblasts. However, it is not known whether IL-13 can induce phenotypic changes in the airway epithelium which result in TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>secretion at levels that impact collagen secretion and the bulk properties (e.g., optical) of the subepithelial matrix. Furthermore, the ability and time course of the airway epithelium to recover from a repeated inflammatory insult and return to a baseline phenotype has not been described. Finally, over expression of IL-13 has also been implicated in the development of other fibrotic diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. An impaired signaling between the epithelium and stroma has been suggested, however these mechanisms are only partially understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that phenotypic changes induced by IL-13 create an epithelium that is profibrotic; that is, an IL-13-treated epithelium could secrete soluble mediators in a continuous fashion to induce changes in a subepithelial fibroblast-embedded matrix consistent with fibrosis, but in the absence of the Th2 cytokine. Using a co-culture model of fully mucociliary-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells and normal human lung fibroblasts embedded in a collagen gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we found that prolonged (14 days) exposure to IL-13 during the differentiation phase induced an increase in MUC5AC expression which persisted for up to seven days following withdrawal of IL-13. Furthermore, this altered epithelial phenotype stimulated soluble collagen release in the media, increased deposition of salt soluble collagen in the matrix, and enhanced the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal from fibrillar collagen in the subepithelial matrix. The enhanced collagen content and changes in the optical properties are due, in part, to the continuous secretion of epithelial-derived TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the return to a baseline phenotype of the airway epithelium was observed following withdrawal of IL-13 for a period of ten days, demonstrating plasticity of the airway epithelial phenotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Recombinant human IL-13 (Cat # 213-IL), TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>(Cat # 302-B2), and polyclonal goat TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>neutralizing antibody (Cat # AB-112-NA) were purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

Cells were thawed and passaged twice in T-75 cm<sup>2 </sup>flasks (Corning, Fisher) in a 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% air incubator in bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM) supplemented with growth factors supplied in the SingleQuot<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>kit (Lonza).

The NHLF were seeded in 1.7 mg/ml rat-tail tendon collagen 1 (Collaborative, Bedford, MA), 5&#x000d7; DMEM (Gibco, Invitrogen) and 10&#x000d7; reconstitution buffer (25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 mM HEPES, and 5 mM NaOH). 800 &#x003bc;l aliquots of the mixture containing 25,000 cells per ml were pipetted into 12 well plates, and some into glass bottom plates specially designed for Confocal microscopy (Mattek Corp.). The collagen mixture was then non-covalently crosslinked in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, after which 1 ml of 50:50 media was added to each well.</p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> describes the different experimental conditions schematically. After the 14 days treatment with varying IL-13 concentrations, in one group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), IL-13 media is withdrawn (removed) at day 21. At day 22, some of these Transwells<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>were moved to new 12 well plates and co-cultured with NHLF embedded in rat tail collagen gels for 3 days (days 22&#x02013;25) in 50:50 media without IL-13, with/without TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>neutralizing antibody or goat IgG control. In a second group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), the IL-13 media was withdrawn at day 21 and cultured in 50:50 media without IL-13 until day 28, and then co-cultured with NHLF embedded rat tail collagen gels for 3 days (days 28&#x02013;31), with/without TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>neutralizing antibody or goat IgG control. A third group served as the control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), where the co-cultures were performed at the same time points, but the cells were never exposed to IL-13. A final condition consisted of NHLF-embedded collagen gels alone (not co-cultured with NHBE) with 1 ml of 50:50 media on top, and is referred to as "NHLF only". Media was collected from all conditions and stored at -80&#x000b0;C for active and total TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>analysis by ELISA. A critical feature of the study design is treatment of the NHBE with IL-13 for 14 days followed by withdrawal and subsequent culture in the absence of IL-13 all throughout the withdrawal and 'co-culture with NHLF' periods.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Protocol for IL-13 treatment and withdrawal.</bold> NHBE cells are seeded on Transwells<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>as described in the <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>, treatment with IL-13 followed by its withdrawal is carried out as shown.

At the start of the experiment for extracting salt soluble collagen, 0.05 M Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 M NaCl with 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma) was added to the gels. A ratio of 5 volumes of solvent to wet tissue weight was used. The sample was then stirred overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.

Furthermore, other fibrotic diseases in the lungs (e.g., IPF) share similar characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Mechanisms linking these features of the disease are only partially understood. Our study demonstrates that a prominent TH2-type inflammatory mediator, IL-13, can alter the differentiated phenotypic features of the epithelium. Furthermore, the altered epithelium alone (i.e., in the absence of IL-13) secretes biologically significant TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>levels, which stimulates features of fibrosis (e.g., collagen secretion) in the subepithelial matrix and alters the bulk optical properties of the matrix. In addition, following extended withdrawal of IL-13, the epithelium is capable of reverting back to its baseline phenotype.</p><p>The inflammatory process in asthma has a prominent allergic component which involves Th2-type cytokines including interleukin(IL)-4, -5 and -13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Both in vivo and in vitro model systems have been employed to determine the role of IL-13 in modulating features of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In vivo, transgenic mice which selectively over express IL-13 or mice which do not express IL-13 have been used to demonstrate critical roles of IL-13 in airway hyperresponsivness, fibrosis, and mucus cell metaplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, the source of IL-13 leading to these findings cannot be isolated as multiple cells types are capable of producing IL-13. IL-13 mediated changes to the bronchial epithelium could be paracrine (Th2 lymphocytes as the source) or autocrine (epithelium as the source) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>In vitro, treatment of the airway epithelium with IL-13 during the differentiation phase has been shown to stimulate mucus production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and acute (48 hours) treatment of the epithelium with IL-13 can stimulate the release TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Both of these observations are consistent with our results. Nonetheless, the biological consequence(s) of these IL-13-induced changes to the epithelium have not been described.</p><p>The current study demonstrates that chronic treatment of the epithelium with IL-13 during the differentiation phase results in enhanced MUC5AC expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>), reduced &#x003b2;-Tubulin-IV expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, D</xref>) and elevated TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>secretion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;D</xref>). These changes are observed for up to seven days following withdrawal of the IL-13. When the IL-13 pre-treated epithelium was co-cultured with a fibroblast-embedded collagen gel in the absence of IL-13 at day 25, the IL-13 concentration dependent increase in MUC5AC was maintained but not at day 31. However, the down regulation of &#x003b2;-Tubulin-IV expression with increasing IL-13 concentration was suppressed during the co-culture with fibroblasts at day 25, and this trend was also observed at day 31. While we did not pursue the mechanism of this observation at this time, it seems clear that the fibroblasts influence the epithelium through as yet unidentified mediators. This observation lends support to co-culture models as they provide unique insight into epithelial and mesenchyme communication.</p><p>Although there is some donor to donor variability, the trends for all these proteins remain the same [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In addition, IL-13 can stimulate cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], which may account for increased levels of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>and MUC5AC, we did not observe a significant increase in cell number on staining nuclei (data not shown). These phenotypic changes are consistent with the loss of ciliated epithelial cells (reduced &#x003b2;-Tubulin-IV), and goblet cell metaplasia (enhanced expression of MUC5AC).</p><p>At day 25, when the IL-13 treated epithelium was co-cultured with a fibroblast-embedded collagen gel in the absence of IL-13, the fibroblasts increased both the secretion of soluble collagen in the media and matrix (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;B</xref>), and the second harmonic generated signal in the extracellular matrix (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C&#x02013;D</xref>). Upon incubation with a TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>neutralizing antibody this increase is abolished suggesting that biologically relevant levels of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>levels are continuously secreted by the epithelium. Furthermore, at day 31 when the levels of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>are the same in the treated and untreated NHBE co-cultures, there is no increase in collagen content in the media or matrix condition nor were there any differences in the SHG signals.</p><p>Thickening of the reticular layer in asthma has been termed subepithelial fibrosis, and is due to deposition of fibrillar collagens (types I, III, and V), tenascin C, and fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The Sircol collagen assay is a quantitative dye-binding method that can measure collagens from type I-V in a soluble form. Only newly secreted collagen into the matrix is soluble. Over time, collagen becomes insoluble due to intermolecular crosslinking. Our results demonstrate at day 25 that soluble collagen levels are elevated when the fibroblast-embedded collagen gel is co-cultured with the airway epithelium compared to levels without co-culture, and an additional increase when the airway epithelium has been differentiated in the presence of IL-13. This observation is consistent with enhanced collagen secretion by the fibroblasts due to soluble mediators produced by the airway epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It has been shown that IL-13 can induce the secretion of matrix metalloproteases that could potentially degrade the rat-tail collagen gels. We tested this possibility by taking the media at day 25 and day 31 from the varying concentration IL-13 pretreated NHBE-NHLF co-culture conditions and exposing it to acellular collagen gels for 3 days. We did not observe a significant change in the levels of collagen in the media before and after exposure to the gels (data not shown), suggesting that, although IL-13 may induce secretion of matrix metalloproteases, the type or magnitude did not impact or degrade the rat tail collagen in our system.</p><p>In addition to the Sircol soluble collagen assay, we quantified structural changes in the matrix using multiphoton microscopy and second harmonic generation (SHG). SHG in the extracellular matrix is specific to fibrillar collagen, and is generated by non-linear interactions of the near-infrared light with the non-centrosymmetric features of collagen. SHG is largely forward propagated from collagen fibers at exactly 1/2 the wavelength of the excitation wavelength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In our experiment, we utilized an excitation wavelength of 780 nm, and detected the subsequently backward scattered SHG signal (390 nm) from collagen using a narrow bandpass filter (380&#x02013;400 nm) in an epiconfiguration. The intensity of the SHG signal is a positive function of the concentration of collagen, but can also increase when the organization of collagen at secondary and tertiary levels increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, at day 25 our observation of an enhanced SHG signal in the extracellular matrix following co-culture of the airway epithelium with the fibroblast-embedded collagen gel is consistent with either an increased amount of collagen, and/or an increased organization of the collagen.</p><p>We hypothesized that the increase in collagen secretion and the enhanced SHG signal from the matrix was due, in part, to epithelial-derived TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>. TGF-&#x003b2; has three isoforms (TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>) in mammalian systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and are pleiotropic mediators of cell growth and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. All three isoforms are present in the lungs, can be produced by epithelial cells, and have been shown to contribute to fibrosis. For example, our group has recently demonstrated that scrape-injured airway epithelial cells release active TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>at concentrations similar to the current study (50&#x02013;100 pg/ml), and that the epithelial-derived TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>enhances the SHG signal from an underlying fibroblast-embedded collagen gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Moreover, relatively small deviations (i.e., 30&#x02013;50 pg/ml) above or below the basal production of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, that are similar in magnitude observed in our study, result in altered SHG from the matrix suggesting that tight regulation of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>is required for normal matrix homeostasis. Similarly, it has been shown that compression of airway epithelial cells stimulates collagen secretion from fibroblasts in co-culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], as well as TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The role of biologically relevant epithelial-derived TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>in subepithelial fibrosis is also strongly supported by our observation that a neutralizing antibody negates the observed increases in collagen secretion and SHG, and that addition of exogenous active TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>) at concentrations observed in the media reproduces the increase in collagen secretion.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>was measured in the media in our co-culture model (60&#x02013;70 pg/ml, data not shown), but the concentration was not impacted by IL-13 treatment or co-culture. Transgenic mice bred to over express IL-13 demonstrate tissue fibrosis and stimulate TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>production. Although the major source of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>in the mouse model are macrophages, alveolar epithelial cells, and eosinophils, we cannot rule out the role of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>in subepithelial fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Finally, the normal human bronchial epithelial cells are commercially (Lonza) purchased primary cells from normal human healthy and non-smoking individuals who are tested and found non-reactive by an FDA approved method for the presence of HIV-1 and other viruses. The asthmatic airway epithelium in vivo displays signs of structural damage, it is more susceptible to oxidant-induced apoptosis and has marked mucus metaplasia. It is widely accepted that the epithelium in asthmatics is biochemically abnormal due to its ability to release greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and express elevated levels of transcription factors both in vivo and following in vitro culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Thus, the asthmatic airway epithelium may respond differently to IL-13 than the normal airway epithelium; nonetheless, the current study forms the basis for observing similar endpoints in future studies using asthmatic epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>IL-13 enhances MUC5AC expression and TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>secretion, and decreases &#x003b2;-Tubulin-IV expression in the airway epithelium when present during the 14-day differentiation phase at an air-liquid interface. The altered phenotypic features of the airway epithelium in vitro are consistent with those observed in asthma. Co-culturing this altered epithelial phenotype with a lung fibroblast-embedded collagen gel in the absence of IL-13 results in enhanced collagen secretion and second harmonic generation signal from the extracellular matrix, both of which are dependent on biologically significant levels of epithelial-derived TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>. However, upon withdrawal for a period of ten days, the levels of MUC5AC, &#x003b2;-Tubulin-IV and TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>secretion are similar in the treated and untreated case indicating plasticity of the cultured airway epithelium, and its ability to return to a baseline phenotype. We conclude that IL-13 may contribute to subepithelial fibrosis in asthma by stimulating the continuous release TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>from the airway epithelium.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NKM designed, planned, and performed all of the experiments, and wrote the manuscript; JDM performed some initial studies regarding NHBE culture and IL-13 exposure; CBR and BTD assisted with the design and interpretation of multiphoton microscopy and SHG imaging; and SCG provided overall guidance for the study, assisted in the experimental design, analysis and interpretation of the data, and writing of the manuscript.
