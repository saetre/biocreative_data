Here, we show that the proliferative potential of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes is powerfully stimulated by the sustained activation of the Notch pathway. We found that Notch1 is expressed in proliferating ventricular immature cardiac myocytes (ICMs) both in vitro and in vivo, and that the number of Notch1-positive cells in the heart declines with age. Notch1 expression in ICMs paralleled the expression of its Jagged1 ligand on non-myocyte supporting cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling in ICMs blocked their proliferation and induced apoptosis; in contrast, its activation by Jagged1 or by the constitutive expression of its activated form using an adeno-associated virus markedly stimulated proliferative signaling and promoted ICM expansion. Maintenance or reactivation of Notch signaling in cardiac myocytes might represent an interesting target for innovative regenerative therapy.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: AAV, adeno-associated virus; CKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; DAPT, <italic>N</italic>-(<italic>N</italic>-[3,5-difluorophenacetyl]-L-alanyl)-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester; Fc, fragment crystallizable; HES, hairy and enhancer of split; ICD, intracellular domain; ICM, immature cardiac myocyte; PI, propidium iodide; rFc-sJ1, recombinant Fc-fused soluble Jagged1; sJ1, soluble Jagged1.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The Notch signaling pathway plays a key role at multiple steps of morphogenesis during embryonic development as well as in a wide variety of processes during adult life. In particular, Notch activation appears to finely tune the balance between proliferation and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells in several different settings, including hematopoietic and nervous systems, skin, gut, and heart (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiba, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hurlbut et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nemir and Pedrazzini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niessen and Karsan, 2008</xref>). Physiological activation of Notch signaling requires cell&#x02013;cell contact and occurs through binding of the Notch receptor to one of its ligands (Delta and Jagged in vertebrates and Serrate in invertebrates) followed by the proteolytic release of the intracellular domain (ICD) of Notch (Notch-ICD) and its translocation into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Strooper et al., 1999</xref>). Once inside the nucleus, Notch-ICD interacts with transcription regulators of the CSL family (CBF1, Su(H), and Lag-1), triggering the activation of genes of the hairy and enhancer of split (HES) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jarriault et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iso et al., 2003</xref>). Experimental evidence obtained in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, zebrafish, chicken, and mammals has demonstrated that Notch signaling controls mesodermal commitment, including cardiogenic differentiation, during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rones et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loomes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rutenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Monte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grego-Bessa et al., 2007</xref>). Of interest, mice lacking the genes encoding either Notch receptors or their ligands show early embryonic lethality, which is mainly the consequence of cardiovascular abnormalities. This observation supports the notion that the Notch pathway essentially participates in the process of cardiac and vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gridley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gridley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shawber and Kitajewski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Monte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grego-Bessa et al., 2007</xref>). Several other observations also favor this conclusion. In humans, the Alagille syndrome, a congenital disorder associated with heart abnormalities, has been linked to haploinsufficiency of Jagged1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McElhinney et al., 2002</xref>). In mice, combined haploinsufficiency of Jagged1 and Notch2 results in cardiac defects reminiscent of this syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCright et al., 2002</xref>). The Notch signaling pathway also appears to be involved in cardiac valve development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Timmerman et al., 2004</xref>): in humans, heterozygous mutations disrupt normal development of the aortic and, occasionally, mitral valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garg et al., 2005</xref>). Although these models demonstrate the importance of Notch in heart development, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Notch function in this district.</p><p>The emerging concept that the heart is not a postmitotic organ but rather a dynamic tissue maintained by a balance between cell death and cardiomyocyte differentiation from precursor cells implies the existence of a pool of resident stem cells able to trigger heart repair and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kajstura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hierlihy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltrami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsuura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Messina et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laugwitz et al., 2005</xref>). The understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling cardiac precursor cell proliferation and differentiation appears of paramount interest with regard to exploiting this information to promote cardiac regeneration in adults.</p><p>In this paper, we show that the proliferative potential of immature cardiac myocytes (ICMs) is powerfully stimulated by the sustained activation of the Notch pathway. We found that Notch1 was highly expressed in early neonatal proliferating cardiomyocytes and that its activation protected these cells from apoptosis; the ligand Jagged1 was instead mainly detectable in non-myocyte cardiac stromal cells. The levels of expression of Notch1 were found to decline together with the loss of the cardiomyocyte proliferative potential, both in vitro and in vivo; consistent with this observation, the sustained activation of Notch1 determined a remarkable expansion of cardiac cells in vitro. Similar to the role of the Notch pathway in preserving progenitor cells in other tissues, these results indicate that immature, still proliferating cardiomyocytes rely on Notch1 activity for cell renewal, thus raising the exciting the possibility that the forced activation of this pathway might lead to the expansion of the pool of poorly differentiated, committed cardiac cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The number of Notch1-positive, BrdU-positive cardiomyocytes in vivo declines with age</title><p>We started by analyzing the number of cycling cells in neonatal and adult rat hearts. For this purpose, animals at birth and at 9 mo of age (adults) were treated with BrdU, and after 1 wk, the presence of cells that had incorporated the nucleotide analogue was assessed by immunofluorescence. In agreement with published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang and Koh, 1997</xref>), &#x0003e;30% of nuclei of the &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;positive neonatal cardiomyocytes scored positive for BrdU incorporation, whereas &#x0003c;3% of cells had incorporated BrdU in the adult hearts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>, for representative images at different magnifications; and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> for quantification). To confirm the cardiac lineage specificity of the proliferating cells, double labeling with the cardiomyocyte-specific nuclear marker GATA-4 and BrdU was performed on heart sections of neonatal rats. In agreement with the &#x003b1;-actinin stainings, the nuclei of several proliferating cells scored positive for both GATA-4 and BrdU (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). To further confirm these findings, heart sections from neonatal and adult animals were stained with an antibody against cyclin A, a G1/S marker that is only expressed in proliferating cells. A large number (&#x0223c;30%) of nuclei in the neonatal hearts scored positive for this antibody. In sharp contrast, many fewer cells (&#x0003c;3%) were detected in adult hearts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref> for representative images and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref> for quantification). Of interest, we noticed that the neonatal hearts also contained a large number of &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;positive cells that were positive for the expression of the Notch1 receptor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). When these neonatal hearts were stained for both BrdU incorporation and Notch1 expression, several of the BrdU-positive cells were found to express Notch1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>) and, in particular, its activated intracellular form detected by an antibody against Val1744 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Upon quantification, &#x0223c;19% of nuclei in the neonatal hearts were found to be double-positive for both BrdU and Notch1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In both neonatal and adult hearts, Jagged1 was not detectable in mature cardiomyocytes, whereas its expression was confined to patchy areas of &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;negative cells and the endothelial surface lining cardiac muscle fibers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 L</xref> and not depicted).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The number of Notch1-positive, BrdU-positive cardiomyocytes in vivo declines with age.</bold> (A) Low (top)- and high (bottom)-magnification representative images of heart sections from newborn rats, immunostained for BrdU (red) and &#x003b1;-actinin (green).

To specifically distinguish between cardiac myocytes and cardiac stromal cells, we obtained cultures highly enriched in &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;positive cardiomyocytes by three subsequent sub-plating steps (&#x0003e;90% purity; see Materials and methods) along with cultures of &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;negative stromal cells (&#x0003c;1% &#x003b1;-actinin positivity). Both cultures were maintained for 7&#x02013;14 d. In the cardiac myocytes cultures, after 24 h, cells were small, had a rounded shape, and expressed poorly organized &#x003b1;-actinin; we refer to these myocytes as ICMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, day 1). During the first week of culture, ICMs progressed along their differentiation by increasing in size and showed progressively more organized sarcomers; from day 3, mature cardiomyocytes started beating. At all time points, including day 1, the cells were positive for &#x003b1;-actinin and Nkx2.5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>), which is indicative of their committed cardiomyocyte identity. About 5% of the day-1 immature ICMs scored positive for BrdU incorporation; this percentage decreased to &#x0223c;2% and &#x0223c;1.4% at days 3 and 7 after plating (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> for representative images and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref> for quantification). Consistent with the BrdU incorporation results, when the distribution of cardiomyocytes in the different phases of the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry after propidium iodide (PI) staining, the percentage of cells in the G1 and S phases was found to progressively decrease along with cardiomyocyte differentiation in favor of a G2/M-specific profile (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). This result is in agreement with analogous findings presented in the accompanying manuscript by Campa et al. (see p. <related-article related-article-type="article-reference" vol="183" page="129" id="N0x1f87a90N0x42d98e0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="18838555" ext-link-type="pubmed">129</related-article> of this issue). At days 1, 3, and 7 after plating, the levels of expression of individual genes in the Notch pathway were assessed by transcript-specific RT-PCR in both purified cardiomyocyte and stromal cell cultures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). At day 1, ICMs expressed high levels of Notch1, whereas Notch2 was barely detectable; the levels of Notch1 appeared to progressively decrease along cardiomyocyte differentiation and became almost undetectable at day 7. In a reciprocal fashion, the levels of Jagged1 in cardiomyocytes progressively increased with time; Jagged2 and Delta1 were not detected at any time in these cells. In supporting stromal cells, no expression of Notch1 was detectable at day 1, whereas its levels progressively increased at days 3 and 7. In contrast, at all time points, these cells expressed high levels of Jagged1, Notch2, and its specific downstream effector Hey1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rutenberg et al., 2006</xref>). No significant differences in the expression of the putative target genes of the Notch pathway, such as Hes1-5, Hey1, and Hey2, were observed in immature and fully differentiated cardiomyocytes, as well as in stromal cells, which indicates that regulation of these target genes is also dependent on pathways different from Notch (also see the following paragraph).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Time course of expression of Notch signaling components during cardiomyocyte differentiation.</bold> (A) Representative images of purified neonatal cardiomyocytes stained for &#x003b1;-actinin (green) at different time points in culture.

This transactivation effect was still evident at day 3, although it became almost undetectable in differentiated cardiomyocytes at day 7. A conditioned medium containing the Delta1 ligand had no apparent effect when used under the same conditions (unpublished data). Of interest, the conditioned medium containing sJ1 was even more potent than the two forms of immobilized rFc-sJ1, which is consistent with the possibility that sJ1 might spontaneously cluster on the surface of the target cells by virtue of its interactions with various proteins of the extracellular matrix and cell surface, as already described for other soluble growth factors (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taipale and Keski-Oja, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cool and Nurcombe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guerrini et al., 2007</xref>).

The effect of Notch1 stimulation on cardiomyocyte proliferation was further strengthened by the observation that the forced expression of N1-ICD in cardiomyocytes by AAV8-N1ICD transduction stimulated BrdU incorporation in day-3 and, remarkably, also in day-7 cardiomyocytes (21.1% vs. 2.8% in AAV8-N1ICD vs. AAV-LacZ transduced cardiomyocytes; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>).</p><p>Finally, in contrast to cardiomyocytes, sJ1 did not affect BrdU incorporation in stromal cells at day 1, in keeping with the absence of the Notch1 receptor in these cells at this time point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>). At days 3 and 7, when Notch1 became expressed, the number of cells incorporating BrdU started to increase, although at a level remarkably lower than in early cardiomyocytes (17.2% vs. 11% BrdU-positive stromal cells at day 7 in the presence or absence of sJ1, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Notch1 activation parallels cell cycle protein expression in immature cardiomyocytes</title><p>The levels of several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation were analyzed by immunoblotting in cardiomyocytes at different time points in culture and upon sJ1 stimulation. The arrest in proliferation and decrease in BrdU incorporation over time were found to correlate with the progressive increase of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, and of the Cdt1 inhibitor geminin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wohlschlegel et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with the increase of these factors, the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin A, and cyclin E were significantly lower in cardiomyocytes at days 7 and 14 of culture. These observations reinforce similar findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campa et al. (2008)</xref> on the specific role of cyclin D1 regulation in the cardiomyocyte cell cycle. Remarkably, sJ1 stimulation reversed cell cycle exit at days 1 and 3, whereas it had no effect at later stages. Cardiomyocyte proliferation correlated with the presence of high levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK; conversely, differentiated cells expressed Y705-phosphorylated p-STAT3, a known marker of terminal differentiation in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Androutsellis-Theotokis et al., 2006</xref>). The sensitivity to sJ1 stimulation was strictly dependent on the presence of the Notch1 receptor on cardiomyocytes. At days 1 and 3, both the Notch1 precursor p300 and the cleaved p120 and p110 forms were present, and sJ1 stimulation further increased their levels while inhibiting its own expression (evident at day 3 in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). At days 7 and 14, p300 was undetectable, and its cleaved forms progressively disappeared. In contrast, expression of Jagged1 became detectable and was negatively regulated by sJ1 stimulation in a negative feedback loop. Collectively, these results support the conclusion that Notch activation powerfully stimulates immature cardiac myocyte proliferation and expansion during the early times of culture, whereas it progressively becomes ineffective along the differentiation process and is incapable on its own to promote reentry of differentiated cardiomyocytes into the cell cycle.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Notch1 activation parallels cardiomyocyte proliferation.</bold> (A) sJ1 treatment activates cell cycle&#x02013;related signaling.

The loss of proliferative potential by isolated myocytes parallels the down-regulation of the Notch1 receptor and the progressive expression of Jagged1. On the contrary, we show that the sustained, constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling directly correlates with an increase in ICM proliferation.</p><p>Our results indicate that the multidirectional Notch receptor/ligand signaling paradigm also extends to cardiac cells. According to this paradigm, it can be envisaged that the stromal microenvironment, expressing Jagged1, triggers an inductive signal to ICMs to expand their number, keeping them in a highly proliferative state. This is supported by our observation that activation of Notch signaling by both exogenous soluble ligand stimulation and intracellular AAV-mediated constitutive expression of N1-ICD enhance ICM proliferation, delay newly formed cardiomyocytes from rapid differentiation into mature beating cells (normally within 24 h from plating), and extend their lifespan in culture. However, Notch receptor activation does not revert newly formed cardiomyocytes back into precursor cells but keeps the ICM proliferating window open for a longer time, stimulating their increase in number.</p><p>The early embryonic lethality caused by cardiovascular defects of mice lacking genes of the Notch signaling cascade strongly supports a key function for Notch in the process of cardiac and vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loomes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rones et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loomes et al., 2002</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">High and Epstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niessen and Karsan, 2008</xref>). Indeed, Notch signaling has been found to exert a suppressive role during myocardial specification in several different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rones et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han and Bodmer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chau et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with these findings, several in vitro studies have also implied a suppressive role of Notch on mesodermal commitment and cardiac differentiation. RBP-J&#x02013;deficient embryonic stem cells show enhanced mesodermal and cardiogenic differentiation, which is likely attributable to the lack of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schroeder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nemir et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schroeder et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, constitutive activation of Notch in mesodermal progenitors blocks cardiomyocyte production in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schroeder et al., 2006</xref>), and forced Notch expression in mesodermal cardiac progenitor cells expressing Mesp1 during development prevents cardiogenesis and results in cardiac abnormalities in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The contradiction between the findings postulating a suppressive role of Notch during early cardiac development and our results, which clearly show that Notch activation is essential to promote ICM proliferation, is only apparent. In fact, Notch signaling is known to be exquisitely sensitive to dosage, developmental timing, and cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that, after mesodermal specification and cardiac commitment, the reactivation of Notch signaling is required to sustain the proliferation of the pool of ICMs still able to undergo mitosis.</p><p>Our results demonstrate the existence, both in vitro and in vivo in neonatal animals, of a pool of N1-ICD&#x02013;positive cells that express early cardiac markers (GATA4 and Nkx2.5) and incorporate BrdU. Loss of the proliferative potential of these cells parallels the progressive disappearance of Notch1, which is consistent with the conclusion that Notch1 might primarily act by preventing terminal differentiation in this expanding proliferating compartment. On the basis of the knowledge currently available on Notch function and our results, we would like to propose the following model (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Although Notch1 is essential to sustain ICM proliferation, its levels progressively decrease in vitro parallel to cardiomyocyte differentiation. This determines a progressive withdrawal of differentiated cardiomyocytes from the cell cycle. By a positive feedback regulation, the Jagged1 ligand starts to be expressed on the surface of these cells. At this point, by a lateral induction mechanism, cardiac myocytes themselves behave as signal-sending cells to their stromal counterparts, the proliferation of which is also sustained at later stages of culture by activation of de novo expressed Notch1 itself. This model is also consistent with the observation that the levels of expression of the Notch antagonist Numb increase as long as the ICM proliferation diminishes, thus inversely correlating with the levels of Notch1. An asymmetrical localization of Numb has been described during embryogenesis, where it is involved in cell fate determination in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rhyu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carmena et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wakamatsu et al., 1999</xref>) and in satellite cell activation during skeletal muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conboy and Rando, 2002</xref>). Moreover, high levels of Notch signaling lead to a reduction of Numb protein, revealing a reciprocal negative regulation between Notch and Numb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman et al., 2006</xref>). Our results indicate that this regulation also occurs in mammalian cardiomyogenesis. Whether Numb expression might also play a role in vivo still remains to be determined. In this respect, however, it is intriguing to notice that Numb-positive progenitor cells have been found in the adult mouse heart, lying in defined interstitial structures reminiscent of stem cell niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Urbanek et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>ICM cells showed shortening of the G1 phase, showed low or undetectable levels of the p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 CKIs and of the Cdt1 inhibitor geminin, and expressed cyclins D1, A, and E, an overall profile that is characteristic of cells with a high replicative turnover. In addition, cell treatment with sJ1 further enhanced these features. In contrast, fully differentiated cardiomyocytes expressed abundant levels of CKIs, whereas the G1/S cyclins became almost undetectable. These features are perfectly in agreement with the observations presented in the accompanying paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campa et al. (2008)</xref>, which shows that the forced activation of Notch2 by ICD gene transfer promotes reentry of cardiomyocytes into the cell cycle but does not bypass a checkpoint that blocks these cells in the G2/M phase.</p><p>Our experiments raise the possibility that the Notch pathway might also mediate the expansion of the pool of ICMs through protection from apoptotic cell death. Indeed, we observed that &#x003b3;-secretase&#x02013;mediated block of Notch signaling in ex vivo cultured ICMs leads to massive cell apoptosis and that this effect is prevented by N1-ICD transduction. In this respect, it is worth noting that the role of Notch signaling in the regulation of apoptosis in other mammalian systems is not univocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mason et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lutolf et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noseda et al., 2004</xref>) and might thus be dependent on the differentiation and proliferation state of the cells.</p><p>Collectively, in this work, we provide the first evidence that activation of the Notch pathway mediates the expansion of a pool of immature still-dividing cardiac myocytes by promoting their proliferation and protecting them from apoptosis. Our results also show that the in vitro treatment of neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures with an sJ1 agonist, although highly successful in expanding ICM proliferation at earlier stages, becomes totally ineffectual when Notch1 is no longer expressed. These observations are contrary to the possibility that treatment with sJ1 might reverse differentiation but prompt its use for the in vitro expansion of the pool of immature, still-proliferating cardiomyocytes. Thus, sJ1 might turn out to be a powerful growth factor able to expand the dividing cardiac precursor cell population when starting with various sources of cardiac stem cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Constructs, cell lines and antibodies</title><p>The insertless pMEXneo and sJ1 constructs, together with stable NIH-3T3 transfectants, were provided by I.

In brief, ventricles from 2&#x02013;3 litters of neonatal Wistar rats were separated from the atria using scissors and then dissociated in CBFHH (calcium and bicarbonate-free Hanks with Hepes) buffer containing 2 mg/ml of trypsin and 20 &#x003bc;g/ml of DNase II. Cells were preplated for 2 h into 100-mm dishes in DME containing 5% defined bovine calf serum (HyClone); stromal cells were then separated from unattached myocytes that were plated at a density of 500 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> into 60-mm dishes (for protein signaling, cytochemistry, RNA, and protein analysis; Falcon), multi-well plates (for biochemical assays; Costar) or multiwell slides coated with 0.2% gelatin (for immunofluorescence staining). For RT-PCR and Western blot analyses, three subsequent 1-h-long preplating steps were performed in order to strongly enrich the cell preparations in cardiomyocytes (&#x0223c;90% purity). For the experiments involving cardiomyocyte transduction using AAV vectors, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, immediately after plating onto 4-well slides coated with 0.2% gelatin at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well, were infected with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup> genome copies per well.
