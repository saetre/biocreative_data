A third group was given 50 &#x003bc;g of a monoclonal anti-mouse IL-5 antibody (TRFK-5) or its vehicle. Animals were subsequently exposed to OVA on five days via airways. Newly produced eosinophils were labelled using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). BrdU<sup>+ </sup>eosinophils and CD34<sup>+ </sup>cell numbers were examined by immunocytochemistry.

The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test was used to determine significant differences between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Anti-IL-9 significantly reduced bone marrow eosinophilia, primarily by decrease of newly produced (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) and mature eosinophils. Anti-IL-9 treatment also reduced blood neutrophil counts, but did not affect BAL neutrophils. Anti-IL-5 was able to reduce eosinophil numbers in all tissue compartments, as well as BrdU<sup>+ </sup>eosinophils and CD34<sup>+ </sup>progenitor cells, and in all instances to a greater extent than anti-IL-9. Also, FACS analysis showed that IL-9 is over-expressed in bone marrow CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells after allergen exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data shows that a single dose of a neutralizing IL-9 antibody is not sufficient to reduce allergen-induced influx of newly produced cells from bone marrow to airways. However, in response to allergen, bone marrow cells over-express IL-9. This data suggest that IL-9 may participate in the regulation of granulocytopoiesis in allergic inflammation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Airway eosinophilic inflammation is a predominant feature of asthma. Eosinophils are believed to be involved in several features of asthma through the release of cationic granule proteins, reactive oxygen radicals, a variety of cytokines and bronchoconstrictive mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The regulation of the eosinophil in asthma is considered to be orchestrated by the Th2-cell, which can release a range of Th2-cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These cytokines regulate eosinophil growth, differentiation and activation.</p><p>IL-9 is another Th2-derived cytokine with pleiotropic biological effects on various types of cells. It acts as a growth factor for T cells, a maturation factor for B cells, and as a proliferation and differentiation factor for mast cells and hematopoietic progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Recently, it has been suggested that IL-9 might play a role in allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Evidence from both murine and human mapping studies shows that IL-9 is a candidate gene for asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, the expression of IL-9 and its receptor is increased in allergic asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It was also shown that eosinophils have the capacity to synthesize and release IL-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Evidence, that <italic>in vitro</italic>, IL-9 prolongs eosinophil survival, as well as IL-5 mediated differentiation and maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], suggests that IL-9 may potentiate eosinophil function <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, locally instilled IL-9 increases eosinophil count in BAL fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, IL-9 transgenic mice were found to display significantly enhanced eosinophilic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Eosinophils develop from CD34<sup>+ </sup>progenitor cells, and it has been suggested that IL-9 alone may upregulate the expression of IL-5 R&#x003b1; on human CD34<sup>+ </sup>cord blood progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Despite increasing evidence, that IL-9 may be involved in allergy, only few studies have been performed using an IL-9 antagonist to test its possible therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of allergic inflammation. Furthermore, the possible regulatory effect of IL-9 on newly produced eosinophils and CD34<sup>+ </sup>progenitor cells has not been documented. In our study, we aimed to examine the effect of a neutralizing monoclonal anti-IL-9 antibody on different tissue compartments <italic>in vivo</italic>, in a model of allergic eosinophilic inflammation, and relate this effect to newly produced eosinophils (labelled with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine; BrdU) and CD34<sup>+ </sup>cells. Furthermore, we compared the effect of anti-IL-9 with that of anti-IL-5.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male Balb/c mice, 5 to 6 weeks old, were obtained from B&#x00026;K Universal AB (Sollentuna, Sweden).

A booster dose of the OVA-Al(OH)<sub>3 </sub>mixture was given on a second occasion, five days after the first injection. Starting eight days after the second sensitization, the animals were briefly anesthetized using aerosolized Isoflurane (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill), and exposed to 100 &#x003bc;g OVA in 25 &#x003bc;l of PBS by intranasal (i.n.) administration on five consecutive days.</p></sec><sec><title>Pretreatment with anti-cytokine antibodies and treatment with BrdU</title><p>Animals were pretreated i.p. with a single dose (100 &#x003bc;g/animal) of purified hamster anti-mouse IL-9 monoclonal antibody (clone D9302C12; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) or its isotype control, purified hamster IgG (clone G235-2356; Pharmingen). In parallel groups, animals were treated either with a single dose (50 &#x003bc;g/animal) of a monoclonal antibody to mouse IL-5 (clone TRFK-5; R&#x00026;D Systems Europe Ltd., Barton Lane, Abingdon, UK) or its isotype control, rat IgG<sub>1 </sub>(clone R3-34; Pharmingen) in 0.5 ml of PBS, 30 min. before the OVA exposure. Secondly, the combined treatment of anti-IL-9 and anti-IL-5 antibodies was tested. Animals were treated with both anti-IL-9 (100 &#x003bc;g/animal) and anti-IL-5 (50 &#x003bc;g/animal), either anti-IL-9 (100 &#x003bc;g/animal) and rat IgG<sub>1 </sub>(50 &#x003bc;g/animal), or anti-IL-5 (50 &#x003bc;g/animal) and purified hamster IgG (100 &#x003bc;g/animal), or both isotype controls together (100 &#x003bc;g of purified hamster IgG and 50 &#x003bc;g of rat IgG<sub>1</sub>). Newly produced inflammatory cells were labelled with a thymidine analogue, 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; Boehringer Mannheim Scandinavia AB, Bromma, Sweden), at a dose of 1 mg in 0.25 ml of PBS i.p. twice (7 h apart) on day one and three of allergen exposure (total dose 4 mg/animal).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell collection and samples processing</title><p>Samples were collected 24 h after the last allergen exposure.

When in adequately deep anaesthesia, the chest was opened and samples of blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) and bone marrow were taken.</p><p>Blood was obtained by penetration of the right ventricle of the heart with a needle. BAL was performed through the trachea with a cannula by instillation of 0.25 and 0.2 ml of ice-cold PBS. BALf of each animal was pooled; approximately 0.4 ml of the instilled fluid was consistently recovered. Finally, one femur was excised and cut at the epiphyses.

The monoclonal anti-IL-9 antibody, given at a dose of 100 &#x003bc;g before allergen exposure, did not significantly reduce allergen-induced airway eosinophilia, but consistently reduced bone marrow eosinophilia, by a reduction of newly produced (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) and mature bone marrow eosinophils. IL-9 was expressed in bone marrow CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells after allergen exposure, which was more pronounced after stimulation of the cells with allergen or PMA+IC. The monoclonal IL-5 antibody, given at a dose of 50 &#x003bc;g before allergen exposure, reduced eosinophil numbers in all tissue compartments, as well as BrdU<sup>+ </sup>eosinophils and CD34<sup>+ </sup>progenitor cells. The effect of anti-IL-5 was significantly greater than the effect of anti-IL-9, and no additive effect of anti-IL-9 was observed beyond the effect of anti-IL-5.</p><p>In our study, the neutralizing anti-IL-9 antibody treatment was given as a single dose administered intraperitoneally in sensitized animals before the allergen exposure. Despite variable effects of IL-9 in <italic>in vitro </italic>studies of allergic cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the treatment with a neutralizing anti-IL-9 antibody <italic>in vivo </italic>in our study did not protect airways from the abundant eosinophilia in BAL, arguing against anti-IL-9 having a potential as an anti-inflammatory treatment in established allergic disease. This result is in contrast with a previous report by Cheng and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], which showed that a polyclonal anti-IL-9 antibody at a dose of 20 &#x003bc;g significantly inhibited airway eosinophilic inflammation. The fact that the antibody used in that study was polyclonal may suggest that the inhibitory effect was not solely dependent on inhibition of IL-9. Treatment with a monoclonal anti-IL-9-antibody during the sensitization process attenuates the development of airway allergic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in mice exposed to allergen at a later time, implying a role of IL-9 in the development of allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, the treatment was given in very high concentration (200 &#x003bc;g) as four doses (total 800 &#x003bc;g/animal) during the sensitization period, which would correspond to very high doses of antibody treatment in a clinical situation. Furthermore, clinical treatment of allergic disease is given to individuals that have already been sensitized to one or several allergens, why any effect of a neutralizing antibody during sensitization is unlikely to be helpful clinically. Importantly, our finding of no or limited inhibitory effect of BAL eosinophilia by anti-IL-9 is in agreement with a report showing that sensitized IL-9KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] respond with normal airway inflammation after allergen exposure.</p><p>Despite the lack of effect of inhibition of airway eosinophilia by anti-IL-9, we consistently observed an inhibitory effect of the treatment on the increase in bone marrow eosinophils after allergen exposure. Airway allergic inflammation is to a great extent the result of the recruitment of newly produced cells from bone marrow via blood under the influence of allergen. Newly produced eosinophils, labeled with BrdU, to a substantial degree contribute to the allergen-induced inflammatory process, which results in an accumulation of eosinophils in the airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Anti-IL-9 treatment significantly decreased the number of mature eosinophils in bone marrow, and reduced newly produced eosinophils (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) in bone marrow as well as in blood. This supports the hypothesis that IL-9 participates in the eosinophilopoiesis and the release of eosinophils from bone marrow to blood. However, the regulatory effect of IL-9 seems to be of a subordinate magnitude compared to IL-5, since the effects induced by neutralization of IL-5 were of a much greater magnitude.</p><p>Eosinophils develop from CD34<sup>+ </sup>progenitor cells that undergo terminal differentiation normally within the bone marrow and primarily under the influence of IL-5, but also with the support of other cytokines. In several animal studies, an increase in the CD34<sup>+ </sup>population is observed in the bone marrow, circulation and airways after the allergen exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], as well as in human studies of atopic subjects, regardless of asthmatic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>IL-9 has shown a capacity to act on hematopoietic progenitors to enhance eosinophil development when added to CD34<sup>+ </sup>cells cultured with a mixture of IL-3 and IL-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In our study <italic>in vivo</italic>, we failed to observe any effect of anti-IL-9 on CD34<sup>+ </sup>cells, and no significant effects were observed on IL-5 levels either in serum or in BALf. However, the anti-IL-5 antibody showed pronounced capacity to reduce an allergen-induced increase in CD34<sup>+ </sup>cells in both bone marrow and BAL. Again, our data therefore suggest that IL-9 has a subordinate role compared to IL-5 in eosinophilopoiesis.</p><p>Lymphocytes, especially circulating lymphocytes, are considered to be the major cellular source of IL-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We found that bone marrow CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells taken from allergen-exposed animals, over-expressed IL-9 after <italic>in vitro </italic>stimulation with OVA or PMA and calcium ionophore. This finding further supports a role of IL-9 in allergen-induced bone marrow responses, especially in enhanced granulocytopoiesis, although the degree of the response and the exact importance remain to be elucidated.</p><p>We also found some degree of reduction of blood neutrophils after allergen exposure in animals treated with anti-IL-9. Primarily, a reduction of BrdU<sup>+ </sup>neutrophils was observed, which may imply a role of IL-9 in the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow. This study was not designed to specifically evaluate the role of IL-9 in neutrophilia, but implies that such studies may be of interest. This is further supported by the finding that IL-9 can induce IL-8 production in a concentration depend manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that even higher doses of the neutralizing monoclonal IL-9 antibody could have been more effective in attenuating eosinophilia. Overall, however, the degree of contribution of IL-9 in allergen-induced airway eosinophilia seems to be much smaller than that of IL-5, since the treatment with the single dose of the anti-IL-5 antibody (50 &#x003bc;g) significantly inhibited bone marrow, blood and airway eosinophilia, but the higher dose of anti-IL-9 (100 &#x003bc;g) was much less effective. Furthermore, the fact that IL-9KO mice respond with similar degree of inflammation after sensitization and allergen exposure as wild type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] further supports a subordinate role of IL-9 in allergen induced airway eosinophilia.</p><p>Taken together, our data indicate that IL-9 may have some degree of regulatory effect on eosinophilia in the bone marrow and blood, perhaps via eosinophilopoiesis, since newly produced eosinophils were reduced in these compartments. However, no inhibitory effect on airway eosinophils was observed after anti-IL-9 treatment, which argues that the development of such a drug will be unsuccessful in treating allergic airway eosinophilia.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>BAL bronchoalveolar lavage</p><p>BrdU 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine</p><p>IC calcium ionophore</p><p>IL interleukin</p><p>i.n.
