We analyzed the spatiotemporal localization of Rab21 in M-CSF-stimulated RAW264 macrophages by the live-cell imaging of fluorescent protein-fused Rab21. It was demonstrated that wild-type Rab21 was transiently associated with macropinosomes. Rab21 was recruited to the macropinosomes after a decrease in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels. Although Rab21 was largely colocalized with Rab5, the recruitment of Rab21 to the macropinosomes lagged a minute behind that of Rab5, and preceded that of Rab7. Then, Rab21 was dissociated from the macropinosomes prior to the accumulation of Lamp1, a late endosomal/lysosomal marker. Our analysis of Rab21 mutants revealed that the GTP-bound mutant, Rab21-Q78L, was recruited to the macropinosomes, similarly to wild-type Rab21. However, the GDP-bound mutant, Rab21-T33N, did not localize on the formed macropinosomes, suggesting that the binding of GTP to Rab21 is required for the proper recruitment of Rab21 onto the macropinosomes. However, neither mutation of Rab21 significantly affected the rate of macropinosome formation. These data indicate that Rab21 is a transient component of early and intermediate stages of macropinocytosis, and probably functions in macropinosome maturation before fusing with lysosomal compartments.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macropinocytosis is a clathrin-independent endocytosis which accounts for the bulk fluid-phase uptake from the extracellular environment, and is an essential aspect of normal cell function.

Owing to this high important physiopathological relevance of macropinocytosis, the regulatory mechanisms of macropinosome formation and maturation have recently been receiving increasing attention.</p><p>Macropinosome formation is initiated by actin-dependent cell-surface membrane ruffling. Then, some membrane ruffles form circular ruffles (macropinocytic cups), and close into macropinosomes, which are large endocytic vacuoles (0.2&#x02013;5 &#x000b5;m), by fission from the plasma membrane. Usually, newly formed macropinosomes gradually mature and finally merge with lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Racoosin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Both phosphoinositides and small GTPases, such as Cdc42, Rac, ARF6 and Rab5, are known to regulate actin polymerization and remodeling in membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Nobes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Lanzetti1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Donaldson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Rab GTPases are key to membrane trafficking that mediates both maturation and vesicle transport through endocytic pathways, including macropinocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Jones1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Racoosin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Zerial1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the actin-dependent process of macropinosome formation is more similar in appearance and regulation to phagocytosis than clathrin-dependent endocytosis, some of the mechanisms in macropinosome maturation are shared with those of the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway. Knowledge about macropinocytosis has increased; nevertheless, the complex regulatory molecular components and signaling pathways of macropinocytosis still require detailed investigation.</p><p>Small GTPases of the Rab family are key to membrane-trafficking events in eukaryotic cells. To date, more than 60 Rab members have been identified in the human genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Stenmark1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Many of the Rab proteins that are localized on distinct compartments have been reported to coordinate sequential steps of membrane transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-SomselRodman1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In the receptor-mediated, clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway, Rab5, Rab7 and Rab11 are localized on distinct endosomal compartments, and function as marker proteins for early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Zerial1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Rab5 regulates membrane traffic into and between early endosomes in clathrin-dependent endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Zerial1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although Rab7 was colocalized with Rab21 on some macropinosomes, the recruitment of Rab21 to the macropinosomes occurred earlier than that of Rab7 to some extent. Moreover, the reduction in Rab21 levels was accompanied by an increased level of Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006689-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006689.s006">Movie S6</xref>).

It is well established that Rab5 mainly localizes on early endosomes and regulates the homotypic fusion of early endosomes by interacting with EEA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Christoforidis1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Simonsen1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, Rab5 is known to have several regulators and effectors such as Rabex-5, Rabaptin-5, Rabenosyn-5 and Rabankyrin-5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Schnatwinkel1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Markgraf1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, although little is known about those of Rab21. The present study revealed that Rab21 and Rab5 showed similar but not identical spatiotemporal dynamics in RAW264 macrophages during macropinocytosis. Recently, Porat-Shiliom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-PoratShliom1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> have shown that Rab5 is recruited to macropinosomes after the loss of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in HeLa cells over-expressing the active mutant of H-Ras (H-RasG12V) which induces membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis. In our study, it was found that Rab21 was largely colocalized with Rab5 on macropinosomes before the accumulation of Lamp1. Moreover, we observed that the loss of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> from the membrane was followed by the recruitment of Rab21 as well as Rab5. These facts imply that Rab21, like its close homologue Rab5, may play a role in regulating macropinocytosis at an early stage.</p><p>However, we observed that the onset of Rab21 recruitment to macropinosomes occurred slightly later than that of Rab5 in cells co-expressing CFP-Rab21 and GFP-Rab5. Intriguingly, while Rab5 recruitment was shown to occur before PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> loss in cells expressing H-RasG12V <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-PoratShliom1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, Rab21 was localized on macropinosomes after the loss of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in RAW264 cells. Since the decrease in PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels occurs shortly after macropinosome formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Araki1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-PoratShliom1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, Rab21 could localize only on internalized macropinosomes. Therefore, it is unlikely that Rab21 is associated with circular ruffles and open macropinocytic cups. In good agreement with these facts, there was no significant alteration in the rate of macropinosome formation in the cells transfected with wild-type Rab21 or either of the mutants as compared to untransfected cells in our study. It has been reported that a dominant negative mutant of Rab5 inhibits the induction of circular ruffles known to be precursor forms of macropinosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Li1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Rab5 is recruited to circular ruffles together with RN-tre, a Rab5 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that mediates actin remodelling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Lanzetti1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, over-expression of Rabankyrin-5, a Rab5 effector, promotes macropinosome formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Schnatwinkel1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, over-expression of inactive Rab21 (GDP-bound mutant) did not inhibit circular ruffle or macropinosome formation in RAW264 cells in our study. Therefore, unlike Rab5, Rab21 seems not to be necessary for macropinosome formation. It is possible that Rab21 may play a unique role in macropinocytosis, although Rab21 shares some characteristics with Rab5.</p><p>Another notable finding in our study is that Rab21 is recruited to the macropinosomes before the accumulation of Rab7 on the membrane. Then, Rab21 and Rab7 are colocalized on the macropinosomes at certain stages. Rab21 is dissociated from them before the acquisition of Lamp1, while Rab7 remains associated with the membrane even after the acquisition of Lamp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Meresse1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Rink1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, it is likely that Rab5, Rab21 and Rab7 are sequentially associated with macropinocytosis to mediate the progressive maturation of the macropinosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006689-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0006689-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006689.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the association of Rab proteins with macropinocytosis.</title><p>Rab5 is localized on the inner membrane of macropinocytic cups and early macropinosomes.

The results presented here demonstrate that the GDP-bound mutant Rab21-T33N mainly localizes in the cytosol and the trans-Golgi network during macropinocytosis, whereas the GTP-bound mutant Rab21-Q78L is associated with macropinosomes, thereby providing evidence that GTP binding is required for Rab21 translocation, as has been found for other Rab proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Zerial1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. These results imply the involvement of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and/or some other interacting proteins in the regulation of Rab21 translocation. An intriguing finding in our study is that the association of Rab21 with macropinosomes is slightly preceded by that of Rab5 and persists even after Rab5 loss. Rab21 and Rab5 are phylogenetically close and have similar interaction partners. For instance, APPL1, which is an effector of Rab5 and present on newly formed macropinosomes, also interacts with Rab21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Zhu1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Zoncu1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, Rabex-5, characterized as a GEF for Rab5, has been shown to have equal GEF activity on Rab21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Delprato1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, Zhang et al. have identified the VPS9-ankyrin-repeat protein (Varp) as a GEF for Rab21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006689-Zhang2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. They demonstrated that Varp preferentially interacts with the GDP-bound form of Rab21 and has a stronger guanine nucleotide exchange activity towards Rab21 than Rab5, leading to the activation and endosomal localization of Rab21. Such specificity and commonality in GEFs and effectors may be reflected in the slightly different temporal localizations between the two Rab proteins. In future studies, the definition of GEFs, GAPs and downstream effectors of Rab21 would be required for understanding the physiological consequences of Rab21 in the sequential activation of Rab proteins during macropinosome maturation.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Rab21 is transiently associated with macropinocytosis at an intermediate stage partially overlapping both the Rab5-acting stage and the Rab7-acting stage, and probably functions in macropinosome maturation rather than macropinosome formation. The macropinocytic pathway is coordinately regulated by several Rab GTPases, creating sequential Rab-effector links that mediate the progressive maturation of the organelles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Bovine serum albumin (BSA), rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC)-dextran (Mr &#x0223c;70,000) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) were obtained from Sigma Chemical (St Louis, MO).
