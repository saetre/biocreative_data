In human breast cancer, the overall duration of estrogen exposure is the most important risk factor for developing estrogen-responsive breast cancer. Accordingly, it has been suggested that estrogen exposure reduces apoptosis through the up-regulation of the anti-apoptosis protein, Bcl-2. Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, regulates apoptosis and plays a crucial role in the development and growth regulation of normal and cancerous cells. Our research interest is to examine the effects of CLA on the induction of apoptosis in human breast tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The localization of Bcl-2 in both normal and cancerous human breast tissues was determined by immunohistochemical staining and the Bcl-2 protein expression was tested by western blot analysis. Co-culture of epithelial cells and stromal cells was carried out in the presence or absence of CLA to evaluate apoptosis in the context of a cell-cell interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results showed that both normal and cancerous breast tissues were positive for Bcl-2 staining, which was higher overall in mammary ducts but very low in the surrounding stromal compartment. Interestingly, by quantifying the western blot data, basal Bcl-2 protein levels were higher in normal breast epithelial cells than in cancerous epithelial cells. Furthermore, treatment with 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) stimulated growth and up-regulated Bcl-2 expression in estrogen responsive breast epithelial cells; however, these carcinogenic effects were diminished by either CLA or 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (Tam) and were suppressed further by the combination of CLA and Tam. In both one cell type cultured and co-culture systems, CLA induced cell apoptosis in ER&#x003b1; transfected MDA-MB-231 cells but not in the wild type MDA-MB-231 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data, therefore, demonstrate that ER&#x003b1; plays important roles in CLA induced apoptosis in human breast tissues.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>CLA is produced by rumen fermentation of linoleic acid and is deposited in the subcutaneous fat and intramuscular fat layer in beef cattle; it also is present in dairy milk fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. There are several CLA isomers in ruminant-produced foods, among them <italic>c</italic>9, <italic>t</italic>11-CLA and <italic>t</italic>10, <italic>c</italic>12-CLA are more potent against tumor cell growth <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, rats fed CLA-enriched butter fat had reduced mammary cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Studies also showed that beef CLA isomers even when associated with other beef fatty acids reduce human cancer cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and beef tallow increases the potency of CLA against mouse mammary tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. CLA studies in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] demonstrated the anti-tumor effect of CLA (I) on angiogenesis by suppression of the predominant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoforms, VEGF 121 and 165, and mRNA expression in a human breast cancer cell line; (II) via up-regulation of the estrogen-regulated cancer suppressor gene, protein tyrosine phosphatase &#x003b3; (PTP&#x003b3;) in human breast cells; and (III) by modulation of prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) signaling in canine mammary cells.</p><p>Potential modulation of apoptosis by anti-cancer agents is of interest for several reasons. Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is thought to play a key role in the development and growth regulation of normal and cancerous cells. Consequently, dysregulation of apoptosis can result in carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The regulation of apoptosis involves a large set of proteins including Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In human breast cancers, about 75% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;) positive. Estrogens cause initiation, promotion, and progression of these tumors. E<sub>2 </sub>is the most abundant circulating endogenous estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the rat model, higher Bcl-2 expression is detected in mammary epithelial cells when animals are treated with E<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The anti-estrogen tamoxifen is the most frequently prescribed drugs for estrogen responsive breast cancer patients and also is recommended for women at high risk of developing breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Tamoxifen therapy generally is well tolerated and leads to prolonged cancer-free survival and decreased mortality even in patients with ER-positive metastatic tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the development of tamoxifen resistance and the incidence of developing endometrial cancer after five-year tamoxifen therapy is a critical issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Updated data from the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial showed that the aromatase inhibitor appeared to be superior to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, aromatase inhibitors cause different side effects compared with those of tamoxifen, and the greater level of the toxicity versus the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors needs to be investigated further [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Health Services Research Committee recommends that patients intolerant to aromatase inhibitors should receive tamoxifen. The concern in using endocrine therapy for chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic purposes guided us to investigate naturally existing compounds in food that possess anticancer activity, such as CLA. Daily consumption of CLA from ruminant-based foods for cancer prevention will be less likely to raise concerns about toxicity. However, more recent data raised the concern about safety issue of CLA. Dietary CLA, mainly <italic>t</italic>10, <italic>c12</italic>-CLA, induced insulin resistance and increased plasma insulin levels in both normal and obesity mice, and more important, similar results have been reported in recent clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that high level of <italic>t</italic>10, <italic>c12</italic>-CLA induced liver steatosis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus use this isomer in the clinical need to be very cautious.</p><p>It has been theorized that the paracrine signals produced by surrounding stromal cells plays a crucial role in modulating malignant epithelial cells progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Studies suggest that CLA is incorporated, stored in stromal cells, and CLA affect cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. CLA and human breast cancer study revealed that dietary CLA intake was associated with the regulation of estrogen receptor expression <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. CLA has been found to reduce the risk of developing an estrogen receptor-negative tumor in premenopausal women, which may lead to a better therapeutic outcome for breast cancer patients as their cancer will be likely responsive to anti-estrogen therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Based on this epidemiological finding, we hypothesize that CLA will exert anti-cancer activities in ER&#x003b1;-positive breast tumors. In this study, we examined the role of ER&#x003b1; in CLA-induced apoptosis in human breast epithelial cells and the possible involvement of apoptotic marker, Bcl-2, on CLA-mediated apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p><italic>t</italic>10, <italic>c</italic>12-CLA (&#x0003e; 98% pure), the CLA isomer used in this study, was purchased from Matreya, Inc.

We first utilized ER&#x003b1;(+) primary cultured normal human breast epithelial cells (ER&#x003b1;(+) NEC) to examine whether CLA also targets this type of cells. The estrogen receptor positivity of the normal breast epithelial cells was determined based on their ER&#x003b1; protein expression.

To examine this speculation, immunohistochemical staining for Bcl-2 expression was performed on 14 normal and 14 cancerous human breast tissue samples. In this study, normal patients were younger (&#x02264; 40 years of age) than cancer patients (&#x0003e; 41 years of age) and based on Allred scoring, all tissue samples were positive for Bcl-2 staining (score = 3) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Bcl-2 expression was localized to cytoplasm and perinuclear area of cells mainly in mammary ductal epithelium with slight staining of stromal cells surrounding the mammary ducts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Under the same magnification, Bcl-2 staining intensity was greater in cancerous tissue compared with normal tissues, which might be due to the larger cytoplasmic volume and larger mammary duct compartment in the malignant samples. To quantify Bcl-2 expression, we isolated epithelial cells and stromal cells from both cancerous and normal breast tissues. Whole cell lysates were electrophoresed and Bcl-2 protein expression was determined by western blot. In agreement with immunohistochemical staining results, Bcl-2 protein was detected in epithelial cells that lined the mammary duct but was very weak in stromal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Interestingly, Bcl-2 expression was higher in primary cultured normal breast epithelial cells (NEC) than in primary cultured cancerous human breast epithelial cells (CAEC) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

Bcl-2 expression was measured by immunohistochemical staining and western blot. CLA treatment decreased E<sub>2</sub>-stimulated Bcl-2 expression in tissues after three days of treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). This was confirmed by quantification of western blot Bcl-2 protein results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Next, we examined whether CLA could potentiate the anti-estrogenic effects of Tam in MCF-7 and ER&#x003b1;(+) CAEC.

Studies have shown that the local micro-environment is crucial for cancer progression, because cancer epithelial cells are surrounded by various types of stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The interaction between epithelial cells and extracellular matrix is important for cells to make life or death decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To address whether stromal cells can alter CLA-induced apoptosis in ER&#x003b1;(+) and ER&#x003b1;(-) cancer epithelial cells, breast cancer epithelial cell lines, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, or MDA-MB-231-ER&#x003b1;, were co-cultured with primary human breast stromal cells isolated from normal (NSC) or cancerous (CASC) tissues. After 7 days of CLA treatment, apoptosis in breast cancer epithelial cell lines were measured by caspase-3/7 activity. Apoptosis of co-cultured MCF-7 cells was not changed in comparison with MCF-7 cells cultured alone. CLA treatment induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells cultured alone and stimulated further apoptosis when these cells were co-cultured with stromal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). A similar pattern of response also was shown in MDA-MB-231-ER&#x003b1; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) but not in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

Furthermore, Bcl-2 expression was decreased in the co-cultured cells treated with CLA.

Estrogens are involved in initiation, promotion, and progression of breast carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It has been shown that CLA exerts little to no inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-231 cells compared to MCF-7 cells suggesting the possible involvement of anti-estrogenic effects of CLA on human breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Using MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with the estrogen responsive element (ERE), Tanmahasamut et al. (2003) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] demonstrated that CLA inhibited the promoter's activity directly through the ERE. More recently, Liu and Sidell (2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] showed that CLA suppressed phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor, which may inhibit receptor-ERE interactions in MCF-7 cells. We examined the anti-estrogenic effects of CLA on MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, ER&#x003b1;(+) NEC and ER&#x003b1;(-) NEC (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). CLA had anti-proliferative effects in MCF-7 and ER&#x003b1;(+) NEC but not in MDA-MB-231 and ER&#x003b1;(-) NEC. Potentiation of Tam by combination with CLA was observed in MCF-7 cells. It was observed that CLA reduced cell proliferation in normal mammary gland but did not induce apoptosis of cells within the terminal end buds and lobular epithelium in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast, CLA induced apoptosis in mammary tumor cells and premalignant rat mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our results showed that although CLA also induced apoptosis in ER&#x003b1;(+) NEC, a greater effect was observed in MCF-7 cells than in ER&#x003b1;(+) NEC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). We speculate that dietary long-term consumption of CLA may have moderate chemopreventive activities in healthy individuals. Furthermore, in breast cancer patients, CLA also might have less of an effect on normal parts of the mammary gland, resulting in a lesser degree of cytotoxicity in these patients.</p><p>To ascertain the role of ER&#x003b1; in the anti-estrogenic effects mediated by CLA, MDA-MB-231-ER&#x003b1; cells (ER&#x003b1; transiently transfected MDA-MB-231) were treated with E<sub>2 </sub>or E<sub>2</sub>+CLA. CLA exerted anti-estrogenic effects in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231-ER&#x003b1; cells but treatment did not induce considerable effects in MDA-MB-231 cells. E<sub>2 </sub>treatment inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231-ER&#x003b1; and CLA counteracted E<sub>2</sub>-induced growth inhibitory effect (unpublished data). According to these and results shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, we expect that the anti-cancer activities of CLA will be more effective in ER&#x003b1;(+) breast cancer patients than those with ER&#x003b1;(-) breast cancers. This might explain epidemiological findings showing that CLA intake may be correlated with reduced risk of having an estrogen receptor negative cancer in premenopausal breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms of the anti-estrogenic effects of CLA</title><p>The carcinogenic effects of estrogens in breast cancer include the stimulation of breast tissue growth and the protection of cells from apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A higher proliferative rate in tumors has been correlated with metastasis, death from neoplasia, low disease-free survival rates, and low overall survival rate in human cancer models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Immunohistochemical staining studies suggested that Bcl-2 expression is linked to hormonal regulation in human breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, several studies showed Bcl-2 protein expression in normal as well as hyperplastic and neoplastic breast epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In agreement with these findings, our results showed that Bcl-2 protein is expressed in both cancerous and normal human breast tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In normal breast tissue samples, 12 out of 14 were from patients under 40 years of age; 10 were diagnosed as macromastia and the remaining four were diagnosed as hypertrophy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Accordingly, we speculate that Bcl-2 may be important to maintain mammary gland function in these normal patients and Bcl-2 may be involved in the occurrence of mammary hypertrophy and mammary macromastia. It has been suggested that cells express Bcl-2 are immature and may be part of the stem-cell subpopulation in normal mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Bcl-2 is important for maintenance and development of normal mammary gland. However, Bcl-2 expression is increased when cell proliferation in tissues is dysregulated in hyperplastic and neoplastic disorders. Bcl-2 localization in normal breast tissue may be related to the origin of malignant breast disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Upon E<sub>2 </sub>stimulation, Bcl-2 protein was increased in ER&#x003b1;(+) normal as well as cancerous human breast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We have observed that CLA also blocks the estrogenic effects of environmental hormones such as Zeranol, a nonsteroidal agent with estrogenic activity used as a growth promoter in the US beef and veal industries (unpublished data). Taken together, the results suggest that CLA is an excellent candidate for prevention and therapy of estrogen responsive breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>CLA blocks the epithelial-stromal interaction in the ER&#x003b1;(+) but not ER&#x003b1;(-) human breast microenvironment</title><p>From experimental cancer models, the extracellular microenvironment has been demonstrated to influence tumor formation, the rate of cellular proliferation, the ability of the cancer cells to metastasize and the extent of invasiveness. In many cancers, the influences of the microenvironment are mediated in part by paracrine signaling between epithelial cancer cells and the surrounding stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Although Bcl-2 is expressed highest in malignant epithelial cells, stromal cells also express Bcl-2 but in lesser amounts, which may indicate both autocrine and paracrine effects of Bcl-2 in the tumor microenvironment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). CLA induced more apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231-ER&#x003b1; cells when those cells were co-cultured with stromal cells suggesting that the presence of stromal cells is important in CLA induced apoptosis in ER&#x003b1;(+) cancer cells which support the theory that CLA is incorporated and stored in stromal cells to affect cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It appeared that CLA was able to interrupt this paracrine signal (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). However, the involvement of stromal cells did not alter the effects of CLA in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Although CLA possesses apoptotic effect in both normal and cancerous stromal cells (data not shown), cancerous ER&#x003b1; negative breast epithelial cells may acquire independent self-regulation from the surrounding stromal compartment.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy of CLA in breast cancer chemoprevention</title><p>Preclinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] showed promising anti-mammary tumor activity in mouse (~3.5 mg/20 g mouse &#x000b7; d) and rat models (~13 mg/275 g rat &#x000b7; d) that are equivalent to the effective concentration in humans (~2.8 g CLA/70 kg &#x000b7; d). Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that a diet composed of CLA-rich foods (204 mg CLA/day), particularly cheese, may protect against breast cancer in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. More recently, another study showed that CLA intake (134&#x02013;155 mg CLA/day) was not related to overall breast cancer risk, however, the risk of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer among premenopausal women was reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is clear that women consume ~100 times less than the amount of CLA estimated to provide protection. A moderate but effective influence may occur after low level long term consumption of CLA. Since CLA is a natural by-product of rumen fermentation and is found in foods derived from ruminants, consumption of CLA from foods for the purposes of chemoprevention likely will not affect the safety of consumers. It is interested to note that special diet of cow is able to increase CLA in milk fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Whether CLA will cause any toxic effects on these cows? We speculate that CLA will be less likely to induce cell apoptosis in the udder of these cows because CLA in the circulation will not reach the doses used in <italic>in vitro </italic>cell culture models nor the concentrations of CLA-enriched diet in animal studies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We investigated the role of ER&#x003b1; in CLA induced apoptosis in human breast tissue.
