In this study, we investigated the functions of canonical Wnts on differentiation of adult multipotent human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in vitro and in vivo. We observe differential sensitivities of hMSCs to Wnt inhibition of osteogenesis versus adipogenesis, which favors osteoblastic commitment under binary in vitro differentiation conditions. Wnt inhibition of osteogenesis is associated with decreased expression of osteoblastic transcription factors and inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, which are involved in osteogenic differentiation. An hMSC subpopulation exhibits high endogenous Wnt signaling, the inhibition of which enhances osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation in vitro. In an in vivo bone formation model, high levels of Wnt signaling inhibit de novo bone formation by hMSCs. However, hMSCs with exogenous expression of Wnt1 but not stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin markedly stimulate bone formation by naive hMSCs, arguing for an important role of a canonical Wnt gradient in hMSC osteogenesis in vivo.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Growing evidence indicates that Wnt signaling plays a critical role in stem/progenitor self-renewal in adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reya and Clevers, 2005</xref>), in which these cells serve as reservoirs for tissue renewal in response to trauma, disease, and aging. In the canonical pathway, Wnts signal through frizzled and LRP5/6 coreceptors, leading to inactivation of the axin&#x02013;GSK3-&#x003b2; complex, which otherwise phosphorylates and directs degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin. Stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin translocates into the nucleus and forms a complex with T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor transcription factors to activate Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reya and Clevers, 2005</xref>). Some Wnts lack this ability and stimulate noncanonical pathways through effectors including JNK, Rho GTPase, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Veeman et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from bone marrow are multipotent and give rise to tissues, including bone, cartilage, muscle, and adipose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pittenger et al., 1999</xref>). Recent studies have revealed critical transcription factors involved in the commitments of different MSC-derived lineages (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harada and Rodan, 2003</xref>). For example, osteoblastic differentiation is controlled by Runx2, osterix (Osx), and Dlx5, whereas PPAR-&#x003b3; is involved in adipocyte commitment (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harada and Rodan, 2003</xref>). Genetic studies have also established that Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin activity is essential for normal osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Day et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hill et al., 2005</xref>). Enhancement of Wnt signaling either by Wnt overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 2007</xref>) or deficiency of Wnt antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Morvan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">ten Dijke et al., 2008</xref>) is associated with increased bone formation in mice and humans. Loss or gain of function mutations in LRP5 also cause osteoporosis or high bone mass phenotypes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Little et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The in vitro effects of Wnt signaling on osteogenic differentiation of MSCs are controversial. Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling has been reported to stimulate differentiation of mouse MSCs toward the osteoblastic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gaur et al., 2005</xref>). However, both stimulatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gregory et al., 2005</xref>) and inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Boer et al., 2004</xref>) effects of canonical Wnt signaling on osteogenic differentiation by human MSCs (hMSCs) have been observed. Because of their osteogenic potential, human adult bone marrow MSCs are one of the most promising stem cell populations for bone regeneration as well as repairing critical-size bone defects that fail to undergo spontaneous healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meijer et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, these experiments were undertaken in an effort to better define how Wnts influence hMSC commitment along osteoblastic and other lineages as well as the mechanisms involved.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We first analyzed the in vitro biological effects of canonical Wnts on differentiation of adult hMSCs. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Boer et al., 2004</xref>), treatment of hMSCs with Wnt3a conditioned medium (CM) or lentiviral-mediated transduction of Wnt1 strongly inhibited osteogenic differentiation compared with that of respective control cultures, as reflected by reduced staining for the early osteoblastic marker AP and reduced mineralization as detected by Alizarin red staining (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810137/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). Moreover, exogenous Wnt1 resulted in dramatic down-regulation of expression of several markers associated with osteoblastic differentiation (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harada and Rodan, 2003</xref>), including AP, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin (Fig. S1 B).</p><p>In addition to its inhibition of osteogenic differentiation, Wnt stimulation was associated with increased cell proliferation (Fig. S1 C). Because terminal differentiation is commonly associated with exit from the cell cycle, we asked whether Wnt inhibition of differentiation might be caused by enhanced proliferation blocking exit from cell cycle. However, PDGF, which also increased hMSC proliferation and resulted in higher saturation density (Fig. S1 C), did not inhibit osteogenic differentiation, arguing that the Wnt effects could not be explained by stimulation of cell proliferation alone.</p><p>The osteogenic inhibitory function of canonical Wnts seemed inconsistent with the fact that this pathway plays a positive role in bone homeostasis in vivo. It has been observed that aging leads to a decrease of bone-forming osteoblasts and an increase of marrow adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Verma et al., 2002</xref>). These findings are consistent with the possibility that alterations in hMSC lineage differentiation may have profound effects on bone formation. Because Wnt signaling can also inhibit adipogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ross et al., 2000</xref>), we asked whether canonical Wnts might modify hMSC lineage commitment to favor osteoblastic differentiation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 (A and B)</xref>, osteogenic differentiation was partially inhibited at 100 ng/ml Wnt3a, whereas concentrations of 25 ng/ml or lower failed to detectably inhibit either AP activity or mineralization. In contrast, Wnt3a was much more potent in inhibiting adipocyte differentiation, with &#x0223c;40% inhibition observed at 5 ng/ml and complete inhibition at observed at 100 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). As might be expected for transcriptional signaling through Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin, a dominant-negative TCF4 (dnTCF4) antagonized exogenous Wnt1-mediated inhibition of both osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation (Fig. S1 D).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Differential sensitivity of hMSCs to Wnt inhibition of osteogenic versus adipogenic differentiation.</bold> (A) Scanned images of AP (top) or Alizarin red staining (bottom) in hMSCs after 3 wk in osteogenic medium (OS) in the presence of different concentrations (in nanograms/milliliter) of recombinant Wnt3a.

Wnt3a significantly blocked adipogenic differentiation at 5 ng/ml and completely abolished adipogenesis at 100 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D&#x02013;G and I</xref>). In marked contrast, treatment with Wnt3a at both 5 and 25 ng/ml resulted in a significant relative increase in osteogenic differentiation, as manifested by increased AP activity and mineralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, H and I</xref>). At 100 ng/ml, Wnt3a partially inhibited osteogenic differentiation as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, H and I</xref>). These results indicate that under conditions permissive for binary lineage differentiation, differences in sensitivity to Wnt inhibition may alter the equilibrium and shift the commitment from adipocytes toward osteoblasts.</p><p>One mechanism underlying osteogenic inhibition by Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling has been attributed to direct interaction and inhibition of Runx2 transcriptional activity by the &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;Lef1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kahler and Westendorf, 2003</xref>). However, it was also reported that Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling increases Runx2 level in mouse mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gaur et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we examined the expression of osteoblastic transcription factors, including Runx2, Osx, and Dlx5, in hMSCs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, the expression levels of these genes were reduced in Wnt1-expressing hMSCs in basal medium as well as under osteogenic conditions compared with that in vector cells, which is consistent with high levels of Wnt signaling acting to down-regulate these osteoblastic transcription factors.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Mechanisms involved in Wnt inhibition of osteogenic differentiation.</bold> (A) Real-time PCR analysis of Runx2, Osx, and Dlx5 expression in vector (Vec)- or Wnt1-expressing hMSCs grown in basal (Undiff) or osteogenic medium for 4 and 14 d.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, p38 and ERK as well as JNK were activated, as indicated by their increased phosphorylation in hMSCs undergoing osteogenic differentiation. Activation of p38 was detectable as early as 2 d, whereas increased phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) was obvious by 6 d. Wnt1 expression largely inhibited activation of both kinases under osteogenic conditions, whereas there was no significant change in p-ERK levels in response to Wnt1 expression under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>).</p><p>The Ror2 receptor tyrosine kinase plays an important role in skeletal development as well as mediates Wnt5a signaling to the JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>). Other studies have shown that Wnt5a stimulates osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baksh et al., 2007</xref>) and Ror2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibits hMSC osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). When we examined Ror2 expression in response to osteogenic stimulation, we observed an increase, which was blocked by exogenous Wnt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Moreover, when we inhibited Ror2 expression with shRNA under osteogenic conditions, neither p38 nor ERK activation was affected, whereas JNK activation was effectively blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>), and osteogenic differentiation was partially inhibited as well (not depicted). Similarly, treatment of hMSCs under differentiation conditions with SP600125, a small molecule inhibitor of JNK, partially inhibited osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). These findings support the idea that canonical Wnt inhibition of Ror2 up-regulation and JNK activation contributes to its osteogenic inhibitory functions.</p><p>Canonical Wnt signaling has been implicated in stem/progenitor cell maintenance in several adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reya and Clevers, 2005</xref>). Thus, we asked whether hMSCs demonstrated endogenous Wnt signaling activity. Using a lentiviral-based TCF luciferase reporter system, hMSCs showed an approximately sevenfold TCF reporter activity over that of the control reporter, and this activity could be completely inhibited by dnTCF4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). We observed further that endogenous TCF activity in hMSCs was heterogeneous, as only &#x0223c;5% of cells exhibited high activity using a GFP-based reporter system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Moreover, this endogenous Wnt signaling was down-regulated during osteogenic differentiation as monitored by decreased levels of TCF reporter activity and expression of a known &#x003b2;-catenin target gene, <italic>Axin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In contrast, expression of the Wnt antagonist Dkk1 was markedly increased during osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>), suggesting that Dkk1 may participate in down-regulating endogenous Wnt signaling during osteogenic differentiation.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Functions of endogenous Wnt signaling in hMSC osteogenic differentiation.</bold> (A) TCF reporter analysis in hMSCs after infection with Top or Fop luciferase virus and Renilla luciferase virus together with either vector (Vec) or dnTCF4 virus.

In contrast to the osteogenic inhibition by exogenous Wnt1, dnTCF4 enhanced osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>), as well as increased expression of genes associated with osteogenic differentiation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810137/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). dnTCF4 also enhanced adipogenic differentiation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810137/DC1">Fig. S2 B</ext-link>) and increased PPAR-&#x003b3; expression (Fig. S2 C), with evidence of spontaneous adipocyte commitment both in basal medium (Fig. S2 B) and under osteogenic conditions (Fig. S2 D), neither of which responses were observed in vector hMSCs (not depicted). All of these results argue that endogenous Wnt signaling plays an important role in maintaining hMSCs in a relatively undifferentiated state.</p><p>To investigate how canonical Wnt inhibitory effects on osteogenic differentiation in vitro might translate into a positive function in bone formation in vivo, we used an established ectopic bone formation model in immunodeficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krebsbach et al., 1997</xref>). When mixed with ceramic powder of hydroxyapatite (HA)/tri-Ca phosphate (TCP), vector-expressing hMSCs formed detectable small fragments of ectopic bone constituting &#x0223c;1% of the total scaffold area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and G</xref>). Consistent with the inhibitory effects of high Wnt signaling levels on hMSC osteogenic differentiation in vitro, exogenous Wnt1-expressing hMSCs exhibited little if any detectable bone forming capacity under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and G</xref>). Based on our observations of heterogeneous endogenous Wnt activity in hMSCs, we sought to model higher levels of heterogeneous Wnt activity by mixing vector and Wnt1-expressing hMSCs at different ratios in the implants. These conditions led to a striking enhancement of bone formation with as much as 25% bone formation observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, C&#x02013;G</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of canonical Wnt signaling on osteogenesis by hMSCs in an ectopic bone formation model.</bold> (A&#x02013;F) hMSC-vector cells alone (A), hMSC-Wnt1 cells alone (B), or hMSC-vector cells mixed with hMSC-Wnt1 cells (C&#x02013;F) at ratio of 1:1 (C), 3:1 (D), 10:1 (E), or 20:1 (F). b, bone; HA, HA/TCP.

When bone formation was significantly enhanced in implants with mixed LacZ- and Wnt1-expressing hMSCs (Fig. S3, B and C), the bone structures were predominately comprised of LacZ-staining cells.

These findings argue that only hMSCs with low Wnt signaling activity are capable of differentiating into bone-forming osteocytes.</p><p>Immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) revealed significant increases in both LacZ- and Wnt1-expressing hMSCs in mixed implants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, H&#x02013;J</xref>) compared with hMSC-LacZ cells alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 J</xref> and Fig. S3 D). These results correlated with the increased numbers of both Wnt1- and LacZ-staining cells observed in mixed implants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 K</xref>). These results establish that canonical Wnt1 specifically stimulated in vivo proliferation of hMSCs in both autocrine and paracrine modes, with the latter increasing the population of naive hMSCs capable of undergoing osteogenesis under low or undetectable Wnt signaling.</p><p>To address whether or not the enhanced bone formation by Wnt1 was caused by other factors induced by activated &#x003b2;-catenin signaling, we expressed stabilized mutant &#x003b2;-catenin in hMSCs and examined the effects on bone formation in vivo. &#x003b2;-Catenin was specifically detected in hMSCs expressing stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin but not in mixed LacZ-expressing hMSCs in the same implants (Fig. S3 E) or implants with hMSC-LacZ cells alone (Fig. S3 F). Of note, expression of stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin significantly increased cell numbers in implants but had relatively little effect on the number of naive hMSC-LacZ cells under mixed conditions (Fig. S3 G). Consistent with the in vitro osteogenic inhibitory function of &#x003b2;-catenin reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jian et al., 2006</xref>), we observed little if any bone formation by hMSCs expressing mutant &#x003b2;-catenin alone and no increased bone formation when mixed with hMSC-LacZ cells (Fig. S3 H). These results establish that canonical Wnt ligands acting in a cell-nonautonomous manner are required for enhanced bone formation in this context.</p><p>Based on our present findings and the aforementioned previous studies, we propose a model for canonical Wnt modulation of osteogenesis by hMSCs in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 L</xref>) in which a Wnt activity gradient results from the asymmetrical localization of Wnts and antagonists between hMSC stem/progenitor and osteoblasts/osteocyte compartments. For example, we observed Dkk1 up-regulation during osteogenesis, and previous studies have indicated increased expression of other Wnt antagonists, secreted frizzled-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boland et al., 2004</xref>), and sclerostin by osteoblasts/osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Winkler et al., 2003</xref>). Such a gradient of Wnt activity likely plays important roles in stimulating self-renewal and expansion of hMSCs/progenitors at high Wnt activity levels while permitting osteoblastic differentiation where Wnt activity decreases. Differential sensitivity to Wnt inhibition of osteogenesis versus adipogenesis in vitro also provides a possible mechanism to favor osteoblastic commitment within a certain range of Wnt activity by restricting hMSCs from adopting adipocytic cell fate. Our findings strongly favor a direct role of canonical Wnt in bone formation but do not exclude a role for LRP5 on bone formation through regulation of the hormonal acting serotonin as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yadav et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite their potential clinical use in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, bone formation by hMSCs is poor, and, so far, repair of critical-size bone defects has not been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meijer et al., 2007</xref>). A recent study showed that preexposure of hMSCs to dibutyryl-cAMP, an activator of the PKA pathway, can enhance ectopic bone formation by these cells from 1.5% in the control group up to 6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Siddappa et al., 2008</xref>). Our present findings indicate that canonical Wnts can have a major positive impact on hMSC-mediated bone formation in HA/TCP transplants, increasing bone formation up to 25% under our experimental conditions. The appropriate manipulation of Wnt ligand expression might lead to significant improvement in the efficiency of tissue engineering and enhance the therapeutic value of these stem cells for the restoration of bone defects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, CM, growth factors, and inhibitors</title><p>Primary hMSC cultures were obtained from three independent donors (Lonza) and expanded in basal medium or induced with osteogenic or adipogenic medium (Lonza) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.
