Nuclear localisation is therefore important to perform BRMS1 cellular functions and possibly inhibit metastasis progression.</p><p>Analysis of the BRMS1 amino acid sequence identified two coiled-coil motives at residues 51&#x02013;81 and 147&#x02013;180, and two putative canonical monopartite nuclear localization signals (NLSs) located at amino-acid residues 198&#x02013;205 (NLS1) and 239&#x02013;245 (NLS2).

Evidence comes from protein-protein interaction found using FRET analyses, as well as by the identification of cytosolic partners by yeast two-hybrid assays (submitted). The latter results have also been shown by other authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006433-Hurst2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> reinforcing our conjecture. The presence of a putative nuclear export signal (NES) capable of complementing the alleged nuclear localisation and therefore enabling BRMS1 to shuttle between both compartments has not been postulated. If this hypothesis is correct it could imply that the activity of BRMS1 might be modulated by compartmentalisation. It would also shed light into a new more complicated mechanism of action for its anti-metastatic activity. Therefore, this issue represents an important molecular question for the understanding of cancer genetics and metastasis involving BRMS1.</p><p>The active transport of proteins through the nuclear pores is commonly mediated by nuclear import and export receptors belonging to the karyopherin family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006433-Terry1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

One such import receptor is importin &#x003b1;6, a nuclear transporter for NLS-containing proteins.

Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid results suggest that nuclear import of BRMS1 might be mediated by importin &#x003b1;6. Besides, we demonstrate that BRMS1 has the capability to migrate between nucleus and cytoplasm and define precisely the motifs responsible for this shuttling. A functional nuclear export sequence (NES) was identified between residues 74&#x02013;91 of BRMS1. The nuclear-cytoplasm shuttling of BRMS1 represents a previously non-reported, possible mechanism for regulating the activity of BRMS1 or its associated cytosolic partners. The identified NES is CRM1-independent, since the CRM1-inhibitor LMB did not block the exit of exogenously expressed protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The region of BRMS1 encompassing residues 198 to 246 is able to transport a heterologous protein into the nucleus</title><p>We want to characterize the properties of putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs) present within the BRMS1 protein sequence.

Simultaneous disruption of NLS1&#x0002b;NLS2 abolishes nuclear location of a heterologous protein. Besides, a construct encompassing both NLS showed an exclusive nuclear pattern concluding that residues 197&#x02013;246 are essential for nuclear location. In addition, this construct displays a stronger fluorescence within the nucleus compared to BRMS1-FL, suggesting that conformation of the properly folded (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006433-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) FL fusion protein might somehow impair its nuclear transport, or that BRMS1 contains another signal(s) able to shuttle the protein back to the cytosol. The former observation becomes especially true after comparison of the pattern showed by a BRMS1 protein merely GFP attached and the very large BRMS1 protein expressed in the pHM830 system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006433.s001">Figure S1</xref>). An NLS1-deletion construct was exclusively expressed in the cytoplasm. Moreover, a pHM830/&#x00394;NLS2 construct results in the same pattern shown by the FL-construct, suggesting that NLS2 is dispensable for nuclear allocation. Altogether we conclude that NLS1 constitute a functional, necessary and sufficient nuclear signal. A construct over-expression only four residues (<sup>201</sup>KRKK), within NLS1 motif shifts the fusion protein towards the nucleus as efficiently as the entire BRMS1 protein. Besides, a substitution of the fourth residue for an uncharged serine rendered the construct not competent for nuclear import. Precisely, the KRKS peptide is present within the NLS2 motif, underscoring its inability for nuclear import.</p><p>Our results largely prove the functionality of BRMS1-NLS1 and the inability of BRMS1-NLS2 as import signals by themselves. However, it is worth to consider that upon protein folding both motifs could be brought close enough to allow them to work cooperatively as a stronger motif. This possibility is endorsed by the observation of the strongest nuclear localization for a construct including both motives.

Given that a mechanism for nuclear import exists, we hypothesized the possibility of an export signal in the BRMS1 sequence.

Transfection of human cells with a NES-BRMS1-GFP fusion construct, showed a slight difference when compared with a non-competent construct in protein distribution of non-treated cells. Only 5.6&#x00025; of transfected cells partially shift fluorescent protein towards the cytosol while the negative construct show similar values (3&#x00025;). However, after inhibition of the nuclear re-import of NLS-Rev fusion proteins with Act-D, more than 26&#x00025; of BRMS1-NES transfected cells showed a partial shift of GFP-protein towards the cytosol, whereas the non-competent construct maintained same levels as in non-treated cells.

Cells transfected with a NES-competent construct completely blocked the exit of GFP-fusion protein after LMB treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006433.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Unexpectedly, subcellular location was unaltered upon treatment of pRev1.4-BRMS1-NES-eGFP transfected cells.

Thus, we conclude that BRMS1 contains a functional CRM1-independent NES.</p><p>Eukaryotic cells separate transcription/replication from translation by compartmentalization into nucleus and cytosol respectively. The majority of proteins with nuclear function are actively transported based on its binding to specific karyopherin receptors usually by the presence of NLS and NES signals. In the absence of a specific retention mechanism based on the high affinity of a protein for nuclear components, all nuclear proteins shuttle, considering export as a default pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006433-SchmidtZachmann1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In such a case the distribution of a protein will not be directed, at least not exclusively, by the import/export competence of the protein itself but also by its capability to bind to nuclear partners.

This interaction provides a plausible explanation along with the weakness of the BRMS1-NES for the predominant nuclear location of BRMS1. The fact that BRMS1 has access to the cytoplasm, even transiently, might be important for integrating nuclear functions with those occurring in the cytoplasm, constituting a major event in the regulation of both activities.</p><p>It is worth to mention that apart from being significant for a better characterization of BRMS1 protein itself, insights into the mechanism and regulation of its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling capability might be pivotal from the point of view of a potential clinical/therapeutic approach.

As transcription occurs in the nucleus, the activity of different transcription factors can be regulated by their subcellular distribution. Thus, identification of molecules that could affect BRMS1 protein location might prove effective in controlling cell growth.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that BRMS1 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm mediated by a novel, weak but functional NES region. Moreover, we provide strong evidence that NLS1 is necessary and sufficient for BRMS1 nuclear transport. Finally, the identification of KPNA5 as BRMS1 partner has also been demonstrated. Since BRMS1 molecular functions are highly dependent on nuclear localisation, our results possibly suggest another level of regulation for BRMS1 biological mechanisms. Future studies should evaluate to what extent the reported nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling might affect BRMS1 dependent anti metastatic properties. We speculate that BRMS1 activity by import/export transport could serve as a potential regulatory mechanism playing a biological role which functional/clinical implications are not yet understood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>U-2 OS, HeLa, MDA-MB-23 human and C2C12 mouse myoblast were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

More than 200 transfected cells were observed across three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Nuclear export assay</title><p>Nuclear to cytoplasm <italic>in vivo</italic> assays were carried out as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006433-Henderson1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Relative export activity was measured 24 h later by scoring nuclear (N), cytosolic (C) or diffuse (N&#x0002b;C) location of fusion proteins (&#x0003e;200 cells) ranging from 1&#x0002b; (weakest) to 9&#x0002b; (strongest) activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006433-Henderson1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.
