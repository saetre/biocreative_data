Both the <italic>PURG</italic> and <italic>WRN</italic> genes initiate transcription at multiple sites, the major clusters of which are &#x0223c;90 bp apart. A segment containing this region strongly promotes transcription of a reporter gene in both directions. Both promoters are TATA-less and CAAT-less and both are positively regulated by Sp1 elements. While promoter elements for the two genes are interleaved, in the contrapodal direction, certain elements critical for each gene are distinct. Sequencing of cDNAs for Pur&#x003b3; mRNA reveals that two alternative coding sequences are generated from a single gene, resulting in different Pur&#x003b3; C-termini. <italic>PURG-A</italic> mRNA consists of a single intronless transcript of &#x0223c;3 kb. <italic>PURG-B</italic> mRNA results from transcription through the <italic>PURG-A</italic> polyadenylation site and splicing out of an intron of &#x0003e;30 kb. In this unique example of a switch, splicing of a single intron either occurs or does not occur depending upon differential termination&#x0002f;polyadenylation. <italic>PURG-B</italic> is the primary <italic>PURG</italic> transcript detected in testis, but it is undetectable in all members of a normal adult tissue cDNA panel. <italic>PURG-A</italic> levels are low or undetectable in the normal tissue panel, but they are greatly elevated in all members of a tumor tissue panel. <italic>PURG-B</italic> is detected in several tumor panel members.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x9901a50.0x9c592f0" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession nos<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Pur family members studied thus far are sequence-specific single-stranded DNA- and RNA-binding proteins. The ability of Pur&#x003b1;, the first family member cloned (GenBank accession no. NM005859) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c1">1</xref>), to regulate viral DNA transcription and replication in mammalian cells may provide a model for its cellular roles. Pur&#x003b1; binds the protein Tat, encoded by HIV-1, and enhances transcription of the HIV-1 genome in a manner dependent on Pur&#x003b1; also binding to the resulting RNA transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c2">2</xref>). Pur&#x003b1; binds to the TAR RNA element near the 5&#x02032;-end of the HIV-1 transcript and to Tat, which binds TAR near the Pur&#x003b1;-binding site. Pur&#x003b1; binds to a similar element in JC virus (JCV) DNA in the viral replication&#x0002f;transcription regulatory region and Pur&#x003b1; and Tat act synergistically at this element to stimulate JCV late gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c5">5</xref>). In mouse cells Pur&#x003b1; stimulates transcription of the BC1 gene and binds to the resulting transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c6">6</xref>), providing another example of a DNA- and RNA-binding pattern similar to that seen with HIV-1. In human cells Pur&#x003b1; binds to 7SL RNA, which is related to mouse BC1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c7">7</xref>). Pur&#x003b1; has now been implicated in transcriptional regulation of a variety of additional cellular genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c12">12</xref>). Pur&#x003b1; has been reported to associate with another Pur family member, Pur&#x003b2;, the resulting complex being involved in regulation of the vascular smooth muscle actin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c13">13</xref>). The sequence of human Pur&#x003b2; cDNA has now been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c14">14</xref>) (GenBank accession no. AY039216). Increased levels of Pur&#x003b1; protein inhibit cell cycle progression at G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub> checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c16">16</xref>). Simultaneous deletions of the <italic>PURA</italic> and <italic>PURB</italic> genes occur at a high frequency in acute myelogenous leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c14">14</xref>). The <italic>PUR</italic> gene family is strongly conserved from plants to humans. Whereas the human genome contains at least three family members, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains only one (GenBank accession no. AF021259).</p><p>Each Pur family member contains three class I amino acid repeats which are highly conserved and are related to repeats in human Myb proteins and the yeast protein Rap1. All Pur proteins also contain two class II repeats separating the class I repeats. The class I repeats in Pur&#x003b1; are crucial for its ability to bind its single-stranded <italic>PUR</italic> recognition element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c17">17</xref>). To identify new members of the Pur family of proteins, a short Pur&#x003b1; sequence corresponding to the class I repeat was used to screen for homologous DNA sequences registered in the GenBank database using the tBLASTn program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c18">18</xref>). A significant Pur&#x003b1; homolog was found to be present in human genomic DNA upstream of the Werner syndrome gene, <italic>WRN</italic>. This sequence comprised a complete open reading frame (ORF) for a characteristic Pur protein, which we have designated in the present report as Pur&#x003b3;. The gene is designated as <italic>PURG</italic>. In characterizing the <italic>WRN</italic> promoter, investigators had previously deleted regions of <italic>PURG</italic>, but they did not note the presence of the <italic>PURG</italic> ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c20">20</xref>). Intriguingly, the <italic>PURG</italic> ORF is in the opposite orientation to the <italic>WRN</italic> ORF.</p><p>Werner syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder causing several characteristics of premature aging and certain types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c23">23</xref>). Werner syndrome patients are prone to juvenile cataracts, atrophy of the skin, graying and loss of hair, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis and neoplasia characterized by multiple sarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c23">23</xref>). The <italic>WRN</italic> gene is located at chromosome band 8p11&#x02013;12 and encodes a protein of 1432 amino acids with significant homology in its helicase domain to that of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c24">24</xref>). To date, five human RecQ-type helicase genes, i.e. <italic>RecQL</italic>, <italic>WRN</italic>, <italic>BLM</italic>, <italic>RecQ4</italic> and <italic>RecQ5</italic>, have been identified. Mutations in the <italic>WRN</italic>, <italic>BLM</italic> and <italic>RecQ4</italic> genes have been shown to be responsible for the autosomal disorders known as Werner syndrome, Bloom syndrome and Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson sydrome, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c25">25</xref>). Most mutations in <italic>WRN</italic> affect helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c25">25</xref>). The mechanism by which mutations in the <italic>WRN</italic> gene cause the phenotypes in Werner syndrome patients remains unknown.</p><p>The head-to-head orientation of <italic>WRN</italic> and <italic>PURG</italic> raises the question of whether the two genes could share promoter sequences and whether their expression could be co-regulated. Therefore, we have sought here to define the <italic>PURG</italic> transcription unit and to characterize its promoter, the structure of the gene and its expression. Surprisingly, we have found unique aspects of both the initiation and termination of the <italic>PURG</italic> gene. A novel termination&#x0002f;polyadenylation switch allows the gene to encode either of two proteins, with different C-termini.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium with <sc>l</sc>-glutamine and 4.5 g&#x0002f;l glucose (Cellgro Mediatech) supplemented with 10&#x00025; (v&#x0002f;v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL) at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere of 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>, 95&#x00025; air.</p></sec><sec><title>Two-step RT&#x02013;PCR and 5&#x02032;-RACE of human testis <italic>PURG</italic> mRNA</title><p>Human testis mRNA (Clontech) was reverse transcribed with <italic>C.therm.</italic> Polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the products were purified with a Qiagen PCR purification kit.

This sequence contains an ORF of 1044 bp which is located between 1025 and 2068 bp upstream of the most 5&#x02032; transcription start site of the <italic>WRN</italic> gene, WRN &#x0002b;1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f1">1</xref>). Numbering for this region of the <italic>WRN</italic> gene is that of Yamabe <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c19">19</xref>). The new ORF encodes a peptide sequence of 347 amino acids which has high homology to the human Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2; protein sequences. Especially high homology is observed in regions corresponding to the three class I repeats, two class II repeats and the &#x02018;psycho&#x02019; motif of Pur&#x003b1;. To find out whether this ORF is transcribed <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed a tBLASTn search of its amino acid sequence against the dbEST database. A human cDNA clone from pooled libraries of fetal lung, testis and B cells was identified. The 106 bp sequence tag of that cDNA clone is exactly the same as a part of the ORF. That cDNA clone, designated here pHPURG1, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and the entire insert of 1925 bp was sequenced. The insert sequence goes from codon 14 to the stop codon of the ORF, followed by an 897 bp 3&#x02032;-UTR and a poly(A) tail. It corresponds to the genomic sequence between 1064 and 2966 bp upstream of the <italic>WRN</italic> transcriptional start site, WRN &#x0002b;1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f1">1</xref>). Thus, pHPURG1 contains an incomplete protein coding sequence and an intact 3&#x02032;-UTR. These data, together with data obtained from the following experiments, indicate that a new Pur family gene, <italic>PURG</italic>, is located upstream of the <italic>WRN</italic> gene. Because, as described later in this paper, there exists another isoform of Pur&#x003b3;, we designate the transcription unit shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f1">1</xref> as <italic>PURG-A</italic>. Sequencing of the complete <italic>PURG-A</italic> cDNA (GenBank accession no. AF195513) is described later in this paper after identification of the 5&#x02032;-UTR. <italic>WRN</italic> and <italic>PURG</italic> are organized in a head-to-head configuration, such that they are transcribed in opposite directions, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f1">1</xref>. Contemplation of this figure raises two immediate questions. Where does transcription of <italic>PURG</italic> initiate? Do the two genes share essential promoter elements? We set out to answer these questions.</p></sec><sec><title>5&#x02032;-RACE identifies a long 5&#x02032;-UTR of Pur&#x003b3; mRNA with multiple transcriptional start sites</title><p>We noticed that the G&#x0002b;C content of the upstream DNA sequence of <italic>PURG</italic>, i.e. the sequence between WRN &#x0002b;1 and &#x02013;1025, is high (76&#x00025;, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>A). In particular, that of a 202 bp region, encompassing sites &#x02013;755 and &#x02013;956, is extremely high (89&#x00025;, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>A). No specific products were obtained in an initial 5&#x02032;-RACE experiment using nested <italic>PURG</italic> reverse primers downstream of the 202 bp region. If the 5&#x02032;-end of Pur&#x003b3; mRNA is located upstream of this region, we could perform 5&#x02032;-RACE using reverse primers that are located upstream of this region. We thus employed RT&#x02013;PCR to roughly define the position of <italic>PURG</italic> transcription start site(s). <italic>C.therm.</italic> Polymerase was used as the reverse transcriptase in the RT step because it functions well at temperatures as high as 70&#x000b0;C, enabling successful synthesis of cDNA from G&#x0002b;C-rich mRNA templates. A human testis mRNA preparation (Clontech) was chosen for both RT&#x02013;PCR and 5&#x02032;-RACE because it was determined to contain Pur&#x003b3; mRNA. A reverse primer located downstream of, but near to, the 5&#x02032;-end of the Pur&#x003b3; coding sequence in pHPURG1 (R1, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>A) was used in reverse transcription and R1 and each of the forward primers (F1&#x02013;F5, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>A) were used in PCR. PCR with R1 and F5 yields a single 850 bp product, exactly the size of genomic DNA located between R1 and F5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>B, left), a result deemed surprising since it indicated a long 5&#x02032;-UTR. This product was not seen in the negative control in which the RT step had an incubation time of 0 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>B, left). These data indicate that the 5&#x02032;-end of Pur&#x003b3; mRNA is located upstream of the position of the primer F5 and that there is no intron between F5 and R1. RT&#x02013;PCR with reverse primer R3, located downstream of F5, and one forward primer located upstream of F5 (F6, F7 or F8, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>A) revealed that some <italic>PURG</italic> transcripts start from sites located upstream of primer F8, well into intron 1 of the <italic>WRN</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>B, right). There was a sharp decrease in band intensity when F7, instead of F6, was used together with R3 in the RT&#x02013;PCR, suggesting that major <italic>PURG</italic> transcripts start from sites between F6 and F7 while minor transcripts start from sites further upstream. Thus, while human <italic>PURG</italic> might have more than one promoter, it is likely that one promoter governs the vast bulk of transcripts. The size of each of these PCR products is equal to that of the genomic DNA between each pair of the primers used in the PCR (data not shown), indicating that there is no intron in the 5&#x02032;-end of <italic>PURG</italic> up to the position of F8.</p><p>We then performed 5&#x02032;-RACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c26">26</xref>) using nested <italic>PURG</italic> reverse primers R2, R3 and R4, which are located downstream of F5 but upstream of the 202 bp region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>A). <italic>C.therm.</italic> Polymerase was used instead of AMV reverse transcriptase in the 5&#x02032;-RACE kit (Roche) to ensure complete synthesis of first-strand cDNA from G&#x0002b;C-rich Pur&#x003b3; mRNA. The second PCR products in the 5&#x02032;-RACE are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>C. The size of major PCR products ranged from &#x0223c;188 to &#x0223c;318 bp, while some minor PCR products were &#x0003e;318 bp. These different sized products were specifically derived from Pur&#x003b3; mRNAs with different transcription start sites, as confirmed by cloning and sequencing of these products. They were cloned into the pBK-CMV plasmid (Stratagene). Twenty clones containing inserts were selected, out of which eight were sequenced, including the two clones with the longest and shortest inserts. The inserts in all the eight clones were derived from Pur&#x003b3;. They share the same 3&#x02032;-end, i.e. the end of reverse primer R4, but have different 5&#x02032;-ends, i.e. &#x02013;92, &#x02013;104, &#x02013;119, &#x02013;122, &#x02013;130, &#x02013;158, &#x02013;185 and &#x02013;193 with respect to WRN &#x0002b;1. The 5&#x02032;-RACE results indicated that Pur&#x003b3; was transcribed primarily from a cluster of initiation sites roughly between &#x02013;92 and &#x02013;193 with respect to WRN &#x0002b;1, and much less frequently from further upstream positions. This is consistent with the RT&#x02013;PCR results shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>B, in which the data suggest that Pur&#x003b3; starts transcription mainly from sites located between F7 and F6, i.e. between &#x0002b;3&#x000a0;and &#x02013;176 with respect to WRN &#x0002b;1, and less frequently from further upstream sites. Analysis of the mRNA sequence upstream of the 1044 bp ORF indicates that this ORF represents the complete Pur&#x003b3; coding sequence. The median Pur&#x003b3; mRNA 5&#x02032;-UTR identified here is &#x0223c;900 bp in length. Such a long 5&#x02032;-UTR is uncommon among eukaryotic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the <italic>PURG</italic> promoter reveals limited co-regulation with <italic>WRN</italic></title><p>As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f3">3</xref>A, the human <italic>PURG</italic> and <italic>WRN</italic> genes are organized such that their major clusters of transcription start sites are separated by &#x0223c;90 bp. Their minor transcription start sites are located upstream of their major transcription start sites, well into the contraposed gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c20">20</xref>). The <italic>WRN</italic> gene reportedly has two promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c20">20</xref>). Luciferase reporter assays performed in several cell lines revealed that the activity of the <italic>WRN</italic> downstream promoter was 2&#x02013;10-fold stronger than its upstream promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c20">20</xref>). The region encompassing positions &#x02013;67 and &#x0002b;160 was shown to be the minimal region required for full activity of the <italic>WRN</italic> downstream promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c19">19</xref>). These investigators have demonstrated that two Sp1 elements (Sp1-1 and Sp1-2) and one RCE motif (RCE-1) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f3">3</xref>A) in the 67 bp region upstream of WRN &#x0002b;1 are indispensable for <italic>WRN</italic> downstream promoter activity. This short region also lies proximal to the downstream transcriptional start sites of <italic>PURG</italic>. In order to find out whether the human <italic>PURG</italic> transcription unit shares <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements with that of <italic>WRN</italic>, we performed 5&#x02032; progressive deletion analyses of the <italic>PURG</italic> downstream promoter in luciferase reporter assays in HeLa cells. These cells were chosen because they had previously been used in characterization of the <italic>WRN</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c19">19</xref>). A series of luciferase reporter constructs were generated by inserting <italic>PURG</italic> upstream sequences with progressively deleted 5&#x02032;-ends into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). These constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells and the relative promoter activities of the various inserts were assessed by comparing the luciferase activities of these constructs with that of the parental vector pGL3-Basic. As revealed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f3">3</xref>B, the DNA fragment from &#x0002b;166 to &#x02013;363 with respect to WRN &#x0002b;1 had a strong promoter activity, &#x0223c;36&#x00025; of the promoter activity of the same DNA fragment in the reverse direction. Deletion of 175 bp from the 5&#x02032;-end (from &#x0002b;166 to &#x02013;9) reduced promoter activity by &#x0223c;60&#x00025;. This same region was also shown to be required for <italic>WRN</italic> promoter activity in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c19">19</xref>). Thus this region is important for the transcriptional regulation of both genes. Scanning of this region using MatInspector, a program that searches for transcription factor-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c28">28</xref>), did not reveal any clearly relevant candidates for regulatory elements. Further deletions of Sp1-1 (from &#x02013;9 to &#x02013;33), Sp1-2 (from &#x02013;33 to &#x02013;51) and RCE-1 (from &#x02013;51 to &#x02013;67), which play key roles in <italic>WRN</italic> transcription initiation, had no remarkable influence on <italic>PURG</italic> promoter activity. Truncation from &#x02013;67 to &#x02013;86 removed another Sp1 element, Sp1-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f3">3</xref>A), and reduced promoter activity by &#x0223c;50&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f3">3</xref>B). Sp1-3 may thus have a positive modulating effect on <italic>PURG</italic> transcription initiation. Further truncation to &#x02013;113 had little effect on promoter activity, although several transcription start sites and a potential E2F-binding site were removed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f3">3</xref>). The removal of another 40 bp (from &#x02013;113 to &#x02013;153) only slightly reduced the promoter activity, leaving significant remaining promoter activity. This deletion removes several other transcription start sites and two potential elements, RCE-2 and Sp1-4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f3">3</xref>). Little promoter activity remained when the deletions progressed to position &#x02013;181 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f3">3</xref>B). The region between &#x02013;153 and &#x02013;181 contains five <italic>PUR</italic> elements of the form GNGG or GGNG. It is quite conceivable that Pur&#x003b3; could autoregulate its gene, and <italic>WRN</italic> as well, since Pur&#x003b1; has recently been shown to autoregulate its own promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c29">29</xref>). This region contains no other known <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, as revealed by MatInspector. It is notable that the region encompassing &#x0002b;52 to &#x02013;153 also contains multiple <italic>PUR</italic> elements. The DNA fragment from positions &#x0002b;167 to &#x02013;1024, the beginning of the Pur&#x003b3; coding sequence, had a promoter activity 20&#x00025; that of the DNA fragment from &#x0002b;166 to &#x02013;363, suggesting that there are negative regulatory elements in the long 5&#x02032;-UTR between &#x02013;363 to &#x02013;1024 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f3">3</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Two isoforms of Pur&#x003b3; mRNA are expressed from the <italic>PURG</italic> gene</title><p>Results presented thus far indicate that the major transcripts of human <italic>PURG-A</italic> possess a coding region of 1044 bp, a 5&#x02032;-UTR as long as 1282 bp and an intact 3&#x02032;-UTR of 897 bp (GenBank accession no. AF195513). The entire sequence of <italic>PURG-A</italic> contains no intron, as is also true of <italic>PURA</italic> and <italic>PURB</italic>. The 347 amino acid Pur&#x003b3; protein is highly homologous to Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2;. Searching the dbEST database with the human Pur&#x003b3; coding sequence using the BLAST program yielded a mouse blastocyst cDNA clone, designated here pMPURG1. We obtained the mouse clone and sequenced the entire insert. The insert in pMPURG1 begins with an ORF of 293 codons, followed by an intact 3&#x02032;-UTR of 806 bp and concludes with a poly(A) tail. The first 258 codon sequence in pMPURG1 is 93&#x00025; identical to the 258 codon sequence from 31 to 288 in the human Pur&#x003b3; cDNA, while their amino acid sequences are 97&#x00025; identical. Yet the 35 codons from 259 to 292 and the 3&#x02032;-UTR in pMPURG1 are completely different to the sequence from codon 289 to the 3&#x02032;-end in the human Pur&#x003b3; cDNA. The genomic sequence after codon 288 of human Pur&#x003b3; is GTAAGT, matching the consensus sequence for a 5&#x02032; splice site of introns in higher eukaryotes. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that an intron located after codon 288 was not spliced out from the precusor RNA of human Pur&#x003b3;, which we named <italic>hPURG-A</italic>, but that a corresponding intron was spliced out from the precusor RNA of mouse Pur&#x003b3;, which we named <italic>mPURG-B</italic>, the sequence of which is now available (GenBank accession no. AF479672). We shall present evidence that this hypothesis is correct and that the two isoforms of Pur&#x003b3; mRNA are expressed alternatively from a single <italic>PURG</italic> gene in both human and mouse.</p><p>Human primers HPC5 and HPCA3, corresponding to the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends, respectively, of the 1044 bp hPur&#x003b3;-A coding sequence, were used to amplify potential mouse Pur&#x003b3;-A (mPur&#x003b3;-A) coding sequence from mouse genomic DNA. A single product with a size similar to the 1044 bp human DNA was obtained. Sequencing revealed that it was 1053 bp long and 94&#x00025; identical to the 1044 bp hPur&#x003b3;-A coding sequence. The protein thus encoded would be 350 amino acids long and 97&#x00025; identical to the 347 amino acid hPur&#x003b3;-A protein. A cDNA clone from adult mouse testis has subsequently been identified that contains the 1053 bp PCR product sequence plus an 11 bp 5&#x02032;-UTR and a 139 bp 3&#x02032;-UTR, all of which are highly homologous to corresponding regions in hPur&#x003b3;-A cDNA. Thus this clone contains a partial cDNA sequence of mPur&#x003b3;-A. The complete coding sequence of <italic>mPURG-A</italic> is now available (GenBank accession no. AF479673). While the first 258 codons of mPur&#x003b3;-B in pMPURG1 are identical to codons 34&#x02013;291 in mPur&#x003b3;-A cDNA, the codons C-terminal to these are different. Since there is no intron in the 1053 bp mPur&#x003b3;-A coding sequence, there must be an intron located between codons 258 and 259 of mPur&#x003b3;-B in pMPURG1. In agreement with this conclusion, the genomic sequence after codon 258 is GTAAGT, the typical 5&#x02032; splice site of introns in higher eukaryotes. It is thus evident that two different Pur&#x003b3; mRNAs are transcribed from a single mouse <italic>PURG</italic> gene.</p><p>By searching the dbEST database with the exon 2 sequence of mPur&#x003b3;-B with the BLAST program, we identified and sequenced a cDNA clone from human fetal lung (GenBank accession no. AI338787). It contains an insert of 789 bp, followed by a poly(A) tail. Since the insert is 82&#x00025; identical to the 806 bp mPur&#x003b3;-B 3&#x02032;-UTR, we surmised that it is the intact 3&#x02032;-UTR of human Pur&#x003b3;-B (hPur&#x003b3;-B). RT&#x02013;PCR amplification from a human testis mRNA preparation (Clontech) with reverse primer HPCB3, derived from the 789 bp insert sequence, in the RT step and HPCB3 and HPC5 in the PCR step indeed generated a partial hPur&#x003b3;-B cDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f4">4</xref>). As expected, this hPur&#x003b3;-B cDNA shares only the first 288 codon sequence of hPur&#x003b3;-A. The following 35 codon sequence encodes 34 amino acids that are 91&#x00025; identical to the 34 amino acids encoded by exon 2 of mPur&#x003b3;-B mRNA. The remaining partial 3&#x02032;-UTR sequence is the same as that of the 789 bp insert initially obtained. The complete sequence of <italic>hPURG-B</italic> cDNA is now available (GenBank accession no. AV077841). As in mPur&#x003b3;-B, there is an intron located between codons 288 and 289 of hPur&#x003b3;-B. There is no other intron after codon 289 because the cDNA sequence is identical to the genomic sequence from nucleotides 16737 to 17629 in the human BAC clone RP11-293D9 (GenBank accession no. AC008066). In summary, the genomic structure and DNA sequence of <italic>PURG</italic> genes are highly conserved between human and mouse. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f5">5</xref> presents a comparison of the C-termini of the human and mouse Pur&#x003b3;-A and -B isoforms. The position of the apparently spliced-out intron in the mRNAs encoding the B isoforms is indicated by dashed lines. To shed further light on how these isoforms are generated it was necessary to examine chromosome 8 <italic>PURG</italic> genomic DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Diffferential termination&#x0002f;polyadenylation accounts for two different <italic>PURG</italic> mRNAs encoding distinct protein isoforms</title><p>The human chromosome 8 BAC clone RP11-293D9 contains a 16736 bp partial intron sequence which is located upstream of exon 2 of <italic>hPURG-B</italic>. The sequence at the 3&#x02032;-end of the intron is TTTTTTCTTTAG, matching the consensus sequence for the 3&#x02032; splice site of introns in higher eukaryotes. The genomic sequence upstream of <italic>WRN</italic> (GenBank accession no. AF181896) contains exon 1 and the following 12427 bp partial intron sequence of <italic>hPURG-B</italic>. It does not overlap the 16736 bp partial intron sequence in RP11-293D9. Human chromosome 8 BAC clone RP11-473A17 (GenBank accession no. AC084736) overlaps these two clones of the intron, but there are unsequenced regions between them. Together these data indicate that exon 2, encoding the hPur&#x003b3;-B C-terminus, does in fact lie downstream of <italic>hPURG-A</italic> on chromosome 8. The data also indicate that the size of the <italic>hPURG-B</italic> intron is &#x0003e;30 kb. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f6">6</xref> illustrates the structure of the human genomic <italic>PURG</italic> locus. <italic>PURG-A</italic> and <italic>PURG-B</italic> cDNAs were both generated from poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA molecules. Thus <italic>PURG-A</italic> and <italic>PURG-B</italic> polyadenylation sites are located &#x0003e;30 kb apart on genomic DNA. The only plausible mechanism that can explain the transcription and processing of <italic>PURG-A</italic> and <italic>-B</italic> mRNAs is that <italic>PURG</italic> transcription terminates at two different regions, one near the <italic>PURG-A</italic> poly(A) site, the other near the <italic>PURG-B</italic> poly(A) site. One alternative mechanism is extremely unlikely but not presently completely ruled out. It would posit that <italic>PURG</italic> transcription terminates at only one region, i.e. 3&#x02032; to the <italic>PURG-B</italic> poly(A) site. Cleavage and polyadenylation would then occur either near the 3&#x02032;-terminus or, alternatively, &#x0003e;30 kb upstream of the terminus. Such cleavage is unprecedented and no mechanism thus far elucidated can account for cleavage and polyadenylation so far upstream of transcriptional termination. This is further considered in the Discussion. There are several instances of possible alternative termination in the literature. Nonetheless, transcription of the <italic>PURG</italic> gene is unique in that it is the only reported instance in which splicing of a single intron either does or does not occur, depending on differential termination&#x0002f;polyadenylation, resulting in different protein C-termini.</p></sec><sec><title>Differences in Pur&#x003b3;-A and Pur&#x003b3;-B mRNA expression in various organs and tumor cell lines</title><p>RT&#x02013;PCR with reverse primer HPCA3 in the RT step and HPCA3 and HPC5 in the PCR step yielded the hPur&#x003b3;-A coding sequence from the same testis mRNA preparation shown to yield hPur&#x003b3;-B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f4">4</xref>). Thus both isoforms of Pur&#x003b3; mRNA are expressed in human testis. Sequencing of RT&#x02013;PCR products confirms this. Given similarity in amplification, hPur&#x003b3;-B mRNA appears more abundant than hPur&#x003b3;-A in testis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f4">4</xref>). They are both transcribed primarily from sites located between F6 and F7 and less frequently from further upstream sites (data not shown), suggesting that they are under the same control of transcription initiation.</p><p>By identifying Pur&#x003b3; cDNA clones in the dbEST database, we found that hPur&#x003b3;-A was expressed in glioblastoma (BF245424), hPur&#x003b3;-B was expressed in fetal lung (AI338787), hPur&#x003b3; (unknown whether A or B) was expressed in hippocampus (BI550191) and in ovarian fibrotheoma (BF434119), mPur&#x003b3;-A was expressed in testis (AK015630), mPur&#x003b3;-B was expressed in blastocyst (AA793440) and in kidney (AI931378), and mPur&#x003b3; (unknown whether A or B) was expressed in skin (AA079942) and in mammary tumor (BE554692).</p><p>Human Pur&#x003b3; mRNA expression was examined using commercially available cDNA panels from eight normal organs &#x0005b;Human Multiple Tissue cDNA (MTC) Panel I; Clontech&#x0005d; and eight tumor cell lines (Human Tumor MTC Panel; Clontech) by PCR amplification of hPur&#x003b3;-A and hPur&#x003b3;-B cDNAs from each of the 16 cDNA preparations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f7">7</xref>). When 34 PCR cycles were employed, no hPur&#x003b3; products were detected (not shown). While 46 cycles were necessary to detect hPur&#x003b3; PCR products in several normal tissues, 42 cycles were sufficient to detect hPur&#x003b3; mRNA expression in all of the tumor cells studed. Human Pur&#x003b3;-A mRNA was expressed at different, but quite significant, levels in all of the eight tumor cell lines. Human Pur&#x003b3;-B mRNA was detected in three of the tumor cell lines and its expression level was lower than that of the corresponding hPur&#x003b3;-A mRNA in each of these. In contrast, hPur&#x003b3;-A mRNA was only detected in three of the eight normal organs and no hPur&#x003b3;-B mRNA was detected in any of the eight normal organs. Thus far, hPur&#x003b3;-B mRNA has only been detected in certain fetal cells, testis and tumor cells. Human Pur&#x003b3;-A mRNA, on the other hand, has been detected in a broader range of normal tissues and it may be expressed ubiquitously in tumor cells. The overall Pur&#x003b3; mRNA expression levels in the eight normal organs were much lower than those in eight tumor cell lines. In particular, no hPur&#x003b3;-A or hPur&#x003b3;-B mRNA was detected in lung or pancreas, but hPur&#x003b3;-A mRNA was detected in the two lung carcinoma cell lines and the pancreas adenocarcinoma cell line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f7">7</xref>). These data suggest a potential relation between the up-regulation of Pur&#x003b3; expression and tumorigenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Overlapping, contrapodal promoters regulate initiation of transcription of <italic>PURG</italic> and <italic>WRN</italic></title><p>The contrapodal orientation of <italic>PURG</italic> and <italic>WRN</italic> raises questions regarding potential co-regulation of the two genes. For that reason we have defined the transcription unit and characterized the promoter for <italic>PURG</italic>. That has previously been done for <italic>WRN</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c20">20</xref>). It has been reported that <italic>WRN</italic> initiates transcription from multiple sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c20">20</xref>). Here 5&#x02032;-RACE indicates that <italic>PURG</italic> also initiates from multiple sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f2">2</xref>). In each case the 5&#x02032;-most initiation sites lie within the transcription unit of the contraposed gene, suggesting that regulatory sequences may exist within the contraposed gene. The vast bulk, however, of transcripts for each gene initiate from closely spaced sites separated by &#x0223c;90 bp of intervening regulatory sequence. This separating regulatory region has previously been evaluated for transcription of <italic>WRN</italic> and evaluated in the present publication for <italic>PURG</italic> by us. In both cases the promoters have been evaluated in HeLa cells, in which both proteins have been observed to be expressed by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). We report that the intervening potential regulatory region functions in HeLa cells to highly promote transcription in both directions. In both cases the promoters are TATA-less and CAAT-less and contain many potentially bi-directional SP1 transactivational binding sites. Important distinctions, however, indicate that these two genes are not strictly co-regulated. Several of the SP1 sites deemed critical for <italic>WRN</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c19">19</xref>) do not, when deleted, affect <italic>PURG</italic> transcription. While transcript levels for both genes are relatively high in testis and brain, <italic>PURG</italic> transcript levels in all normal tissues are low overall. Thus, while both genes may be housekeeping genes, there are important elements that regulate their expression levels in different tissues. The possibility of autoregulation of the <italic>PURG</italic> gene must be noted. All <italic>SP1</italic> elements are also <italic>PUR</italic> elements and there are many more <italic>PUR</italic> elements in the common promoter region as well as in the <italic>PURG</italic> 5&#x02032;-leader sequence. Thus, Pur&#x003b3; or its related family members may bind to this region to influence transcription. Autoregulation of the <italic>PURA</italic> gene in this fashion by Pur&#x003b1; has recently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c29">29</xref>). In that study increasing levels of Pur&#x003b1; reduced transcription from the <italic>PURA</italic> gene. Likewise, binding of Pur proteins to the <italic>PURG</italic>&#x02013;<italic>WRN</italic> promoter could affect <italic>WRN</italic> transcription. It is conceivable in that case that expression of the Pur&#x003b3; protein could directly regulate transcription of the <italic>WRN</italic> gene. It would thus be interesting to determine whether deregulation of <italic>PURG</italic> ever occurs in patients with Werner syndrome.</p><p>It is now known that several human gene pairs are organized in contrapodal fashion with central, intervening regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c43">43</xref>). In most cases regulatory elements critical for transcription in each direction differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c42">42</xref>), whereas in certain cases bi-directional regulatory elements critical for both genes have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c40">40</xref>). Even in those cases, however, additional regulatory elements differed between the two genes. What evolutionary benefit is there for the presence of head-to-head overlapping promoters if transcription of the two contraposed genes is not co-regulated? One possibility is that two such genes might not be normally co-regulated, but that in response to certain cellular signals it would be beneficial to simultaneously up- or down-regulate both of them. All of the promoters referenced above are highly G&#x0002b;C-rich and may be targets for DNA methylation. The <italic>PURG</italic>&#x02013;<italic>WRN</italic> promoter region is also extremely G&#x0002b;C-rich. It will be interesting to determine whether, and how, DNA methylation affects expression of these genes.</p><p>Results from scanning a panel of human tissues reveal that <italic>WRN</italic> mRNA exists in all 24 tissues examined (data not shown), suggesting that it is a housekeeping gene, in keeping with previous speculation. Housekeeping genes generally have a CpG island of some 200&#x02013;1000 bp spanning the promoter region, frequently extending into the first exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c44">44</xref>). These promoters are not only rich in G&#x0002f;C, but are also characterized by a CpG&#x0002f;GpC ratio that is &#x0003e;0.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c45">45</xref>). The <italic>PURG</italic>&#x02013;<italic>WRN</italic> promoter region has these features. Similarly, the two genes each have no TATA or CAAT boxes. Human <italic>PURG</italic> may also be a housekeeping gene, but, if so, its levels must be quite low in certain cells or under certain conditions, as indicated by the expression levels in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f7">7</xref>.</p><p>There are several potential ATG translation start sites in the <italic>hPURG</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTR prior to the one at which translation actually initiates. This is unusual among gene 5&#x02032;-UTRs. Note, however, that <italic>WRN</italic> also has two ATG codons upstream of its translation start site. In each case, for either gene, the upstream ATGs do not have favorable surrounding consensus sequences for translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c27">27</xref>) and they are followed shortly thereafter by stop codons.</p></sec><sec><title>Pur&#x003b3; protein isoforms relate structural features of Pur family members to neoplasia</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f7">7</xref> reveals that the <italic>PURG</italic> gene is highly expressed in many tumor cell lines. In cells in which the <italic>PURG-B</italic> form is expressed the <italic>PURG-A</italic> form is also present at high levels. The results suggest that enhanced expression of <italic>PURG</italic> may be regulated at the level of initiation of transcription. It remains to be determined whether or not increased <italic>PURG</italic> transcription is coupled to increased cell proliferation. The present results likely extend the Pur family to comprise at least four distinct proteins. Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2; are both single-stranded DNA-binding proteins that bind specifically to repeats of GGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c13">13</xref>). The repeat region of Pur&#x003b1; is essential for both DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c17">17</xref>) and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c46">46</xref>) binding. Given the high degree of homology of Pur&#x003b3; repeats to those of the other Pur proteins, it is likely that the Pur&#x003b3; DNA- and RNA-binding properties are similar, although this remains to be demonstrated. Outside the repeat motifs there are important distinctions between Pur proteins. Both the Pur&#x003b3;-A and -B forms contain the sequence QGSRRRQKHS, a potential nuclear localization signal absent from Pur&#x003b1; and Pur&#x003b2;. Thus, while Pur&#x003b1; access to, and exclusion from, the nucleus is highly regulated by multiple amino acid motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c15">15</xref>), Pur&#x003b3; may be more stably directed there. All human Pur proteins contain a variation of the Pur&#x003b1; psycho motif, located C-terminal to the repeats and implicated in Rb binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c47">47</xref>). Part of this motif in Pur&#x003b1; includes a potential casein kinase II Ser phosphorylation site in the form FCKYSEEM. This differs in the hPur family members as follows:</p><p>FCKYSEEM Pur&#x003b1;</p><p>FCRYADEM Pur&#x003b2;</p><p>FIKYEEEM Pur&#x003b3;-A</p><p>In Pur&#x003b1; a negative charge may be conferred on the S by phosphorylation. In Pur&#x003b2; this is not possible at the A. In Pur&#x003b3;-A the E residue specifies a permanent negative charge. Given that this is reportedly in a protein&#x02013;protein interaction region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c17">17</xref>), this change could be functionally significant, although further work must substantiate this. It is most notable that Pur&#x003b3;-B completely lacks the psycho motif. Thus, while Rb binding may be altered among Pur&#x003b1;, Pur&#x003b2; and Pur&#x003b3;-A, it may not be possible at all for Pur&#x003b3;-B. In this regard, Pur&#x003b3;-B may be a dominant-negative form of Pur protein, since it contains the conserved DNA- and RNA-binding repeats. Its preferential expression in certain tumor cells could conceivably be related to the propensity of such cells to evade Rb-controlled cell cycle checkpoints. The <italic>PURG</italic> B-form is expressed in colon adenocarcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f7">7</xref>). It would be interesting to know whether such expression occurs early or late in the progression to neoplasia.</p></sec><sec><title>Novel aspects of transcription termination&#x0002f;polyadenylation control expression of hPur&#x003b3; isoforms</title><p>A novel mechanism involving differential termination&#x0002f;polyadenylation controls the expression of mRNAs for the two Pur&#x003b3; isoforms in both human and mouse. Little is known about the control of transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II in higher eukaryotes, but it is widely held that termination occurs 3&#x02032;, and quite proximal, to a polyadenylation signal. The precise mechanism by which synthesis of the two <italic>PURG</italic> mRNAs is regulated are not known, but one observation is clear: <italic>PURG-A</italic> and <italic>PURG-B</italic> transcripts are polyadenylated at different sites which are greatly distant in the genome. Therefore, it can be concluded that some aspect of termination&#x0002f;polyadenylation differentially controls the expression of <italic>PURG-A</italic> and <italic>PURG-B</italic> mRNAs. In yeast certain proteins controlling termination and those controlling polyadenylation interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c48">48</xref>). In higher eukaryotes it has been reported that specific G-rich sequences near to, and downstream of, a polyadenylation signal induce transcriptional pausing, leading to the cleavage that precedes polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf356c49">49</xref>). This tight coupling of termination and polyadenylation strongly mitigates against a termination site &#x0003e;30 kb 3&#x02032; to a polyadenylation signal. Therefore, it is likely that a factor, or factors, controlling coupled termination&#x0002f;polyadenylation is responsible for differential expression of the two Pur&#x003b3; isoforms.</p><p>There is a canonical polyadenylation signal AATAAA located 14 bp upstream of the <italic>hPURG-B</italic> poly(A) site. In mouse this signal is 15 bp upstream of the <italic>mPURG-B</italic> poly(A) site. There is no such sequence near the <italic>hPURG-A</italic> poly(A) site, yet <italic>PURG-A</italic> comprises the bulk of the expressed <italic>PURG</italic> in most cells. There are several sequences similar to AATAAA in the vicinity of the 3&#x02032;-end of <italic>PURG-A</italic> and it is conceivable that a cryptic polyadenylation signal is employed. There is also an ATTAAA element &#x0223c;300 nt from the 3&#x02032;-end of <italic>PURG-A</italic> and it is also possible that it is functional.</p><p>The detection of <italic>PURG-B</italic> expression primarily in tumor cells raises the possibility that a polyadenylation signal near the 3&#x02032;-end of <italic>PURG-A</italic> could be mutated, thus allowing transcription to proceed through the <italic>PURG-B</italic> exon. We cannot currently state that this never happens, but, thus far, sequencing of the 3&#x02032;-UTR from mRNAs from several tumor tissues and lines has not revealed any mutations or deletions. Thus, if <italic>PURG</italic> transcription is aberrant in cancer, as suggested in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf356f7">7</xref>, it is likely to be due to alterations in the termination&#x0002f;polyadenylation mechanism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf356f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Genomic organization of the <italic>PURG</italic> and <italic>WRN</italic> genes at human chromosome band 8p11&#x02013;12.
