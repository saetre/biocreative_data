Although most ALS cases occur sporadically, without known family history, a subset of these are genetically inherited. In particular, twenty percent of familial ALS cases are linked to mutations in the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Transgenic mice expressing mutant forms of SOD1 (mSOD1 mice) recapitulate the phenotype of ALS and provide the only currently available faithful model of ALS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-GonzalezdeAguilar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Boillee1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the selective motor neuron degeneration in ALS remain elusive. Recent work in mSOD1 mice showed that motor neuron death is not cell autonomous and involves defects in other cell types than neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Boillee2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Clement1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this notion, recent evidence showed that the pathophysiology of ALS includes widely systemic defects in both patients and animal models. In particular, energy homeostasis is strikingly abnormal in ALS patients since both sporadic and familial ALS patients present with increased energy expenditure (hypermetabolism) and hyperlipidemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Desport1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Funalot1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These systemic defects are in some yet unknown way linked to the disease process since hyperlipidemia correlates with increased survival in ALS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Dupuis1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Our work in animal models showed that mSOD1 mice were in energy deficit, with decreased adipose stores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Dupuis2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Fergani1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This condition was elicited by increased energy expenditure, ie hypermetabolism, and was due to an increased consumption of both glucid and lipid nutrients in skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Dupuis2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Fergani1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Early reduced muscle ATP levels, long before the onset of motor impairment further indicates impaired fuel processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Dupuis3">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Feeding these animals with a fat enriched diet replenished, to some extent, adipose stores and, most importantly, increased the lifespan and delayed muscle denervation of transgenic mSOD1 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Dupuis2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Mattson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, ALS is associated with alterations of energy homeostasis which interferes with the pathological process.</p><p>Whether muscle hypermetabolism is sufficient <italic>per se</italic> to drive motor neuron degeneration remains however unknown. To address this question, we used here transgenic mice with muscular overexpression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial protein typically present in brown adipose tissue that induces non-shivering thermogenesis by uncoupling mitochondrial electron transport from ATP synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Hoerter1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Couplan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Ricquier1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. These animals naturally displayed an age-dependent deterioration of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), and progressive signs of denervation that eventually led to mild late-onset motor neuron pathology in the spinal cord. NMJ regeneration and functional recovery were profoundly delayed following injury to the sciatic nerve and mutant SOD1 pathology was exacerbated by muscle UCP1 expression. These findings show that a relatively mild mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle recapitulates the earliest pathological events in ALS.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mitochondrial uncoupling leads to muscle weakness but preserves muscle structure</title><p>To achieve a chronic muscle-restricted uncoupling, we used mice overexpressing UCP1 under the control of the promoter of the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) gene. Previous work on these MCK-UCP1 mice had shown slight decreases in both mitochondrial membrane potential (from 170 mV to 160 mV) and respiratory control ratio (from 3.3 to 2.5), which resulted in a mild phenotype primarily characterized by diminished muscle mass and fast-to-slow muscle fiber type switching in muscles such as the gastrocnemius <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Couplan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. As a first step toward the characterization of the neuromuscular phenotype in these animals, we sought to replicate and extend these results. Consistent with this, we found that MCK-UCP1 mice were lighter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g001">figure 1A</xref>), and the cross-sectional surface of gastrocnemius myofibers showed a dramatic age-dependent reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g001">figure 1C</xref>), which could account for their decreased grip strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g001">figure 1B</xref>). Since Han and collaborators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Han1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> had previously reported that mice overexpressing high levels of UCP1 suffer from a prominent myopathic disorder, we checked whether the reduction in muscle fiber size observed in our animals could reflect a degenerative process. Serum concentrations of creatine kinase and lactate, an increase of which is indicative of muscular dystrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-JimenezMallebrera1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, were not increased in MCK-UCP1 mice but rather tended to decrease, as compared to wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g002">figure 2A</xref>). In addition, we did not detect the presence of myofibers containing centrally located nuclei (data not shown), that would be a sign of the regenerative process observed in muscular dystrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-JimenezMallebrera1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with these findings, MCK-UCP1 muscles did not upregulate the satellite cell marker M-Cadherin, which is typically found in such regenerative processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g002">figure 2B</xref>). Necrotic myofibers, another hallmark of muscular dystrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-JimenezMallebrera1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, can be easily identified by their permeability to Evans blue dye. In control experiments, a huge amount of Evans blue positive myofibers were observed in wild-type muscles following cardiotoxin injury, but only very few atrophic myofibers (less than 1 per field) were detected in 7-month-old MCK-UCP1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g002">figure 2D</xref>). Finally, mRNA levels of atrogin-1, an ubiquitin-ligase whose expression is strongly upregulated upon muscle wasting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Gomes1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, appeared unchanged in MCK-UCP1 mice, as compared to wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g002">figure 2B</xref>). Altogether, these findings confirm that mild mitochondrial uncoupling in MCK-UCP1 mice does not cause a dystrophic or massive proteolytic degeneration in skeletal muscle.</p><fig id="pone-0005390-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005390.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Muscle phenotype of MCK-UCP1 mice.</title><p>A: body weight of male (empty diamonds) and female (empty triangles) wild-type mice, and male (filled diamonds) and female (filled triangles) MCK-UCP1 mice as a function of time. &#x0002a;, p&#x0003c;0.05 vs corresponding MCK-UCP1 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7 mice per group).

In contrast, the postsynaptic primary gutters in MCK-UCP1 fibers appeared less ramified already at 1 month of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g003">figure 3A</xref>, pictures e-h), and, in very rare cases, fragmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g003">figure 3A</xref>, picture h). At 7 months of age, fragmentation was very frequent, and the size of the postsynaptic apparatus had decreased, as compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g003">figure 3A</xref>, pictures i&#x02013;l). Moreover, in the few NMJs presenting with normal primary gutters at this age, thinner cisternae (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g003">figure 3A</xref>, picture i) and neighboring ectopic AchR clusters (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g003">figure 3A</xref>, picture i) could be detected.

To this end, we performed longitudinal electromyography studies. Before 6 weeks of age, MCK-UCP1 mice showed normal electrical activity recordings, as compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g004">figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that NMJs were functional and properly innervated at that age. Later on, however, a subset of mice started to exhibit fasciculations, which gradually progressed in older animals to strongly altered patterns characterized by fibrillations, fasciculations and myotonic discharges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g004">figure 4A</xref>). After 7 months of age, all the mice were affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g004">figure 4B</xref>). To test whether this abnormal electrical activity was the reflect of altered neurotransmission at the NMJ, as occurs for example in congenital myasthenic syndromes, we recorded the muscle evoked response to repetitive nerve stimulation. If neuromuscular transmission was affected, a sharp decrease (&#x0003e;10&#x00025;) in the amplitude of the electrical response should be observed after repeated stimulations, but no differences were detected between MCK-UCP1 and wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g004">figure 4C</xref>), indicating that neuromuscular transmission did not appear compromised.

Since acetylcholine receptor (AchR) clustering is likely to be an energy-dependent process, we hypothesized that mitochondrial uncoupling occuring in MCK-UCP1 muscles lead to an inability of these muscles to maintain AchR clusters with age. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether old MCK-UCP1 mice were still able to newly form ectopic AchR clusters.

In particular, large AchR clusters were frequently detected in the extra junctional area in MCK-UCP1 muscle fibers, whereas only small AchR clusters could be observed and were closely confined to the synaptic region in wild-type fibers.

To this aim, we performed sciatic nerve crush studies.

After nerve crush, motor recovery was evaluated by the sciatic functional index (SFI), a scale based on the shape of footprints, and grip strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-SchiavetodeSouza1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In wild-type mice, the SFI decreased to a minimum 3 days post-operation and then progressively recovered to reach a normal value at day 15.

In young mice, mitochondrial uncoupling did not appear to interfere with the development of a normal, pretzel-shaped innervated NMJ. However, as shown here by using a combination of histological and electrophysiological techniques, these NMJs progressively underwent denervation upon aging. This in turn leads to a distal axonopathy that progressed with age to a limited but clear motor neuron degeneration. Our results indicate that the progressive deterioration of NMJs in aging MCK-UCP1 mice results from an intrinsic instability of the axon rather than from a post-synaptic dismantlement of the NMJ. Two lines of results are consistent with this notion. First, the formation of AchR clusters in response to neural agrin was not impaired but rather enhanced in MCK-UCP1 muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g007">figure 7</xref>), suggesting that the complex postsynaptic muscular machinery responsible for AchR clustering is not impaired. Second, functional recovery after nerve injury was considerably delayed in MCK-UCP1 muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005390-g008">figure 8</xref>), suggesting a rather inefficient nerve terminal regeneration and a severe impairment of the presynaptic mechanisms that underlie axonal regrowth. A very plausible explanation for the progressive denervation and impaired reinnervation observed in MCK-UCP1 mice is that mitochondrial uncoupling in muscle modifies the production of retrograde signals required for presynaptic motor ending stability. Since, at present, little is known on the nature of the signals produced by an adult muscle fiber to maintain the stability of the neuromuscular contact, the precise signalling mechanisms elicited by mitochondrial uncoupling and their relative contribution to the pathology of these mice will require further investigations. Such studies will undoubtly shed light on new retrograde muscle to nerve survival signalling pathways. It is important to note that our current results are compatible with two pathological scenarios: first, the NMJ alterations might be due to cell autonomous effects of transgene expression. In this scenario, mitochondrial uncoupling in a given muscle fiber would locally lead to the degeneration of its innervating axon. Alternatively, since transgene expression in muscles leads to broadly systemic effects, these systemic alterations could weaken NMJs and neuromuscular contacts. Indeed, caloric restriction is able to accelerate the outcome in mSOD1 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Pedersen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that interventions ameliorating systemic energy metabolism might also weaken motor neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Muscle mitochondrial uncoupling does not lead to paralysis or premature death</title><p>Although displaying a massive destruction of the NMJs, MCK-UCP1 mice do not display a full blown fatal motor neuron disease. This apparently paradoxical situation may rest on the fact that not all the muscles in MCK-UCP1 mice are affected by UCP1 overexpression. In fact, numerous muscles beds, including the soleus, the diaphragm and heart muscles appeared relatively normal in these animals, despite that they express almost equivalent levels of UCP1 protein than in severely affected muscles such as the gastrocnemius or the tibialis anterior muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Couplan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and data not shown). From their seminal observations, Couplan and collaborators concluded that muscles undergoing regular contractions, and therefore resting on a continuous mitochondrial ATP production, are protected from the uncoupling activity of UCP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Couplan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with the idea that regular contractions trigger a sustained low mitochondrial potential in these muscles that inhibits the protonophoric activity of UCP1. Thus, despite being overexpressed in all muscles, the transgene only affects fast-twitch fibers, which are predominant in the gastrocnemius <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Hoerter1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Couplan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

The pathology of MCK-UCP1 mice begins with NMJ destruction and distal axonopathy and then progresses towards astrocytosis in the spinal cord and mild motor neuron loss, both typical features of motor neuron diseases. Importantly, in ALS too, the destruction of the NMJ appears as the first detectable pathophysiological event and precedes axonal degeneration and motor neuron death in mutant SOD1 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Fischer1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In MCK-UCP1 mice, NMJ destruction is due to a muscle specific alteration in mitochondrial function and similar alterations have been documented in the muscle of both sporadic ALS patients and mutant SOD1 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Dupuis5">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle might be either directly caused by mutant SOD1 expression in muscle or indirectly through mutant SOD1 expression in other cell types. Consistent with the first hypothesis, a recent study by Dobrowolny and collaborators showed that restricted mutant SOD1 expression in muscle is sufficient to trigger muscle atrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction. Similar to the situation in MCK-UCP1 mice, muscle restricted expression of mutant SOD1 triggered some of the pathological aspects of ALS in the spinal cord, including oxidative stress and gene expression profiles consistent with microgliosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Dobrowolny1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In view of the parallel phenotypes between mutant SOD1 and MCK-UCP1 mice, one can suggest that mutant SOD1 expression in skeletal muscle is able to trigger axonal degeneration through the direct implication of mitochondria. This hypothesis is however not completely consistent with the available evidence. Two studies showed that a loss of mutant SOD1 expression in muscle did not change disease outcome in mutant SOD1 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Miller1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Towne1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that either minute quantities of remaining mSOD1 in muscle are still sufficient to trigger the disease or that the knockdown of mutant SOD1 in muscle was performed too late in the course of the pathology. Whatever the exact contribution of muscle mSOD1 to mitochondrial dysfunction in these mice, the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying motor neuron pathology in MCK-UCP1 mice shed light on the early pathological events of ALS and might then open avenues for potential therapeutic strategies in ALS and other motor neuron disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals and surgery</title><p>Heterozygous MCK-UCP1 mice were bred on the original genetic background and identified by tail DNA genotyping as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Couplan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

PCR analysis was carried out on a Bio-Rad iCycler System using iQSYBR Green Supermix. A specific standard curve was performed in parallel for each gene, and each sample was quantified in duplicate. PCR conditions were 3 min at 94&#x000b0;C, followed by 40 cycles of 45 s at 94&#x000b0;C and 10 s at 60&#x000b0;C. Data were analyzed using the iCycler software, and normalized to the 18S ribosomal subunit RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Recombinant agrin injections</title><p>Chicken neural mini-agrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005390-Meier1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> was cloned into the pCEP-Pu expression vector. The recombinant protein was targeted to the secretory pathway by the signal peptide of BM4O and it included a carboxy-terminal His6-tag. The carboxy-terminal included the 4- and 8-amino-acid inserts at the A/y and B/z sites and thus represents the neural isoform. The secreted recombinant agrin was purified on Ni-column (Ni-NTA agarose, Qiagen) from the culture medium of 293 EBNA cells stably transfected with the pCEP-Pu-agrin vector. Mice were anesthesized as mentioned above, and the tibialis anterior was bilaterally injected with 500 ng of recombinant agrin. Seven days after injection, mice were subjected to unilateral sciatic nerve axotomy and were sacrificed seven days after. Tibialis anterior muscles were immersed in 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde during 30 min and stored in PBS until use. Muscle bundles were prepared and stained for AchR as previously described.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as the mean&#x000b1;SEM.
