HIF-1&#x003b1; (and other &#x003b1; subunits) is tightly controlled mostly at the protein level, through the concerted action of a class of enzymes called PHDs (prolyl hydroxylases) 1, 2 and 3. Most of the knowledge of HIF derives from studies following hypoxic stress; however, HIF-1&#x003b1; stabilization is also found in non-hypoxic conditions through an unknown mechanism. In the present study, we demonstrate that NF-&#x003ba;B (nuclear factor &#x003ba;B) is a direct modulator of HIF-1&#x003b1; expression. The HIF-1&#x003b1; promoter is responsive to selective NF-&#x003ba;B subunits. siRNA (small interfering RNA) studies for individual NF-&#x003ba;B members revealed differential effects on HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA levels, indicating that NF-&#x003ba;B can regulate basal HIF-1&#x003b1; expression. Finally, when endogenous NF-&#x003ba;B is induced by TNF&#x003b1; (tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1;) treatment, HIF-1&#x003b1; levels also change in an NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent manner. In conclusion, we find that NF-&#x003ba;B can regulate basal TNF&#x003b1; and, in certain circumstances, the hypoxia-induced HIF-1&#x003b1;.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)</kwd><kwd>nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B)</kwd><kwd>tumour necrosis factor (TNF)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation</kwd><kwd>EMSA, electrophoretic mobility-shift assay</kwd><kwd>GLUT, glucose transporter</kwd><kwd>HEK, human embryonic kidney</kwd><kwd>HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor</kwd><kwd>I&#x003ba;B, inhibitor of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B</kwd><kwd>IKK, I&#x003ba;B kinase</kwd><kwd>NF-&#x003ba;B, nuclear factor &#x003ba;B</kwd><kwd>PCNA, proliferating-cell nuclear antigen</kwd><kwd>PHD, prolyl hydroxylase</kwd><kwd>qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR</kwd><kwd>ROS, reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>RT, reverse transcriptase</kwd><kwd>siRNA, small interfering RNA</kwd><kwd>TNF&#x003b1;, tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>VEGF, vascular-endothelial growth factor</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><ref-count count="32"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) plays key roles in development, physiological processes and pathological conditions as its presence affects survival, cell-cycle progression and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although first identified as the main transcription factor activated under low oxygen tensions, HIF is a key transcription factor activated by cytokines, oncogenes and ROS (reactive oxygen species) under normoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. HIF is a heterodimeric factor composed of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits [also called ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Although HIF-1&#x003b2; is constitutively expressed and not regulated by oxygen levels, HIF-&#x003b1; subunits are tightly controlled at the protein level. This occurs, predominantly, through the concerted action of a class of enzymes called PHDs (prolyl hydroxylases) that catalyse prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-&#x003b1; subunits, which incessantly targets them for VHL (von Hippel&#x02013;Lindau protein)-dependent 26S proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. PHD enzymes require molecular O<sub>2</sub>, 2-oxoglutarate, iron ions (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) and ascorbic acid to be fully active, and are inhibited in hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Four PHDs have been identified so far, but only three, PHDs 1, 2 and 3, have been functionally characterized in terms of HIF modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. PHD2 is thought to be the dominant PHD in controlling HIF-1&#x003b1; following hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, all three PHDs can be regulated by HIF and by oxygen levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the HIF-&#x003b1; stabilization mechanism controlled by prolyl hydroxylation, hydroxylation of Asn<sup>803</sup> in HIF-1&#x003b1; or Asn<sup>851</sup> in HIF-2&#x003b1;, prevents interaction with the CH1 domains of histone acetyltransferases {p300/CBP [CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein)-binding protein]} that act as transcriptional co-activators. This modification alters the ability of HIF-1/HIF-2 to transactivate their target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although most knowledge regarding HIF-1 has been derived from studies following hypoxic stress, HIF-1 stabilization has also been found in non-hypoxic settings, such as relatively well-oxygenated regions of tumours, and in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the mechanisms for HIF stabilization under those conditions have not been elucidated. Many of the stimuli that induce HIF-1 in normoxia are known to activate a number of other transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B (nuclear factor &#x003ba;B). It is therefore plausible that cross-talk between these two transcription factors can occur. In addition, the HIF-1&#x003b1; and PHD1 promoters contain NF-&#x003ba;B-binding sites, which have not been functionally characterized. Importantly, HIF-1&#x003b1; stabilization and induction through H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was recently shown to be NF-&#x003ba;B dependent under normoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is the collective name for a transcription factor that exists as either a hetero- or homo-dimer and is formed by a family of subunits called RelA (p65), RelB, cRel, p50 and its precursor p105 (NF-&#x003ba;B1), and p52 and its precursor p100 (NF-&#x003ba;B2). Some dimers are more prevalent than others and they shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus but are predominantly sequestered in the inactive state in the cytoplasm, inhibited by members of the I&#x003ba;B (inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Upon stimulation, by compounds such as TNF&#x003b1; (tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1;), oncogenes or UV light, a kinase signalling cascade results in phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B, signalling ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation, resulting in NF-&#x003ba;B release and translocation into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The activated NF-&#x003ba;B dimer then binds to target DNA sequences in the nucleus where it regulates transcription of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes. Although NF-&#x003ba;B activation is extremely fast, the cyclic nature of NF-&#x003ba;B activity, in combination with post-translational modifications and hyper- and hypo-acetylated histones at target genes are indicative of further levels of regulatory complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>There have been several studies demonstrating cross-talk between the NF-&#x003ba;B and HIF signalling pathways, including shared target genes, but a direct link has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we show that several NF-&#x003ba;B subunits are bound to the HIF-1&#x003b1; promoter. NF-&#x003ba;B depletion results in reduced basal levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA. In addition, we demonstrate that TNF&#x003b1;-induced NF-&#x003ba;B can increase HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA, protein and activity levels, leading to transactivation of target genes in normoxia. Changes in HIF-1&#x003b1; levels following hypoxia are only seen when the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is completely blocked. These results demonstrate that NF-&#x003ba;B can directly modulate the HIF-1&#x003b1; pathway, and that this modulation is sufficient to alter HIF target gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Tissue culture, medium and hypoxia treatments</title><p>U2OS osteosarcoma and HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cell lines were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures.

Furthermore, this prolonged TNF&#x003b1; treatment also induced increases in two HIF target genes: GLUT1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b). To test whether the observed increases in HIF-1&#x003b1;, GLUT1 and GLUT3 protein resulted from higher mRNA levels, qRT-PCR was performed for the indicated times following TNF&#x003b1; treatment.

We took advantage of genetic knockout cells and also used siRNA for the upstream kinase complex that regulates NF-&#x003ba;B. We could observe that, when IKK&#x003b1; or IKK&#x003b2; were depleted, either by genetic knockout or siRNA-mediated silencing, there was very little effect on HIF-1&#x003b1; levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>a and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>b), suggesting that protein stabilization can compensate for any impairment in the canonical or non-canonical pathways. However, when both IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2; were depleted, HIF-1 stabilization in response to hypoxia was severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>c). This suggests that HIF-1&#x003b1; gene transcription is mediated by several subunits of NF-&#x003ba;B and these derive from both pathways of activation. These results support our mRNA and ChIP results on how NF-&#x003ba;B controls the HIF pathway.

As such, we hypothesized that novel interactions between two key transcription factors, NF-&#x003ba;B and HIF, existed in this process. In the present study, we demonstrate that HIF-1&#x003b1; basal mRNA levels are controlled by several NF-&#x003ba;B subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1&#x02013;3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In addition, we show that TNF&#x003b1;-, and to some extent hypoxia-, induced NF-&#x003ba;B regulates HIF-1&#x003b1; levels and activity, triggering the transcription of target genes such as GLUT3 and PHD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4&#x02013;6</xref>).</p><p>The results of the present study have numerous implications for a number of pathologies where NF-&#x003ba;B and HIF-1 are deregulated, such as rheumatoid arthritis or cancer. However, despite these implications, NF-&#x003ba;B regulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; could be stimulus-specific or even cell-type-specific. The evidence for this comes from the available genetic knockout models. While HIF-1&#x003b1; deletion results in embryonic lethality at day 9&#x02013;11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], with defects evident as early as 7&#x000a0;days, combined genetic deletion of IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2; results in lethality at day 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Single deletions of IKK&#x003b1;, IKK&#x003b2; or RelA result in lethality at much later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In HIF-1&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, defects are seen in neural tube formation, cardiovascular malformations and increases in cell death in the cephalic mesemchyme. Of interest, IKK&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; double null mice also have defects in neurulation, but these seem to be associated with increased apoptosis in the neuronal epithelium. It would be interesting to re-analyse these mice embryos for HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in the different tissues.</p><p>The results of the present study also demonstrate that TNF&#x003b1; induces HIF-1 activity despite the presence of oxygen.
