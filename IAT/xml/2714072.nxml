Using isoform-specific antibodies, we detected a sizable pool of SYT isoforms in the cytosol where the proteins were organized into filamentous arrays. Actin and actin-associated proteins co-immunoprecipitated with SYT isoforms, which also co-sedimented and co-localized with the actin cytoskeleton in cultured cells and tissues. The association of SYT with actin bundles was extensive yet stopped short of the distal ends at focal adhesions. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton also led to a breakdown of the filamentous organization of SYT isoforms in the cytosol. RNAi ablation of SYT/L alone or both isoforms markedly impaired formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions but did not affect formation of cortical actin bundles. Furthermore, ablation of SYT led to markedly impaired adhesion and spreading on fibronectin and laminin-111 but not on collagen types I or IV. These findings indicate that cytoplasmic SYT isoforms interact with actin filaments and function in the ability cells to bind and react to specific extracellular matrices.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>SYT (<italic>SY</italic>novial sarcoma <italic>T</italic>ranslocated gene or SS18) was discovered as part of a nuclear chimeric protein coded by a t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) translocation found in many synovial sarcomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006455-Clark1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consequently, native SYT, though devoid of a consensus nuclear localization signal, has also been considered to be a nuclear proto-oncogene.

Alternative splicing produces at least four isoforms of SYT, and the most prominent of these are the long (SYT/L; 56 kD) and short (SYT/S; 50.5 kD) isoforms, which differ by inclusion of exon 8 in SYT/L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006455-deBruijn4">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our findings also demonstrate a role for SYT isoforms in cell-matrix interactions but indicate that cytosolic SYT - the biology of which has not been explored - is the critical pool that functions in adhesion. We found that cytosolic SYT isoforms bind F-actin and are involved in cytoskeletal organization. Ablation of SYT led to impaired assembly of actin stress fibers and cell spreading and adhesion on specific extracellular matrix substrata (fibronectin and laminin-111) but not others (types I and IV collagen). These findings indicate that cytosolic SYT functions in the differential signaling controlling how a cell responds and distinguishes among specific extracellular cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>SYT Antibodies</title><p>We generated two polyclonal antibodies: one against the N-terminal half of SYT, which is common to all isoforms, and the other against the peptide sequence coded by exon 8, which is present only in SYT/L. Both antibodies were affinity purified using the recombinant or peptide antigens, and we confirmed the specificity of these antibodies by several approaches. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation of human osteosarcoma U2OS cell lysates demonstrated that the panSYT (pSYT) antibody reacted with both SYT/S (50.5 kD) and SYT/L (56 kD) and that the SYT/L-specific antibody detected only SYT/L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006455-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Immunofluorescence revealed signal in both the nucleus and cytosol, which was ablated with excess antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006455-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

Similar results with these assays were obtained with all other cell types examined, including rat lung fibroblasts (RLF), monkey kidney fibroblasts (Cos-1), and mouse fibroblasts (3T3). These data demonstrate that our antibodies specifically recognize SYT isoforms across mammalian species. In addition, even though the epitope of the pSYT antibody is common to all putative isoforms, we did not detect the other, less-abundant SYT isoforms. Indeed, amplification of SYT cDNA confirmed that SYT/S and SYT/L accounted for essentially all mRNAs detected, with only a minor level (&#x0003c;1&#x00025;) of transcript for the SYT/vs1 isoform (not shown), which lacks exons 7 and 8.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>SYT Isoforms Localize to the Cytoplasm</title><p>Immunofluorescence with either SYT antibody verified nuclear signal in both cells and tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006455-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>); however, signal for SYT protein was also seen in the cytosol of all cells examined, typically in a filamentous pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006455-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

Immunoblotting for the nuclear envelope proteins, lamin-A/C, demonstrated no detectable contamination of nuclear contents in the cytosolic fraction. The relatively strong signal for the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit, used as a plasma membrane maker, in the P1 pellet likely indicates that most of the plasma membrane sedimented in nuclear pellet. Indeed, fractionation of biotinylated surface proteins demonstrated that plasma membrane are brought down in nuclear pellet (data not shown).</p><p>Further fractionation of the cytosolic sample (S1) by ultracentrifugation resulted in essentially all cytosolic SYT in the pellet (P2), which was enriched with cytoskeletal and the remaining membrane components (&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit). No signal for SYT isoforms was detected in the ultra high-speed supernatant (S2), which contained soluble proteins (e.g., RhoGDI) and vesicles (EEA1). Because we did not detect SYT protein on plasma membrane by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006455-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), we hypothesized that cytosolic SYT isoforms were associated with cytoskeletal components in the P2 pellet. Consistent with this idea, exposure to cytochalasin D, which depolymerizes filamentous actin, abolished the cosedimentation of SYT isoforms with the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006455-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>). SYT isoforms sedimented with filamentous (F) actin pools; however, in the presence of cytochalasin D, the level of SYT in the F-actin fraction was markedly reduced. These findings indicate that cytosolic SYT isoforms localized in a subcellular compartment associated with actin cytoskeleton and not with a membrane compartment.</p><fig id="pone-0006455-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006455.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Cytosolic SYT isoforms interact with actin.</title><p>(A) U2OS cells were treated with vehicle (Cnt) or 4 &#x000b5;M cytochalasin D (Cyt D)for 30 min and then G and F actin pools were isolated and immunoblotted with pSYT antibody.

The larger of these resolved as a doublet (Band 1) and contained myosin II heavy chains (MHC) 9 and 10 and the faster migrating band (Band 2) was identified as actin.

Importantly, no other peptides were detected in the excised bands. To assess the specificity of these interactions, we compared immunoprecipitates of control cells and cells with RNAi-ablation of SYT isoforms (verification and controls for the RNAi's are discussed below). The total level of actin was not affected by SYT ablation, but actin and MHCs were not brought down with SYT antibodies from lysates of RNAi knock-down cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006455-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

Although many interactions may be disturbed by GTP-&#x003b3;S or GDP, the recovery of co-immunoprecipitated MHC 9 and 10 was 4.2-fold greater from lysates containing GTP-&#x003b3;S than from lysates with GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006455-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

Our data indicate that cytosolic SYT functions to modulate cytoskeletal organization and adhesion in response to specific matrix substrata. SYT was prominently associated with stress fibers in all tested cells and especially in U2OS cells that have distinct arrays of stress fibers, inclusive of ventral, dorsal, and transverse bundles of actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006455-Hotulainen1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The association of SYT diminished near the cell periphery and stopped short of focal adhesions.</p><p>The interactions between SYT and actin stress fibers were reciprocal though not completely equal. As demonstrated in our studies with cytochalasin D and latrunculin, actin polymerization was required for formation of SYT strands. However, although knock-down of SYT blocked stress fiber formation, it did not impact total actin polymerization as gauged by exaggerated filopodia and cortical actin filaments, a phenotype also seen in <italic>Syt</italic>-null fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006455-Kimura1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we easily detected actin by Sypro Ruby staining in immunoprecipitations with SYT antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006455-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>), but we did not see the SYT proteins themselves. Although the isoforms could have been masked by the IgG heavy chains (a seemingly parsimonious explanation), the lack of visible stained bands at 50 and 55 kD in our immunoprecipitates suggests that the stoichiometry of the SYT:actin interaction favors actin.</p><p>In polarized cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, such as like intestinal epithelial cells, SYT colocalized with circumferential actin belt prominently running along apical-lateral edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006455-g004">Figure 4D,E</xref>), and based on RNAi-cell culture studies, SYT may have an important role in the organization and function of these cytoskeletal elements. In support of this idea, contraction of circumferential actin belt in lining epithelial cells is critical for closure of the neural tube <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006455-Lecuit1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, and <italic>Syt</italic>-null mouse embryos have a marked defect in neural tube closure (Kimura, 2009). Thus, it is possible that this phenotype arises due to lack of an association of SYT with filamentous actin.</p><p>Our data also demonstrate that cytosolic SYT functions in controlling adhesion to specific extracellular matrix substrates. Integrins - heterodimers of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits - are the key receptors that cells use to sense and respond to the pericellular extracellular matrix environment. The ability of integrins to bind matrix ligands and to transduce information of what they have encountered is controlled by upstream (inside-out) receptor activation, formation and maturation of focal complexes and adhesions, and downstream (outside-in) signal transduction, and each of these processes has been functionally linked to the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006455-Raftopoulou1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006455-Giancotti1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006455-Wiesner1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. We speculate that SYT functions primarily upstream of integrin activation and/or focal adhesion formation to affect the activity of specific cell-matrix interactions. The observations that filopodia and cortical actin networks formed in SYT-ablated cells indicate that many of the mechanisms downstream of integrin ligation - particularly events mediated by the small GTPases Rac and cdc42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006455-Raftopoulou1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> - are not dependent on SYT. Furthermore, because focal adhesions and stress fibers formed in SYT-ablated cells on types I and IV collagen but not on fibronectin and laminin-111 and because the integrins that bind fibronectin and laminins are distinct from those that recognize collagens I and IV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006455-Wiesner1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, SYT may function selectively with the fibronectin/laminin-binding integrins.
