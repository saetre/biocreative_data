There are 10 functional isoforms of MTs described, which are divided into 4 classes, designated MT1 &#x02013; 4, on the basis of small differences in protein sequence and charge characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The MTs have been proposed to play an important role in protecting against DNA damage, apoptosis and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Metallothionein 3 (MT3) was first identified as a growth inhibitory factor, expressed in normal brain, which inhibited the survival of neurones in culture and also neurite formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Subsequent studies using glial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] or tumour[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] cells, stably transfected with <italic>MT3</italic>, showed that its endogenous over-expression could inhibit cell growth. More recently, down-regulation of <italic>MT3 </italic>was reported as one of 17 changes in gene expression which was most likely to be associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcome in a range of solid tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. One mechanism for reducing gene expression is methylation of the CpG island when present in the promoter region of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Methylation of the <italic>MT3 </italic>promoter has been observed and has been suggested to cause reduced expression in gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The levels of <italic>MT3 </italic>expression, the frequency of <italic>MT3 </italic>methylation, and correlations between <italic>MT3 </italic>methylation and clinical parameters, have not been investigated in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In this study we used combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] to estimate the frequency of methylation at specific sites within the <italic>MT3 </italic>promoter in oesophageal cancer cell lines, and investigated the relationship between methylation and its expression by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We then measured <italic>MT3 </italic>gene expression and the frequency of <italic>MT3 </italic>methylation in primary oesophageal SCCs and, when available, the histologically normal, proximal resection margin from those patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Methylation analysis of <italic>MT3 </italic>in normal lymphocytes and oesophageal cell lines</title><p>The methylation status of the <italic>MT3 </italic>CpG island was measured by COBRA within 3 overlapping regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Complete digestion of each of the 3 regions was observed for OE33. For TE7, incomplete digestion was observed in the R1 and R2 regions, whilst complete digestion was observed in R3 region. Incomplete digestion was observed in each of the 3 regions for OE21. For OE19, no digestion was observed in the R2 region, but incomplete digestion was observed in the R1 and R3 regions.

We measured methylation of <italic>MT3 </italic>by COBRA in three separate regions of its promoter, and gene expression by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In the oesophageal cell line OE33, which had complete methylation at all the CpG sites analysed, there was also complete transcriptional silencing of the <italic>MT3 </italic>gene. In a further 3 cell oesophageal cancer cell lines, each of which had partial methylation, there was a partial but not complete reduction in gene expression. Treatment of each of these cell lines with aza-dC, which reduced methylation, resulted in an increase in gene expression.</p><p>In those the cell lines which had partial methylation, the amount of methylation could vary between contiguous CpGs in the same cell line, and could vary in particular CpGs between cell lines. Thus, a particular CpG which might be unmethylated in one cell line could be partially or completely methylated in other cell lines expressing similar levels of <italic>MT3</italic>. This is consistent with the reported variability of methylation of the p16 CpG island in primary human mammary epithelial cells during escape from growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene in human cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The significance of this finding is that methods for the measurement of DNA methylation such as methylation specific PCR (MSP) which analyse methylation at one or two CpGs only may misrepresent the methylation pattern of a region. In addition these methods would mislead if they probed CpGs with low levels of methylation in all tissues analysed, such as the site 12 in intron 1 in our analysis of <italic>MT3</italic>. This was methylated in normal lymphocytes and normal oesophageal tissue, as well oesophageal SCC, even though other CpGs were unmethylated and gene expression was high.</p><p>In order to show the relationship between methylation within the regions studied and MT3 gene expression, we incubated cultures of the oesophageal cell lines for approximately two cell divisions with aza-dC, a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase. Because the rate of division varied for each of the cell lines, we determined the length of time required for each of the cell lines to divide twice in the presence of aza-dC using PKH-26 labelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This stable red fluorescent dye inserts into the cytoplasmic membrane, and is distributed equally amongst each of the daughter cells at the time of cell division, such that the mean fluorescence intensity of the cell population is halved with each cell division. As expected, treatment with aza-dC for two cell divisions did not completely demethylate the cell lines. This is because it is only newly synthesised strands which are demethylated, so if in a cell a particular region of DNA is completely methylated on both alleles, after 2 divisions only 75% of the alleles will be demethylated. We found that there was a significant reduction in the amount of methylation at each of the methylated sites analysed following drug treatment. Interestingly, the amount of the reduction varied between different CpG sites within a cell line, and varied from cell line to cell line at a given site. The reasons for this cell line and regional variation in the extent of demethylation are unknown.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the methylation of only a subset of available CpG sites within a region can be sufficient to reduce transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], with a greater reduction in transcription as the density of CpG methylation increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Complete methylation of all the sites in the regions which we studied correlated with lack of any gene expression, while methylation of only a subset of sites correlated with some <italic>MT3 </italic>expression, and the further reduction in methylation resulting from demethylation with aza-dC always correlated with an increase in <italic>MT3 </italic>expression. In this study we evaluated <italic>MT3 </italic>expression only by RT-PCR, because an antibody specific for the MT3 protein was not commercially available. However, previous studies have shown that when the <italic>MT3 </italic>transcript was able to be detected the protein was also detectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Our interest in <italic>MT3 </italic>came from a report that solid tumours with a specific pattern of expression of 17 genes, including down-regulation of <italic>MT3</italic>, were most likely to be associated with metastasis and poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Oesophageal SCC is an aggressive disease with a 5 year survival of about 20%, death most commonly due to secondaries. Molecular markers which assist in predicting metasases might help to tailor treatment options better. <italic>MT3 </italic>was first identified as a growth inhibitory factor which decreased the survival of neuronal cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Subsequent studies using stably transfected cell lines showed that up-regulation of <italic>MT3 </italic>was growth inhibitory in some, but not all, cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The reported role of <italic>MT3 </italic>in carcinogenesis is unclear. In gastric carcinomas <italic>MT3 </italic>expression was found to be markedly reduced, but there was no indication of any relationship to outcome in this report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In contrast, levels of <italic>MT3 </italic>protein were shown to be elevated in bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and breast carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This elevated expression was a poor prognostic indicator, being associated with increased tumour stage in bladder carcinoma, and poor disease outcome in some breast carcinomas. In our series of 64 patients with oesophageal SCC we found a degree of methylation in 52% of primary tumours and 3% of the histologically normal proximal resection margin. We observed that <italic>MT3 </italic>expression was frequently down-regulated in primary oesophageal SCC when compared to normal mucosa, and significant down-regulation was most commonly observed in those tumours that were methylated for <italic>MT3</italic>, and not unmethylated tumours. Interestingly, 3 tumours which had methylated DNA also had normal expression of <italic>MT3</italic>. This might reflect a heterozygous pattern of methylation, with only one allele methylated, or a mixed tumour cell population containing some cells which were methylated and some which were not. The techniques used in this study could not distinguish between these possibilities. Also, 3 patients with unmethylated DNA had low levels of <italic>MT3 </italic>expression, perhaps reflecting mutation or other change in the tumour. We found no relationship between methylation status and survival in the subset of patients for whom data were obtainable, suggesting that in these patients there would also be no relationship between gene expression and survival. Methylation and reduced expression of <italic>MT3 </italic>was also not associated with tumour stage or tumour size. Thus a change in <italic>MT3 </italic>expression by itself does not appear to favour increased tumour growth, and methylations status is not associated with survival, in patients with oesophageal SCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that the <italic>MT3 </italic>promoter has a heterogeneous pattern of methylation in oeosphageal cancer cell lines, and is associated with a reduction in the gene expression. In resected oesophageal SCC tissue <italic>MT3 </italic>expression was frequently down-regulated, most commonly in those tumours in which the promoter region was methylated. Methylation or down-regulation of <italic>MT3 </italic>did not correlate with and patient age, gender, smoking or drinking history, tumour stage, volume, lymph node involvement, or patient survival. MT3 methylation does not show promise as a prognostic marker in patients with oesophageal SCC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and tissue samples</title><p>The oesophageal cancer cell lines OE19, OE21, OE33 and TE7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] were each cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Whole blood was obtained from 19 normal donors, none of whom had known cancers or genetic abnormalities. Primary tumour and, when available, non-cancerous proximal resection margin from 64 consecutive patients undergoing oesophagectomy for SCC at the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fourth Hospital, Hebei Medical University, were collected into RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX). Patient gender, age at the time of operation, smoking and drinking history and tumour type, stage, volume, and conventional histopathology were recorded. Survival data were available for 41 patients.

To determine the culture conditions required to achieve at least 2 cell divisions in the presence or absence of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytine (aza-dC), cells, labelled with PKH-26 (Sigma-Aldrich, Sydney, NSW, Australia), were analysed by flow cytometry as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The cells were treated for 72 (OE21, OE33 and TE7) or 96 (OE19) hr with culture medium containing either vehicle or 1 &#x003bc;M aza-dC (Sigma-Aldrich). The medium was then replaced with fresh medium not containing aza-dC, and the cells were incubated for a further 24 hr before harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of bisulphite modified DNA</title><p>Genomic DNA was isolated from normal donor lymphocytes, cultured cells, and RNAlater stabilized tissues. Lymphocytes were isolated from whole blood using Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The adherent cell lines were harvested by detaching the cells from culture flasks using trypsin/EDTA. RNAlater stabilized tissues were homogenised using disposable pestles (Edwards Instruments, Narellan, NSW, Australia). Next, the samples of lymphocytes, cultured cells, or RNAlater stabilised tissues were digested for 3 days with proteinase K and sodium dodecyl sulfate in TES, pH 8. The protein was removed by NaCl precipitation. The DNA was precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in TE, pH 8. The DNA was bisulphite modified using a modification of the method previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Briefly, 2 &#x003bc;g of genomic DNA was denatured by treatment with NaOH at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 min. The DNA was modified using a mixture of 5 M sodium bisulfite (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.72 &#x003bc;M hydroquinone (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 hr at 56&#x000b0;C. The samples were purified using Rapid PCR Purification System (Marligen Biosciences, Ijamsville, MD), desulphonated with NaOH for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C, precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate, and resuspended in 50 &#x003bc;l of TE, pH 8.</p></sec><sec><title>Methylation analysis of the <italic>MT3 </italic>promoter by COBRA</title><p>Bisulphite modified DNA was amplified using primers that amplified 3 overlapping regions, designated R1, R2 and R3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The primers did not discriminate between methylated and unmethylated alleles. The primers and PCR conditions were specific for bisulphite modified DNA, and did not amplify unmodified DNA. All COBRA PCRs were performed in a volume of 50 &#x003bc;l containing 2 &#x003bc;l of bisulphite modified DNA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 &#x003bc;M of forward and reverse primer, and 0.5 U of HotStar Taq in 1 &#x000d7; PCR Buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The reactions were incubated in an Eppendorf Mastercycler at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 min; then 45 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 52, 54 or 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min, and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min; and a 4 min final extension at 72&#x000b0;C (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The PCR products (5 &#x003bc;l) were digested with 5 units of BstUI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in a final volume of 10 &#x003bc;l, for 4 hr at 60&#x000b0;C. BstUI specifically digests at CGCG sites that are retained after bisulphite modification when CpGs are methylated. The unmethylated cytosines are deaminated to uracil by the bisulphite reaction, then amplified as thymine in the PCR reaction, and so are not digested by BstUI. The digested PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The intensity of each band was quantified and converted to nanograms of DNA using Kodak ID Image Analysis Software (Kodak, Rochester, NY). For each gel, 250 ng of the molecular weight marker pUC19/Hpa II (GeneWorks, Adelaide, SA, Australia) was used as a standard to determine DNA fragment size and mass. Restriction maps for each digest were used to determine the length of all possible fragments, and the number of molecules in each band were determined by multiplying the mass of DNA in each band by its' fragment length. The frequency of methylation at each BstUI site was then estimated by dividing the number of molecules for each fragment by the total number of molecules in the digest.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Primer sequences and related information.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Primer</td><td align="center">Genome position<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center">Primer sequence</td><td align="center">Annealing temperature</td><td align="center">Product size</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">R1-forward</td><td align="center">+148</td><td align="center">5'-AGTATYGTTATTTGTTGTTATTAGTTAAGT-3'</td><td align="center">54&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">298 bp</td></tr><tr><td align="left">R1-reverse</td><td align="center">+445</td><td align="center">5'-TAAAATACCAAATCTCCCTATTCTC-3'</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">R2-forward</td><td align="center">-8</td><td align="center">5'-GAGYGGGTTTYGGTAGTGTATATAT-3'</td><td align="center">52&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">217 bp</td></tr><tr><td align="left">R2-reverse</td><td align="center">+209</td><td align="center">5'-TAAACRAACTTCTCCAAACAACTAAAC-3'</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">R3-forward</td><td align="center">+58</td><td align="center">5'-GAAATGGAATAYGTTTTTTGTTAGTGAT-3'</td><td align="center">60&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">427 bp</td></tr><tr><td align="left">R3-reverse</td><td align="center">-369</td><td align="center">5'-ACTCCRACRCACRCACTACATCT-3'</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">MT3-forward</td><td></td><td align="center">5'-GACCTGCCCCTGCCCTTCTGGTGG-3'</td><td align="center">69&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">219 bp</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MT3-reverse</td><td></td><td align="center">5'-GCTCCACACGGAGGGGTGCCTTCT-3'</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">ACTB-forward</td><td></td><td align="center">5'-TTGCCGACAGGATGCAGAAG-3'</td><td align="center">59&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">101 bp</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ACTB-reverse</td><td></td><td align="center">5'-CTTTCCAAGCGGAGCCATGTCTGG-3'</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">PBGD-forward</td><td></td><td align="center">5'-CTTTCCAAGCGGAGCCATGTCTGG-3'</td><td align="center">59&#x000b0;C</td><td align="center">377 bp</td></tr><tr><td align="left">PBGD-reverse</td><td></td><td align="center">5'-CATGAGGGTTTTCCCGCTTGCAGA-3'</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a </sup>Nucleotide position relative to the transcription start site.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Analysis of <italic>MT3 </italic>expression by quantitative real-time RT-PCR</title><p>Cell line RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) with an on-column DNase I digestion.
