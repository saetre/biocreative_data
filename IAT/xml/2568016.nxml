These proteins temporally associate with kinetochores that have not achieved bipolar attachment. MAD1 specifically localizes and recruits MAD2 to microtubule-free kinetochores and facilitates binding of MAD2 and CDC20, an APC/C activator, thereby inhibiting APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sironi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">De Antoni et al., 2005</xref>). However, how MAD1 is specifically targeted to unattached kinetochores is yet unanswered. In metazoan cells, the ROD&#x02013;ZW10&#x02013;ZWILCH (RZZ) complex is crucial in the SAC pathway (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karess, 2005</xref>). The RZZ complex recruits dynein/dynactin to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Starr et al., 1998</xref>). Although the RZZ complex is required to regulate levels of MAD1 and MAD2 at unattached kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kops et al., 2005</xref>), it localizes to not only microtubule-free but also tension-free kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Famulski and Chan, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, MDF-1/MAD1 is required for SAC-dependent delay of mitotic progression induced by chemical or mutational disruption of microtubules in proliferating germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kitagawa and Rose, 1999</xref>) and early-stage embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nystul et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Encalada et al., 2005</xref>).

In SPDL-1&#x02013;depleted embryos, chromosome congression was incomplete and sister chromatids being separated were often connected by lagging chromosomes. Regardless of the presence of lagging chromosomes, cytokinesis occurred at the same time as in untreated embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), leading to karyomere formation at a frequency similar to that reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sonnichsen et al., 2005</xref>). Time course analysis revealed that depletion of SPDL-1 induced rapid and premature centrosome separation, which reflects a defect in kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), suggesting that SPDL-1 plays a role in proper kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachment in addition to the SAC function. However, the defect was less severe than that caused by depletion of NDC-80, a constituent of the core microtubule-binding site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Desai et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We next tested the genetic interaction of SPDL-1 and the APC/C, the downstream target of the SAC.

MDF-1&#x02013;kinetochore association was barely detectable during normal mitosis (unpublished data). In two-cell&#x02013;stage embryos depleted of ZYG-1, condensed chromosomes formed an arc around the single microtubule aster nucleated from the mono centrosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In these cells, MDF-1 accumulated along the outer side of the chromosome arc that faces away from the centrosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In contrast, KNL-1 and NDC-80 localized to both the inner and outer sides of the chromosome arc (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). These results suggest that sister centromeres were resolved and the outer kinetochore was assembled on both sister chromatids, but one assembled on the side facing away from the centrosomes is not captured, or only laterally captured, by microtubules. Monotelic microtubule attachment could cause the lack of tension on both sister kinetochores. Consistent with the previous finding that BUB1 and the RZZ complex localize to tension-free kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Skoufias et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Famulski and Chan, 2007</xref>), BUB-1 and CZW-1 localized as KNL-1 and NDC-80 did (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In contrast, SPDL-1 asymmetrically localized as MDF-1 did (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Furthermore, MDF-1 associating with chromosomes was substantially reduced by depletion of SPDL-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> and Fig. S3 C). These observations strongly suggest that SPDL-1 is specifically required for MDF-1 targeting to unattached kinetochores. Although CZW-1 localized at both sister kinetochores in ZYG-1&#x02013;depleted embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), codepletion of CZW-1 and ZYG-1 substantially reduced localization of SPDL-1 and MDF-1 on the kinetochores facing away from the centrosome (Fig. S3 D), suggesting that SPDL-1 requires CZW-1 for its accumulation on unattached kinetochores as it does in normal mitosis. Depletion of BUB-1 did not affect kinetochore localization of SPDL-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Fig. S3 A) but reduced MDF-1 on kinetochores in ZYG-1&#x02013;depleted embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

There was a small but detectable amount of MDF-1 and MDF-2 in SPDL-1 immunoprecipitates from whole-worm lysate of wild-type strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>); reciprocally, SPDL-1 and MDF-2 were detected in immunoprecipitates with anti&#x02013;MDF-1 antibody (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).

SPDL-1 localizes at the kinetochore during mitosis in a CZW-1/ZW10&#x02013;dependent and BUB-1&#x02013;independent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). In embryonic cells with the monopolar spindle, SPDL-1 localizes to kinetochores on the side of the chromosome that faces away from the mono centrosome, thereby recruiting MDF-1 via its physical association. MDF-1 localization to unattached kinetochores also depends on BUB-1. We could not show direct interaction of SPDL-1 and MDF-1 by yeast two-hybrid analysis (unpublished data), suggesting that the proteins need additional components for their interaction, or MDF-1 may be modified in a BUB-1 kinase&#x02013;dependent manner for its interaction with SPDL-1.</p><p>Whether SPDL-1 is actively recruited to unattached kinetochores by interacting with other proteins or specifically excluded from attached kinetochores needs study. High amounts of SPDL-1 on metaphase chromosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>) imply that SPDL-1 is removed from kinetochores after microtubule attachment. SPDL-1 is structurally related to Spindly, which plays a role in recruiting dynein to kinetochores and is translocated from kinetochores to microtubules in a dynein-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, dynein may remove SPDL-1 from kinetochores attached to microtubules. Although Spindly does not play the same role as SPDL-1 in MAD1 recruitment in other organisms because the property of MAD1 to localize to unattached kinetochores is highly conserved among eukaryotes (including <italic>C. elegans</italic>), other organisms might also have a similar regulatory mechanism in which other proteins may play the role of SPDL-1 in recruiting MAD1 to unattached kinetochores. Therefore, elucidating how SPDL-1 accumulates specifically at unattached kinetochores should help unravel the molecular mechanisms by which microtubule attachment status of the kinetochore is sensed to initiate SAC function.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>The following <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were used in this study: N2 Bristol (wild-type), RB1391 <italic>san-1</italic>(<italic>ok1580</italic>) <italic>I</italic>, XA3501 <italic>unc-119</italic>(<italic>ed3</italic>) <italic>III</italic>; <italic>ruIs32</italic>[pAZ132; Ppie-1&#x02237;GFP&#x02237;<italic>his-11</italic> unc-119(&#x0002b;)] <italic>III</italic>; <italic>ojIs1</italic>[Ppie-1&#x02237;GFP&#x02237;<italic>tbb-2 unc-119</italic>(&#x0002b;)], CB270 <italic>unc-42</italic>(<italic>e270</italic>) <italic>V</italic>, AG164 <italic>unc-42</italic>(<italic>e270</italic>) <italic>mdf-1</italic>(<italic>av19</italic>) <italic>V</italic>, RQ153 <italic>unc-46</italic>(<italic>e177</italic>) <italic>V/nT1</italic>[<italic>let-X</italic>(<italic>m435</italic>)] <italic>IV</italic>;<italic>V</italic>, KR3627 <italic>unc-46</italic>(<italic>e177</italic>) <italic>mdf-1</italic>(<italic>gk2</italic>) <italic>V</italic>/<italic>nT1</italic>[<italic>let-X</italic>(<italic>m435</italic>)] <italic>IV</italic>;<italic>V</italic>, AG170 <italic>mdf-2</italic>(<italic>tm2910</italic>) <italic>IV</italic>, AG169 <italic>mat-3</italic>(<italic>or180</italic>) <italic>III</italic>.
