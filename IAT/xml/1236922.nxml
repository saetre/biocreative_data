These elements are in most cases defective, but open reading frames can still be found for the retroviral envelope gene, with sixteen such genes identified so far. Several of them are conserved during primate evolution, having possibly been co-opted by their host for a physiological role.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To characterize further their status, we presently sequenced 12 of these genes from a panel of 91 Caucasian individuals. Genomic analyses reveal strong sequence conservation (only two non synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms [SNPs]) for the two HERV-W and HERV-FRD envelope genes, i.e. for the two genes specifically expressed in the placenta and possibly involved in syncytiotrophoblast formation. We further show &#x02013; using an <italic>ex vivo </italic>fusion assay for each allelic form &#x02013; that none of these SNPs impairs the fusogenic function. The other envelope proteins disclose variable polymorphisms, with the occurrence of a stop codon and/or frameshift for most &#x02013; but not all &#x02013; of them. Moreover, the sequence conservation analysis of the orthologous genes that can be found in primates shows that three <italic>env </italic>genes have been maintained in a fully coding state throughout evolution including <italic>env</italic>W and <italic>env</italic>FRD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Altogether, the present study strongly suggests that some but not all envelope encoding sequences are <italic>bona fide </italic>genes. It also provides new tools to elucidate the possible role of endogenous envelope proteins as susceptibility factors in a number of pathologies where HERVs have been suspected to be involved.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>A large fraction (8%) of the human genome contains elements of retroviral origin, with thousands of sequences closely related to the integrated proviral form of infectious retroviruses with the canonical <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>prt</italic>, <italic>pol </italic>and <italic>env </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These elements, named human endogenous retroviruses (HERV), are most probably the proviral remnants of ancestral germline infections by active retroviruses, which have thereafter been transmitted in a Mendelian manner. HERVs have been grouped according to sequence homologies into more than 80 distinct families, each containing a few to several hundreds elements (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] for their classification). Most HERV genes are non-coding, due to either terminating mutations or deletions, but we have characterized 16 human endogenous <italic>env </italic>genes that have retained a coding capacity among the 30,000 endogenous proviral elements of the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The analysis of their transcriptome in healthy human tissues has revealed that three of them are highly expressed in the placenta, namely the erv3/HERV-R, the HERV-W and the HERV-FRD <italic>env </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Phylogenetic as well as functional analyses have revealed strong similarities between HERVs and the present-day infectious retroviruses, suggesting a common history and shared ancestors. Accordingly, it has been proposed that HERVs may still possess some of the functions of infectious retroviruses and as such have pathogenic effects, provided that they are transcriptionally active. Conversely, it is also plausible that HERV proteins may have been co-opted by the host for its benefit. Along this line, it has been proposed that the HERV envelope proteins could play a role in several processes including i) protection against infection by present-day retroviruses through receptor interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], ii) protection of the fetus against the maternal immune system via an immunosuppressive domain located in the envelope transmembrane (TM) subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and iii) placenta morphogenesis through fusogenic effects allowing differentiation of cytotrophoblastic cells into the syncytiotrophoblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In accordance with a symbiotic role for HERVs, it has recently been shown that the HERV-W and HERV-FRD envelope gene products are highly fusogenic glycoproteins that are specifically expressed in the placenta and can mediate cell-cell fusion <italic>ex vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Involvement of HERV proteins in physiological processes, however, remains a debated issue, and definite evidence is still lacking. Because selection pressure on a functional gene should result in a limited mutation rate, the survey of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the human population is a way to evaluate functional constraints on these genes. Using this approach, we had previously demonstrated that one postulated candidate for a role in placentation, namely the highly-expressed erv3/HERV-R envelope gene carries a homozygous stop mutation resulting in a severe protein truncation in 1% of individuals of caucasian origin, which strongly suggests that it is not necessary for any fundamental placental function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The unexpectedly low number of still coding envelope genes present in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] now allows a comprehensive analysis of such genes to be performed, in order to assess their possible physiological and/or physiopathological role. Here, we analysed the SNP level of the 12 coding <italic>env </italic>genes present in the human genome that could be characterized by this approach, together with their conservation among the orthologous genes that can be identified in primates. The two series of data are consistent with a role beneficial to the host for some of the genes, whereas others are likely to be subjected to progressive inactivation. In both cases, the identified SNPs should be useful tools to evaluate the possible role of these genes as "susceptibility genes" in several human pathologies where HERVs have been suspected to be involved.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Structure and PCR-amplification of the fully coding HERV envelope genes</title><p>Retroviral envelope genes are 2 kb-long sequences with no introns, that are located in the 3' domain of proviral elements (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> for the genomic structure of a provirus and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> for the description of the envelope gene and its product). Endogenous retroviruses being in most cases highly reiterated elements (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), the 3' PCR primers for <italic>env </italic>gene amplification had to be placed downstream of the provirus end to specifically amplify the family member of interest, whereas the 5' primer was placed upstream of the <italic>env </italic>MET initiation codon (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Among the 16 coding <italic>env </italic>genes that we had previously identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], 12 could be subjected to a systematic search for SNPs, including 3 out of the 6 HERV-K(HML-2) coding <italic>env </italic>genes (K1, K2, K4), 2 out of the 3 HERV-H coding <italic>env </italic>genes (H1 and H3), and the coding <italic>env </italic>genes of the F(c)1, F(c)2, T, W, R, R(b) and FRD families. Three HERV-K(HML-2) <italic>env </italic>genes could not be PCR amplified: the first one (<italic>env</italic>K3) is located in the centromeric region of chromosome 19, and its provirus is surrounded by stretches of repeated sequences, thus precluding the use of specific primers; the other two (<italic>env</italic>K5 and <italic>env</italic>K6) belong to proviruses present only in a fraction of the caucasian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], with a low allele frequency (0.19 and 0.04, respectively), thus precluding a statistically significant SNP study to be performed (unless a pre-selected population was used). It is noteworthy that proviruses K1, K2 and K4 have also been recently demonstrated to be polymorphic, since they exist in some individuals as a solo Long Terminal Repeat (LTR), devoid of internal sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Yet, the allele frequencies of the complete provirus forms are high (0.72, 0.97 and 0.89, respectively), thus allowing an SNP study. Finally, sequence data for one of the 3 HERV-H coding <italic>env </italic>genes studied (i.e. <italic>env</italic>H2) yielded multiple sequence profiles (possibly due to the parasitic amplification of another member of the HERV-H family) and could not be analyzed further. The list of the 12 fully coding <italic>env </italic>genes that could finally be analyzed, together with the associated amplification primers used, is given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of the proviral form of a retrovirus and its <italic>env </italic>gene products</bold>.

The identified SNPs are positioned on the protein sequences in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, and the number and nature of the variations (synonymous [i.e. silent] versus nonsynonymous [i.e. leading to an amino acid change] substitutions, stop or insertion/deletion [indel] mutations) are given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The complete list and detailed features &#x02013; including frequencies &#x02013; of the identified SNPs is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional data file 1</xref>. As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the number of SNPs for the 12 <italic>env </italic>genes varies significantly depending on the gene, but their distribution along the envelope sequences seems to be random. The number of SNPs per kb varies from 1 (for <italic>env</italic>W) to 10 (for <italic>env</italic>T). Studies on SNPs in intragenic regions of the human genome disclose average densities varying from 0.8 to 5 SNPs per kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These studies also provide an estimate of the average ratio of synonymous versus non-synonymous SNPs, which is close to 1 in coding regions, whereas it is close to 0.5 in pseudogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

There is no correlation between the number of SNPs and the "age" of the corresponding gene in the primate lineage. This is clearly illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, where the <italic>env </italic>genes have been ordered according to the date of entry of each corresponding provirus into the host genome as previously determined via an analysis of the orthologous loci throughout evolution (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). For instance, the <italic>env </italic>genes of the HERV-K(HML-2) family are human-specific, i.e. are present in the genome of primate since less than five million years (Myrs), whereas <italic>env</italic>R(b) and <italic>env</italic>FRD have entered the genome of the common ancestor of Old World and New World monkeys more than 40 Myrs ago. For the <italic>env</italic>FRD gene, which is among the "oldest" <italic>env </italic>genes, only 4 SNPs are found, whereas for the "recent" <italic>env </italic>genes of the HERV-K(HML-2) family, the SNP number can be as high as 16. Although the lack of correlation between the "age" of the genes in the primate lineage and the numbers of SNPs is not unexpected taking into account the occurrence of "bottlenecks" giving rise to founder effects during the evolution of the human population, what remains surprising is the important variability of the number and "severity" of SNPs among the <italic>env </italic>genes. This should be a strong indication for a differential selection pressure exerted on these genes (see below).</p><p>A further characterization of the SNPs, including genotype distribution, haplotype frequency, and linkage disequilibrium was performed (additional data files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The genotype distributions are compatible with a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, except for some positions on the HERV-K1 (HERV-K1_44, HERV-K1_133, HERV-K1_403, HERV-K1_482, HERV-K1_651, HERV-K1_673, HERV-K1_2144), HERV-K4 (HERV-K4_292, HERV-K4_369, HERV-K4_382, HERV-K4_586) and HERV-F(c)1 (HERV-F(c)1_122, HERV-F(c)1_226, HERV-F(c)1_235) <italic>env </italic>genes, consistent with recent integration of these elements in the primate lineage (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Haplotype frequencies were estimated for each gene based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] for haplotypes with frequency estimates &#x0003e;1%. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">additional data file 2</xref>. The three most frequent haplotypes for each <italic>env </italic>gene represent &#x0003e;80% of all the haplotypes, suggesting that these regions have a low recombination rate. A linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot was generated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">additional data file 3</xref>) with pairwise LDs measured between each pair of polymorphisms using the D and D' methods (see materials and methods). As expected, the majority of high LD values occur within the <italic>env </italic>genes, and the LDs calculated between SNPs of different HERV <italic>env </italic>genes is low. Low LDs were obtained as well for <italic>env </italic>genes located on the same chromosome, i.e. for HERV-F(c)2, HERV-K2, HERV-R, HERV-W (on chromosome 7) and for HERV-H1 and HERV-H3 (on chromosome 2; 10 Mb apart). These observations suggest an independent evolution for each <italic>env </italic>gene.</p><p>Among all the coding <italic>env </italic>genes, <italic>env</italic>W and <italic>env</italic>FRD are the only two genes with a clearly identified functional property, i.e. the capacity to generate cell-cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This property &#x02013; most probably associated with its role in placentation, see the Background section &#x02013; was used to characterize further the consequences of the identified SNPs on the fusogenic function of the encoded proteins. To do so, we PCR-amplified the genomic DNAs of individuals carrying the corresponding SNP alleles, with primers allowing the cloning of the <italic>env </italic>genes in appropriate expression vectors. The fusogenic function was then assayed as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], using two different cell lines for fusion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As illustrated in the figure, no difference can be observed between the four haplotypes of each of the <italic>env </italic>genes tested. This, together with the low SNP level for the two genes, is a strong indication for selection of a "function" associated with the corresponding proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of the non synonymous SNPs identified in envFRD and envW on their fusogenic function</bold>.

Some of the orthologous primate <italic>env </italic>genes had been previously cloned and sequenced ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] for <italic>env</italic>W, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] for <italic>env</italic>FRD, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] for <italic>env</italic>R and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] for envF(c)1).

As illustrated in the figure, a first important outcome is that only three <italic>env </italic>genes have been maintained in a fully coding state throughout evolution, i.e. <italic>env</italic>FRD (7/7 lineages), <italic>env</italic>W (5/5 lineages) and <italic>env</italic>R (5/5 lineages) which, interestingly, correspond to the three <italic>env </italic>genes highly expressed in the placenta. Secondly, as observed for the human SNP analysis, there is no correlation between the "age" of the gene in the primate lineage and its coding status: the latter three <italic>env </italic>genes are among the "oldest" ones, whereas three other <italic>env </italic>genes (<italic>env</italic>H3, <italic>env</italic>T and <italic>env</italic>F(c)1) are fully coding in only one non-human lineage, and the others are only coding in the human lineage.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Conservation of the coding envelopes in primate species</bold>.

Interestingly, these two genes are highly &#x02013; and specifically &#x02013; expressed in the placenta, and possess a well-characterized fusogenic function which led to the proposal that they are <italic>bona fide </italic>genes that have been co-opted by the host for a physiological function related to placenta physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Among the other genes, <italic>env</italic>R is of interest since as with the two former genes it is highly expressed in the placenta and has maintained its fully coding status in all species since its entry into the primate lineage. Yet, the SNP analysis discloses a severe polymorphism &#x02013; including a premature stop codon &#x02013; indicating that the preservation of an open reading frame during evolution should not be considered as a sufficient criterion to assign a biological function. The other genes are not conserved in a fully coding state in all the primate branches where they are present and/or disclose a severe polymorphism (with in several cases occurrence of a premature stop codon for some allelic forms).</p><p>Another hallmark of the presence of a functional constraint on a gene is a low nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratio (Ka/Ks) for orthologous genes found in other species. A <italic>bona fide </italic>gene with a cellular function should be under purifying selection, which prevents deleterious nonsynonymous substitutions from being fixed and usually does not affect synonymous substitutions, leading to Ka/Ks ratios &#x0003c;1, whereas a gene under genetic drift (e.g. a pseudogene) has a Ka/Ks ratio close to unity (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). Such an analysis has already been performed for the <italic>env</italic>FRD and the <italic>env</italic>W genes. The mean ratio for all pairwise comparisons was 0.37 for <italic>env</italic>FRD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], demonstrating the existence of a selective pressure. For <italic>env</italic>W, the corresponding ratio was 0.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], precluding definite conclusions (yet, a subsequent study on <italic>env</italic>W identified a region of the gene with a lower ratio compatible with a functional constraint specifically exerted on that domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). We have calculated the Ka/Ks ratios for the other <italic>env </italic>genes, when nucleotide sequences of their orthologs were available (data not shown). These ratios were found to be heterogeneous for a given <italic>env </italic>gene, with values ranging from 0.23 to 1.17, again precluding any definite conclusion to be drawn.</p><p>According to the present analysis of intra- and interspecific variability of the <italic>env </italic>genes, one is led to conclude that most probably only two among the twelve studied <italic>env </italic>genes are likely to be involved in an essential human physiological function, whereas the others would be on their way to conversion into pseudogenes. The presence of a reading frame still open in human for the latter genes may appear intriguing, but one has to keep in mind that they belong to multicopy HERV families, and as such one of the element could have remained open just by chance, without any purifying selection, since even under completely neutral drift it takes time for a sufficient number of mutations to transform a gene into a pseudogene. Along this line, it is of interest to mention the study by Zhang and Webb on the primate <italic>V1R </italic>pheromone receptor genes, for which there were approximately 140 copies in the genome of the common ancestor of Old World monkeys and hominoids, whereas the human genome has only five <italic>V1R </italic>genes that retained an ORF. Examination of the orthologous genes in primates showed that none of the five genes kept an intact ORF in all of the apes. Furthermore, for the orthologous sequences with an intact ORF, Ka/Ks ratios were close to unity. The intraspecific variation of these five human genes was also assessed, and for two of them an allelic form generating a premature stop codon was found. Altogether, the authors concluded that there were no functional constraints on these genes since before the separation of hominoids and Old World Monkeys (approximately 23 Myrs ago) and that they were in the process of pseudogeneization in those primate species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Another possible explanation for the "neutral" conservation of an open reading frame for an HERV <italic>env </italic>gene without any selection pressure from the host could be related to the relatively autonomous status of these parasitic elements, and be associated with the persistence of active retroviral elements responsible for the maintenance &#x02013; by a reiterated infection process &#x02013; of some of the HERV families (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]).</p><p>In any case, it appears clearly that conservation of an <italic>env </italic>gene with a coding status cannot be taken as the sole criterion for a possible function to the benefit of the host, with only the <italic>env</italic>W and <italic>env</italic>FRD genes emerging from the present study as possible <italic>bona fide </italic>genes. Yet, this does not mean that the other <italic>env </italic>genes cannot have any effect in humans. Indeed, the present analysis only indicates that they are not under stringent purifying selection, in terms of evolution, but they still could be involved in pathologies &#x02013; such as tumors or auto-immune diseases &#x02013; not deleterious to the species because they occur late in the life of the individuals. One should keep in mind that endogenous retroviruses originate from <italic>bona fide </italic>retroviruses, and as such might have conserved some of the pathological potency of their progenitors. In this respect, the identified SNPs should be essential tools to determine if this is indeed the case, via an analysis of their distribution among selected groups of individuals with a definite pathology. Along this line, the present data on the <italic>env</italic>T gene are of special interest. Indeed, this gene is the only non-placental <italic>env </italic>gene found to be highly expressed in a human tissue &#x02013; the thyroid &#x02013; of healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and the high level of polymorphism of the gene shown in this report together with its lack of conservation in primates suggest that it is not involved in any essential physiological process and thus not subjected to purifying selection. Thanks to the identified SNPs, it can now be tested whether this expressed gene is involved in a pathological process in humans, among which thyroid tumors could be select candidates for a systematic search.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The systematic SNP search on fully coding human endogenous envelope genes, combined with an analysis of the sequence conservation among the orthologs that can be identified among primates revealed that two genes (<italic>env</italic>W and <italic>env</italic>FRD) can be considered as <italic>bona fide </italic>genes, and identified polymorphisms &#x02013; to a variable extent &#x02013; in the other genes. The data are consistent with a physiological role for the former (also called syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 and likely to be involved in human placentation) and provide tools for the latter, to determine their potential role in physiological processes and/or their association with pathological processes in humans &#x02013; which would be the consequence of their original retroviral status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>DNA samples and genotyping</title><p>Ninety-one human samples of French Caucasians were collected from the EGEA (Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma) study, among the controls ascertained without disease.
