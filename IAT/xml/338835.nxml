The skeletal muscle gene MLC1F/MLC3F, the ventricular muscle/slow skeletal muscle gene MLC1V(MLC1S), and the atrial muscle/foetal striated muscle gene MLC1A(MLC1emb). MLC1V and MLC1A are expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscle, and we show here that these genes use a single site of initiation of transcription, and therefore the same proximal promoter region, in both muscle types, and in myogenic cell lines in culture. We have previously shown that for the MLC1F/MLC3F gene, 1200bp of upstream sequence from the MLC1F promoter is sufficient to allow tissue specific and developmentally regulated expression. We have therefore isolated, characterised, and sequenced over 1200bp upstream of each of the three MLC genes in order to look for elements which may be involved in their regulation. Detailed comparison of their promoter sequences, as well as those of the cardiac and skeletal muscle alpha-actin genes, reveals a number of common elements. Among these is an "MLC-sequence" (CCTTTTATAG) common to all MLC genes, including those of chick and rat, and a "cardiac sequence" common to the mouse MLC1A, MLC1V and alpha-cardiac actin genes expressed in the heart.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0162-a" xlink:role="10041"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0164-a" xlink:role="10043"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10037"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10038"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10039"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10040"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0162.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10041"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10042"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10043"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10044"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10045"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10046"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10047"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10048"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10049"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10050"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10051"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00163-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10052"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
