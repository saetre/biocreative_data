The catalytic &#x003b1;-subunits of plant Snf1-related kinases (SnRKs) interact in the yeast two-hybrid system with different proteins that share conserved domains with the &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-subunits of Snf1 and AMPKs. However, due to the lack of a robust technique allowing the detection of protein interactions in plant cells, it is unknown whether these proteins indeed occur in SnRK complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here we describe a double-labelling technique, using intron-tagged hemagglutinin (HA) and c-Myc epitope sequences, which provides a simple tool for co-immunopurification of interacting proteins expressed in <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-transformed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells. This generally applicable plant protein interaction assay was used to demonstrate that AKIN&#x003b2;2, a plant ortholog of conserved Snf1&#x0002f;AMPK &#x003b2;-subunits, forms different complexes with the catalytic &#x003b1;-subunits of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SnRK protein kinases AKIN10 and AKIN11 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The genome sequence of the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has recently been completed and annotated providing a wealth of information for emerging proteomics and functional genomics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c2">2</xref>). Construction of new platforms for transcript profiling aim at an integrated analysis of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c3">3</xref>), whereas systematic protein interaction screens in the yeast two-hybrid system offer a means for characterisation of the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c5">5</xref>). As detection of protein interactions in the yeast two-hybrid system does not necessarily imply that the same proteins also interact in plants, there is a need for development of new techniques to facilitate the detection of <italic>in vivo</italic> protein interactions in plant cells. Current problems in the analysis of subunit composition of plant protein complexes are well illustrated by the example of Snf1-related plant protein kinases (SnRKs).</p><p> SnRKs belong to the conserved family of yeast sucrose non-fermenting (Snf1) kinase and animal AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c6">6</xref>). These conserved protein kinases are heterotrimeric enzymes consisting of &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-subunits. The catalytic &#x003b1;-subunit carries an N-terminal serine&#x0002f;threonine protein kinase domain followed by C-terminal regulatory sequences which function as a kinase autoinhibitory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c7">7</xref>). In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the &#x003b1;-subunit is encoded by the <italic>SNF1</italic> gene, which is required for proper regulation of glycogen storage, sporulation and transcriptional derepression of glucose-repressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c8">8</xref>). In comparison, two different isoforms of &#x003b1;-subunit are known in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c9">9</xref>). The &#x003b3;-subunit encoded by the <italic>SNF4</italic> gene in yeast is involved in maintaining the active conformation of the &#x003b1;-subunit by binding to its autoinhibitory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c7">7</xref>). The &#x003b2;-subunit mediates the formation of a heterotrimeric complex because it can independently interact with both the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b3;-subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c10">10</xref>). Co-transfection experiments indicate that the &#x003b2;-subunit is also required for reconstitution of AMPK kinase activity in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c11">11</xref>). Remarkably, three genes (<italic>SIP1</italic>, <italic>SIP2</italic> and <italic>GAL83</italic>) code for the &#x003b2;-subunits in yeast, whereas only two &#x003b2;-isoforms have been found so far in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c12">12</xref>). Recent studies in yeast demonstrate that, in addition to the assembly of active kinase complex, the &#x003b2;-subunits are required for specific recognition of diverse kinase substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c13">13</xref>).</p><p> Orthologs of the Snf1&#x0002f;AMPK &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-subunits have been identified in several plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c20">20</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis indicates a remarkable homology between the catalytic &#x003b1;-subunits of plant SnRKs and other members of the Snf1&#x0002f;AMPK family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c21">21</xref>). According to this classification, plant protein kinases showing the highest similarity to Snf1 and AMPKs belong to the SnRK1 subfamily. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> two SnRK1 &#x003b1;-subunits are known which are capable of functionally complementing the yeast <italic>snf1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c16">16</xref>). In addition, two different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins sharing homologous C&#x003b2;S (cystathione &#x003b2; synthase) domains with the Snf1&#x0002f;AMPK &#x003b3;-subunits have been identified. However, only one of these putative <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SnRK &#x003b3;-subunits (AtSNF4) was observed to suppress the <italic>snf4</italic> deficiency in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c19">19</xref>). Based on sequence homology, two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes encoding potential orthologs of Snf1&#x0002f;AMPK &#x003b2;-subunits were identified and characterised by different patterns of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c17">17</xref>). The interaction properties of these putative SnRK subunits have been studied in the yeast two-hybrid system and protein interaction assays <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c19">19</xref>). Nonetheless, it is&#x000a0;still an open question whether the highly variable putative &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-subunits indeed occur <italic>in vivo</italic> in common complexes with SnRK &#x003b1;-subunits, which are remarkably conserved in plant cells.</p><p> To characterise the interactions between SnRK subunits <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic>, we exploited an epitope tagging technique which was recently developed for facile detection and cellular localisation of proteins in <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-transformed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c22">22</xref>). By generating fusions between intron-tagged epitope coding domains and plant cDNAs, this technique eliminates artificial expression of proteins in <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>. Thus, the expression of proteins in plant cells can be specifically and sensitively detected as early as 5 days after transformation. To verify the results of yeast two-hybrid tests, a co-immunopurification assay was developed based on co-expression of interacting proteins carrying hemagglutinin (HA) and c-Myc epitopes in plant cells. Using this generally applicable plant protein interaction assay, we demonstrate here that the catalytic &#x003b1;-subunits of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein kinases AKIN10 and AKIN11 form different SnRK complexes with a regulatory AKIN&#x003b2;2 subunit <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>Vectors carrying plant gene expression cassettes with an intron-tagged HA epitope coding domain were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c22">22</xref>).

Plasmid pLOLA and pGIGI are compatible with pPILY and pMENCHU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c22">22</xref>), respectively, allowing a fusion of protein coding sequences with HA and c-Myc epitopes using the same reading frames. Vector pMESHI provides a different reading frame to generate alternative translational fusions. Plasmid pGIGI is a derivative of pMESHI, which contains a <italic>Bam</italic>HI site for generation of in-frame fusions with cDNAs derived from the yeast two-hybrid vectors pACT2 and pAS2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke491f1">1</xref>). Plant gene expression cassettes in all HA and c-Myc epitope vectors carry a CaMV 35S promoter with a duplicated enhancer domain and 3&#x02032; transcription terminator sequences from the nopaline synthase gene. The plant gene expression cassettes are flanked by unique <italic>Not</italic>I sites to facilitate further cloning of epitope-tagged constructs in <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> binary vectors for plant transformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Optimisation of co-expression of HA and c-Myc epitope-tagged proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation</title><p>To optimise the conditions for detection of c-Myc epitope-tagged proteins expressed in <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-transformed plant cells, a &#x003b2;-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter protein was labelled with an N-terminal c-Myc epitope. A <italic>uidA</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>gusA</italic> coding sequence was inserted in pLOLA, then the plant gene expression cassette was moved into the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> binary vector pPCV002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c26">26</xref>) and transformed into <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c22">22</xref>). The amount of bacterial cells used for transformation was adjusted such that on average 80&#x00025; of infected <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells showed staining with the histochemical GUS substrate X-Gluc 5 days after infection. From the transformed cells protein extracts were prepared, separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and subjected to western blotting with different commercially available anti-c-Myc antibodies. In crude protein extracts prepared from control non-transformed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells all anti-c-Myc IgGs tested in western blotting (including a BAbCO IgG from clone 9E10, which provided the highest sensitivity of detection) showed a non-specific cross-reaction with a protein of 100 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke491f2">2</xref>, TOTAL). Nonetheless, the anti-c-Myc antibodies specifically detected a myc&#x02013;GUS reporter protein with the expected molecular mass. Unlike western blotting, preclearing of protein extracts with protein G&#x02013;Sepharose followed by immunoprecipitation with immobilised anti-c-Myc IgG resulted in specific detection of the myc&#x02013;GUS protein, providing a reliable tool for development of a co-immunopurification assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke491f2">2</xref>, IP).</p><p> To simultaneously express two different proteins in plant cells, the conditions for co-transformation were optimised using <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> strains which carried reporter gene constructs coding for the <italic>Discosoma</italic> red fluorescent protein DsRed in pR97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c28">28</xref>) and the green fluorescent protein mGFP4 in pBI121 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c29">29</xref>). Titration of the inoculum size by infection of 50 ml aliquots of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell cultures during the logarithmic growth phase indicated that the cultures could tolerate a maximum of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup><italic>Agrobacterium</italic> cells without losing their viability (data not shown). Using a total of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup> bacterial cells for infection, the transformation frequencies ranged between 70 and 80&#x00025; with a single <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> strain, whereas double infections with two strains yielded only 40&#x02013;50&#x00025; transformed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells which displayed expression of either green or red fluorescent protein as visualised by epifluorescence microscopy (data not shown). To measure the co-transformation frequency, the proportion of cells showing both green (GFP) and red (DsRed) fluorescence was determined using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Sequential recording of green, red and merged yellow (GFP &#x0002b; DsRed) images provided a precise count for single and double transformed cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke491f3">3</xref>). On average, 55&#x00025; of cells growing in aggregates (i.e. microcalli) displayed both GFP and DsRed emission, indicating that it is feasible to use <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated co-transformation for expression of two different proteins in cultured <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec><title>AKIN&#x003b2;2, an ortholog of the Sip2 &#x003b2;-subunit of yeast Snf1 kinase, forms different complexes with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SnRK &#x003b1;-subunits AKIN10 and AKIN11 <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To identify potential orthologs of Snf1&#x0002f;AMPK &#x003b2;-subunits, different domains of yeast Sip2 protein were used to search for homologous sequences in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> database using the TBLAST program. The best hit identified a gene (accession no. gb:ATFCA6, chromosome 4, ESSA I contig fragment no. 6) which coded for a protein showing partial homology to conserved kinase-interacting sequences (i.e. KIS domains) of &#x003b2;-subunits of yeast Snf1 and animal AMPKs. The same gene was recently identified as encoding a putative SnRK subunit designated AKIN&#x003b2;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c17">17</xref>). A cDNA encoding AKIN&#x003b2;2 in fusion with the Gal4 activation domain was isolated from a cDNA library made in the yeast two-hybrid vector pACT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c16">16</xref>) using a specific probe obtained by PCR amplification of the last exon. This cDNA clone was used as prey in the yeast strain Y187 to test for interaction of AKIN&#x003b2;2 with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SnRK1 &#x003b1;-subunits AKIN10 and AKIN11 used as baits in two-hybrid assays. Quantitative measurement of &#x003b2;-galactosidase enzyme levels, reflecting activation of a <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene by the bait&#x02013;prey interactions, suggested that AKIN&#x003b2;2 is a putative binding partner for both AKIN10 and AKIN11 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke491f4">4</xref>). The specificity of observed two-hybrid interactions was controlled using distantly related SnRK1 &#x003b1;-subunits, such as yeast Snf1 and tobacco NPK5, self-activation tests with yeast strains carrying the AKIN10 and AKIN11 baits alone and interaction assays with several unrelated preys, including pVA3 and pLAM (Clontech) (data not shown).</p><p> To verify the results of two-hybrid interactions, AKIN&#x003b2;2 was co-expressed with either AKIN10 or AKIN11 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells using the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated co-transformation method described above. AKIN10 and AKIN11 were labelled with N- and C-terminal c-Myc epitopes, respectively, whereas the N-terminus of AKIN&#x003b2;2 was fused to a HA epitope as described (see Materials and Methods). First, the epitope-tagged constructs were independently transformed into <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells to evaluate the expression level and stability of modified AKIN10, AKIN11 and AKIN&#x003b2;2 proteins. Following 5 days of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> infection, protein extracts were prepared from the transformed cells, resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and immunoblotted using monoclonal anti-HA and anti-c-Myc antibodies. Both c-Myc-tagged AKIN10 and AKIN11 proteins (both 61 kDa) were detected at apparently low levels (as compared to an HA epitope-tagged GUS reporter protein; data not shown). As noted earlier, western blotting revealed a non-specific cross-reaction of monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody with a protein of 100 kDa in all samples prepared from transformed and non-transformed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells. Intriguingly, AKIN11&#x02013;myc was typically detected as a doublet, suggesting post-translational modification or specific degradation of this protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke491f5">5</xref>A). In comparison to myc&#x02013;AKIN10 and AKIN11&#x02013;myc, HA&#x02013;AKIN&#x003b2;2 was produced at an apparently higher level, but appeared to be less stable because, in addition to its intact form, some degradation products were also detected with the anti-HA antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke491f5">5</xref>B). These characteristics observed by immunoblotting of epitope-tagged proteins did not change when HA&#x02013;AKIN&#x003b2;2 was co-expressed with either myc&#x02013;AKIN10 or AKIN11&#x02013;myc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke491f6">6</xref>A). The apparent reduction in the intensity of the bands with respect to the single transformations probably reflects a reduced number of transformed cells when performing co-transformation experiments.</p><p> To examine whether HA&#x02013;AKIN&#x003b2;2 occurred in common complexes with the c-Myc epitope-tagged SnRK &#x003b1;-subunits, protein extracts were prepared from control non-transformed cells and cultures transformed separately with each construct, as well as from cells co-transformed with HA&#x02013;AKIN&#x003b2;2 and either myc&#x02013;AKIN10 or AKIN11&#x02013;myc. The extracts were subjected to immunaffinity purification on immobilised anti-HA and anti-c-Myc IgG matrices. Proteins eluted from the anti-HA and anti-c-Myc IgG matrices by HA and c-Myc peptides, respectively, were immunoblotted with anti-HA and anti-c-Myc antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke491f6">6</xref>B). HA&#x02013;AKIN&#x003b2;2 was detected by the anti-HA antibody after immunaffinity binding of both myc&#x02013;AKIN10 and AKIN11&#x02013;myc. Interestingly, only full-length HA&#x02013;AKIN&#x003b2;2 was recovered in complex with the immunopurified SnRK &#x003b1;-subunits, suggesting a lack of interaction of C-terminally truncated AKIN&#x003b2;2 derivatives with myc&#x02013;AKIN10 and AKIN11&#x02013;myc. Similarly, both c-Myc-tagged SnRK &#x003b1;-subunits were detected in association with HA&#x02013;AKIN&#x003b2;2 after immunoaffinity purification on anti-HA IgG. The specificity of these protein interactions was corroborated by control co-transformation experiments which revealed no interaction of HA&#x02013;AKIN&#x003b2;2 with an affinity purified myc&#x02013;GUS protein (data not shown). Thus, these data demonstrated that AKIN&#x003b2;2 is a &#x003b2;-subunit of two different SnRK protein kinase complexes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Recent annotation and comparative sequence analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome reveals an unexpectedly high level of redundancy. A comparison of the chromosome 2 and 4 sequences indicates that &#x0223c;75&#x00025; of all predicted gene products show a significant similarity to another protein encoded elsewhere in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c1">1</xref>). A typical example of this potential functional redundancy is provided by components of the SnRK family in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Until completion of the genome sequence, two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes coding for SnRK catalytic &#x003b1;-subunits had been identified and demonstrated to complement the corresponding yeast <italic>snf1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c16">16</xref>). Similarly, two different genes were identified to code for putative homologs of Snf1&#x0002f;AMPK &#x003b3;-subunits based on sequence homology searches and yeast two-hybrid interaction studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c19">19</xref>). In addition, two different proteins showing domain homology to &#x003b2;-subunits of yeast Snf1 (Sip&#x0002f;Gal83 family) and animal AMPKs were identified and tested for interaction with an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SnRK &#x003b1;-subunit in the two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c17">17</xref>). However, our survey of the completed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome sequence indicates the presence of additional genes coding for putative SnRK subunits. Using the coding sequence of AKIN&#x003b2;2 in a BLASTP search, in addition to AKIN&#x003b2;1 we have identified five sequences (accession nos At2g28060, AT3g01510, At1g27070, AT5g39790 and AT3g52180) which show an overall similarity and significant domain homology to members of the yeast Sip protein family (<italic>P</italic> values of 1.3e<sup>&#x02013;20</sup>, 4.8e<sup>&#x02013;08</sup>, 4.8e<sup>&#x02013;06</sup>, 8.4e<sup>&#x02013;04</sup> and 2.3e<sup>&#x02013;02</sup>, respectively). A similar BLASTP search with the coding region of AKIN10 reveals a new member of the highly conserved &#x003b1;-subunit gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c16">16</xref>) (AT5g39440, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 2.9e<sup>&#x02013;196</sup>), as well as three additional genes for predicted proteins (AT4g24400, AT5g25110 and AT5g10930, <italic>P</italic> values of 3.7e<sup>&#x02013;74</sup>, 2.0e<sup>&#x02013;71</sup> and 1.4e<sup>&#x02013;70</sup>, respectively) showing significant homology to the regulatory domains of AKIN10 and AKIN11 catalytic &#x003b1;-subunits. As conserved sequences of regulatory domains of &#x003b1;-subunits are used as characteristic modules to identify members of the SnRK1 subfamily, it is likely that these proteins represent novel SnRK1 &#x003b1;-subunits. This surprising redundancy of genes coding for putative SnRK1 subunits suggests that many alternative kinase complexes could be formed by combinations of different subunits in plants. Determination of the subunit composition of SnRK complexes thus represents a demanding task for future studies.</p><p> Among the currently available techniques, the yeast two-hybrid system offers a simple and reliable means for sorting of protein interactions. Nonetheless, the results of two-hybrid interaction assays often require confirmation. Therefore, control <italic>in vitro</italic> protein binding studies are usually performed with recombinant proteins in combination with &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine labelling of their binding partners in various coupled transcription&#x02013;translation systems. In these <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays the interacting proteins are assembled in heterologous systems which lack potentially necessary endogenous factors (such as other subunits of a protein complex) and post-translational modifications. These evident problems call for development of new protein interaction assays which facilitate the characterisation of protein complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p> With the aim of detecting <italic>in vivo</italic> protein interactions between subunits of SnRK protein kinases in plant cells, we have developed a simple co-immunopurification assay based on a previously described intron-tagged epitope-labelling technique and efficient transformation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell suspensions by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>. In our previous studies we have exploited an intron-tagged HA epitope coding domain to affinity purify proteins and determine their localisation in plant cells using either transient expression or stable transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c22">22</xref>). In the present work we have optimised the application of another epitope in order to establish a reliable assay for monitoring the interaction of plant proteins labelled with HA and c-Myc epitopes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells. We used this technique to determine whether a recently described putative <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SnRK &#x003b2;-subunit (AKIN&#x003b2;2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c17">17</xref>) occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> in complexes with two previously characterised different &#x003b1;-subunits, AKIN10 and AKIN11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c16">16</xref>). We have observed that both AKIN10 and AKIN11 interact with the putative AKIN&#x003b2;2 regulatory subunit in the two-hybrid system. To verify the results of two-hybrid assays, AKIN&#x003b2;2 was labelled with an HA epitope and co-expressed with c-Myc epitope-labelled AKIN10 and AKIN11 proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells. A considerable difference was noted between the expression levels of c-Myc-tagged &#x003b1;-subunits and HA-tagged AKIN&#x003b2;2 protein by immunoblotting. However, this observation must be treated with necessary caution due to likely differences in the sensitivity and specificity of anti-HA and anti-c-Myc antibodies. Whereas western blotting suggested apparently low level expression, both myc&#x02013;AKIN10 and AKIN11&#x02013;myc proteins were isolated in association with comparable amounts of HA&#x02013;AKIN&#x003b2;2 protein using immunoaffinity binding to anti-HA and anti-c-Myc IgG beads.</p><p> Recent studies suggest that formation of different Snf1 kinase enzyme complexes with the Sip&#x0002f;Gal83 &#x003b2;-subunits may account for specific targeting of the Snf1 kinase to different substrates in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c13">13</xref>). Using the <italic>in planta</italic> protein interaction assay presented here, it is feasible now to label as pair-wise combinations all putative subunits of plant SnRK1 kinases with epitope tags. In addition to immunoaffinity purification of SnRK complexes, this approach could help to decipher the combinations of different subunits and determine their role in the recognition of different substrates and SnRK-binding signalling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke491c16">16</xref>). Although our present results are confined to suspension cultured cells, the described epitope-tagged constructs can also be used for generation of transgenic plants to facilitate the identification of multiprotein complexes that may show different subunit compositions in diverse cell types and phases of plant development.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke491f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Schematic map of intron-tagged c-Myc epitope vectors.
