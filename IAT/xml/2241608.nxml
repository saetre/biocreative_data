There is a strong interest in the pharmaceutical industry to develop high quality medium to high-throughput assays for detecting compounds with potential cardiac liability at the earliest stages of drug development. Cultivation of cells at lower temperature has been used to improve the folding and membrane localization of trafficking defective hERG mutant proteins. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of lower temperature maintenance on wild type hERG expression and assay performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Wild type hERG was stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells, with the majority of channel protein being located in the cytoplasm, but relatively little on the cell surface. Expression at both locations was increased several-fold by cultivation at lower growth temperatures. Intracellular hERG protein levels were highest at 27&#x000b0;C and this correlated with maximal <sup>3</sup>H-dofetilide binding activity. In contrast, the expression of functionally active cell surface-associated hERG measured by patch clamp electrophysiology was optimal at 30&#x000b0;C. The majority of the cytoplasmic hERG protein was associated with the membranes of cytoplasmic vesicles, which markedly increased in quantity and size at lower temperatures or in the presence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin. Incubation with the endocytic trafficking blocker, nocodazole, led to an increase in hERG activity at 37&#x000b0;C, but not at 30&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results are consistent with the concept that maintenance of cells at reduced temperature can be used to boost the functional expression of difficult-to-express membrane proteins and improve the quality of assays for medium to high-throughput compound screening.

Loss of function mutations in hERG or the administration of channel blockers cause a delay in membrane potential repolarization of the cardiac action potential, and give rise to a prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiograph ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], for review). This 'long QT syndrome' can trigger polymorphic ventricular dysrhythmias (<italic>torsades de pointes</italic>), syncope and sudden death.</p><p>The hERG channel is blocked by a plethora of structurally diverse compounds, including many marketed drugs, some of which, such as terfenadine and cisapride, have been withdrawn from the market due to this unwanted activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. For this reason there is strong interest within the pharmaceutical industry in optimizing the recombinant expression of hERG, in order to improve the quality of medium to high-throughput assays for detecting compounds with potential cardiac liability at the earliest stages of drug development.</p><p>Among some 200 hereditary mutations in KCNH2 that cause type 2 long QT (LQT2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], about 67% are missense alterations, the majority of which cause trafficking defects; that is, an overall reduction of cell surface hERG protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In most cases, when these mutants are expressed in HEK293 cells, the trafficking defects can be 'rescued' or at least partially corrected by incubating cells at 27&#x000b0;C or by adding hERG blockers such as E4041, or the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Low temperature maintenance has also been reported to increase the surface expression of trafficking defective mutants of CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] in stably transfected polarized CFBE41o-cells, wild type &#x003b1;7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in SH-EP1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], as well as the production of a number of recombinant proteins that are soluble and secreted in CHO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the mechanism of these temperature effects is not well understood.</p><p>Here we report an increase in expression of wild type hERG at lower growth temperatures and the characterization of the accumulation of hERG protein in intracellular vesicles in CHO-K1 cells. Our results demonstrate that low temperature growth can be an important tool in the development of robust drug screening assays for difficult-to-express ion channels such as hERG.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Increase in intracellular and cell surface hERG protein expression levels when cells were maintained at 30&#x000b0;C</title><p>A number of CHO-K1 stable cell lines over-expressing wild type hERG were established. Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy showed that most of the expressed hERG protein was located intracellularly and very little was associated with the cell surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;B</xref>). As low temperature cultivation has been reported to increase the surface expression of some membrane proteins, as well as the production of some non-membrane associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we looked at the effect of this treatment on wild type hERG expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Subcellular localization of expressed hERG.

Three days after switching to 30&#x000b0;C, hERG channel activity was measured by planar patch clamp electrophysiology using an IonWorksHT automated system. Current amplitudes measured at the tail end of a -30 mV inactivation step (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, for voltage command protocol), were 3-fold higher following incubation at 30&#x000b0;C with a mean of 0.93 nA (<italic>n </italic>= 686), compared to 0.28 nA (<italic>n </italic>= 657, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001) from the 37&#x000b0;C cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;D</xref>). The proportion of cells expressing tail currents above a threshold level of 0.1 nA (sufficient, for example, for high throughput compound screening) was also notably higher (96% vs 75%). These results suggest there is a general increase in expression of functional hERG protein on the cell surface of all cells examined at the lower temperature. An elevation of total channel protein associated with the cell membrane was observed at 30&#x000b0;C, as detected by Western blot (data not shown). Analysis by confocal microscopy confirmed these findings and also showed that, both at 37 and 30&#x000b0;C, hERG was largely concentrated in punctate cytoplasmic structures which became much more prominent at lower temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Increased functional expression of hERG at 30&#x000b0;C.

In the first experiment, total cellular hERG protein was measured using fixed and permeabilized cells labelled with an antibody (C20) raised against a peptide sequence located at the C-terminus of the protein which is predicted to be on the intracellular side of the plasma-membrane (or on the surface of internal membrane-bound organelles). Maintenance of the cells at 34, 32, 30, 27 and 23&#x000b0;C for 3 d increased total cellular hERG immunofluorescence compared with 37&#x000b0;C by some 2-, 3-, 4-, 6- and 3-fold, respectively. Thus, the total hERG protein expression peaked at 27&#x000b0;C, and then tailed off when the temperature was reduced further to 23&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). Extending the growth period from 3 to 7 d increased the expression still further, giving levels of ~6- and 10-fold higher than 37&#x000b0;C, at 30 and 27&#x000b0;C, respectively (data not shown), suggesting the effect was cumulative over time. Since nearly all of the immuno-fluorescence was cytoplasmic, these measurements largely reflect the amount of intracellular located hERG protein.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Quantification of total and surface-associated hERG protein in cells maintained at lower temperatures.

Following 3 d incubation, the increase in hERG fluorescence was ~3.5-fold at 30&#x000b0;C, and 2-fold at 27&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These results suggest that the amplitude of increase of hERG on the cell surface was similar to that in the cytoplasm at 30&#x000b0;C, while at 27&#x000b0;C, a higher proportion of the protein remained intracellular.</p></sec><sec><title>HERG electrophysiological activity was highest at 30&#x000b0;C, but <sup>3</sup>H-dofetilide binding activity was optimal at 27&#x000b0;C</title><p>The flow cytometry experiments described above showed that the optimal cultivation temperatures for intracellular and surface hERG protein expression were different. We next compared the level of functional activity expressed at 30 and 27&#x000b0;C, using two types of assay, patch clamp electrophysiology and <sup>3</sup>H-dofetilide binding. As before, the patch clamp experiments were carried out by automated planar array electrophysiology using an IonworksHT instrument which allows larger cell samples to be examined, thereby enabling greater statistical precision. In addition, unlike manual patch clamp, cells are sampled randomly from the total population, giving functional data that is more comparable to the protein expression data obtained by flow cytometry.</p><p>HERG electrophysiological activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) was elevated at both 30 and 27&#x000b0;C compared to 37&#x000b0;C, and was highest at 30&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The average currents at the tail end of the -30 mV inactivation step from cells at 37, 30 and 27&#x000b0;C were 0.38 (<italic>n </italic>= 133), 0.81 (<italic>n </italic>= 118) and 0.63 (<italic>n </italic>= 118) nA respectively, and are statistically different from each other (37/30&#x000b0;C <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001; 37/30&#x000b0;C <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, 30/27&#x000b0;C <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). On the other hand, although the level of specific <sup>3</sup>H-dofetilide binding activity also increased at both temperatures, peak levels occurred at 27&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Thus the ratios of total binding to non-specific binding from cells at 37, 30 and 27&#x000b0;C were 1.09, 1.29 and 1.78, respectively (37/30&#x000b0;C <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05; 37/27&#x000b0;C <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001, 30/27&#x000b0;C <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001). Thus peak ion channel activity, which measures functional cell surface hERG, occurred when surface-expressed hERG protein levels were highest (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), whereas maximum binding activity, which measures ligand binding in total crude membrane extracts composed of both intracellular and plasmic membranes, was correlated with peak expression of total hERG protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). These results strongly suggest that although the bulk of the protein is trapped inside the cell, it is nevertheless expressed in a form capable of binding specific ligands.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of hERG activity measured by patch clamp and <sup>3</sup>H-dofetilide binding in cells maintained at different growth temperatures.

At 27&#x000b0;C, in many cells, large vesicle/vacuole-like structures appeared in which much of hERG immunofluorescence was apparently located at their periphery (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Similar hERG-loaded large/vacuole-like vesicles were rare in 30&#x000b0;C cells, but became abundant when combined with the presence of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).

In these cases, the protein often remains primarily intracellular and can be rapidly degraded. The lack of significant quantities on the cell surface is often a major hindrance for drug discovery since it renders the development of robust assays that can be used for compound screening highly problematic. Low temperature maintenance has been reported to increase the yield of some recombinant proteins, including those that are soluble, secreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and membrane-bound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this study, using a variety of techniques including flow cytometry, immunoblotting and confocal and high resolution immunocytochemistry, we have demonstrated a cumulative increase over time in the level of cellular and surface hERG protein when expressing cells are cultured at lower temperature. These findings may be general since they occur in cell backgrounds other than CHO, including HEK293, and for some other channel proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and data not shown).</p><p>Confocal and high resolution ultrastructural immunocytochemistry showed that hERG protein expression was most prominent in intracellular vesicle/vacuole-like compartments.

Both confocal and electron microscopy detected hERG protein predominantly on the peripheral membrane of these vesicles. It is conceivable that such accumulation and enlargement of the vesicle/vacuole-like structures could be the result of a blockade en route to their destruction. Interestingly, similar to low temperature, thapsigargin can also "rescue" trafficking defective hERG mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Our results for the first time suggest a possible common mechanism for these two types of treatments.</p><p>When over-expressed, some membrane proteins are readily endocytosed after reaching the cell surface; some are destined for degradation in lysosomes while others can be recycled back to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The surface expression of hERG in HEK293 cells is strictly regulated, internalisation and lysosomal degradation can be rapidly induced by ceramide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In Swiss 3T3 cells, uptake of exogenous materials and transport through the endocytic pathway to lysosomes slowed at lower temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In HeLa cells, 20&#x000b0;C caused a small reduction of endocytosis, but a near complete block of the removal of internalised dextran-containing late endosome vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In rat hepatocytes, temperatures of 16&#x02013;20&#x000b0;C blocked the transition from early to late endosomes, and from late endosomes to lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Uptake and catabolism of endocytic particles continued, but progressively slowed as the temperature decreased from 35 to 20&#x000b0;C. Fusion of the vesicles to lysosomes did not occur at 20&#x000b0;C or below, while endocytosis and internal vesicle movement continued and only stopped at a much lower temperature, below 10&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our results demonstrating the accumulation of intracellular vesicles loaded with hERG channel protein that is apparently fully able to bind<sup>3</sup>H-dofetilide, together with an increased stability of the protein at the lower temperature (detected by pulse chase labelling, data not shown), are in clear agreement with these previous reports and are consistent with a model of reduced trafficking of vesicles further down the endocytic pathway for degradation, albeit perhaps in combination with a small, but significant reduction in endocytosis.</p><p>The above data are further strengthened by the present results with nocodazole. The compound has no effect on endocytosis, but blocks microtubule-dependant steps later in the endocytic pathway. In HeLa cells, nocodazole prevented transferrin transport from early endosomes to the peri-nuclear recycling compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and caused accumulation of endosomal carrier vesicles, a compartment intermediate between early and late endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In a similar manner in BHK cells, nocodazole caused the accumulation of spherical vesicles that has little fusion activity, suggesting that transport between early and late endosomes requires intact microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, pre-treatment of CHO, 3T3, HeLa, and NRK cells with nocodazole inhibited the content exchange of lysosomes in cell fusion experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In our experiments, the effects of nocodazole and low temperature were similar, but not additive. This is consistent with the effect of nocodazole being due to blockade of endocytic trafficking rather than cell cycle progression, since in the latter scenario the increase in hERG expression would have been expected to be larger when combined with 30&#x000b0;C. The cells can be maintained at 30&#x000b0;C continuously with healthy exponential growth, albeit at a slower rate, without any sign of cell cycle arrest found in the cells treated with nocodazole, such as complete growth arrest and multi-nucleation. The accumulation of hERG at 30&#x000b0;C was greater than in the presence of nocodazole even at 37&#x000b0;C, suggesting that cell cycle arrest alone can not explain this temperature effect.</p><p>It is conceivable that a number of other mechanisms could also, perhaps to a lesser extent, contribute to the temperature effect on hERG expression, such as an improvement in protein folding, maturation or trafficking to the cell surface. While a number of hereditary mutations in hERG render the protein misfolded and destined for ER-associated degradation through proteosomes, there is little evidence of this happening for the wild type protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that low temperature maintenance can be used to boost the functional expression of some difficult-to-express cell surface membrane associated proteins such as the hERG channel, and significantly improve the quality of compound screening assays ranging from patch clamping to radio-ligand binding. The data also sheds some light on the mechanism of this temperature effect.</p><p>We hypothesis that at the normal culturing temperature of 37&#x000b0;C, some of the over-expressed hERG channel protein reaches the cell surface, but is rapidly internalized. This and perhaps other exit trafficking routes sends the protein to intracellular vesicles destined for degradation. Transfer into lysosomes and, to a lesser extent, endocytosis are disproportionately slowed as the temperature is reduced leading to the accumulation of hERG-loaded vesicles as well as an accumulation of hERG protein on the cell surface. Some of the retained hERG protein can perhaps be trafficked back to the cell surface due to constitutive endocytic recycling, similar to that occurs with some other membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The aggregation of these effects leads to an increase in protein retention both inside the cell and on the surface membrane. It is likely that an increase in cellular retention of trafficking defective hereditary mutant hERG proteins, through this mechanism, could contribute to the low temperature channel "rescue", in addition to improvements perhaps in folding and trafficking through the ER-Golgi network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen unless otherwise stated.
