Central to the function of PCSK9 is a direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction formed with the LDLR. In the present study, we investigated a strategy to modulate LDL uptake by blocking this interaction using specific antibodies directed against PCSK9. Studies using surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that direct binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR could be abolished with three different anti-PCSK9 antibodies. Two of these antibodies were raised against peptide epitopes in a region of the catalytic domain of PCSK9 that is involved in the interaction with the LDLR. Such antibodies restored LDL uptake in HepG2 cells treated with exogenous PCSK9 and in HepG2 cells engineered to overexpress recombinant PCSK9. This latter observation indicates that antibodies blocking the PCSK9&#x02013;LDLR interaction can inhibit the action of PCSK9 produced endogenously in a cell-based system. These antibodies also disrupted the higher-affinity interaction between the natural gain-of-function mutant of PCSK9, D374Y, and the LDLR in both the cell-free and cell-based assays. These data indicate that antibodies targeting PCSK9 can reverse the PCSK9-mediated modulation of cell-surface LDLRs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>antibody-mediated disruption</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>low-density lipoprotein receptor</kwd><kwd>proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type&#x000a0;9 (PCSK9)</kwd><kwd>protein&#x02013;protein interaction</kwd><kwd>surface plasmon resonance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>aa, amino acids</kwd><kwd>BODIPY&#x000ae;, boron dipyrromethene (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-<italic>s</italic>-indacene</kwd><kwd>CHRD, cysteine/histidine-rich domain</kwd><kwd>EGF-A, epidermal growth factor-like repeat A</kwd><kwd>FBS, fetal bovine serum</kwd><kwd>HEK-F cells, Freestyle&#x02122; suspension human embryonic kidney cells</kwd><kwd>IL1Ra, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist</kwd><kwd>LDL, low-density lipoprotein</kwd><kwd>LDLc, LDL-cholesterol</kwd><kwd>LDLR, LDL receptor</kwd><kwd>MOI, multiplicity of infection</kwd><kwd>PCSK9, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type&#x000a0;9</kwd><kwd>RU, resonance units</kwd><kwd>SPR, surface plasmon resonance</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="28"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cardiovascular disease is one of the great plagues of our affluent society, responsible for approx. 30% of all deaths each year. In addition to lifestyle risk factors, such as poor diet and smoking, genetic predisposition also contributes to the prevalence of the disease. Sufferers of familial hypercholesterolaemia exhibit highly elevated serum LDLc [LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol] levels, leading to premature atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recently, a novel serine protease, PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type&#x000a0;9) was identified as the third genetic locus for autosomal dominant hypercholesterolaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. PCSK9 is involved in the metabolism of LDLc through its action on the LDLR (LDL receptor), degrading the receptor via a mechanism which has yet to be fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Structurally, PCSK9 consists of a 30 aa (amino acid) signal peptide, followed by a prodomain (aa 31&#x02013;152), a catalytic domain (aa 153&#x02013;425) and a CHRD (C-terminal cysteine/histidine-rich domain) (aa 426&#x02013;692) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. PCSK9 is synthesized as a &#x0223c;72&#x000a0;kDa precursor protein that undergoes autocatalytic cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. After cleavage, the &#x0223c;14&#x000a0;kDa prodomain remains tightly associated with the active site, rendering the mature protein catalytically inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. PCSK9 undergoes a variety of post-translational modifications before being secreted efficiently from the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In cell-culture systems, overexpression of PCSK9 resulted in a decrease in LDLR levels via a post-transcriptional mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, PCSK9 does not affect the synthesis or trafficking of the LDLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The addition of media containing recombinant PCSK9 to HepG2 cells caused a reduction in the number of surface LDLRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It has now been established that PCSK9 forms a direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction with the EGF-A (epidermal growth factor-like repeat A) domain of the LDLR that results in targeting of the LDLR to lysosomes for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This interaction appears to be necessary, and may be sufficient, for PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation, a hypothesis supported by two studies showing that the addition of catalytically inactive PCSK9 to HepG2 cells decreased LDLR levels to the same extent as wild-type PCSK9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Further evidence supporting the importance of the PCSK9&#x02013;LDLR interaction was the discovery that the natural PCSK9 gain-of-function mutant D374Y, which causes a particularly severe form of hypercholesterolaemia, has a significantly increased binding affinity for the LDLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we investigated a strategy to disrupt the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR using specific antibodies directed against PCSK9, and examined the effects this has on LDL uptake in cellular models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>cDNA and site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>The cDNA encoding human PCSK9 (GenBank&#x000ae; accession number AX207686) was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers and incorporating a 3&#x02032; FLAG tag sequence (DYKDDDDK) to aid purification of the expressed product, and <italic>att</italic>B1 and <italic>att</italic>B2 sites at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends respectively.

To investigate this approach, a variety of anti-PCSK9 antibodies were assessed for their ability to block the PCSK9&#x02013;LDLR interaction in an SPR binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Pre-incubation of PCSK9 with three affinity-purified anti-PCSK9 antibodies resulted in disruption of the interaction. These antibodies were AF3888 (a polyclonal antibody raised against mature PCSK9) and two polyclonal antibodies, E6675 and E6660, raised against PCSK9 peptide sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). At a concentration of 500&#x000a0;nM, AF3888 reduced the binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR by 81%, whereas E6675 and E6660 reduced binding by 90 and 89% respectively. A fourth anti-PCSK9 antibody, Ab28770, raised against a C-terminal peptide did not block the binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR, but instead gave an apparent increased binding level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). This effect may be due to the inability of Ab28770 to prevent PCSK9 binding to the LDLR; the increased signal corresponds to the increased mass of the PCSK9&#x02013;Ab28770 complex relative to PCSK9 alone. No effect was seen with the control antibody directed against IL1Ra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Antibody interference of the PCSK9&#x02013;LDLR interaction</title><p>LDLR was immobilized via amine coupling to a CM5 sensorchip.

Furthermore, we have shown that blocking the interaction in this way reduces PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation in a hepatocyte cell-based system. Three antibodies capable of mediating this effect were identified: a commercial polyclonal antibody raised against full-length PCSK9 (AF3888) and two polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides corresponding to regions of PCSK9 known to be crucial for LDLR binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A fourth anti-PCSK9 antibody to an epitope in the CHRD that is not involved in the interaction with the LDLR was used to demonstrate that antibody binding alone was not sufficient to disrupt the interaction.</p><p>In a cell-based functional assay monitoring uptake of fluorescently labelled LDL, pre-incubation of purified recombinant PCSK9 with antibody AF3888 led to a reduction in PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation, allowing levels of cellular LDL uptake to return to normal. In order to assess further the effect of the antibody, the BODIPY&#x000ae;&#x02013;LDL uptake assay was modified to incorporate BacMam virus-mediated overexpression of PCSK9 in place of treatment with purified protein. When transduced cells overexpressing PCSK9 (wild-type or the gain-of-function mutant D374Y) were incubated with the blocking antibody, AF3888, there was reversal of the PCSK9 effect on LDL uptake relative to transduced cells in the absence of blocking antibody. Additionally, the results of the present study demonstrate that the higher-affinity interaction between the D374Y mutant and LDLR could also be disrupted, albeit with higher concentrations of antibody than were required to disrupt the wild-type PCSK9&#x02013;LDLR interaction.</p><p>The antibody-mediated reversal of the PCSK9 effect on LDL uptake was lower in the cell-based model when PCSK9 was overexpressed in the cells rather than being added exogenously as a purified protein. This may reflect that insufficient antibody was present to neutralize the continual overexpression of PCSK9. However, we did seek to overcome this by replenishing the medium during the time course of the experiment with the maximum amount of fresh antibody that the experimental system would allow. An alternative possibility is that there may be an additional cellular site of interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR that is inaccessible to the antibody. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that PCSK9 may act upon the LDLR in a post-endoplasmic reticulum compartment before its secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], in addition to the well-characterized effect of secreted PCSK9 on cell-surface LDLR. Nevertheless, our data clearly show that antibodies blocking the PCSK9&#x02013;LDLR interaction can inhibit the action of PCSK9 endogenously produced in a cell-based system.</p><p>During the course of the present study, it was reported that the isolated EGF-A domain of the LDLR was sufficient to inhibit the LDLR-lowering effect of purified PCSK9 added exogenously to HEK-293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Epitope excision and MS using PCSK9 and the PCSK9&#x02013;EGF-A complex revealed that aa 175&#x02013;210 of PCSK9 remained bound to EGF-A after protease treatment and washing. Interestingly, this region overlaps with the peptide (aa 207&#x02013;223) against which antibody E6660 was raised and which we have shown blocks the interaction of PCSK9 with the LDLR.</p><p>Despite the success of currently available lipid-lowering therapeutics, there are still &#x0003e;267 million people worldwide that have a plasma total cholesterol concentration of &#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mg/dl (5.17&#x000a0;mmol/l) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], significantly increasing their risk of coronary heart disease, a condition that accounts for &#x0003e;30% of all deaths in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition to their inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and the resultant up-regulation of the LDLR, the most widely prescribed class of drugs, the statins, also have the effect of up-regulating PCSK9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This potentially limits their efficacy, and suggests that supplementing this therapy with an agent inhibiting the action of PCSK9 may have significant benefit. This approach is supported by studies of <italic>Pcsk9</italic>-knockout mice, as well as humans with missense mutations in <italic>PCSK9</italic>, which both exhibit increased sensitivity to statins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, reducing PCSK9 expression, either via antisense or RNAi (RNA interference), effectively reduces plasma LDLc levels in rodents and non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. An alternative approach to prevent the biological effect of PCSK9 is to abrogate binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR using antibodies or small molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], rather than reducing expression of endogenous PCSK9.</p><p>In summary, the present paper reports the first demonstration that antibodies directed against PCSK9 are able to specifically block its interaction with the LDLR. <italic>in vitro</italic>, such antibodies were able to inhibit the interaction between purified recombinant PCSK9 and the extracellular domain of the LDLR. Those antibodies capable of blocking the interaction mapped to the region on PCSK9 were reported recently to interact directly with the LDLR EGF-A domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We have demonstrated further using cell-based LDL-uptake assays that one of these blocking antibodies could inhibit the effect of both wild-type PCSK9 and the D374Y natural gain-of-function mutant. The results suggest that targeting PCSK9 using a specific antibody may represent a strategy for the treatment of dyslipidaemia by reversing PCSK9-mediated modulation of cell-surface LDLRs.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>C.
