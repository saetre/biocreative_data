PDGF-BB is produced by most types of solid tumors, and PDGF receptor signaling participates in various processes, including autocrine stimulation of tumor cell growth, recruitment of tumor stroma fibroblasts, and stimulation of tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, PDGF-BB-producing tumors are characterized by increased pericyte abundance and accelerated tumor growth. Thus, there is a growing interest in the development of tumor treatment strategies by blocking PDGF/PDGFR function. We have recently generated a mouse model carrying an activated PDGFR-&#x003b2; by replacing the highly conserved aspartic acid residue (D) 849 in the activating loop with asparagine (N). This allowed us to investigate, in an orthotopic tumor model, the role of increased stromal PDGFR-&#x003b2; signaling in tumor-stroma interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>B16 melanoma cells lacking PDGFR-&#x003b2; expression and either mock-transfected or engineered to express PDGF-BB, were injected alone or in combination with matrigel into mice carrying the activated PDGFR-&#x003b2; (D849N) and into wild type mice.

At later phases of tumor progression, no significant difference in tumor growth rate was observed between wild type mice and mutant mice, although the pericyte coverage was higher around tumor vessels from mutant mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings suggest that the activated PDGFR-&#x003b2; (D849N) in the host animal increased the total vessel area and the average vessel surface even in PDGF-negative tumors, resulting in a shorter lag phase during tumor establishment.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB is a homodimeric growth factor with a broad range of target cells, notably mesoderm-derived cells, such as pericytes and mesangial cells, but also ectoderm-derived glial cells and neurons. PDGF-BB binds to two distinct receptor tyrosine kinases denoted PDGF receptor (PDGFR)- &#x003b1; and &#x02013; &#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>PDGF-BB and PDGFR-&#x003b2; are mainly expressed in the developing vasculature, where PDGF-BB is produced by endothelial cells which attract PDGFR-&#x003b2; expressing mural cells, i.e. pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Knockout studies of PDGF-B or PDGFR-&#x003b2; identified pericyte deficiency of the microvasculature as a main phenotype, resulting in lethal hemorrhage and edema at late gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>PDGF-BB is produced by most types of solid tumors, inducing stroma formation and neovascular response in order to secure sufficient supply of nutrients and oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been shown that PDGFR-&#x003b2; expression by pericytes is necessary for their recruitment to tumor vessels and that extracellular retention of PDGF-BB produced by the tumor endothelium is required for the recruitment of adequate numbers of pericytes, as well as for proper integration of pericytes into the vascular wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that pericyte density correlates inversely with the effect of antiangiogenic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Using mouse models it was shown that inhibition of PDGF signaling reduces interstitial fluid pressure in tumors, and thereby enhances the effect of chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Together, these examples suggest potential benefits of targeting PDGFR-&#x003b2; in the treatment of tumors.</p><p>Recently, PDGF receptor signaling was shown to be perturbed by mutations within the activation loop of PDGFR-&#x003b1; in a subset of wild-type c-kit expressing gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. One of these mutations, D842V, resulted in receptors displaying ligand-independent receptor phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We have recently generated a mouse model carrying a mutation in the corresponding amino acid residue in the activation loop of the murine PDGFR-&#x003b2;; namely an exchange of asparagine for aspartic acid at amino acid position 849 (D849N). This mutation did not cause any tumor formation in homozygous mutant mice, despite the fact that this mutation also caused ligand-independent receptor autophosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This elevated basal phosphorylation resulted in a dramatically increased ligand-independent anti-apoptotic signaling and migration, as well as a ligand-dependent increase in proliferation of D849N-mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts. This prompted us to investigate how a host environment carrying a D849N-activated PDGFR-&#x003b2; would influence tumor formation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In the present study, we show that a stromal environment with the D849N-mutant PDGFR&#x003b2; favored earlier establishment of PDGF-BB expression-negative tumors up to a size of 0.3 cm<sup>3</sup>, due to increased vascularization, characterized by increased total vessel area and average vessel surface.

For double staining of pericytes and endothelial cells, anti- &#x003b1; smooth muscle actin (ASMA) monoclonal antibodies (1 &#x003bc;g/ml; clone 1A4, Dako) and goat-anti-mouse CD31/platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) antibodies (1 &#x003bc;g/ml sc-1506; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used consecutively. Macrophages were identified with rat anti-mouse F4/80 antibodies (1:100, MCAP497, clone A3-1, Serotec). Omission of primary antibody was used as negative control. Primary antibodies for ASMA, CD31 and F4/80 were detected using either biotinylated rabbit-anti-mouse antibodies (1:500, E0354, DAKO) visualized by Vectastain ABC-HRP kit (1:100, Vector Laboratories), or biotinylated rabbit-anti-goat antibodies (1:500, E0466, DAKO) visualized by Vectastain ABC-AP kit (1:100, Vector Laboratories), or biotinylated goat-anti-rat antibodies (10 &#x003bc;g/ml, BA9400, VECTOR) visualized by Vectastain ABC-HRP kit (1:100, Vector Laboratories) respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mayer's hematoxylin was used as counterstain. Using a Leica microscope (DM4000) equipped with a Leica DFC camera and Qwin software, several parameters, such as the total vessel surface, viable tumor area, number of vessels and pericytes and perimeter of vessels, were calculated. All immunohistochemical analyses were performed on 20 high-power fields per tumor. Only viable tumor area was examined. The ratio of total vessel area per tumor was defined as the total surface of vessel area divided by the area of viable tumor. The average vessel area was defined as total vessel area divided by the total number of vessels. The number of vessels per high-power field was defined as total number of vessels divided by the number of analyzed fields (n = 20). The numerical density of pericytes per perimeter of vessel was defined as the number of pericyte nuclei associated with tumor vessels divided by the sum of vessel perimeter.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA. <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PDGF-BB expression increases tumor vascularization in wild type and D849N-mutant mice but has no further increasing effect on pericyte coverage in D849N-mutant mice</title><p>It has been shown that the ectopic expression of PDGF-BB by subcutaneously injected melanoma cells has a positive effect on tumor vascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, we first analyzed the effect of PDGF-BB-expression on the vascular compartment in large (0.8 cm<sup>3</sup>) B16 tumors in wild type mice and D849N-mutant mice (n = 6 tumors for each experimental group). Staining for CD31 identified endothelial cells, whereas perivascular cells/pericytes were identified by staining for ASMA. In both wild type and D849N-mutant mice, the ratio of vessel area/tumor area was higher for PDGF-BB-expressing B16-tumors, compared to mock-transfected B16-tumors (wild type p &#x0003c; 0.05, D849N-mutant p &#x0003c; 0.01) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). However for PDGF-BB expressing tumors, there was only a tendency (p = 0.1371) towards an increased ratio of vessel area/tumor area in D849N-mutant mice (0.065 +/- 0.022) compared to wild type mice (0.049 +/-0.014) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

Six tumors were analyzed for each experimental combination.

We confirmed these initial findings in another experimental series, in which we only used mock-transfected B16 melanoma cells (twelve tumors each from wild type and D849N-mutant mice).

In our study, ectopic PDGF-BB expression by B16 melanoma cells correlated with increased vascularization and pericyte coverage in established, large (0.8&#x02013;1.0 cm<sup>3</sup>) tumors. This is in accordance with previous studies indicating that PDGF-BB induces more mature vessels with higher pericyte density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, we found the pericyte density elevated in mice carrying an activating mutation (D849N) in PDGFR-&#x003b2;, independent of ectopic PDGF-BB expression, supporting earlier observations that this mutation causes significant receptor signaling in the absence of ligand, or greatly increases sensitivity towards very low amounts of ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Since the pericyte coverage of the tumor vasculature in D849N-mutant mice was autonomously elevated, we continued our experiments with B16 melanoma cells lacking PDGF-BB expression. In several mouse tumor models, it has been shown that paracrine stimulation of PDGFR-&#x003b2; is associated with increased tumor growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In agreement with this, we found that tumors grew faster in mice with activated PDGFR-&#x003b2;, compared to wild type mice. However, this was statistically significant only during tumor establishment, i.e. until a volume 0.2 to 0.3 cm<sup>3</sup>. In order to investigate the influence of the host stroma on early tumor establishment, we mixed B-16 melanoma cells with matrigel. In contrast to the situation in large tumors (0.8&#x02013;1.0 cm<sup>3</sup>), there was no difference in pericyte density, but the tumors grown in D849N-mutant mice were characterized by significantly increased vascularization. Therefore, the growth advantage during tumor establishment is most probably due to increased blood supply. Experimental angiogenesis is characterized by a sequential invasion of subcutaneous matrigel plugs by monocyte/macrophages, fibroblasts, pericytes and endothelial (precursor) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although we did not see any difference in macrophage staining in subcutaneous matrigel plugs lacking tumor cells (data not shown), we found that ASMA-positive stromal cells in D849N-mutant mice more efficiently invaded matrigel plugs. This implies that a more active stromal compartment probably drives the improved vascularization during tumor establishment in mice carrying an activated PDGFR-&#x003b2;. On the other hand, it seems unlikely that an enhanced direct interaction between stromal fibroblasts and tumor cells could account for the earlier tumor establishment in D849N-mutant mice, since there was no difference in proliferation of B16 melanoma cells co-cultured with either irradiated wild type or irradiated D849N-mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts <italic>in vitro </italic>(data not shown). However, we cannot exclude an increased participation of circulating hemangioblasts (hematopoietic/endothelial precursor cells) in early tumor vascularization in D849N-mutant mice. Recently, increased PDGFR-&#x003b2; signaling due to transgenic overexpression of PDGF-B, or the D849N-mutant PDGFR-&#x003b2; was shown to promote endothelial cell differentiation of hemangioblasts <italic>in vivo </italic>at the expense of hematopoietic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have found two different effects of D849N-mutant PDGFR-&#x003b2; signaling in our melanoma mouse model. During late phase, when the tumor is characterized by remodeling of necrotic areas and tumor re-growth, tumor vessels provided by the D849N-mutant host stroma are more densely covered by perivascular cells, but this does not to result in any appreciable tumor growth advantage. During early phases of tumor development however, the mutant host stroma supports the establishment of tumor more efficiently, due to increased vascularization. This is an important observation, as it demonstrates that activating mutations of growth factor receptors in the host stroma can accelerate tumor establishment in the absence of tumor-derived ligand expression, and thus contribute to shortened tumor dormancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; IHC, immunohistochemistry</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SS participated in the study design, carried out most of the animal studies, performed all of the histological evaluation, including statistical analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
