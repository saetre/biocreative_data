Functional analyses showed that <italic>HAND2 </italic>belongs to the group of BMP induced transcription factors that acts downstream of <italic>PHOX2B </italic>and upstream of <italic>GATA2, GATA3, PHOX2A </italic>and the noradrenergic marker genes <italic>Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) </italic>and <italic>Dopamine Beta Hydroxylase (DBH) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, <italic>HAND2 </italic>is highly expressed in neuroblastoma (NB), a pediatric tumor arising from undifferentiated migrating sympathetic precursor cells that shows conspicuously divergent biological phenotypes ranging from spontaneous regression to rapid progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we have reported on the identification of <italic>DEIN</italic>, a novel gene with high expression in NB of children &#x0003c;1 year of age and stage 4S NB, both of which are associated with a good prognosis and spontaneous regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Given the lack of a putative coding region, <italic>DEIN </italic>was predicted to represent a noncoding RNA whose function in NB and sympathetic nervous system development is yet unclear. <italic>DEIN </italic>is located on chromosome 4q33&#x02013;34 in a head-to-head orientation with <italic>HAND2 </italic>with both genes being separated by a nucleotide sequence of 228 bp. The close vicinity and divergent configuration of both genes together with their concurrent tissue specific expression pattern suggests a common transcriptional regulation that is mediated by the intergenic sequence. Bidirectional gene organisation was shown to represent a common feature in the human genome with approximately 10% of all genes showing this configuration. Many of these gene pairs were shown to be co-regulated and/or functionally related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>This study aimed to examine the potential of the intergenic region to direct transcription in <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN </italic>orientation, thereby acting as a bidirectional promoter. In addition, conservation and structural features such as putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) of the genomic region were analyzed. To test whether the expression of both genes is co-regulated in NB <italic>in vivo </italic>and associated with prognostic factors, expression levels of <italic>DEIN </italic>and <italic>HAND2 </italic>were examined in a cohort of 236 primary NBs of different stages by microarray analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Determination of transcriptional start sites and the nucleotide structures of <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN </italic>transcripts in NB</title><p>The human <italic>HAND2 </italic>gene was initially cloned from a human fetal cardiac cDNA library by Russel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The 1.3 kb long consensus sequence derived from cDNA clones <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF087940">AF087940</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF087941">AF087941</ext-link> was shorter than the 2.3 kb transcript detected in Northern Blot, and the authors expected the unaccounted sequence to be located in the 3'-UTR of the gene. However, numerous transcribed sequences containing the coding region of <italic>HAND2 </italic>and extending several 100 bp in 5'-direction have been submitted to GenBank in recent years suggesting that the unaccounted sequence is most probably located upstream of the coding region. In order to determine the transcriptional start site and the full length sequence of the main <italic>HAND2 </italic>transcript in NB, we performed a combined RACE- and RT-PCR approach. The resulting transcript is 2351 bp long and comprises two exons of 1495 and 856 bp (GenBank accession <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FJ226608">FJ226608</ext-link>). The 5'-sequence of the first exon extends into a CpG island with an average GC-content of 70% which might have impeded the full-length cloning of the human transcript in previous attempts. Our results are well in line with the reported length of 2.3 kb by Northern Blot hybridization from heart tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and our Northern Blot analyses. The genomic structure of <italic>HAND2 </italic>with a long first and a shorter second exon with the coding region being interrupted by an intron is highly conserved in other species such as mouse, rat, chicken and zebrafish (data not shown). Furthermore, the transcriptional start site of <italic>HAND2 </italic>is highly conserved in all of these species. The 5'-end of <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FJ226608">FJ226608</ext-link> is identical with the start sites of mRNA <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AK122739">AK122739</ext-link> and EST <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DA609347">DA609347</ext-link>, both of which were derived from NB cell line IMR-32. In contrast, the <italic>HAND2 </italic>reference sequence <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_021973">NM_021973</ext-link>, which has not been experimentally confirmed, lacks two nucleotides at its 5'-end as compared to our transcript.

We detected strong expression of both genes in all stage 4S tumors, moderate to low expression in localized tumors, and little or no expression in stage 4 tumors (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In NB cell lines, expression of <italic>DEIN </italic>and <italic>HAND2 </italic>was detected in cell lines SH-SY5Y and Kelly, but it was absent in cell line SH-EP.

Patients diagnosed before the age of one year had significantly higher <italic>DEIN </italic>and <italic>HAND2 </italic>expression values as compared to patients diagnosed later (both p = 0.001; fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Expression of both genes was also significantly higher in children diagnosed before the age of 18 months as compared to older patients (both p = 0.01; data not shown). As expected, <italic>DEIN </italic>expression was significantly higher in tumors of stage 4S than in those of stage 4 (p = 0.02). These results are in line with our previous study that reported on a strong association between <italic>DEIN </italic>expression and stage 4S as well as age &#x0003c; 1 year in a cohort of 121 primary NBs by real-time RT-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, in contrast to the results of our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], <italic>DEIN </italic>expression was neither significantly different between stage 4 and localized stages, nor between stage 4S and localized stages in the micoarray analyses (data not shown). This discrepancy might be explained by the high percentage of patients &#x0003c;12 months of age among localized tumors in the microarray cohort (81/119 patients, 68%). <italic>HAND2 </italic>mRNA levels were not associated with either stage, which is in agreement with a study of Gestbloom et al., who reported that <italic>HAND2 </italic>is expressed independently of tumor stage or differentiation in NB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

A total of six reporter gene constructs were transfected into four neuroblastoma cell lines (summarized in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Bidirectional gene configuration, defined as two divergently transcribed genes that are separated by less than 1 kb, is a common architectural feature in the human genome and was shown to account for co-regulated and/or tissue specific expression of functionally related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Most of these genes have been reported to belong to the group of housekeeping genes many of which are involved in DNA repair and replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In recent years, other non-homologous bidirectional gene pairs were identified with functions in senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], antigen presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], brain disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], oncogenesis or tumor supression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><sec><title>Structure and conservation of the bidirectional promoter</title><p>The majority of bidirectional promoters are less than 300 bp in length, have a median GC-content of 66% and associate with CpG-islands in 75% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. All these features are present in the common promoter region of <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN</italic>, which is 228 bp long, contains 13 CpG sites and has a GC-Content of 70%. Interestingly, the distance between <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN </italic>remained stable throughout evolution with only 14 and 7 additional nucleotides in the human sequence as compared to chicken and mouse, respectively. Although there is no systematic evaluation on the alteration of the genomic distance between bidirectional gene pairs throughout evolution, we found examples reporting a far more dramatic increase of several hundreds of bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The constancy of the intergenic distance between <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN </italic>might thus be indicative of the selective pressure that was acting to maintain the close distance of the genes over a long evolutionary period.</p><p>The nucleotide sequence, exon number and transcript structure including intron-exon boundaries of <italic>HAND2 </italic>are highly conserved among different species including chicken and zebrafish. In contrast, <italic>DEIN </italic>is only conserved in mouse and chicken but not zebrafish, and shows an overall lower conservation that decreases in 3'-direction with the highest conservation in exons 1 and 2 and a region in exon 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Numerous transcribed sequences matching nearly all exons of <italic>DEIN </italic>were found in mouse and chicken, but not in zebrafish.

We conclude from these findings that (1) <italic>DEIN </italic>has probably first evolved after zebrafish in higher vertebrates, and that (2) bidirectional transcription of <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN </italic>is probably evolutionary conserved in higher vertebrates such as rodents and birds. The latter conclusion is further supported by large-scale comparative analyses of bidirectional promoters in vertebrates using orthology assignments, according to which many bidirectional promoters have emerged after the divergence of birds and fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Asymmetrical activity of the bidirectional promoter in NB cell lines</title><p>The activity of the bidirectional promoter in four NB cell lines was shown to be asymmetric with strong activity in <italic>HAND2 </italic>and moderate activity in <italic>DEIN </italic>orientation.

However, the <italic>in vitro </italic>repressive activity could also be a result of steric inhibition of transcription factors, since the genetic distance between the two regulatory elements and the promoter in the genome is about 6 &#x02013; 8 kb, whereas it is only 44 bp &#x02013; 1.9 kb in the luciferase reporter constructs.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional regulation and putative functional link of <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN </italic>in NB</title><p>Tissue specific regulation of <italic>HAND2 </italic>expression by cis-regulatory elements located in its upstream genomic region has been extensively studied in heart and branchial arches, but to date, genomic elements that are critical for <italic>HAND2 </italic>expression in the developing sympathetic nervous system have not been identified. In heart, <italic>HAND2 </italic>transcription depends on an enhancer element consisting of two conserved <italic>GATA </italic>sites that are dispersed over a genomic region of 1.5 kb between exon 3 and 4 of <italic>DEIN </italic>with an overall low conservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

According to McFadden et al. who studied regulatory elements for <italic>HAND2 </italic>expression in mouse, the genomic region 11 kb upstream of <italic>hand2 </italic>did not direct expression in sympathetic ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This result seems to be in contrast with our finding of a strong transcriptional activation of a reporter gene by the 228 bp upstream region of <italic>HAND2 </italic>in human NB cells that are suggested to derive from sympathicoadrenal precursors.</p><p>Our data indicate that the bidirectional promoter is an important element for <italic>HAND2 </italic>expression in sympathicoadrenal tissues, although the exact transcriptional activators have not been specified yet. It has been demonstrated earlier that <italic>Phox2b </italic>knockout mice lack <italic>Hand2 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These data strongly suggest that <italic>PHOX2B</italic>, a master gene required for the development and differentiation of autonomic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], is an upstream activator of <italic>HAND2 </italic>in the developing sympathetic nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Expression analyses of <italic>PHOX2B, HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN </italic>in NB cells lines SH-SY5Y and SH-EP, two well-studied subclones of SK-N-SH with a neuronal-like and epithelial-like phenotype, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], further suggest that not only <italic>HAND2</italic>, but also <italic>DEIN </italic>is a target gene of <italic>PHOX2B</italic>: In cell line SH-EP, <italic>PHOX2B </italic>expression was shown to be absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and likewise, neither <italic>HAND2 </italic>nor <italic>DEIN </italic>was expressed in SH-EP cells according to our Northern Blot analysis (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>); in contrast, all three genes are expressed in cell line SH-SY5Y ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In order to investigate whether <italic>DEIN </italic>and <italic>HAND2 </italic>are possible downstream targets of <italic>PHOX2B </italic>in primary NB, we simultaneously examined <italic>DEIN </italic>and <italic>HAND2 </italic>mRNA levels in sixty selected tumors with high and low <italic>PHOX2B </italic>expression values using microarrays (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Tumors of both subgroups showed largely concordant expression levels of <italic>DEIN </italic>and <italic>HAND2</italic>. However, whereas low expression levels of <italic>PHOX2B </italic>were consistently associated with low mRNA levels of <italic>DEIN </italic>and <italic>HAND2 </italic>in the vast majority of cases, the degree of correlation appeared to be lower for tumors with high <italic>PHOX2B </italic>expression levels. These observations provide further evidence that <italic>PHOX2B </italic>may act as an upstream activator of both <italic>DEIN </italic>and <italic>HAND2</italic>, although additional factors may be necessary to induce expression of these genes in NB. Taking the presence of multiple conserved binding sites for homeobox transcription factors within the bidirectional promoter and the concurrent expression of <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN </italic>in NB into account, it is tempting to speculate that <italic>PHOX2B </italic>could actually represent a direct transcriptional activator for <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN </italic>via the common promoter sequence.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Hierarchical cluster analysis of 60 primary neuroblastomas with high and low <italic>PHOX2B </italic>expression levels according to expression of <italic>DEIN, HAND2 </italic>and <italic>PHOX2B </italic>as determined by microarray analysis</bold>.

The bidirectional promoter probably plays an important role in coordinating <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN </italic>expression in a similar spatial and temporal fashion. However, the functional relevance of the linkage between <italic>DEIN </italic>and <italic>HAND2 </italic>expression by the bidirectional promoter requires further investigation, e.g. functional studies on <italic>DEIN </italic>and experiments elucidating the transcription factors that bind to the promoter region.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN </italic>represent a gene pair that is tightly linked by a bidirectional promoter in an evolutionary highly conserved manner. The activity of the promoter in NB cell lines is asymmetric with strong activity in <italic>HAND2 </italic>and moderate activity in <italic>DEIN </italic>orientation. Expression studies strongly suggest co-regulation of both genes, and their high expression in tissues corresponding to the developing sympathetic nervous system suggests a functional link between <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN</italic>. Co-regulated and tissue specific expression are likely both mediated by the bidirectional promoter, which appears to be evolutionary highly conserved in rodents and birds. Concordant expression levels of <italic>HAND2</italic>, <italic>DEIN </italic>and <italic>PHOX2B </italic>in many primary NB and NB cell lines suggest that <italic>PHOX2B </italic>acts as an upstream transcriptional activator for both genes. Regarding the key role of <italic>HAND2 </italic>in the differentiation of neural crest derived precursors into sympathetic neurons and the high expression of <italic>DEIN </italic>in spontaneously regressing NB, <italic>DEIN </italic>could be instrumental in biological phenomena like regression and differentiation, which are characteristic for favourable NB and the developing sympathetic nervous system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>3'- and 5'-RACE-PCR</title><p>To identify the 5'-ends of <italic>HAND2 </italic>and <italic>DEIN</italic>, 5'-RACE-PCR was performed using the SMART&#x02122;RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, USA) with the gene specific primers GSPH2 for <italic>HAND2 </italic>and GSPD1 for <italic>DEIN</italic>.
