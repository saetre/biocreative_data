The sequence was composed of 1722 bp which included the 1299 bp of the complete coding region, the 108 bp of the 5'-noncoding region and the 312 bp of the 3'-noncoding region containing a polyadenylation signal. In addition, the poly(A) tail was also found. A potential ribosome-binding site was located 30 nucleotides upstream to the initiation codon in the 5'-noncoding region. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence was 433 amino acids in length and showed very high homology (82%) to the amino acid sequence of gamma gamma enolase (neuron-specific enolase: NSE), although the nucleotide sequence showed slightly lower homology (75%). The size of NNE mRNA was approximately 1800 bases by Northern transfer analysis and much shorter than that of NSE mRNA (2400 bases) indicating a short 3'-noncoding region. A dot-blot hybridization and Northern transfer analysis of cytoplasmic RNA from the developing rat brains using a labeled 3'-noncoding region of cDNA (no homology between NSE and NNE) showed a decrease of NNE mRNA at around 10 postnatal days and then a gradual increase to adult age without changes of mRNA size. Liver mRNA did not show any significant change during development.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0152-a" xlink:role="4369"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0158-a" xlink:role="4375"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0159-a" xlink:role="4376"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4365"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4366"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4367"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4368"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4369"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4370"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0154.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4371"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4372"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4373"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4374"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4375"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4376"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4377"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4378"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
