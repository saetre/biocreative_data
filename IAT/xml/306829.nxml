The HNF-3 proteins bind DNA via a homologous winged helix motif common to a number of developmental regulatory proteins including the Drosophila homeotic fork head (fkh) protein. The mammalian HNF-3/fkh family consists of at least thirty distinct members and is expressed in a variety of different cellular lineages. In addition to the winged helix motif, several HNF-3/fkh family members also share homology within transcriptional activation region II and III sequences. In the present study we further define the sequence boundaries of the HNF-3 beta N-terminal transcriptional activation domain to extend from amino acids 14 to 93 and include conserved region IV and V sequences. We also demonstrate that activity of the HNF-3 N-terminal domain was diminished by mutations which altered a putative alpha-helical structure located between amino acid residues 14 and 19. However, transcriptional activity was not affected by mutations which eliminated two conserved casein kinase I sites or increased the number of acidic amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain. Furthermore, we determined that the nuclear localization signal overlaps with the winged helix DNA-binding motif. These results suggest that conserved sequences within the winged helix motif of the HNF-3/fkh family may be involved not only in DNA recognition, but also in nuclear targeting.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0107-a" xlink:role="1187"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0107-b" xlink:role="1187"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0108-a" xlink:role="1188"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0109-a" xlink:role="1189"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0109-b" xlink:role="1189"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0110-a" xlink:role="1190"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1184"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1185"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1186"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1187"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1188"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1189"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1190"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00007-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1191"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
