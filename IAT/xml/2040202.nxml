As an important antioxidant selenoprotein, TR1 is thought to participate in cancer prevention, but is also known to be over-expressed in many cancer cells. Numerous cancer drugs inhibit TR1, and this protein has been proposed as a target for cancer therapy. We previously reported that reduction of TR1 levels in cancer cells reversed many malignant characteristics suggesting that deficiency in TR1 function is antitumorigenic. The molecular basis for TR1's role in cancer development, however, is not understood. Herein, we found that, among selenoproteins, TR1 is uniquely overexpressed in cancer cells and its knockdown in a mouse cancer cell line driven by oncogenic <italic>k-ras</italic> resulted in morphological changes characteristic of parental (normal) cells, without significant effect on cell growth under normal growth conditions. When grown in serum-deficient medium, TR1 deficient cancer cells lose self-sufficiency of growth, manifest a defective progression in their S phase and a decreased expression of DNA polymerase &#x003b1;, an enzyme important in DNA replication. These observations provide evidence that TR1 is critical for self-sufficiency in growth signals of malignant cells, that TR1 acts largely as a pro-cancer protein and it is indeed a primary target in cancer therapy.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dietary selenium has potent cancer prevention activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Hatfield1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and both selenium-containing proteins (selenoproteins) &#x0005b;2,3 and references therein&#x0005d; and low molecular weight selenium-containing compounds (selenocompounds) &#x0005b;2 and references therein&#x0005d; have been implicated in this activity.

DT and DT/pU6-m3 cells grew in soft agar, while control and DT/siTR1 cells grew poorly under these conditions. The growth properties in soft agar of two human cell lines, A549 and HCT116, following transfection with the corresponding human TR1 knockdown vector and control vector lacking siTR1 were also examined (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001112.s002">Fig. S1</xref> and figure legend).

We examined the effect of TR1 reduction on this phenotype by growing control, DT/pU6-m3 and TR1 knockdown cells in regular and serum-deficient media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001112-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Under normal growth conditions, both DT and DT/siTR1 cells grew more than twice the rate of NIH3T3 cells, while DT/siTR1 cells grew only about 10&#x00025; less effectively than DT/pU6-m3 cells (left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001112-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Thus, TR1 knockdown did not decrease the growth of DT cells, excluding the effects associated with TR1 essentiality for cell growth. As many malignant cells grow more efficiently than normal cells when cultured in serum-deficient medium, we examined the abilities of the two transfected cell lines to grow in serum-deficient conditions (right panel). DT/siTR1 cells grew at about half the rate as the DT/pU6-m3 cells, further suggesting that cancer-associated properties of cells were specifically affected by the TR1 knockdown.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Cell cycle analsis</title><p>Cell cycle analysis of control, DT/siTR1 and DT/pU6-m3 cells, when grown in serum-deficient medium, was carried out to elucidate the stage affected by the reduction in TR1 expression resulting in growth retardation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001112-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The three cell lines were grown in complete medium overnight and then placed in serum-deficient medium for 0, 24 and 48 hrs. Cells were incubated with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and stained with BrdU antibodies to assess DNA replication and were incubated with 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) to assess genomic DNA. These cells were then analyzed by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001112-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) and the appropriate areas quantitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001112-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The three cell lines had large numbers of cells in both the G0-G1 and S phases when analyzed immediately following active growth in complete medium, although DT/siTR1 had more cells in the S phase while the other two cell lines had more cells in the G0-G1 phase (see Time 0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001112-g003">Figs. 3A and B</xref>). The control cell line had approximately 90&#x00025; of its cells retained in the G0-G1 phase throughout growth in serum-deficient medium. This observation most certainly indicates that most of the control cells are retained in the quiescent (G0) state which is consistent with their inability to grow under these growth conditions. A major difference occurred in the amounts of cells in DT/pU6-m3 and DT/siTR1 cell lines at 24 hrs of growth in the G0-G1 and S phases in that DT/pU6-m3 cells had a much higher percentage of its cells in the S phase and lower percentage in the G0-G1 phase than did DT/siTR1. Within the S phase, DT/pU6-m3 had about 1.5 times more cells in early than late S, while DT/siTR1 had about 3 times more cells in early than late S. Although the amounts of cells in both transfected cell lines in the G0-G1 and S phases more closely approximated each other at 48 hrs of growth, the large divergence was still present between the early and late S phases in these two cell lines. These findings suggest that DNA replication was arrested in the early S phase in DT/siTR1 cells. It should also be noted that DT/siTR1 cells have higher amounts of their cell population retained in the G2-M phase than either control or DT/pU6-m3 cells during growth analysis suggesting that more cells within the DT/siTR1 population have trouble transitioning into mitosis. The possible defect causing greater retardation of DTsiTR1 cells in the G2-M phase warrants further investigation but was not pursued in this study as it does not appear to affect the overall reduction in DT/siTR1 growth rate compared to that of DT/pU6-m3 in serum-deficient medium (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001112-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001112-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001112.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Cell cycle analysis.</title><p>Control, DT/pU6-m3 and DT/siTR1 cells were grown in serum-deficient medium for 0, 24 and 48 hrs and incubated with BrdU for 6 hours.

DNA Pol &#x003b1; and Cdc45 were highly enriched in both transfected cell lines compared to control cells at each of the time points. Interestingly, DNA Pol &#x003b1; appeared to be reduced in DT/siTR1 cells compared to DT/pU6-m3 cells at 24 hrs and most significantly at 48 hrs. In addition, the levels of DNA Pol &#x003b5; appeared to be reduced in control and DT/siTR1 cells compared to DT/pU6-m3 cells at 48 hrs, while DNA Pol &#x003b2; appeared to be reduced at all three time points in DT/siTR1 compared to either control or DT/pU6-m3 cells. It would seem that the most pronounced effect of TR1 reduction in DT/siTR1 cells is on DNA Pol &#x003b1; resulting in reduced growth of these cells in serum-deficient medium. However, TR1 reduction may also result in reducing the levels of DNA Pol &#x003b2;, whereas the reduced levels of DNA Pol &#x003b5; at 48 hrs in control and DT/siTR1 cells may result from the serum-deficient growth medium.</p><fig id="pone-0001112-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001112.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Analysis of components involved in DNA replication.</title><p>Expression levels of DNA polymerase components, DNA Pol &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b4; and &#x003b5;, Cdc45 and PCNA, in control, DT/pU6-m3 and DT/siTR1 cells were analyzed by western blotting.

However, we ruled out this possibility by examining the deoxynucleotide pools in control, DT, DT/pU6-m3 and DT/siTR1 cells and showing that they did not vary during growth in serum-deficient medium (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001112.s003">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>Numerous TR1 functions and properties suggest that this selenoprotein has anti-cancer functions: 1) oxidative stress is one of major characteristics of cancer cells and TR1 is a key player in antioxidant defense by reducing Trx1 and other redox regulators in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Rundlf1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Fujino1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>; 2) TR1 is essential for proper function of tumor suppressor p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Moos1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>; 3) TR1 inhibition by carcinogenetic, electrophilic compounds implicated it in cancer prevention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Hatfield1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>; and 4) the selenium-containing amino acid, Sec, occupies the active catalytic site of TR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Kryukov1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and selenium is known to have potent cancer prevention properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Hatfield1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is tempting to speculate that adequate amounts of dietary selenium in general, and a sufficient expression level of TR1 in particular, maintain cellular redox homeostasis in normal cells, protecting them against oxidative stress, mutations in DNA and damage to other cellular components. Thus, TR1, along with other selenoproteins, can function in cancer prevention by inhibiting malignant transformation. However, in newly emerging tumors, demands for TR1 greatly increase as this protein would seem to be required to sustain tumor growth, likely because of the increased demand for its reducing equivalents via the Trx1 pathway and, as shown in this work, DNA replication. This proposal explains both the potent cancer prevention activity of dietary selenium and the contrasting roles of TR1 in both preventing and promoting cancer. Furthermore, this study provides the basis to explain disparate literature data on the role of this enigmatic protein in cancer and elevates TR1 even further as a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Urig1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Fujino1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Nguyen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Yoo1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> will undoubtedly have a major impact on how we vision the intake of selenium in the diet of humans and other mammals. It has been known for sometime that diets containing sufficient or supplemental amounts of selenium have beneficial effects in preventing certain forms of cancer possibly through the action of enriching the selenoprotein population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001112-Hatfield1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. However, caution should be expressed in that once a malignancy is initiated, then adequate or enriched amounts of selenium in the diet may serve to drive tumorigenesis. Our study adds an important layer towards understanding the roles of redox processes in cancer developments and the use of diet in cancer prevention and treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p><sup>75</sup>Se (specific activity 1000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from the Research Reactor Facility, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO.
