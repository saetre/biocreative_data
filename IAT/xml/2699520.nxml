Here, we demonstrated that the telomerase-recruitment domain of Cdc13 is also phosphorylated by Cdk1 at the same cell cycle stage as the Tel1/Mec1-dependent regulation. Phosphor-specific gel analysis demonstrated that Cdk1 phosphorylates residues 308 and 336 of Cdc13. The residue T308 of Cdc13 is critical for efficient Mec1-mediated S306 phosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Phenotypic analysis <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed that the mutations in the Cdc13&#x02009;S/TP motifs phosphorylated by Cdk1 caused cell cycle delay and telomere shortening and these phenotypes could be partially restored by the replacement with a negative charge residue. In the absence of Ku or Tel1, Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc13 showed no effect on telomere length maintenance. Moreover, this Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation was required to promote the regular turnover of Cdc13. Together these results demonstrate that Cdk1 phosphorylates the telomerase recruitment domain of Cdc13, thereby preserves optimal function and expression level of Cdc13 for precise telomere replication and cell cycle progression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomeres are dynamic DNA&#x02013;protein complexes that protect the ends of linear chromosomes, prevent detrimental chromosome rearrangements and defend against genomic instability and the associated risk of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Telomeres, consisting of tandem repeats of short G-rich sequences, are synthesized by the enzyme telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The catalytic core of telomerase is composed of a reverse transcriptase and an RNA subunit. The reverse transcriptase utilizes the RNA component as a template to add the G-rich repeats onto the 3&#x02032;-ends of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). In most human somatic cells, telomerase activity is absent, and telomeres are gradually shortened with successive cell divisions due to incomplete replication, which eventually causes replicative senescence. Once telomeres become sufficiently short, they are thought to lose the ability to protect the ends of the chromosomes from being recognized as broken ends, and being subjected to nuclease digestion and active recombinational repair. Continuous telomere shortening in human fibroblasts leads to chromosome fusions, crisis and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Very few human cells can bypass this crisis either through telomerase reactivation or through an alternative recombination pathway for telomere lengthening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>).</p><p>In budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, genes encoding components of telomerase have been identified and mutations in these genes cause a gradual loss of telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). <italic>EST2</italic> and <italic>TLC1</italic> encode the reverse transcriptase catalytic protein subunit and the templating RNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). In addition, the protein encoded by <italic>EST1</italic> is associated with the RNA component of telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18">15&#x02013;18</xref>). Other accessory factors, such as Cdc13, are required for the <italic>in vivo</italic> action of telomerase. Cdc13 is a single strand telomere-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). It forms a complex with Stn1 and Ten1. Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 show homology to Rfa1, Rfa2 and Rfa3, respectively. This replication protein A-like heterotrimeric complex specifically binds single strand telomeric sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and is required for both telomere protection and telomerase recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It recruits telomerase to its site of action through an electrostatic interaction between Cdc13 and Est1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>DNA replication must take place only once per cell cycle in eukaryotes. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly the budding yeast Cdk1 (Cdc28), have been proven to phosphorylate and regulate a number of DNA replication factors, including components of the origin recognition complex, Orc1, Orc2 and Orc6, and MCM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Previous studies also demonstrated that Cdk1 regulates telomere replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28">26&#x02013;28</xref>). <italic>cdk1</italic> cells display defective telomere elongation and long single G strand tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Furthermore, very recently, Cdk1 has been reported to activate Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).In eukaryotes, the maintenance of genome integrity relies on checkpoint to properly detect and repair DNA damage caused by environmental stresses or irregularities during DNA metabolisms. Damage and replication defects are recognized by the putative protein complex containing protein kinases such as Tel1 and Mec1. We previously reported that Cdc13 is a target of Tel1/Mec1-kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). This regulation occurs from late S to G2 phase of the cell cycle and is required for telomerase recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33">31&#x02013;33</xref>). In addition, we also observed a <italic>TEL1/MEC1</italic>-independent phosphorylation of Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). We wondered how these phosphorylations mediate Cdc13 functions at telomere replication and which kinase contributes to the <italic>TEL1/MEC1</italic>-independent phosphorylation. In this work, we show that Cdc13 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Similar to the Tel1/Mec1-dependent regulation, Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc13 occurs at the same cell cycle stage. We identified two phosphorylation sites. Inactivation of both Cdk1 phosphorylation sites in Cdc13 results in telomere shortening and delays the regular proteolysis of Cdc13 and cell cycle progression. Thus, we suggest that phosphorylation of Cdc13 by Cdk1 facilitates telomere replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids, yeast and telomere experiments</title><p>All the yeast operations were performed by standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).

To determine the exact phosphorylation sites, we purified mutant GST-Cdc13 containing single or double alanine (A) mutations at these sites. These substrates were then used in the IP-kinase assay. Compared to wild-type Cdc13, phosphorylation of the T308A Cdc13 subunit was drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). These results imply that T308 is the major phosphorylation site of Cdc13. Double mutations at T308S336A, but not at T308S460A, caused a further reduction of phosphorylation, comparing to T308A alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Therefore, our data suggested that the phosphorylation sites of Cdc13 by Cdk1 are located at amino acids 308 and 336.</p><p>Since the Cdk1-mediated regulation on residue T308 is very close to a Mec1-mediated regulation on S306 of Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), we asked whether Cdk1 would modulate the action of Mec1 on Cdc13, or <italic>vice versa</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, Cdk1 was able to phosphorylate Cdc13-S306A and Mec1 was also able to phosphorylate Cdc13-T308A. However, an attenuated Mec1-mediated phosphorylation was observed in Cdc13-T308A. On the other hand, the mutation on S306 made no major impact on the Cdk1-mediated modification on T308.

This peak was diminished in the <italic>cdc13-T308A</italic> strain, further indicating that Cdk1 plays a critical role on the hyperphosphorylated peak from late S to G2 phase observed in the wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

We previously showed that Tel1 and Mec1 phosphorylate Cdc13 and govern the telomerase recruitment function of Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Consistent with the recent finding that Cdk1 regulates Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), in this article we additionally demonstrated that Cdk1 phosphorylates Cdc13 at the telomerase recruitment domain. While it currently lacks structural information between Cdc13 and Est1 in the recruitment interface, we speculate that the hypernegatively charged domain of Cdc13 contributed by Tel1, Mec1 and Cdk1 may provide an optimal interface to recruit the potential positively charged domain near the amino acid 444 lysine residue of Est1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). This hypernegatively charged domain of Cdc13 forms at the late S and lasts to G2 phase, right at the timing for telomerase to function on telomeres.</p><p>An intriguing finding of this study is that Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation is required for, in addition to optimal telomerase recruitment, the proper turnover of Cdc13. While the protein level of Cdc13 is well regulated throughout the cell cycle, which peaks at late S/G2 phase and drops at the G1 phase, we found that phosphorylation at T308 is critical for the rapid degradation of Cdc13. What kind of disturbances would be caused by underdegraded Cdc13 existing in the nucleus after the G2 phase of the cell cycle is still unclear. Further identification of the proteolysis pathway of Cdc13 will be important to study this effect by uncoupling the function of tuning the protein level of Cdc13 from the function of telomerase recruitment of Cdc13 contributed by Cdk1.</p><p>Phosphoproteomics has been used to profile thousands of phosphorylation in cells. Using mass spectrometry to analyze phosphorylation sites in wild-type <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, both S306 and T308 of Cdc13 were found to be phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). In our previous study, mutations at the Tel1/Mec1 phosphorylation sites did not lead to an alteration of protein levels of Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Interestingly, the T308 residue is very close to a Mec1-regulated site, S306, and T308 is critical for the full activity of Mec1 on S306, at least in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). These results indicate that a conformational change at T308 might modulate Mec1-mediated Cdc13 phosphorylation. However, the Cdk1-mediated telomere shortening observed in the T308 strain was abolished in the absence of Tel1. Altogether these data suggest that Tel1 makes a greater impact, while Mec1 and Cdk1 kinases play supporting roles, to optimize the reaction of telomerase recruitment.</p><p>Previous studies showed that Cdk1 mutation could produce long single strand G-tails at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), which was not observed in our T308S336A cells (data not shown). It remains possible, in addition to Cdc13, Cdk1 may target other proteins during telomere replication. In that case, the telomeric effect of Cdk1 on Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) should be masked in the <italic>cdc28-4</italic> cells, that is, the <italic>cdc28-4</italic> mutation causes a greater telomeric alteration than <italic>cdc13-T308A</italic>.
