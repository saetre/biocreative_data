Fourteen days after treatment mice were subjected to a lung mechanistic study and the lungs were lavaged and inflammatory cells, protein and TGF-&#x003b2; levels in lavage fluid determined. Lungs were subsequently either fixed for histology or excised for biochemical assessment of fibrosis and determination of RAGE protein- and mRNA levels. There was no difference in the inflammatory response or degree of fibrosis (hydroxyproline levels) in the lungs between WT and RAGE KO mice after silica injury. However, histologically the fibrotic lesions in the RAGE KO mice had a more diffuse alveolar septal fibrosis compared to the nodular fibrosis in WT mice. Furthermore, RAGE KO mice had a significantly higher histologic score, a measure of affected areas of the lung, compared to WT silica treated mice. A lung mechanistic study revealed a significant decrease in lung function after silica compared to control, but no difference between WT and RAGE KO. While a dose response study showed similar degrees of fibrosis after silica treatment in the two strains, the RAGE KO mice had some differences in the inflammatory response compared to WT mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Aside from the difference in the fibrotic pattern, these studies showed no indicators of RAGE having an effect on the severity of pulmonary fibrosis following silica injury.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pulmonary fibrosis can have various causes and can be a debilitating progressive condition with a poor prognosis.

Here, the role of RAGE in a silica model of pulmonary fibrosis was studied. Injury led to a decrease in RAGE mRNA levels and a decrease in total RAGE protein in total lung homogenates. This is consistent with findings in both the bleomycin model and asbestos model as well as in lungs from human IPF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009604-Hanford1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009604-He1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The decrease in membrane RAGE protein is likely to be a direct effect of loss of type I epithelial cells and may also be due to cleavage of membrane RAGE by proteases to form soluble RAGE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009604-Raucci1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009604-Hanford2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. The loss of soluble RAGE is more likely to be an indicator of tissue damage and damage to the extracellular matrix, but may be due to decreased production from injured epithelial cells. Previous studies have shown that shedding of syndecan-1, a heparin sulfate proteoglycan highly abundant in the extracellular matrix, occurs in models of pulmonary fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009604-Kliment1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

In fact, soluble RAGE has been shown to accumulate in the BALF after acute lung injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009604-Zhang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. However, barely any soluble RAGE was detected in the BALF of WT mice both before and after silica injury. This may be due to clearance of soluble RAGE from the BALF after the initial injury.</p><p>The silica model of pulmonary fibrosis is more closely related to the asbestos model than the bleomycin model, in that the silica particles are relatively resistant to clearance from the lung and lead to inflammation and fibrosis around the silica particles. This is visualized by the characteristic silicotic nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009604-g003">Figure 3</xref>, wild type silica). In the silica model we hypothesized the outcome to resemble what takes place in the asbestos model, since they are both fibers/particles that persist in the lung. Furthermore, RAGE/collagen IV interactions have previously been shown to be important for epithelial cell spreading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009604-Demling1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and possibly wound healing. Based on this we hypothesized that an increase of RAGE ligands could lead to decreased re-epithelialization after injury and furthermore that RAGE KO mice would get worse fibrosis since they would have decreased ability to re-epithelialize. However, while we found no difference in the absolute degree of fibrosis between WT and RAGE KO mice treated with silica, histologically the RAGE KO mice had a more diffuse pattern of fibrosis compared to the dense nodular fibrosis in the WT mice. Pulmonary function studies also showed a trend of increased airway resistance in the RAGE KO compared to WT after silica injury. The RAGE/collagen IV interaction might explain why RAGE expressing WT mice are able to restrict the spreading of fibrosis more effectively than RAGE KO mice. The interaction may function to control the cell spreading even during wound healing, and hence the fibrosis develops as nodules with clearly defined edges, whereas RAGE KO mice are not able to control the spreading of epithelial cells and therefore develop a more diffuse pattern of fibrosis. Another possibility could be that macrophages phagocytozing silica particles subsequently migrate towards each other in order to condense the silica particles and limit the extent of fibrosis. It could be that RAGE KO macrophages have a changed ability to perform this task.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; levels in BALF samples of silica treated RAGE KO mice were significantly lower than in WT mice. This finding may explain why the two strains get similar amount of fibrosis. As previously mentioned RAGE KO mice get more fibrosis in an asbestos model, while in a bleomycin model they are largely protected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009604-Englert1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009604-He1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. If RAGE KO mice are actually more susceptible to developing fibrosis when challenged i.t. with a particular/fibrillar agent, but at the same time have less TGF-&#x003b2;, then the overall amount of fibrosis may end up being the same.</p><p>A dose response study with 3 different amounts of silica showed similar degrees of fibrosis, but some differences in inflammatory cell population between RAGE KO and WT mice. Furthermore, protein leakage into the lung was significantly higher in RAGE KO mice than in WT mice, indicating that the integrity of the alveolar wall is more fragile/susceptible to damage in RAGE KO mice. Taken together this indicates that RAGE may be involved in the inflammatory response and adherence of epithelial cells, but not in the subsequent development of fibrosis after silica induced lung damage. The RAGE KO mice used in this study are constitutive global RAGE KO mice. It is possible that the constitutive RAGE KO mice may have up- or down regulated proteins as an adaptive response to the loss of pulmonary RAGE expression. RAGE may also be involved in the regulation of other proteins whose expression could be dramatically altered by the knockout of RAGE. Notably, a recent study using inducible EC-SOD KO mice showed that while constitutive EC-SOD KO mice were viable and had a phenotype resembling WT mice, the conditional EC-SOD KO mice died rapidly with symptoms resembling acute lung injury after inducing the knockout of EC-SDO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009604-Gongora1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Further studies will be necessary to study potential differentially regulated proteins between WT and RAGE KO mice. In addition, an inducible RAGE KO mouse strain may help shed light on the inflammatory function of RAGE and its involvement in lung pathology where this protein is so highly expressed.</p><p>In summary, except for the altered histologic pattern of fibrosis, there is no data to suggest that RAGE expression alters the degree of fibrosis using a silica induced model of pulmonary fibrosis. RAGE does appear to be a strong marker of epithelial cell injury in that both a decrease in pulmonary protein levels of RAGE and a decrease in RAGE mRNA levels are seen in response to fibrotic injury. The markedly different responses of RAGE KO mice to different models of pulmonary fibrosis suggest that RAGE does play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, but its role depends on the injury eliciting the fibrotic response. Further investigation is necessary in order to fully understand the mechanisms RAGE plays in pulmonary fibrosis and how to best exploit RAGE biology to intervene in the fibrotic response.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0009604-Castranova1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Castranova</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Vallyathan</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><year>2000</year><article-title>Silicosis and coal workers' pneumoconiosis.</article-title><source>Environ Health Perspect</source><volume>108</volume><issue>Suppl 4</issue><fpage>675</fpage><lpage>684</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10931786</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0009604-Kamp1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kamp</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name></person-group><year>2009</year><article-title>Asbestos-induced lung diseases: an update.</article-title><source>Transl Res</source><volume>153</volume><fpage>143</fpage><lpage>152</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19304273</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0009604-Selman1"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Selman</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>TE</given-names></name><name><surname>Pardo</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><year>2001</year><article-title>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: prevailing and evolving hypotheses about its pathogenesis and implications for therapy.</article-title><source>Ann Intern Med</source><volume>134</volume><fpage>136</fpage><lpage>151</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11177318</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0009604-Blum1"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Blum</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Agre</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><year>1973</year><article-title>A clinical review of bleomycin&#x02013;a new antineoplastic agent.</article-title><source>Cancer</source><volume>31</volume><fpage>903</fpage><lpage>914</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4122362</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0009604-The1"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><collab>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health N</collab><year>2008</year><comment>Silicosis: Number of deaths, crude and age-adjusted death rates, U.S. residents age 15 and over, 1968&#x02013;2004.
