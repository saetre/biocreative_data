RNaseE has a key importance for the general mRNA decay in <italic>E.coli</italic>. While RNaseE initiates the degradation of most mRNAs in <italic>E.coli</italic>, it is likely that the enzyme is also responsible for the degradation of recombinant RNAs. As RNaseE is essential for cell viability and knockout mutants cannot be cultured, we investigated the possibility for a down-regulation of the intracellular level of RNaseE by antisense RNAs.

The expression of antisense RNAs did not effect the cell growth negatively. The amount of antisense RNA was monitored quantitatively by a fluorescence based sandwich hybridisation assay. Induction by anhydrotetracycline was followed by a 25-fold increase of the detectable antisense RNA molecules per cell. The antisense RNA level was maintained above 400 molecules per cell until the stationary phase, which caused the level of expressed antisense RNAs to decrease markedly. Western blot experiments revealed the strongest reduction in the RNaseE protein level 90 min after antisense RNA induction. The cellular level of RNaseE could be decreased to 35% of the wild type level.

Our results show that even complicated self-regulatory systems such as RNaseE may be controlled by antisense RNA technology, indicating that systems based on antisense RNA expression may have a potential for controlling detrimental factors with plasmid-based constructs in arbitrary strains while maintaining their beneficial characteristics. The study also proved that the RNA sandwich hybridisation technique is directly applicable to quantify small RNA molecules in crude cell extracts, which may have a broader application potential as a monitoring tool in RNA inhibition applications.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation is an important mechanism for controlling gene expression in all organisms. The rate of mRNA decay directly affects the steady state concentration of mRNA, thereby influencing the rates of protein synthesis. The lifetimes of mRNAs can differ significantly within a single cell and have a direct effect on message concentrations. In <italic>E.coli </italic>for example, different mRNAs may differ in stability by as much as two orders of magnitude. Their half-lives may range from a fraction of a minute to as long as an hour with a typical average half-life being two to four minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, the longevity of individual transcripts may vary significantly in response to growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>E.coli</italic>, mRNA decay generally involves the sequential action of endonucleases and 3'-exonucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. At least three of the endoribonucleases identified in <italic>E.coli</italic>, RNasesE, RNase III, and RNase G have been found to initiate RNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For most <italic>E.coli </italic>mRNAs, degradation begins with the cleavage of internal AU-rich sites by RNaseE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The cleavage products are then further degraded by endo- and exoribonucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>EndoribonucleaseE (RNaseE) is an essential protein of <italic>E.coli </italic>and necessary for cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is assumed to be the principal endonuclease in the <italic>E.coli </italic>mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], while performing the first cut. The resulting fragments are then further degraded by a combination of endonucleolytic cleavage and 3'-exonucleolytic digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While RNaseE initiates the degradation of cellular RNAs, it is most likely also responsible for the decay of the transcripts of recombinant genes. In recombinant protein production processes target mRNA instability may be one of the bottlenecks for a successful product formation. Reduction of the intracellular RNaseE level may increase the half-lives of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and therefore may result in a higher product formation. As RNaseE is an essential protein, <italic>&#x00394;rne</italic>-strains cannot be used as host systems for the production of proteins. New systems are needed to investigate the influences of reduced RNaseE level to product formation.</p><p>RNaseE is a multifunctional endoribonuclease playing a role in the chemical degradation of bulk cellular RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the processing of ribosomal RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the decay of special regulatory messenger and structural RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the control of plasmid replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the removal of poly-A-tails from transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is a large multidomain protein with N-terminal ribonucleolytic activity and an RNA-binding domain. The C-terminal half of the protein contains the binding sites for all components of the degradasome and is essential for the formation of this multi-enzyme complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This endonuclease, 1061 amino acids in length, possesses broad cleavage-site specificity and cuts RNA in a variety of single-stranded regions that are AU-rich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>RNaseE is a 5'-end dependent endonuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and prefers 5'-monophosphorylated substrates, which are cut much more efficiently than 5'-triphosphate mRNAs. Therefore, 5'-triphosphates at nascent mRNAs protect the transcript. The cleavage products of RNaseE have 5'-monophosphates. This explains the "all-or-none" mRNA decay in <italic>E.coli </italic>where a slow initial cut is followed by the fast degradation of the entire mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p><italic>E.coli </italic>RNaseE is essential for cell viability and either its underproduction or overproduction can impair cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To maintain RNaseE near its optimal cellular concentration, <italic>E.coli </italic>cells have evolved an autoregulatory mechanism of controlling the synthesis of this important ribonuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Feedback regulation of RNaseE is mediated in <italic>cis </italic>by the 361nt <italic>rne </italic>5'-untranslated region (UTR), which could confer this property onto heterologous transcripts to which it was fused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The 5'-UTR contains six structural domains. Of these structures only hairpin 2 is sufficient to direct efficient feedback regulation by RNaseE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The autoregulation involves changes in the longevity of the <italic>rne</italic>transcript, whose half-life (normal ~1 min) varies in response to the level of RNaseE activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, a 21-fold increase in <italic>rne </italic>gene dosage results in only 2.8-fold increase in the cellular protein concentration due to accelerated degradation of the <italic>rne </italic>mRNA. Conversely, insufficient RNaseE activity may increase the lifetime of the <italic>rne</italic>transcript. Therefore, expression of the <italic>rne </italic>gene is unusually sensitive to the cellular level of RNaseE activity. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Small non-coding RNAs are used for sequence specific interaction with mRNAs, resulting in a blockage or degradation of the targeted RNA. Antisense RNA mechanisms can be found in pro- and eukaryotic organisms, but the mechanisms for achieving post-transcriptional down-regulation are diverse.</p><p>In bacteria, RNA interference (RNAi) is a nearly unexplored area of science. In eukaryotes, RNAi seems to be a common mechanism in controlling gene expression in nearly all organisms and eukaryotic gene silencing by RNAi has become a standard procedure in research. In contrast, only a few antisense RNA based regulatory mechanisms are known in prokaryotes, which control mainly the biological function of accessory genetic elements like phages, transposons and plasmids. Bioinformatics-aided searches have identified many new small RNAs (sRNA), which are mainly encoded in the intergenic regions of the <italic>E.coli </italic>chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Their function often remains unknown.</p><p>Initial applications of the antisense mechanism in bacteria were based on natural prokaryotic antisense systems. An example is the <italic>parB </italic>partition locus of the plasmid R1, which also provides antibiotic-free plasmid stability when it is cloned to other plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that antisense RNA based strategies also can be used to regulate the biosynthesis of global regulatory proteins and metabolites in <italic>Clostridium acetobutylicum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and <italic>E.coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and that the application of an antisense RNA strategy can increase the product formation in recombinant protein production processes in <italic>E.coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to establish a system for induced silencing of RNaseE by antisenseRNAs. By using this approach, it was possible to decrease the cellular level of RNaseE strongly. The constructed system may be a tool to decrease the innate mRNA degradation of the cell and therefore increasing the stability of target product mRNAs in recombinant processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cloning of antisense RNA expression constructs</title><p>A plasmid carrying two different inducible promoters were applied to determine the silencing effect of the expression of small non-coding RNaseE targeting antisense RNAs in <italic>E.coli</italic>. One promoter was used for the expression of small non-coding antisense RNAs, the second promoter may be later used for the gene expression of the target protein. Starting from the plasmid pP4Hcyt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], it was necessary to introduce endonuclease restriction sites downstream of the tetracycline inducible promoter (P<sub>tet</sub>) before further introduction of different antisense fragments, because no restriction sites were available in the target region of pP4Hcyt. A multiple cloning site (MCS) was designed and introduced downstream of P<sub>tet </sub>(see Materials and Methods). Based on the DNA sequence of the <italic>rne </italic>gene from <italic>E.coli </italic>K-12 seven antisense RNA encoding fragments targeting different regions of the transcript and its 5'-UTR were amplified by PCR. The fragments were introduced into the new MCS downstream of P<sub>tet </sub>in antisense orientation using <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Bgl</italic>II creating pANTI1 to 7, respectively. The resulting constructs were confirmed by sequencing.

At 60 to 90 min after induction, the detected antisense RNA levels were still above 400 molecules per cell.

Despite it had been shown earlier that the <italic>rne </italic>mRNA level in wild type <italic>E.coli </italic>cells is very low and that also the half-life of this mRNA can vary from &#x0003c; 40 sec to over 8 min due to the special regulatory feedback mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we wanted to estimate whether our assay is feasible to detect <italic>rne </italic>mRNA under our specific experimental conditions.</p><p>Therefore, we first prepared samples from shake flask cultures according to Material and Methods. In different FSHAs, varying amounts of cell extract (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>to 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>) and <italic>in vitro </italic>standard were analysed at the same time. It was not possible to detect <italic>rne </italic>mRNA in the cell extracts or further purified RNA samples. Different modifications of the sample preparation procedure were tested to minimize RNA degradation in the preparation phase, such as the content of the inhibition solution, and direct sampling into pre-cooled inhibition solution and immediate freezing in liquid nitrogen, followed by slow thawing of the sample on ice. Also the amount of total RNA per well in the FSHA was increased up to 2 &#x003bc;g RNA per well. However, in all cases the signals obtained for <italic>rne </italic>mRNA were below the detection limits (data not shown).</p><p>To test whether the feedback regulatory mechanism of RNaseE is the reason for the failure of detecting <italic>rne </italic>mRNA in our cell extracts, the <italic>rne </italic>probe set was used to detect the mRNA of an inducible truncated version of RNaseE, called N-Rne, lacking the 5'-UTR of the WT transcript.

Based on the OD<sub>600 </sub>of the cultures, crude cell extracts of equal cell amounts (6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells) were prepared at different points of the growth curve. Cell extracts of both cultures of the same strains were separated on a single gel by SDS-PAGE and the content of RNaseE was determined by Western blot to compare their RNaseE level (see figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>).</p><p>The quantification of the Western blot results was done by using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).

The degradation of most <italic>E.coli </italic>mRNAs is thought to begin with the internal cleavage in AU-rich sequences by the endonuclease RNaseE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The resulting mRNA fragments are then further degraded by a combination of endonucleolytic cleavage and 3' exonucleolytic digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>During production of recombinant proteins many factors influence the formation of the target protein and target mRNA instability may be one of these bottlenecks. While RNaseE initiates the degradation of most mRNAs in <italic>E.coli</italic>, it is most likely also responsible for the degradation of recombinant RNAs. RNaseE is an essential enzyme necessary for cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>rne </italic>knockout strains cannot easily be used to determine the influence of RNaseE on the decay of recombinant transcripts. The aim of this study was the establishment of an antisense RNA based approach to decrease the intracellular level of RNaseE in <italic>E.coli</italic>. Aside from being an interesting tool for the evaluation of the effect of RNA stability, such a system also might be of practical relevance directly in recombinant processes.</p><p>In this study we could demonstrate clearly, that it is possible to decrease the amount of RNaseE significantly to about one third of its original concentration by antisense RNA targeting, despite the sensitive feed-back regulation mechanism of RNaseE on its own mRNA.</p><p>Interestingly, only one out of seven different antisense constructs, antisense 7 expressed from plasmid pANTI7, was able to reduce the intracellular RNaseE level significantly. This plasmid expressed an antisense RNA with an 83 nt long complementary sequence covering the whole single-stranded region 3 of the 5'-UTR, the ribosome binding site and the beginning of the coding region of the <italic>rne </italic>transcript (compare to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]). The strongest reduction of RNaseE was observed 90 min after induction. The protein level of RNaseE decreased to approximately 35% of the wild type level. Entering the stationary phase at 120 min after induction, the RNaseE level was kept at 50 to 60% of the wild type level until the end of the experiment (see figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, pANTI1 and pANTI6, both encoding antisense RNAs with 103 nt or 120 nt long complementary sequences respectively, covering the same region of the target RNA as pANTI7 and additionally an extended part in the noncoding region (pANTI1) or of the <italic>rne </italic>coding region (pANTI6), showed no effective reduction of the RNaseE level (data not shown). This might be due to the hybridisation kinetics in the crowded cytoplasm where longer molecules might be assumed to diffuse more slowly. Additionally, antisense RNA 6 includes an accessory AU-rich sequence, not present in the antisense RNA 7 which might be function as an RNaseE target site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore, despite being expressed at a high level (see fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) the additional RNaseE cleavage site might cause faster degradation of the antisense mRNA encoded at pANTI6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although it is still matter of detailed future investigations whether a higher stability of heterologous target RNAs can be obtained by using the antisense approach, the actual study is a further proof that down-regulation of proteins by RNA inhibition is not only feasible for regulation of arbitrary genes in eukaryotes, but also can be a powerful approach if adapted to prokaryotic cells. Especially the antisense technology may be useful tool if considered for controlling essential genes with a negative impact on target proteins, to establish industrially stable processes, which are rarely possible with knockout or conditional mutants. The advantage of using the antisense RNA technology for down-regulation of RNaseE in comparison to strains carrying the <italic>rne131 </italic>mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] is that the feature can be easily transferred in any <italic>E. coli </italic>strain without influencing the fitness of the host before induction of the antisense transcript. This may be especially important for the development of industrial processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p>Strains used in this study are summarised in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.
