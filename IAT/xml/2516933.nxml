However, because PI3K/Akt signaling has many important functions, including the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, it is not clear that its inhibition would be tolerated in vivo. To determine whether tolerable doses of AKTi-1/2 could effectively inhibit Akt signaling in tumors in vivo and inhibit their growth, mice harboring BT474 xenografts were treated with the drug. Unlike UACC-893, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-361, BT474 cells are highly tumorigenic when injected into nude mice.

To test the hypothesis that these tumors might also remain dependent on Akt signaling, we used two experimental models of Herceptin-resistant breast cancer: the BT474-EII cell line model and the Fo5 xenograft model.

Thus, much effort has focused on developing novel anti-tumor agents that target this pathway. Up to now, however, it has been unclear whether the degree of pathway inhibition required for significant anti-tumor activity could be achieved without unacceptable toxicity. The PI3K/Akt pathway is an important regulator of many key physiologic processes and the development of several classes of Akt inhibitors has been halted because of toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003065-LoPiccolo1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003065-Lindsley1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We now show that a selective and potent allosteric inhibitor of Akt1 and Akt2 effectively inhibits Akt signaling in tumor bearing mice without gross toxicity or weight loss even when administered chronically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003065-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003065-g005">5</xref> and S2).

A second possibility is that the complex signaling network in normal cells is robust and relatively insensitive to loss of any single component of the network. Constitutive activation of the oncoprotein may feedback inhibit redundant pathways in the network and cause the cell to become hyperdependent on the single oncoprotein.

The Akt1/Akt2 inhibitor caused transient and moderate hyperglycemia in mice that is associated with a transient hyperinsulinemia (manuscript in preparation). Why the drug is so effective at concentrations that cause only transient hyperglycemia, but no gross toxicity, is not entirely clear. It is possible that this is a manifestation of oncogene addiction; the levels of pathway inhibition achieved are sufficient to inhibit tumor growth, but without significant deleterious impact on normal physiology. The inhibitor is equipotent against human and mouse Akt in vitro and in vivo, ruling out selective inhibition of the Akt in the xenograft tumor (unpublished data). The greater selectivity of an allosteric inhibitor as compared to ATP-competitive inhibitors may also play a role: off-target effects are less likely. It is also possible that the relative sparing of Akt3 activity is responsible, although genetic models suggest that Akt2 is most responsible for maintaining glucose homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003065-Cho1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The finding that the Akt1/Akt2 inhibitor can be given chronically to animals for months without weight loss suggests that the drug does not cause severe metabolic toxicity under these conditions, at least in mice. Whereas the physiological function of Akt3 is unclear at present, the avoidance of Akt3 inhibition may allow a greater therapeutic window for Akt1 and Akt2 inhibition.</p><p>Whereas breast tumors with PI3K or HER2 deregulation may be addicted to Akt signaling, the situation is less clear for tumors with PTEN loss. ZR-75-1 (PTEN-negative, low EGFR) is extremely sensitive to AKTi-1/2, but MDA-MB-468 (PTEN-negative, high EGFR) is not. This could be due to a variety of factors, including residual Akt3 activity in the latter cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003065-g001">Figure 1</xref>). However, this is unlikely, since we have previously shown that MDA-MB-468 cells are not effectively inhibited when AKT activity is completely inhibited in response to induction of the expression of wild type PTEN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003065-She1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

These and other data suggest that, in the context of EGFR activation, the proliferation and survival of PTEN-negative cells are not dependent on PI3K/Akt signaling alone.

These findings and the absence of gross toxicity in vivo suggest that Akt inhibition is a feasible therapeutic strategy for breast cancers in which PI3K/Akt signaling is dysregulated by mutation.

Allosteric inhibition of Akt may be useful as a single modality in the treatment of these tumors, including those that have become resistant to HER2 inhibitors. Furthermore, it would be expected to sensitize tumors to induction of apoptosis by cytotoxic agents and, perhaps, in combination with EGFR inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer and with drugs such as rapamycin that cause the feedback activation of PI3K/Akt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003065-OReilly1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>Human breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in a 1&#x02236;1 mixture of DME:F12 medium supplemented with 4 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 10&#x00025; heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.
