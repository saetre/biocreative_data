They frequently contain high levels of TGF&#x003b2; of around 7.5 ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, epithelial tumor cells shedding or migrating from local primary tumor sites are still alive and grow well in the pleural effusions. Such cells are believed to have some defects in the TGF&#x003b2; receptors or in receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Therefore, in the present study, tumor cells derived from pleural effusions of patients with lung cancer were chosen for examining the gene expression and gene integrity of these receptors.</p><p>Type I TGF&#x003b2; receptor (T&#x003b2;RI) is a key signaling receptor for TGF&#x003b2; to conduct Smad-mediated transcriptional activation in a cell. There are three major cell surface receptors characterized for TGF&#x003b2; ligands, designated T&#x003b2;RI, T&#x003b2;RII, and T&#x003b2;RIII. In early signaling events, TGF&#x003b2; binds to its cell surface T&#x003b2;RII, followed by the recruitment and phosphorylation of T&#x003b2;RI on a juxtamembrane glycine/serine (GS)-rich domain. This phosphorylation results in the association of R-Smads (Smad2 and Smad3) with a shared partner, Smad4, to form heterotrimers that undergo nuclear translocation to regulate TGF&#x003b2;-responsive genes. The putative function of T&#x003b2;RIII in these events is to facilitate ligand binding to T&#x003b2;RI and T&#x003b2;RII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Among these TGF&#x003b2; receptors, the type I plays a pivotal role in conducting the TGF&#x003b2; stimulus from cell surface into the nucleus to deliver various biological outcomes. Functional disruption, mutation, or aberrant expression of the TGF&#x003b2; type I receptor gene (<italic>Tgfbr1</italic>) is frequently associated with human diseases, including cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>gene is a tumor susceptible allele. Over 30% of patients with ovarian cancer harbor somatic changes in exons 1 to 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Most changes are in-frame deletions or insertion mutations in the nine-alanine (9A) stretch of the putative signal peptide or missense mutations in the catalytic kinase domain of the receptor. Other T&#x003b2;RI transcript variants with sequence defect in the peptide have been also reported in the rat kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Notably, a gene variant with a three-alanine deletion (<italic>Tgfbr1-6A</italic>) in the 9A stretch was found recently in a variety of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], suggesting that this signal peptide is a susceptible site for its gene mutation. Transfection of this variant has been shown to convert TGF&#x003b2; growth inhibitory signals into growth stimulatory signals in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, little is known about cellular functions of regions in the signal peptide other than the 9A stretch.</p><p>We found four naturally occurring T&#x003b2;RI variants in three patients with lung cancer. All variants have different in-framed truncations in the signal peptide. Molecular dissection of the peptide using serial deletion mutagenesis characterized two novel functional regions that participate in maintaining T&#x003b2;RI protein stability and receptor-mediated transcriptional regulation in cells. Expression of one of these variants in a cell could lead to its refractoriness to TGF&#x003b2;, supporting an idea that naturally occurring T&#x003b2;RI may have a role in tumor progression. Collectively, our data suggest that the signal peptide of T&#x003b2;RI can be a susceptible region for mutation resulting in TGF&#x003b2; insensitivity in cancer. Mutations occurred in different regions of the signal peptide may display distinct T&#x003b2;RI defect modes and suggest that the variants with these mutations may represent potential therapeutic targets in cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sequence deletions in the signal sequence of T&#x003b2;RI from effusion-derived tumor cells</title><p>Four new <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>transcript variants were found in pleural effusion-derived tumor cells. Total RNA was extracted from patient cells CA427, CA528, CA1109, and from the normal control cells, WI38 and HUVEC, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Nested-PCR amplification reactions using two pairs of primers, P1 and P2, located in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions were performed to clone out the endogenous <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>transcript variants from the cells. Gel electrophoresis of the amplicons revealed that at least two additional <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>transcript variants in the patient cells. However, no extra band was detected in the normal control cells, except for the 1.5 kb band representing the wild-type <italic>Tgfbrl </italic>transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). After gene cloning and sequencing, four new in-framed deletion variants were identified in the patients totally. The nucleotide sequences of each variant in the truncated region are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. They were designated as DM1 and DM2, with sizes around 1.5 kb, and DM3 and DM4, with 0.3 kb and 0.9 kb deletions, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Intriguingly, all the variants had varied nucleotide deletions in a sequence coding for the putative signal peptide of T&#x003b2;RI. The proteins encoded by the DM3 and DM4 transcript variants also lack the transmembrane domain and either partial or entire extracellular and GS-rich regions, respectively. Thus, the data suggest that the insensitivity of effusion tumor cells to TGF&#x003b2; may be caused by defects in the protein integrity of T&#x003b2;RI.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The existence of <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>transcript variants in pleural effusion-derived tumor cells</bold>. <italic>Panel A: RT-PCR</italic>.

Western blotting analyses indicated that the variants had great differences in their protein expression. Notably, DM1, lacking nucleotides 16&#x02013;75, and DM2, lacking nucleotides 15&#x02013;80, were expressed at extremely low levels in the cells as compared with the expression of the wild-type control and the other two variants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The same expression pattern was also observed in R1B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and Cos-7 cells (data not shown), indicating that the differential expression must be cell type independent. An experiment using a plasmid encoding green fluorescence protein co-transfected with the individual variant genes showed that there were no substantial differences in gene transfection efficiency, ranging from 84.4% to 90.9% as determined by flow cytometric analyses. Consistently, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis using P3 primers, as indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, showed that no distinction in the level of RNA transcript among the exogenous variants was detected in the cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Differential expression of T&#x003b2;RI variants</bold>.

The DS1 mutant lacks nucleotides 16&#x02013;51, which code for a peptide N-terminal to a 9A stretch. The DS2 mutant protein has a peptide truncation in the 9A stretch itself, which has been reported to be susceptible to nucleotide deletion in patients with several types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The DS3 mutant, with deletion of nucleotides 79&#x02013;117, encodes a protein lacking a peptide C-terminal to the 9A stretch. The data shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> clearly indicate that deletion of the small sequence of nucleotides 16&#x02013;51 (DS1) is sufficient to impair the expression of T&#x003b2;RI protein. Accordingly, both DM1 and DM2 variants with deletion of this sequence also demonstrated the same defect in their protein expression. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, RT-PCR analysis further confirmed that differential protein expression among those deletion mutants was not because of differences in the levels of their transcripts. In contrast to DS1, the deletion of nucleotides 52&#x02013;78 (DS2) or 79&#x02013;117 (DS3) affected expression only slightly.

The DM1 gene was transfected into HEK 293 cells followed by blocking translation machinery with cycloheximide (CHX). The half-life of the DM1 protein (about 30 min) was much shorter than that of the wild-type protein (90 min) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These data are in agreement with a previous report using pulse-chase metabolic labeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

The p3TP-Lux reporter containing a TPA-responsive element and <italic>PAI-1 </italic>promoter was co-transfected with individual variant genes into the T&#x003b2;RI-null cell line, R1B. In response to TGF&#x003b2; stimulation, receptor-mediated transcriptional activation was determined from the corresponding luciferase activity. Compared with transcriptional activation mediated by wild-type T&#x003b2;RI after protein normalization, truncation of a peptide encoded by nucleotides 16&#x02013;51 for the DS1 mutant did not affect its receptor function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Similar results were also seen in the DM1 and DM2 mutants with deletion of this peptide. In contrast, truncation of a peptide C-terminal to the 9A stretch (DS3) dramatically impaired its capability to conduct TGF&#x003b2; signaling. A consistent result was also observed in the DM3 and DM4 variants lacking this peptide. Thus, these data suggest that at least two functional subdomains are located on the putative signal peptide for T&#x003b2;RI to control its protein expression and downstream signaling.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Transcription activation induced by T&#x003b2;RI variants</bold>. <italic>Panel A.

This data strongly suggests that the expression levels are sufficient to transduct the extracellular TGF&#x003b2; signal, activate gene transcription, and exert biological action in R1B cells. In contrast, lack of a peptide C-terminal to the 9A stretch in DM3, DM4, and DS3 almost abrogated their signaling capability, indicating that they are non-functional receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of variants on TGF&#x003b2;-mediated growth regulation</title><p>To test if the coexistence of these variants might alter the cellular function of TGF&#x003b2;-sensitive cells, MCF-7 stable transfectants expressing individual T&#x003b2;RI variants were established and cell growth was determined by MTT assay. To eliminate possible artifacts associated with individual cell clones, mixed transfectants were used. No measurable difference on cell growth was observed among them in the absence of TGF&#x003b2;. However, the DM3 variant, surprisingly, rescued 44.2% of growth suppression induced by TGF&#x003b2;, but only partial prevention was seen in the cells expressing DM4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The action of DM3 is, at least partially, attributed to the abolishment of TGF&#x003b2;-induced apoptotic event (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). On the other hand, as expected for DM1 and DM2, expression of either variant only produced a slight difference from the control in the presence of TGF&#x003b2;. This may result from two possibilities. First, MCF-7 cells have endogenous TGF&#x003b2; receptors and intact downstream signaling pathways to respond to TGF&#x003b2; stimulation. Increasing expression of exogenous signaling molecule(s) is not always proportional to enhance the signaling magnitude or biological outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Second, it might be caused by saturated signaling capacity in the cells. Furthermore, the expression level of DM1 or DM2 is quite low and probably barely affects endogenous signaling in TGF&#x003b2;-responsive MCF-7 cells. In summary, these results suggest that the existence of some T&#x003b2;RI variants in cancer cells can bestow them with a growth advantage in a tumor microenvironment such as that in malignant pleural effusions with high levels of TGF&#x003b2;.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of DM3 on TGF&#x003b2;-induced growth inhibition and cell apoptosis</bold>. <italic>Panel A: Cell growth</italic>.

Functional disruption, mutation, or aberrant expression of the <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>gene could cause many human diseases, including cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the present study, we identified two additional functional elements in the signal peptide of T&#x003b2;RI beside published mutations in the 9A stretch. Sequence loss or deletion of a 12-residue peptide upstream to the 9A stretch, which is encoded by nucleotides 16&#x02013;51, showed a dramatic impairment of T&#x003b2;RI expression because of its labile protein stability. On the other hand, a 13-residue peptide immediately downstream to the stretch is apparently involved in receptor-mediated signaling activation. In contrast, removal of the 9A stretch itself had only a mild effect on the protein expression and function of T&#x003b2;RI. Intriguingly, Pasche <italic>et al</italic>. recently reported that deletion of three alanine residues in the stretch conferred certain advantages for tumor growth and was associated with the malignancy of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our study also demonstrated that the presence of the DM3 variant could counteract TGF&#x003b2; action. These findings disclose an unexpected additional complexity in the response of tumor cells to TGF&#x003b2;-mediated growth regulation.</p><p>In contrast to previously reported T&#x003b2;RI variants, the four newly discovered truncated forms defined in this study are apparently not caused by somatic mutations. Germ-line predisposing or cancer-associated somatically acquired mutations are usually considered the major cause for malfunction of the <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>gene. Those mutations are composed of nucleotide transversion, insertion, and deletion mutations. Around 30% of patients with ovarian cancer bear a dinucleotide insertion in exon 5 of the <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Another tumor-susceptible allele is <italic>Tgfbr1-6A</italic>. A meta-analysis of 12 case-control studies by Pasche <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] indicates that <italic>Tgfbr1-6A </italic>carriers have an increased risk of colon, breast, and ovarian cancers compared with non-carriers. In addition, there was a much higher frequency of this allele found in colorectal tumor tissue than in germ-line DNA extracted from the same patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], suggesting that acquisition of <italic>Tgfbr1-6A </italic>allele may be contributed by cancer-associated somatic deletions. However, this clinical correlation between the frequency of this allele and increased cancer risk is quite controversial since other studies did not reach the same conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. One possible interpretation for this is that <italic>Tgfbr1-6A </italic>is also a common polymorphism in healthy individuals (11.2% to 19.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Hence, the frequency between cancer patients and controls is not distinctly different. A meta-analysis of case-control studies for heterogeneity from different groups may be marginally significant. Intriguingly, neither our laboratory nor others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] have found this mutant allele in patients with lung cancer. Hence, acquisition of lung cancer-associated mutations to T&#x003b2;RI may be through post-transcriptional processes rather than because of sequence defects in its genomic DNA. One plausible mechanism for this is RNA editing, as several mammalian tumor-associated transcript mutants can be generated through this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>RNA editing is a widespread phenomenon in eukaryotes and it involves insertions, deletions, or nucleotide conversion leading to post-transcriptional base changes in mRNA and tRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This cellular process is also observed in mammalian transcripts and some of them are associated with tumorigenesis such as in the glutamate receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], <italic>Ptpn6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and <italic>Wt-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Consistent with our finding, Choi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] also reported an insertion of four or five amino acid residues in the carboxyl terminus of extracellular domain of naturally occurring rat <italic>Alk-5 </italic>(<italic>Tgfbr1</italic>) transcripts. This finding further strengthens our hypothesis that cancer cells may modulate their sensitivity to TGF&#x003b2; by generation of its receptor variants through a post-transcriptional process and interfere with endogenous existing signaling. At least, DM3 in this study may be such a case.</p><p>Sequence deletions in the <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>transcripts are not merely through a single biological process. In addition to the truncations in the signal peptide, the deletion of nucleotides 344&#x02013;574 in the sequence for DM3 and nucleotides 97&#x02013;972 in that for DM4 are consequences of major alternative gene splicing. Alignment of the published human <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>gene sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] with the nucleotide sequences encoding these two variants revealed that the deletions occur precisely between exons 2 and 4 for DM3 and between exons 1 and 6 for DM4. Hence, generation of these transcript variants is probably involved in at least two post-transcriptional processes: alternative RNA splicing or RNA editing or even a yet undefined biological process.</p><p>Regulation of protein degradation requires accurate identification. Frequently, a small region of protein sequence provides information that targets the protein for degradation such as the degradation motif of I&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the stability-regulating region of MOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and the N-terminal residues of some proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The action for the degradation is either mediated by ubiquitin-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] or -independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] proteolytic pathways. Removal of the 12-residue peptide upstream to the 9A stretch in the DM1, DM2, and DS1 variants greatly shortened their protein half-lives (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Treatment with MG132, an ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor, but not of lactacystin, a highly specific inhibitor of the 20S proteasome, rescued them from degradation. Therefore, this 12-residue peptide might have an indispensable role in the protection of T&#x003b2;RI against ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. The protective role played by this peptide is probably to target a newly synthesized polypeptide of T&#x003b2;RI onto the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and prevents it from prolonged exposure to cytoplasmic proteolytic machinery. However, this is not the case for TGFBR1-6A. Pasche <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] showed that the removal of three alanine residues from the 9A stretch did not measurably affect its membrane targeting. Thus, the essential role of the 12-residue peptide for membrane targeting of T&#x003b2;RI variants needs to be clarified.</p><p>Additionally, a region C-terminal to the 9A stretch in the signal peptide, ranging from residue 27 to residue 39, has a tremendous effect on T&#x003b2;RI-mediated transcriptional activation. Lack of this region in the DM3, DM4, and DS3 variants showed no dramatic difference from the wild-type one in their protein expression, but all failed to conduct TGF&#x003b2; signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This result clearly indicates the critical role of this region for the function of T&#x003b2;RI. Based on amino terminal sequencing in a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or using a SignaIP program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the data indicate that the major cleavage site of the putative signal peptide is located between residues 33 and 34. Hence, loss of the cleavage site could be a potential factor accounting for DS3's refractoriness to TGF&#x003b2;. One plausible speculation is that the signal peptides un-cleaved from these variants, and in turn, interfere with their ability to bind with ligand. However, there might be other residues in this region critical for the receptor function.</p><p>The co-existence of T&#x003b2;RI variants might confer survival benefits to tumor cells. This hypothesis is supported by our present data, showing that the expression of DM3 enabled MCF-7 cells to resist TGF&#x003b2;-induced growth inhibition markedly. A similar observation was also reported in the TGFBR1-6A variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, in contrast to this variant, the DM3 protein not only loses the truncated region of DS3, but also lacks the transmembrane domain, juxtamembrane region, and GS motif. In our gene reporter and cell proliferation assays in R1B cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), those data further confirm that DM3 is a non-functional receptor and mainly localized in the cytosol. One previous study by Saitoh <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] showed that a deletion mutant lacking its juxtamembrane region could be still associated with T&#x003b2;RII and transduce TGF&#x003b2; signaling. Therefore, we speculate that this DM3 variant can modulate TGF&#x003b2;-mediated signaling activation by competing with endogenous wild-type T&#x003b2;RI in the cells for association with the type II receptor and thereby blocking some downstream signaling pathways. This working hypothesis is currently supported by our unpublished data, showing that DM3 could significantly abolish TGF&#x003b2;-induced JNK activation and have a potential role in tumorigenesis. However, another possibility that secondary signals generated by this variant may directly deregulate the TGF&#x003b2;-induced cell apoptosis should also not be ruled out since it still contains an intact serine/threonine kinase domain. Compared to DM3, DM4 loses several kinase subdomains, particularly for subdomains III-V, which have been shown to include a key region for the transduction of TGF&#x003b2; signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The expression of this variant could also rescue TGF&#x003b2;-induced growth suppression in a cell although the magnitude of the blocking effect was much weaker than that of DM3. If the molecular mechanism mediated by DM4 is the same as by DM3 remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Although the involvement of TGFBR1-6A and our newly discovered variants in tumorigenesis has not been substantially validated <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo </italic>studies, this implication seems to be supported by published data from several clinical studies. Thus, Chen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] performed genotyping for the <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>gene in 34 patients with ovarian cancer. The data showed that 7 out of 34 (21%) patients had either deleted or point mutations in the truncated regions of DM3 or DM4. Wang, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] found that around 31.3% of ovarian cancer patients had a 2-nucleotide insertion at codons 276&#x02013;277 (nucleotides 825&#x02013;831), also located in this region. Thus, these findings suggest that mutations in <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>are likely responsible for human ovarian carcinogenesis. However, the evidence from our and Zhang's [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] laboratories obviously indicate that mutations of <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>probably do not result from defects in its DNA level. Hence, for association of <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>mutations with lung cancer, a large-scale case-control study on mutations of its transcript is required to test any correlation between the frequency of mutated transcripts and their potential to cause malignancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Loss of functional T&#x003b2;RI resulting in insensitivity to TGF&#x003b2; is frequently associated with tumor malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The disclosure of these two hitherto undiscovered regions on the signal peptide of T&#x003b2;RI in this study adds pivotal knowledge to the molecular understanding of its protein expression and receptor function and provides an alternative molecular target for monitoring disease progression. First, these data demonstrate that a small deletion in the putative signal peptide of T&#x003b2;RI is a common feature for the pleural effusion-derived tumor cells we have examined so far, but this is not found in normal control cells. Second, the serial site-directed deletion mutagenesis resolved an indispensable role for T&#x003b2;RI protein stability of the 12-residue peptide upstream to the 9A stretch of the signal peptide. Deletion of a 13-residue peptide downstream to the 9A sequence produced serious impairment to receptor-mediated transcriptional activation. Third, study of the effects of these naturally occurring variants on cell growth has provided a plausible interpretation for how effusion tumor cells can survive in a microenvironment enriched with TGF&#x003b2;. Finally, these observations indicate that a small sequence deletion in the signal peptide can cause distinct consequences for T&#x003b2;RI protein expression or receptor function and suggest that DM3 might act as an oncogene, regulating TGF&#x003b2;-induced pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml).

HEK 293 or R1B cells were transiently transfected with each gene construct using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or ExGene500 (Fermantas, Hanover, MD), respectively. For increasing protein expression, transfected R1B cells were infected with T7 vaccinia viruses as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The transfectants were lysed 24 h after the transfection in a lysis buffer [10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaF] supplemented with 1 &#x000d7; protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Approximately 15 or 150 &#x003bc;g of the lysates were resolved by electrophoresis in 10% or 15% SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels, as indicated in the figure legends. The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose transfer membranes (Schleicher &#x00026; Schuell, Keene, NH) and probed with anti-HA-tag (Covance, Berkeley, CA), or anti-&#x003b2;-Actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) antibodies. The immuno-complexes were detected by probing with anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG conjugated with HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cambridgeshire, UK) and visualized using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce, Rockford, IL).</p></sec><sec><title>Reporter gene assay</title><p>Receptor-mediated transcriptional activation of wild-type T&#x003b2;RI and its truncated variants was determined by measuring TGF&#x003b2;-induced luciferase activity. Each gene construct or a control plasmid was co-transfected into R1B cells with the p3TP-Lux reporter gene using ExGene 500 (Fermentas). To normalize the transfection efficiency, 0.05 &#x003bc;g of the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) was also utilized in the experiments. After 24 h, the transfectants were starved for 6 h by changing for fresh media supplemented with 0.2% FBS, and then treated with 5 ng/ml TGF&#x003b2;1 (R&#x00026;D systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 24 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in each transfected cell lysate were detected using Dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega) in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometric analysis</title><p>Examination of transfection efficiency with different gene constructs was performed by co-transfection with the pEGFP plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein. One microgram of each gene construct and 0.1 &#x003bc;g of pEGFP were transfected into 3&#x02013;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells and incubated for 24 h. Flow cytometric analyses were used to determine the percentage of green fluorescence-positive cells in total cell population using a FACSCalibur machine (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA).</p><p>For analysis of TGF&#x003b2;-induced cell apoptosis, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>stable-transfectants expressing the DM3, or DM4 variants were seeded onto each well of 6-well plates and cultured overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. After TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment for 72 h, cells were collected, washed with PBS twice, and stained with Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) according to manufacturer's instructions (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). The results are presented as fold of increase in cell apoptosis as compared with corresponding untreated cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Ribonuclease protection assay</title><p>The existence of <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>naturally occurring transcript variants was confirmed by RNase protection analysis using the RPA III kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). PCR reactions using primers listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> generated variant-specific amplicons with a 12-nt linker and a T7 promoter sequences located in the 3' end of the amplicons. <sup>32</sup>P-labeled antisense riboprobes were prepared using a T7 transcription kit (Ambion) to yield 275, 204, 163, and 102 nt probes for DM1, DM2, DM3, and DM4, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from CA1109 effusion tumor cells. Ten &#x003bc;g of the RNA aliquot was hybridized with individual or mixed <sup>32</sup>P-labeled antisense probe (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cpm) for 16 -18 h at 42&#x000b0;C, digested with RNase A/T1, and resolved on a 6% acrylamide sequencing gel containing 8 M urea.

To visualize the translated proteins, [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine (1175 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) was used. The radiolabeled proteins were resolved in a 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed with X-ray film.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell growth assay</title><p>Stably transfected MCF-7 cells (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>) expressing individual variants, or vector control cells were seeded and treated with TGF&#x003b2;1 for 96 h or not. The cell proliferation was determined by incubating the cells with 200 &#x003bc;l of fresh medium containing 1 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h. After removal of the MTT solution, the resulting formazan crystals were dissolved completely in an ethanol/DMSO mixture (1:1), transferred to the wells of 96-well plates, and quantified using an ELISA plate reader (Metertech 960, Metertech Inc, Taipei, Taiwan) with the absorbance measured at 550 nm. Triplicate wells were assayed for each experiment and three or four independent experiments were performed, as indicated in the figure legends.
