Epilepsy is reported to occur in 20&#x02013;25% of individuals with FXS. However, no overall increased excitability has been reported in <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mice, except for increased sensitivity to auditory stimulation. Here, we report that kindling increased the expressions of <italic>Fmr1</italic> mRNA and protein in the forebrain of wild-type (WT) mice. Kindling development was dramatically accelerated in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice also displayed prolonged electrographic seizures during kindling and more severe mossy fiber sprouting after kindling. The accelerated rate of kindling was partially repressed by inhibiting N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) with MK-801 or mGluR5 receptor with 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP). The rate of kindling development in WT was not effected by MPEP, however, suggesting that FMRP normally suppresses epileptogenic signaling downstream of metabolic glutamate receptors. Our findings reveal that FMRP plays a critical role in suppressing limbic epileptogenesis and predict that the enhanced susceptibility of patients with FXS to epilepsy is a direct consequence of the loss of an important homeostatic factor that mitigates vulnerability to excessive neuronal excitation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>FMRP</kwd><kwd>kindling</kwd><kwd>mGluR5</kwd><kwd>mossy fiber sprouting</kwd><kwd>NMDA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited mental retardation, results from a trinucleotide repeat (CGG) expansion in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region of the gene <italic>Fmr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Verkerk et al. 1991</xref>).

Murine FMRP is a brain-specific RNA-binding protein that suppresses translation of target RNAs. Through interactions with kinesin, FMRP is able to travel between distal neurites and the soma of neurons and thereby regulate protein synthesis locally within specific cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashley et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Warren and Nelson 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eberhart et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darnell et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohashi et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ling et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidovic et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>Patients with FXS exhibit mental retardation, attention deficits, autistic behavior, macroorchidism, and facial abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Turner et al. 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Opitz and Sutherland 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sobesky et al. 1996</xref>). Additionally, epilepsy is reported to occur in 20&#x02013;25% of individuals with FXS and paroxysmal electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities are present in about 50% of prepubescent boys with FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Musumeci et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sabaratnam et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hagerman et al. 2002</xref>). These EEG pattern abnormalities resemble those of patients with benign focal epilepsy of childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry-Kravis 2002</xref>). FMRP deficiency is speculated to lead to increased neuronal excitability and susceptibility to seizures in humans. However, spontaneous seizures are never observed in <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mice and sensitivity to convulsants (such as bicuculline, pentylenetetrazol and kainic acid) is not significantly different from wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Toth 2001</xref>). The most substantial deficit observed in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice is increased sensitivity to auditory seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Musumeci et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Toth 2001</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice do not have an overall increased excitability phenotype but rather auditory system specific hyperexcitability.</p><p>Recent studies have challenged this conclusion. In hippocampal slices from <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, increasing neuronal activity by blocking &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) transmission by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist bicuculline induces prolonged epileptiform discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang et al. 2005</xref>). Furthermore, these prolonged discharges can be suppressed with the mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP). These observations suggest that FMRP does influence neuronal excitability in the forebrain, possibly by repressing group I mGluR-mediated RNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang et al. 2005</xref>). Interestingly, MPEP could also reverse other symptoms of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, including sound-induced seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bear et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McBride et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan et al. 2005</xref>).

Kindling mimics epileptogenesis in which repeated administration of an initially subconvulsive electrical stimulation of the amygdala results in progressive intensification of behavioral seizures and prolongation of electrographic afterdischarges (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goddard et al. 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Racine 1972</xref>). We found that kindling stimulation increased the expression of <italic>Fmr1</italic> mRNA and protein in the forebrain of WT mice. The development of behavioral seizures was dramatically accelerated in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, and AD durations were greatly exaggerated throughout kindling. Furthermore, exuberant mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) was observed in fully kindled <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Behavioral seizures could be repressed by administering the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist MK801 or mGluR5 antagonist MPEP in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Interestingly, MPEP did not alter kindling development in WT mice, suggesting that FMRP normally suppresses the epileptogenic effects of mGluR5 activity. Our findings indicate that FMRP-mediated transcriptional repression plays a critical role in moderating susceptibility to limbic epileptogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental Animals</title><p>Male <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice of the FVB strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">The Dutch&#x02013;Belgian Fragile X Consortium 1994</xref>) and their WT littermates were used.

This is consistent with the former finding that Group I mGluR and FMRP function in a convergent way in regulating mRNA translation and subsequently regulate synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenough et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bear et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hou et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nosyreva and Huber 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pan and Broadie 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pan et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>The development of kindling in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice have 3 interesting characteristics: normal EST, accelerated development of kindling, and prolonged electrographic seizures. These features share strong similarity to those observed in &#x003b1;2A adrenergic receptor (&#x003b1;2A-AR) null mice in which the number of stimulations required to achieve full kindling is reduced by about half and the duration of AD is nearly doubled throughout the development of kindling compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janumpalli et al. 1998</xref>). The &#x003b1;2A-AR is coupled to Gi/o subset of heterotrimeric G-proteins, which may function against the activation of group I mGluRs which interact with Gq proteins. It is possible that loss of FMRP and inactivation of &#x003b1;2A &#x02013;AR may lead to epileptogenesis by allowing excessive activation of a common signaling cascade. On the other hand, it is possible that the 2 mutants display similar phenotype of accelerated kindling by employing 2 parallel cellular cascades.</p><p>The formation of new synaptic connections is an important process in epileptogenesis. MFS is a major hallmark of abnormal synapse formation that occurs in the epileptic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Margerison and Corsellis 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McNamara 1999</xref>). As FMRP has been shown to effect neuronal elaboration by affecting the function of cytoskeletal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comery et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Irwin et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galvez et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antar et al. 2006</xref>), we investigated MFS in naive and kindled <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Whereas, the naive <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO brain exhibited no obvious abnormalities in mossy fiber innervation, MFS was dramatically enhanced in the IML region of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice compared with WT mice 5 or 28 weeks after 22 daily stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). This difference was not likely to be simply the result of enhanced seizure activity in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO brain because WT mice could be stimulated an additional 8 times (thus 36% more stimulations than <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice) and still show little evidence of increased MFS (data not show). Because no obvious neuronal cell death was detected in either the kindled WT or <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice 24 h after the completion of kindling development, this enhanced axon reorganization indicates that FMRP may exert an important role in preventing activity-induced neuronal network reorganization in the adult brain.</p><p>It has long been known that the cellular and molecular changes that underlie kindling are opposed by refractory periods, but the nature of these changes are not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mucha and Pinel 1977</xref>). The upregulation of FMRP expression by kindling-induced seizure as well as the accelerated development of kindling and pervasive seizure-evoked synaptogenesis in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice that we observed together support the idea that FMRP is an important intrinsic buffer against epileptogenesis. It is in this light that we predict that the enhanced susceptibility of patients with FXS to epilepsy is the direct consequence of the absence of a critical homeostatic factor that mitigates vulnerability to excessive neuronal excitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><grant-sponsor>National Basic Research Program of China</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>2006CB806600</grant-num>); the <grant-sponsor>Key State Research Program of China</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>2006CB943900</grant-num>); the <grant-sponsor>National &#x0201c;863&#x0201d; high-tech research and development program</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>2006AA02Z166</grant-num>); the <grant-sponsor>Innovative Research Group of The National Natural Science Foundation of China</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>30721004</grant-num>); the <grant-sponsor>Chinese Academy of Sciences</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>KSCX2-YW-R-099</grant-num>).
