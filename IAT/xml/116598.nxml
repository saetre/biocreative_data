The novel extrachromosomal DNA-containing virus-like element denoted PEVE (Planarian Extrachromosomal Virus-like Element) was identified in one planarian strain. The PEVE genome (about 7.5 kb) consists of two unique regions (Ul and Us) flanked by inverted repeats. Sequence analyses reveal that PEVE comprises two helicase-like sequences in the genome, of which the first is a homolog of a circoviral replication initiator protein (Rep), and the second is similar to the papillomavirus E1 helicase domain. PEVE genome exists in at least two variant forms with different arrangements of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA stretches that correspond to the Us and Ul regions.

Moreover, planaria are used for <italic>in vivo</italic> tumorogenicity studies of pure compounds and complex environmental mixtures, and for mechanistic studies of tumorogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Planaria are prospective models for genetic variation studies in populations. The planarian species (<italic>Planariidae</italic> family) are represented by different strains employing various modes of reproduction, including exclusively sexual, exclusively asexual, or both sexual and asexual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Strains that reproduce exclusively asexually are genetically different to strains of the same species able to reproduce both sexually and asexually. For instance, an asexual strain of <italic>Dugesia (S) mediterranea</italic> exhibits morphological heteromorphosis in the third pair of chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Worms belonging to different asexual strains of <italic>Dugesia japonica</italic> and <italic>Girardia</italic> (formerly <italic>Dugesia</italic>) <italic>tigrina</italic> are triploid or mixoploid, while sexual strains are diploid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Asexual strains are represented by independent populations that propagate only by fission.</p><p>Recently, we supplemented the well-known SSH<sup>#</sup> (suppression subtractive hybridization) technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] with the Mirror Orientation Selection method (MOS) for eliminating background clones from SSH-generated libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This innovative procedure allowed the application of these techniques in the subtraction of large eukaryotic genomes, including those of freshwater planarian (haploid genome size of <italic>G. tigrina</italic> is 1.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). Using the SSH-MOS combination, genomes of two different strains of <italic>G. tigrina</italic> were compared. Novel virus-like element with unusual features was identified in one planarian strain. We characterized the genome structure of the novel element and analyzed its distribution in the planarian body.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Verification of the model</title><p>Two planarian strains were used for comparison. One was an asexual strain maintained as laboratory culture in Moscow (Russia) for over 20 years. Worms belonging to this strain have been successfully used for various experiments, including gene discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The second strain, collected in Russia near Moscow, represented sexual planaria capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. The specimens were assigned to <italic>G. tigrina</italic> on the basis of their external appearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This strain is morphologically similar to the sexual strain collected previously in Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and like the Spanish animals, differs from asexual planaria in their size and details of coloration. Unlike asexual animals, mature planaria of the sexual strain possess well-distinguished reproductive organs and lay fertile cocoons.</p><p>To verify the genetic propinquity of the sexual and asexual planarian strains, we analyzed mariner element sequences from the asexual and the sexual specimens. Several DNA sequences similar to the mariner element have been reported in <italic>G. tigrina </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. There are about 7000 copies of this element in the genome, which appear to code for an active transposase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. None of these mariner elements are present in the genomes of other turbellarians, including the species closest to <italic>G. tigrina </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. With the aid of PCR using specific primers for the planarian mariner element, we isolated and sequenced several clones from sexual and asexual planaria. All clones displayed 98&#x02013;99% identity at the nucleotide level, and the differences between sequences of various strains did not exceed the diversity within one strain.</p><p>Based on these data, we conclude that the two planarian strains represent a valid model system for studying genetic differences between planarian populations, and can be used for the subtractive hybridization of genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning of PEVE</title><p>Two subtracted libraries were generated: the first enriched with asexual strain-specific DNA fragments (AS library), and the second with sexual strain-specific DNA (SS library). Differential screening revealed 30% and 60% strain-specific clones in SS and AS libraries, respectively. Sequence analyses of selected AS-specific clones demonstrated that about 50% contained open reading frames (ORFs) with codon usage unusual for <italic>G. tigrina </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Some of these AS-specific ORFs encode polypeptides similar to viral proteins.</p><p>When used as probes in Southern blot hybridization with undigested sexual and asexual planarian DNA, these clones stained two relatively low molecular weight DNA bands in asexual specimens only (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

This indicates that only our asexual planarian population is infected by PEVE.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Using the subtractive hybridization technique, we identified a novel planarian virus-like element, PEVE. Examination of PEVE genome organization and structure reveals that this virus-like element cannot be assigned to any known group of viruses or plasmids, and thus represents a novel type of viral element that encodes two helicases in one genome. Both putative helicases may be involved in the initiation of DNA replication.</p><p>The proposed scheme of PEVE genomic organization is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>. Based on Southern blot and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization data, we hypothesize that PEVE exists as two variant forms with different compositions of ss and ds DNA stretches, corresponding to the Ul and Us regions. The ss stretches are present in a unique orientation and therefore have only one type of polarity. The ss Ul region displays sense orientation for ORF4L and antisense for ORF1L, while the Us region comprises a strand with all encoded ORFs in an antisense orientation. These ss regions are flanked by ds sequences in both orientations.</p><p>PEVE is distributed unevenly along the worm's body. Our PCR data reveal very low amounts of the viral-like element in the head region. The PEVE expression was also detected in central and tail regions and was not found in head region. In accordance with in situ hybridization data, PEVE is detected in certain differentiated parenchyma cells.</p><p>PEVE is the first viral element identified in free-living flatworms. This novel element is not widespread in planarian populations, and has been detected in only one planarian asexual strain to date. However, it is possible that similar virus-like elements and viruses are present in other planarian strains.</p><p>Although asexual strains of planaria exist independently for a long time, they display substantial genetic resemblance. In particular, the identities of five <italic>Antennapedia</italic>-like homeobox genes have been disclosed from both our and the Spanish asexual strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These findings imply that PEVE may affect other asexual strains of planaria, thus paving the way for the development of transgenic planaria using the planarian viral sequences as vectors for introduction of exogenous DNA into planarian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have identified a novel extrachromosomal viral-element (PEVE) in the asexual strain of planarian <italic>G. tigrina</italic>.
