Human TLRs comprise a large family of 10 proteins with member-specific activators and a complex downstream signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. TLRs are expressed on various immune cells but are also present on mucosal surfaces of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Applying different adaptor proteins such as toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 1 (TRIF, TICAM1), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), myelin and lymphocyte protein Mal, translocation associated membrane protein (TRAM) and sterile alpha and TIR motif containing (SARM), TLRs activate signalling pathways of mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF&#x000ea;B), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) or the activator protein 1 (AP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These signalling cascades result in enhanced secretion of various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interferons, tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) and interleukins IL4, IL8, and IL12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Two studies have described the expression of human TLRs in epithelial cells within the female reproductive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Other than their importance for the interaction between host and pathogen, the receptors might be involved in mucosal homeostasis as described already for the intestine and colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. TLR3 is implicated in the recognition of dsRNA, mRNA and viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], whereas TLR4 is a key component of the initial injury response by reacting towards bacterial endotoxin and multiple endogenous ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recent studies have determined the expression pattern of TLR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] in the human endometrium, but their possible involvement in the pathogenesis of endometrial diseases associated with inflammation remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Endometriosis is a common benign gynaecological condition of reproductive aged women [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]]. The disease is characterised by endometrial tissue fragments outside the uterine cavity and is associated with pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, and infertility. Since aetiology and pathogenesis remain uncertain, different theories are discussed including altered immune function. The deregulation of immune response in endometriosis is characterised by increased number of activated macrophages and their secreted products, such as growth factors, cytokines, and angiogenic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Young et al. reported an increase in interleukin-8 (IL-8) production after stimulating TLR3 and TLR4 in endometrial cell lines with appropriate ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. IL-8 is a chemotactic activating cytokine for leukocytes and it has been hypothesized to play a role in the growth and maintenance of ectopic endometrial tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recent studies consider endometriosis as a process of sterile inflammation in the pelvis, which is accompanied by elevated levels of inflammatory key regulators such as TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] or NF-&#x003ba;&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Both are known downstream targets of TLRs.</p><p>Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynaecological malignancy in Europe and North America affecting mainly postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In endometrial tumorigenesis, two different types are characterised: the estrogen-related adenocarcinoma (endometrioid type) and the non-endometrioid type such as papillary serous and clear cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Adenocarcinoma accounts for seventy percent of endometrial cancer and is mostly preceded by premalignant changes like endometrial hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The majority of adenocarcinoma expresses steroid receptors and occur in women with risk factors associated with an imbalance of estrogen and progesterone. However, inflammation with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; is known to play an important role in cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma the expression of NF&#x003ba;B and TFN&#x003b1; has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] indicating that the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines seem to play a role in endometrial tumorigenesis.</p><p>The present study describes the expression pattern of TLR3 and TLR4 mRNA and proteins in healthy endometrium across the menstrual cycle and in postmenopausal tissue. To assess the possible involvement of these toll-like receptors in endometrial pathologies, their expression pattern was also examined in endometriosis and in adenocarcinoma specimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Endometrial tissues</title><p>Endometrial tissues were obtained from 55 women with regular menstrual cycles (mean 28 &#x000b1; 2.2 days) who were undergoing gynaecological procedures for benign conditions at the Department of Gynaecology, University Hospital Essen (table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

The amplicons were purified by using a Qiagen kit and cDNA concentration was measured photometrically. For each gene, five different dilutions of standard cDNA were used in real time PCR. Threshold cycles for TLR3 signals were between 26 and 38 and for TLR4 between 25 and 36, respectively. Because of the diversity in the RNA quality, each individual sample was normalized to its ACTB mRNA content as an internal standard. These relative values were used for statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Paraffin-embedded specimens were sectioned at 7 &#x003bc;m, rehydrated and microwaved in 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 10 min for antigen retrieval.

We also found higher TLR4 expression levels in endometrial samples throughout the menstrual cycle and in postmenopausal biopsies, when compared to those for TLR3. In most tissues including gut, gonads and placenta, TLR3 is greater expressed than TLR4 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. TLR3 recognizes RNA and viruses, whereas TLR4 mediates the response to bacterial endotoxins and is activated due to sterile inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, the predominant expression of TLR4, observed in uterine tissues, might reflect the occurrence of sterile inflammation during the menstrual cycle. Moreover, ascending bacterial pathogens could contribute to the TLR4 dominance in the uterus.</p><p>In agreement with earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], both investigated TLRs were mainly localized in the endometrial epithelium, the site of primary immune response in the uterus. In addition, we were able to detect TLR4 protein on endometrial CD14 and CD163 positive immune cells. We found CD14 mainly expressed within the epithelial layer, only a sporadic number of CD14 positive cells was detected in stromal compartment, probably representing the population of monocytes. A recent study performed on bovine endometrial cells, co-localised TLR4 transcripts with CD14 mRNA and protein to stromal and epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. CD14 is a known accessory molecule for TLR4 and conducts a downstream signalling cascade via MyD88 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In agreement with Pioli et al., who detected TLR4, CD14 and MyD88 transcripts in human endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], we were able to co-localize TLR4 with CD14 proteins suggesting the presence of both interacting receptors CD14 and TLR4 in the endometrial cells.</p><p>For the first time, we present endometrial effluents expressing high levels of TLR3 and TLR4 proteins. Since the period of menstruation is accompanied by an increased risk of infections due to ascending microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], we believe that the increased expression of toll-like receptors may be one of the defense mechanisms used by the uterus. Previous studies reported that toll-like receptors are also implicated in epithelial repair as described for intestinal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and alveolar epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In damaged tissue, necrosis induced inflammation is thought to trigger danger signals, leading to tissue repair response through TLRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Since repair processes occur every month in the uterus of premenopausal women, we believe that the interaction between hyaluronan and TLR4 might promote the endometrial repair. Hyaluronan is released by necrotic cells, interacts with TLR4 and activates CD44 mediated signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the endometrium, deposition of hyaluronan has been described in stromal compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Moreover, hyaluronan has been reported to be involved in attachment of endometrial cells to the mesothelium as a very early step of endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Further investigations of hyaluronan-TLR4 signalling in healthy and diseased endometrium would be of interest to gain insight into the functional role of TLR4 expression in the uterus.</p><p>Endometriosis causes chronic inflammatory conditions in the pelvic cavity and in the uterus. This disorder is discussed to be accompanied by an activation of the Th2 type of immune response and a shift from Th1 towards Th2 cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Interestingly, Th2 cytokines were shown to play an important role in balancing TLR signalling in human intestinal epithelial cells by mediating downregulation of TLR3 and TLR4 expression and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This could also be the case in the diseased eutopic endometrium, where decreased TLR levels were found. It remains to be fully elucidated, if deregulation of TLR expression is involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis or if altered TLR expression patterns are a consequence resulting from the presence of endometriotic lesions. We could recently show that uterine gene expression patterns are altered due to the existence of ectopic lesions in a non-human primate model for endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Since implantation is a process accompanied by an inflammatory event, an impaired fertility observed in endometriotic women could be one consequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Continued studies are needed to determine the role of TLR function in diseased endometrium, which could be a promising path towards a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.</p><p>Interestingly, we found a local upregulation of both TLRs in peritoneal endometriotic lesions when compared to eutopic endometriosis from the same patients. A recent study presented a local upregulation of CD14 and CD163 in ovarian endometriotic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, we observe locally gained TLR4 expression in epithelial cells as demonstrated in immunohistochemical stainings. We propose that the sterile inflammation process, which occurs in the pelvic cavity upon endometriosis, is able to enhance the epithelial TLR4 expression and thus activate the known downstream signalling cascade. One of the potentially activated TLR-downstream molecules is NF-&#x003ba;B, which was recently found as constitutively elevated in endometriotic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is established that the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is linked to proliferation, angiogenesis and enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines on ectopic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Hence, the TLR-NF-&#x003ba;B cascade might contribute to the chronic persistence of endometriotic lesions.</p><p>In endometrial adenocarcinoma, expression levels of the downstream molecules TNF&#x003b1; and NF-&#x003ba;B were decreased in G2 and G3 but not in the well-differentiated grade 1 carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Although the evidence is lacking, the almost negligible levels of both toll-like receptors in G3 endometrial adenocarcinoma may reflect lowered differentiation and possibly indicates poor prognosis.</p><p>Both endometriosis and endometrial adenocarcinoma are estrogen dependent diseases. In both conditions, TLR3 and TLR4 were significantly decreased in diseased endometrium when compared to age matched controls. However, it is known that estrogen did not influence the expression of either TLR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] nor TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] in epithelial cells of endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Thus, additional factors are required to decrease TLR-expression in endometriotic endometrium and in endometrial carcinoma.</p><p>Besides excessive estrogen, genetic predisposition presents one of the risk factors associated with the development of endometrial adenocarcinoma. In our study, we observed high inter-individual differences in TLR expression as mirrored by high standard deviations. The results implicate a possible impact of polymorphisms on mRNA expression in physiologic and pathologic endometrium. Recently, a functional polymorphism of the TLR4 gene, associated with impaired TLR signalling, was considered as a significant risk factor for gastric carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Another single nucleotide polymorphism in 3'-untranslated region of the same gene has been associated with increased risk for prostate carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. It remains to be fully elucidated, if genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding for toll-like receptors might promote endometrial carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest an involvement of TLR3 and TLR4 in endometrial diseases as we demonstrated altered expression levels for both receptors in endometriosis and endometrial adenocarcinoma. Healthy and differentiated endometrium seems to require an adequate TLR3 and TLR4 expression.
