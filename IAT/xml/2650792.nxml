We used mouse Affymetrix exon arrays to detect copy number variants (CNV) among inbred mouse strains and thereby identified a &#x0223c;475 kb tandem duplication on chromosome 17 that includes <italic>Glo1</italic> (30,174,390&#x02013;30,651,226 Mb; mouse genome build 36). We developed a PCR-based strategy and used it to detect this duplication in 23 of 71 inbred strains tested, and in various outbred and wild-caught mice. Presence of the duplication is associated with a cis-acting expression QTL for <italic>Glo1</italic> (LOD&#x0003e;30) in BXD recombinant inbred strains. However, evidence for an eQTL for <italic>Glo1</italic> was not obtained when we analyzed single SNPs or 3-SNP haplotypes in a panel of 27 inbred strains. We conclude that association analysis in the inbred strain panel failed to detect an eQTL because the duplication was present on multiple highly divergent haplotypes. Furthermore, we suggest that non-allelic homologous recombination has led to multiple reversions to the non-duplicated state among inbred strains. We show associations between multiple duplication-containing haplotypes, <italic>Glo1</italic> expression and anxiety-like behavior in both inbred strain panels and outbred CD-1 mice. Our findings provide a molecular basis for differential expression of <italic>Glo1</italic> and further implicate <italic>Glo1</italic> in anxiety-like behavior. More broadly, these results identify problems with commonly employed tests for association in inbred strains when CNVs are present. Finally, these data provide an example of biologically significant phenotypic variability in model organisms that can be attributed to CNVs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest a potential role for <italic>GLO1</italic> in human psychiatric disorders. In humans, an A111E amino acid polymorphism (rs2736654) in <italic>GLO1</italic> has been described.

More recently, reductions in <italic>GLO1</italic> mRNA in the blood of mood disorder patients have been reported; patients with the same diagnosis but in remission showed normal <italic>GLO1</italic> mRNA levels, raising the possibility that mRNA for <italic>GLO1</italic> is a state-dependent marker of certain affective disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004649-Fujimoto1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

CNV detection was accomplished through the application of Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004649-Emerson1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. We limited our analysis to regions spanning 3 probe lengths that were either duplicated or deleted in one strain relative to C57BL/6J (B6; the reference strain). We selected B6 as the reference strain because the current assembly of the mouse genome and the design of the Affymetrix Mouse Exon ST 1.0 microarray rely heavily on B6. We compared 4 strains to the reference strain: A/J, DBA/2J, LG/J, and SM/J. Two microarrays were used to represent each strain.</p><p>Genomic DNA samples from each strain were hybridized onto Affymetrix Mouse Exon ST arrays. The exon array is composed of 6,553,600 25-nucleotide-length probes with a coverage density of 4 probes for each exon of all known and predicted genes in the mouse genome. Differences in probe hybridization are used as a quantifiable measure to determine CNVs between strains. Spatial correction procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004649-Borevitz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> were implemented to account for confounding experimental artifacts such as local spatial bias and continuous spatial gradients. The probe hybridization intensity signal was quantile normalized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004649-Bolstad1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> across all probes to further correct for systematic variance in arrays.</p><p>Each probe on the exon array was matched to its corresponding base-pair position using MegaBlast. We relied on the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> genome build 36.1 (Feb. 2006), obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The annotation, and subsequent analysis, was limited to those probes for which there was a perfect alignment to a single position in the reference genome. The gene annotation was derived from NCBI's Genbank and matched to probes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://natural.uchicago.edu/~tgal">natural.uchicago.edu/&#x002dc;tgal</ext-link>).</p><p>The CNV detection model used an HMM approach; predictions of deletions or duplications utilize relative hybridization intensity data for each probe. Probes representing one strain were assigned probabilities of being in one of three states: duplicated (more copies), deleted (fewer or no copies) or ground (equivalent copies), relative to a reference strain. Duplications and deletions are identified as contiguous regions of probes with high probabilities for their respective states. The unknown underlying pattern of relative deletions and duplications between strains constitutes the hidden aspect of the HMM. Parameters for the HMM were selected by training on known duplications and deletions followed by visual inspection across a range of settings to balance false positives and false negatives. The primary methods for this algorithm have been published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004649-Emerson1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we describe only the modifications of those methods used in the present study. We limited our analysis to regions spanning a minimum of 3 probe lengths that were either duplicated or deleted in one strain relative to a reference strain. Posterior probabilities for each state were calculated at all probes using a forward-backward algorithm. The forward-backward algorithm produced a biologically relevant fit to the array data and reduced the potential for over correction due to probe effects. To further reduce noise in the posterior probabilities, the algorithm's smoothing parameter was set to 0.55 for both duplicated and deleted states. The scripts for this analysis, as well as unprocessed and processed data, are all available at (borevitzlab.uchicago.edu/Members/rwilliams/copy-number-analysis/supplemental-data).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>PCR to Confirm Duplication on Chromosome 17</title><p>We used the sequence from the 25-mer probes at the predicted ends of the duplications as primers for real time PCR to determine the approximate boundaries of the duplication. Primers were used to amplify regions from B6 and A/J mice using ABI SYBR&#x000ae; Green master mix and an ABI 7900 thermocycler in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

The amygdala was used because it has been extensively implicated in anxiety-like behavior. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and decapitated. The brain was removed from the skull and positioned in a 1 mm brain block with the anterior surface abutting a single-edged razor blade placed in the first slot. The slot nearest the boundary of medulla was used as the first landmark. Double-edged razor blades were placed in slots one and two mm anterior and three mm posterior to that boundary. Two 2-mm thick sections &#x02212;2 mm with respect to Bregma at posterior surface were dissected. In the first section, a horizontal cut was made at the ventral boundary of the external capsule. Another cut in line with the external capsule was made to separate the piriform cortex from the amygdala. In the remaining 2 mm thick section, the cortex was peeled apart from the hippocampus. Tissues were quickly frozen on dry ice. Tissues were pulverized while frozen, and total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad), then further processed by using the RNeasy miniprep kit according to manufacturer's protocols (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The quality of all samples was verified with an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Palo Alto, CA) prior to further processing. 5 &#x000b5;g of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA that was then used as a template to generate biotinylated cRNA. cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix MOE430 gene expression arrays using the manufacturer's protocols.

F<sub>1</sub> offspring were used rather than individuals collected directly in the wild to avoid the effects of environmental factors (e.g. diet, age) of wild animals. In each population, the parents that gave rise to the F<sub>1</sub> male originated from the same barn, or from locations in very close proximity to each other. We ensured that all of the F<sub>1</sub> mice were unrelated to each other by collecting their parents from farms that were at least 1 km apart.

Following this period of habituation, animals were removed from their home cage, immediately placed in the open field arena and allowed to freely explore the apparatus for 10 minutes. The software scored animals for a number of behaviors in the open field including total distance traveled and percent time spent in the center of the arena. These data were recorded during testing and scored in post-session analyses using commercially available software (Activity Monitor 5.1, Med Associates).

CD-1 mice were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA; age 4&#x02013;5 weeks old) and were housed in our vivarium for 3 weeks until testing. In order to avoid false positive (type 1) errors that might occur when using outbred mice that are siblings, we specifically requested that each mouse be obtained from a separate family. The open field consisted of a clear Plexiglas container with internal dimensions of 30&#x000d7;30&#x000d7;40 cm (width&#x000d7;depth&#x000d7;height) and was lit by a small incandescent overhead light-bulb such that the center of the chamber was about 80 lux. The chamber was fully enclosed in a melamine cabinet to shield it from laboratory noise and was ventilated by a small fan on the back of the cabinet. Locomotor activity in the open filed was monitored by photo beam sensors that were arrayed in a 2 cm grid to monitor horizontal movements; the data were collected by a microcomputer and processed using software provided by the manufacturer (AccuSacn Instruments, Columbus, OH). On the test day, animals were allowed to habituate to the test room for at least 30 minutes, and were then gently placed in the center of the open field and observed for 20 minutes. We examined center time and distance traveled because the results from inbred strains suggested that these two variables would be lower in mice with the duplication. The effect of the duplication on behavior was assessed using a one-tailed ANOVA. The test chamber was cleaned between subjects with a 10&#x00025; isopropanol solution.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Measurement of Glo1 expression in Outbred, CD-1 Mice</title><p>Whole brain homogenates were prepared from 59 randomly selected CD-1 mice that had been tested in the open field study more than 2 weeks prior to tissue collection.

To better understand this surprising result, we examined the haplotype structure from 30&#x02013;31 Mb in the 71 strains where the duplication status was known using the same 48 SNPs. Significantly, these SNPs flanked, but were not internal to the duplicated region. We observed four distinct haplotypes that contained the duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004649-g003">Figure 3</xref>, denoted with green borders). Careful examination of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004649-g003">Figure 3</xref> led us to conclude that multiple non-allelic homologous recombination events had taken place <italic>within</italic> the duplicated region. Non-allelic homologous recombination can occur between two chromosomes that both contain the duplication or between one duplicated and one non-duplicated chromosome. Such a recombination would lead to the exchange of either the distal or proximal haplotypes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004649-g003">Figure 3</xref> without altering duplication status. In particular, this explanation accounts for the SNP haplotype observed in the proximal regions of B6 and related strains (not duplicated) and DBA/2J (duplicated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004649-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that recombination within the duplication is at least partially responsible for the complex haplotype structure around the duplication.</p><fig id="pone-0004649-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004649.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Haplotype blocks from 30&#x02013;31 Mb across 71 inbred strains at 48 SNP markers.</title><p>The duplicated region is denoted by heavy black vertical lines; duplicated strains are denoted with two repeating regions labeled &#x02018;proximal copy&#x02019; and &#x02018;distal copy&#x02019;, whereas non-duplicated strains are indicated with a single box that contains the text &#x02018;non-duplicated&#x02019;.

Those that were available had higher than average rates of missing genotypes, and genotypes appeared to be disproportionately missing in strains that were positive for the duplication. We suspected that both phenomena were due the SNP assays or strain-specific SNP genotypes being scored as failures because heterozygous genotypes were obtained from inbred strains. A heterozygous genotype contradicts the assumption that these mice are inbred, and could thus appear to be a technical error. We suspected that these apparently heterozygous genotypes weredue to polymorphisms between the proximal and distal duplicated regions. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced 9 SNPs that were entirely within the duplication in 18 inbred strains (6 of which had the duplication). We observed multiple apparently heterozygous genotypes in duplicated strains, but none in non-duplicated strains (data not shown). The heterozygous genotypes can best be explained by a region that is polymorphic when comparing the proximal and distal copies of the duplication, rather than being heterozygous due to differences between two chromosomes. The heterozygous genotypes agreed with the haplotype structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004649-g003">Figure 3</xref>, and it was possible to identify the haplotypes of the proximal and distal copies. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the complex relationship between the duplication and surrounding haplotypes is due to crossovers that occurred within the duplicated region.</p><p>In order to avoid the ambiguity associated with heterozygous genotypes we used sequencing primers that spanned the duplication boundary (duplicated strains only). For comparison, we also used sequencing primers where one primer was outside of the duplicated region and the other was inside the duplicated region (all strains). This allowed us to uniquely compare SNPs that might be polymorphic between the proximal and distal copies in the duplicated strains, and also to directly extend our haplotype analysis into the duplicated region. When considering the proximal duplication boundary (&#x0223c;30.17 Mb), we observed two informative SNPs (30,174,423 and 30,174,589) both of which appear to have been exchanged via crossing over between duplicated and non-duplicated strains. The region near to 30.65 Mb was more interesting: a SNP at 30,650,629 is polymorphic such that the second duplication-containing haplotype block (the one that includes the A/J strain) differs from all other duplicated strains. The second duplication-containing haplotype block has a characteristic allele that is never observed in the analogous region in any of the other duplicated or non-duplicated strains. The second SNP in this region (30,650,736) perfectly distinguishes the internal from the external duplicated and non-duplication sequence and is thus never observed in non-duplicated strains. Both observations are consistent with these SNPs arising after the duplication occurred, though we cannot exclude the possibility of recombination or gene conversion with an unobserved, non-duplicated chromosome that contained these SNPs. Had the SNP at 30,650,736 been present in the inbred strain database, it would have performed as well as our PCR assay in terms of predicting the presence of the duplication; thus, exhaustive SNP coverage may help to address problems with inbred strain haplotype mapping, but will also increase the multiple testing burden and thus are unlikely to offer a solution to the problem of using SNPs to identify CNV among inbred strain panels.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Evidence for Recent Loss of the Duplication</title><p>Another observation that we made in examining the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004649-g003">Figure 3</xref> is that four strains (129X1/SvJ, BALB/cJ, BTBR T&#x0002b;tf/J and PERA/EiJ) appeared to belong to one of the two common duplication-containing haplotypes but did not contain the duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004649-g003">Figure 3</xref>; denoted with red boxes). We hypothesized that the duplication has reverted to the non-duplicated state in these strains by a process of non-allelic homologous recombination (sometimes termed unequal crossing over). This hypothesis was confirmed both by examination of DNA samples obtained from previous generations of these inbred strains as well as by taking advantage of the known breeding history of these strains. In this regard, one compelling case was the absence of the duplication in BALB/cJ. Historically, we know that BALB/cByJ and BALB/cJ were separated in the 1930s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004649-Bailey1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> but they remain isogenic at all typed SNPs and clearly share the same haplotype throughout the duplicated region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004649-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The absence of the duplication in BALB/cJ could be explained by a reversion event that occurred after their separation from BALB/cByJ in 1937. We obtained DNA samples from JAX for BALB/cByJ from 1982 and 2000 and determined that both had the duplication. We also obtained DNA from BALB/cBy (used by Tafti et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004649-Tafti1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, see below), which was separated from BALB/cByJ in the 1970s, and found that, unlike BALB/cByJ, BALB/cBy did not have the duplication. Finally, we obtained DNA from 1998 and 2006 for BALB/cJ and found that the duplication was not present in either sample. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the duplication has reverted to the non-duplicated state and/or that duplicated and non-duplicated alleles have been segregating within the BALB/c-lineage for some time. Because of the known breeding history of the BALB/c mice, the reversion observed in 129X1/SvJ, which shares the BALB/c haplotype, is presumed to have an independent origin. We obtained a sample from the F<sub>30</sub> generation of PERA/EiJ (1982) and found that this sample was positive for the duplication, whereas the modern samples (F99) were negative for the duplication. SNPs that were inside the duplication in the F<sub>30</sub> sample of PERA/EiJ exactly matched the other strains in that haplotype block (data not shown). These observations are consistent with loss of the duplication due to unequal crossing-over, as discussed above. Genomic DNA from BTBR T&#x0002b;tf/J from 1996 and 2004 as well as a sample from 129X1/SvJ from the 1990s were similar to modern samples and thus offered no further insights.</p><p>Thus, this duplication cannot be reliably predicted based on single SNPs or multi-SNP haplotypes due to simple recombination, genotyping problems due to heterozygous genotypes, and reversion to the non-duplicated state via non-allelic homologous recombination.

To more rigorously test the association between the duplication and anxiety-like behavior, we used our own behavioral data from 38 inbred strains (901 individual mice total) for which the duplication status was known.

We used open field data to calculate the average behavior associated with 3 of the 4 haplotypes for which data were available. This analysis showed that all duplication containing haplotypes are associated with higher anxiety-like behavior, which is consistent with a direct role for the duplication in behavior. In addition, the two strains that are part of haplotype block 2 but have lost the duplication spend more time in the center of the open field (less anxiety-like behavior) compared to strains in the same haplotype block that retain the duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004649-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Finally, the CD-1 mice presumably have a very different haplotype structure around this duplication, but still show the expected relationship between the duplication and behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004649-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These three observations support a causal role of the duplication in behavior and are inconsistent with the alternative hypothesis that the duplication is simply in LD with some other causal allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004649-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Because this duplication contains 4 genes it is not immediately clear which gene is responsible for the observed behavioral differences.

Among inbred strains, sequencing a putatively duplicated region can provide a preliminary test for CNVs; the presence of heterozygous genotypes would suggest the presence of a duplication. Along the same lines, distortions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium would be expected for markers within a duplication when working in an outbred population. PCR assays like the one utilized in the present study can be readily developed for both deletions and duplications, providing a valuable and efficient means of genotyping large numbers of subjects. For large scale discovery and typing of copy number differences, array-based methods, such as the ones used in this paper are clearly the most efficient.</p><p>Data implicating CNV in both autism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004649-Sebat1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004649-Walsh1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> have focused on <italic>de novo</italic> mutations rather than common CNV alleles. In contrast, the present study focuses on a duplication that is common among mice. In an effort to determine whether the peculiar history of inbred mouse strains had made a recent <italic>de novo</italic> CNV common by a combination of sampling error, genetic drift, inbreeding and perhaps unintended selection, we examined wild-caught mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004649-t001">Table 1</xref>). Our studies of wild-caught mice indicated that this particular duplication is common in both wild and laboratory mice. Crosses among inbred mouse stains are efficient for identifying the effects of copy number variants that are differentially fixed among inbred strains, since the frequency of the CNV can be set at 1&#x02236;1 by crossing two contrasting inbred strains. This is a different approach than focusing on <italic>de novo</italic> CNV in human subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004649-Sebat1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004649-Walsh1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>; examination of <italic>de novo</italic> duplications shares more in common with existing mouse mutagenesis strategies. In understanding whether SNPs or CNVs found among inbred strains are the result of a rare allele that was sampled from the wild and then amplified during the inbreeding process, reference back to wild populations, as in our study, provides invaluable insights.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, these data show that a large CNV alters <italic>Glo1</italic> expression and is associated with differences in anxiety-like behavior in inbred and outbred mice. Furthermore, we show evidence that complex haplotype structure and loss of duplicated regions by non-allelic homologous recombination may degrade the statistical power of methods that seek to associate genotypes with phenotypes in panels of inbred strains. More generally, the present results show that eQTLs and genetically complex behavioral differences in mice can be caused by CNVs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004649.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Duplications called by the HMM relative to C57BL/6J.
