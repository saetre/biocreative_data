Increasing evidence indicates that olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) implanted into spinal cord are found to migrate into the lesion site and induce axons regeneration beyond glial scar and resumption of functions. However, little is known about the mechanisms of OECs migrating from injection site to glial scar/lesion site.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>In the present study, we identified a link between OECs migration and reactive astrocytes in glial scar that was mediated by the tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;). Initially, the Boyden chamber migration assay showed that both glial scar tissue and reactive astrocyte-conditioned medium promoted OECs migration in vitro. Reactive astrocyte-derived TNF-&#x003b1; and its type 1 receptor TNFR1 expressed on OECs were identified to be responsible for the promoting effect on OECs migration. TNF-&#x003b1;-induced OECs migration was demonstrated depending on activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascades. Furthermore, TNF-&#x003b1; secreted by reactive astrocytes in glial scar was also showed to attract OECs migration in a spinal cord hemisection injury model of rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings showed that TNF-&#x003b1; was released by reactive astrocytes in glial scar and attracted OECs migration by interacting with TNFR1 expressed on OECs via regulation of ERK signaling. This migration-attracting effect of reactive astrocytes on OECs may suggest a mechanism for guiding OECs migration into glial scar, which is crucial for OECs-mediated axons regrowth beyond the spinal cord lesion site.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Damage to adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) leads to persistent functional deficits for the lack of axonal regeneration and reconnection with correct synaptic targets. The failure of spontaneous anatomical and functional repair is due not merely to the intrinsic incapacity of the neuron to regenerate but rather to the presence of a hostile environment in the lesion site. As the major cell type in CNS, astrocytes provide a variety of critical supportive functions that maintain neuronal homeostasis. When the CNS is damaged, astrocytes undergo an injury response and become reactive, characterized by hyperplasia, hypertrophy and an massive up-regulation of intermediate filament (IF) proteins, and leads eventually to the formation of a dense glial scar network at the lesion site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Cervos1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Astrocytes have the capacity to secrete or respond to a variety of cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-3, and TNF-&#x003b1;. Evidences show that TNF-&#x003b1;, an important inflammatory factor, regulates the migration of various kinds of cells. TNF-&#x003b1; and TNFR1 are required for migration of follicular dendritic cell precursors into splenic follicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Pasparakis1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies of Dekaris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Dekaris1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that TNF-&#x003b1; regulates corneal Langerhans cell migration. Additionally, TNF-&#x003b1; has also been reported to induce the motility of intestinal epithelial cell and mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Corredor1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Montesano1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. As a unique glial type in olfactory system, OECs has been shown to share some characteristics of inflammatory cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Brogden1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Ubink1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Vouldoukis1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Vincent1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Teare1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, data from recent microarray analysis of the transcriptome of OECs document that the cell, compared to astrocytes and Schwann cells, express higher levels of a number of innate immune factors, which suggest that OECs may play a role in modulating neuroinflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Vincent2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. OECs are also demonstrated to possess the cellular machinery that permits them to respond to certain bacterial ligands, and to mount a response through the activation of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF&#x003ba;B), an inflammatory transcription factor, and cytokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Vincent1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, TNF-&#x003b1; was found existing in the culture medium of activated astroyctes induced by LPS. In the injured spinal cord, expression of TNF-&#x003b1; by reactive astroyctes in glial scar was up-regulated and formed a linear concentration gradient. Moreover, Boyden chamber migration assay indicated that TNF-&#x003b1; was a chemoattractant for OECs migration, and TNF-&#x003b1; blocking with antibody greatly decreased the OECs migration activity. In addition, TNFR1 (type 1 TNF-&#x003b1; receptor) but not TNFR2 (type 2 TNF-&#x003b1; receptor) was shown to express in OECs, and we further confirmed that the chemoattractive activity on the migration of OECs was TNFR1-dependent by using anti-TNFR blockage. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that functional TNFR1 is expressed on OECs. All these results supported the hypothesis that in the injured spinal cord, reactive astrocytes in glial scar release TNF-&#x003b1; to attract grafted OECs migrating from injection site into lesion centre.</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1; has been shown to activate a number of signaling pathways in various cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Sippy1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Schutze1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Hansen1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> and these signaling mechanisms are highly dependent on the cell type. It is reported that the MAPK pathway is activated by TNF-&#x003b1; in fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Vietor1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and inflammatory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Winston1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. TNF-&#x003b1; is shown to increase granulosa cells proliferation by activating stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun-NH2-teminal kinase signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Son1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, evidences from Sippy et al. indicate that induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by TNF-&#x003b1; is dependent on protein kinase C in human retinal pigment epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Sippy1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. In present study, we found that the amount of active ERK1/2 was significantly increased in OECs treated with reactive astrocyte-conditioned medium or recombinant TNF-&#x003b1;, which suggested that TNF-&#x003b1; binding to TNFR1 led to activation of ERK1/2 in OECs. PD98059 selectively inhibits the dual-specificity kinase MEK, which phosphorylates and activates MAPK. Pretreating OECs with this pharmacological inhibitor blocked the activation of ERK1/2 and greatly attenuated the migration of these cells induced by reactive astrocyte-conditioned medium, glial scar tissue, or recombinant TNF-&#x003b1;. All these findings suggested that activation of ERK1/2 MAPK was a crucial event in TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;directed migration of OECs.</p><p>There were controversial reports regarding migration of transplanted OECs in the injured spinal cord. Some studies show that OECs readily coexist with reactive astrocytes and are able to pass through this barrier when injected at the time of injury and after a delay, following scar formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Li1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Andrews1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Lakatos1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Lakatos2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-RamonCueto4">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-vandenPol1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Reactive astrocytes, present in all type of injured cases do not appear to limit the movement of OECs even if the glial scar had already formed prior to OEC implantation. However, data from other study demonstrate that the motility of grafted OECs in damaged CNS is limited, with no OECs found migrating into glial scar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Lu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. It is likely that the difference in the injection site and the time for transplantation may account for the conflicting reports about OECs migration in damaged spinal cord. As shown in the present study, after SCI, a linear concentration gradient of TNF-&#x003b1; is formed in the glial scar. If OECs are transplanted in a site far away from lesion centre, the concentration of TNF-&#x003b1; may be too low to attract OECs migrating into glial scar. Therefore,an appropriate injection site is crucial for the grafted OECs to response to signals or factors from glial scar. Previous studies demonstrated that the functional improvement was achieved by delayed transplantation of OECs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Lu2">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-KeyvanFouladi1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008141-Plant1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, our data showed that the chemoattractive activity of glial scar tissue on OECs migration is time-dependent, with a maximal activity at 7 days after SCI. This finding may be beneficial for guiding the selection of time point for OECs transplantation after SCI.</p><p>In summary, our study provide the first evidence that TNF-&#x003b1; released by reactive astrocytes attracts OECs migration. This work suggests a molecular mechanism underlying OECs migration into glial scar and indicates a novel function of reactive astrocytes in OECs-based treatment for CNS injury.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Professor Wutian Wu from University of Hong Kong for providing us GFP-transgenic rats.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0008141-Cervos1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cervos</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Lafuente</surname><given-names>JV</given-names></name></person-group><year>1991</year><article-title>Traumatic brain injuries: structural changes.</article-title><source>J Neurol Sci</source><volume>103</volume><issue>Suppl</issue><fpage>S3</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1940963</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0008141-Silver1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Silver</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name></person-group><year>2004</year><article-title>Regeneration beyond the glial scar.</article-title><source>Nat Rev Neurosci</source><volume>5</volume><fpage>146</fpage><lpage>156</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14735117</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0008141-Yiu1"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yiu</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>ZG</given-names></name></person-group><year>2006</year><article-title>Glial inhibition of CNS axon regeneration.
