Here, we report that PINK1 exists as a dimer in mitochondrial protein complexes that co-migrate with respiratory chain complexes in sucrose gradients. PARK6 related mutations do not affect this dimerization and its associated complexes. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture systems, we found that mutant PINK1 or PINK1 knock-down caused deficits in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Furthermore, proteasome function is impaired with a loss of PINK1. Importantly, these deficits are accompanied by increased &#x003b1;-synclein aggregation. Our results indicate that it will be important to delineate the relationship between mitochondrial functional deficits, proteasome dysfunction and &#x003b1;-synclein aggregation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with pathological hallmarks of dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and cytoplasmic inclusion Lewy bodies that contain mainly &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregates.

V5, Flag, and GFP tag were each fused to a wild type PINK1, L347P-PINK1, E417G-PINK1 and Del-245-PINK1. All combinations of the above constructs were transfected in HEK293 cells for co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. Co-transfection of PINK1-V5 with PINK1-Flag followed by pull-down of the protein with the anti-Flag antibody and detection by WB with the anti-V5 antibody showed that wild type PINK1 protein exist as a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004597-g003"><bold>Figure 3A, left panel</bold></xref>). The same results were obtained in a reverse direction when the protein was pulled-down with anti-V5 antibody and detected with anti-Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004597-g003"><bold>Figure 3A, middle panel</bold></xref>). Co-transfection of PINK1-GFP with PINK1-V5, followed by IP with anti-GFP antibody and detection of PINK1 with anti-V5 antibody also proved the dimerization of PINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004597-g003"><bold>Figure 3A, right panel</bold></xref>).

We have demonstrated that mutant PINK1 or loss of PINK1 cause deficits in respiration and ATP synthesis. Similar and yet different observations were made in other systems. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mitochondrial structural defect accompanied by reduced ATP content were reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Clark1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-ParkJ1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>; Additionally, complex I and II driven respiration deficits were also detected in mice, though surprisingly, this was in the absence of any ATP deficit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Gautier1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. While the molecular details need to be elucidated, it is likely that PINK1 mediated defects are caused by changes in the phosphorylation states of ETC Complexes. In support of this notion, it is known that several subunits of mitochondrial ETC Complexes are phospho-proteins, and their activity can be regulated via PINK1 mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Pagliarini1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Reinders1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is important to note that PINK1-induced deficit in ETC and subsequent cellular dysfunctions are similar to those induced by rotenone toxicity in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Betarbet2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Pharmacological inhibition of the ETC, particularly Complex I, result in PD-like phenotypes, but how these models reflect actual PD pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Our results offer a possible link between specific mitochondrial dysfunctions and cellular abnormalities that are highly relevant to PD.</p><p>We found that proteasome function is impaired by mutant or reduced amounts of PINK1. The proteasome is one of the major pathways for protein degradation. Parkin, the disease gene for PARK2 type of PD, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase. One of Parkin's proposed roles is the proteasomal degradation of its protein substrates. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it was shown that Parkin and PINK1 have a genetic interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-ParkJ1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Clark2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. It will be interesting to investigate if the interaction between Parkin and PINK1 occurs in mitochondria, and whether it affects mitochondrial function.</p><p>Our results identified concomitant deficits in mitochondrial bioenergetics, proteasomal activity, and &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregation. Are they consequential to each other or independent events? We postulate that since PINK1 is predominantly localized in mitochondria, the primary pathogenic event is likely to be in the same place. The ATP deficit is a potential link between mitochondrial abnormality and proteasome deficit, although proteasome deficit could also be caused by other mechanisms such as abnormal post-translational modification including phosphorylation, assembly and targeting, etc. &#x003b1;-synuclein is known to be a target of proteasome degradation in the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Bennett1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Webb1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregation could be the consequence of proteasome dysfunction. In addition, since &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregation has been shown to affect proteasome function directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Chen1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, it is tempting to speculate a vicious cycle of proteasomal dysfunction and &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregation, although further experimental data are needed to support this hypothesis.</p><p>A common theme in neurodegeneration is that for any given disease-causing mutant protein, a large number of interwoven cellular dysfunctions have been discovered. Our observations start to unravel a subset of PINK1 pathogenic processes, and will certainly lead to other highly relevant pathways. For example, deficits in respiratory complexes identified in our experiments, in addition to bioenergetic impairment, may also lead to increased oxidative stress, as was shown in rotenone models and other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Betarbet2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Hoepken1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the ATP deficit is likely to have a much wider negative impact on many cellular functions in addition to proteasome activity. Clearly, it will be important to further assess as many mitochondrial and other cellular functions as possible to dissect the full spectrum of PINK1 pathogenesis. As this manuscript was reviewed, Gautier et al reported respiration deficit in the PINK1 knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004597-Gautier1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data, not only show similar decrease in respiration, but also pointed out the downstream deleterious consequence of this deficit, such as decrease in ATP synthesis rate, proteasomal deficit, and &#x003b1;-synuclein accumulation. Therefore, our results provide a framework for PINK1 mediated pathogenesis, upon which future studies can be designed and pursued.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
