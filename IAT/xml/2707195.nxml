(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b4;) is a regulator of lipid metabolism and has been shown to induce fatty acid oxidation (FAO). PPAR&#x003b4; transgenic and knock-out mice indicate an involvement of PPAR&#x003b4; in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity; however, the precise mechanisms by which PPAR&#x003b4; regulates these pathways in skeletal muscle remain unclear. In this study, we determined the effect of selective PPAR&#x003b4; agonism with the synthetic ligand, GW501516, on FAO and mitochondrial gene expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results show that activation of PPAR&#x003b4; by GW501516 led to a robust increase in mRNA levels of key lipid metabolism genes. Mitochondrial gene expression and function were not induced under the same conditions. Additionally, the activation of <italic>Pdk4</italic> transcription by PPAR&#x003b4; was coactivated by PGC-1&#x003b1;. PGC-1&#x003b1;, but not PGC-1&#x003b2;, was essential for full activation of <italic>Cpt-1b</italic> and <italic>Pdk4</italic> gene expression via PPAR&#x003b4; agonism. Furthermore, the induction of FAO by PPAR&#x003b4; agonism was completely abolished in the absence of both PGC-1&#x003b1; and PGC-1&#x003b2;. Conversely, PGC-1&#x003b1;-driven FAO was independent of PPAR&#x003b4;. Neither GW501516 treatment nor knockdown of PPAR&#x003b4; affects PGC-1&#x003b1;-induced mitochondrial gene expression in primary myotubes. These results demonstrate that pharmacological activation of PPAR&#x003b4; induces FAO via PGC-1&#x003b1;. However, PPAR&#x003b4; agonism does not induce mitochondrial gene expression and function. PGC-1&#x003b1;-induced FAO and mitochondrial biogenesis appear to be independent of PPAR&#x003b4;.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> are ligand-modulated transcription factors that form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Certain PPARs regulate transcription in response to fatty acids and are potential therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Three PPAR family members have been identified. PPAR&#x003b1; is primarily expressed in the liver but also in heart, kidney, and brown fat, where it regulates fatty acid catabolism. PPAR&#x003b3; is highly expressed in adipose tissue and is a key regulator of adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. The expression of PPAR&#x003b4; is more ubiquitous, with relatively high levels in metabolically active tissues, such as muscle, liver, and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Selective activation of PPAR&#x003b4; by agonists has been shown to improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in mouse models of obesity and insulin resistance. These effects are mainly attributed to the agonists' capacity to activate fatty acid transport and oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In addition, recent reports suggest that activation of PPAR&#x003b4; increases mitochondrial gene expression and function. The strongest evidence stems from the muscle-specific VP16-PPAR&#x003b4; transgenic mice, in which a constitutively active fusion protein is overexpressed specifically in the muscle using the skeletal &#x003b1;-actin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). These mice exhibit enhanced mitochondrial gene expression in association with a fiber type switch from fast glycolytic type II fibers to slow oxidative type I fibers. Type I fibers utilize fatty acids as their main fuel and are more fatigue resistant. Concordantly, PPAR&#x003b4; transgenic mice display enhanced exercise endurance when compared with the wild-type mice. However, these studies were done with a PPAR&#x003b4; fusion protein, so it is not yet clear to what extent those results represent the physiological function of the native PPAR&#x003b4; protein.</p><p>A mouse model overexpressing the native PPAR&#x003b4; in muscle was also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). These mice exhibit a much milder phenotype with respect to mitochondrial oxidative capacity when compared with the VP16-PPAR&#x003b4; mice. Nevertheless, overexpression of the native PPAR&#x003b4; increased the percentage of oxidative fibers that are succinate dehydrogenase-positive in tibialis anterior muscle, correlating with an increase in citrate synthase (CS) and &#x003b2;-hydroxy-CoA dehydrogenase activities.</p><p>PGC-1&#x003b1; (PPAR&#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1;) and PGC-1&#x003b2; are important physiological transcriptional regulators of oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1&#x003b1; is induced in a tissue-specific manner under conditions such as cold, fasting, and exercise. It promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative capacity, and FAO by increasing the expression and activation of various transcription factors, including mitochondrial transcription factor A, nuclear respiration factor 1 and 2, PPARs, and ERR&#x003b1; (estrogen-related receptor &#x003b1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The PGC-1&#x003b1; knock-out (KO) mice display reduced mitochondrial function and oxidative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), whereas overexpression of PGC-1&#x003b1; increases both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Interestingly, PGC-1&#x003b1; expression was not increased in muscle from either the VP16-PPAR&#x003b4; transgenic mice or the native PPAR&#x003b4; transgenic mice, leading to the assumption that PPAR&#x003b4; might act downstream or independent of PGC-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Schuler <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) reported that the muscle-specific PPAR&#x003b4; KO mice have reduced oxidative capacity and mitochondrial gene expression in muscle. In contrast to the findings in the PPAR&#x003b4; transgenic mouse models, the expression levels of PGC-1&#x003b1; and mitochondrial transcription factor A were reduced in the PPAR&#x003b4; KO muscles. Thus, the authors suggested that PPAR&#x003b4; acts upstream of PGC-1&#x003b1; and induces PGC-1&#x003b1; expression in muscle.</p><p>Genetic mouse models are very useful but have their limitations with respect to the prediction of pharmacological effects. Although activation of PPAR&#x003b4; by agonists, such as GW501516, has been shown to improve glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, the impact on mitochondrial biogenesis and function is not well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In addition, the underlying molecular mechanisms of PPAR&#x003b4; activation on lipid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative capacity are not fully understood based on the phenotyping results obtained from the PPAR&#x003b4; transgenic and KO mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Given the mitochondrial phenotypes of the PPAR&#x003b4; mouse models, it is tempting to speculate that pharmacological activation of PPAR&#x003b4; exerts beneficial effects on obesity and insulin resistance in a way that mimics what is happening during physical exercise. We therefore investigated first whether pharmacological activation of the endogenous PPAR&#x003b4; induces mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances mitochondrial function in muscle. Second, we used genetic tools to investigate the mechanisms of PPAR&#x003b4; in regulating energy metabolism, specifically the interdependence of PPAR&#x003b4; and PGC-1 transcriptional coactivators in the regulation of FAO and mitochondrial gene expression and function.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Primary Mouse Myoblast Isolation and Differentiation</title><p>Primary muscle cells were isolated from 2&#x02013;3-week-old FVB mice and the PGC-1&#x003b1; wild-type and knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

To ensure that effects are PPAR&#x003b4;-dependent, we first established experimental conditions in which GW501516-induced effects could only be observed in the presence of PPAR&#x003b4; in the muscle cells. To accomplish this, adenovirus-mediated knockdown of PPAR&#x003b4; was performed in primary muscle cells using two shRNAs designed specifically against PPAR&#x003b4;. The mRNA level of PPAR&#x003b4; was reduced 80% in the cells transduced with the adenoviral PPAR&#x003b4; shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). GW501516 treatment resulted in a robust activation of several PPAR&#x003b4; target genes involved in the FAO pathway and uncoupling, such as CPT1b (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b), which catalyzes the esterification of acyl-CoA to form acyl-carnitine, the rate-limiting step of mitochondrial FAO; PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4), which plays an important role in switching the fuel source from glucose to fatty acids by inactivating pyruvate dehydrogenase; and UCP3 (uncoupling protein 3), which induces FAO <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The induction of the mRNA expression of these genes was completely abolished when PPAR&#x003b4; expression was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). Consistent with the mRNA expression, the protein levels of PDK4 and UCP3 were also increased with GW501516 treatment, and this induction was blocked following knockdown of PPAR&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>). Correlating with the induction of gene expression in the FAO pathway, GW501516 treatment increased palmitate oxidation rates, which were completely prevented with the knockdown of PPAR&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). These results demonstrate that the GW501516-induced effects on gene expression and FAO rate are PPAR&#x003b4;-dependent.

To determine whether GW501516 treatment has an effect on muscle PPAR&#x003b4; target genes and mitochondrial gene expression in these mice, the mRNA levels of CPT1b, PDK4, and UCP3 were measured in both tibialis anterior and quadriceps muscles. Consistent with results from the primary mouse myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>), mRNA levels of these genes were significantly increased in both muscles in a dose-dependent manner with the GW501516 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). In contrast, the mRNA levels of PGC-1&#x003b1;, PGC-1&#x003b2;, cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, Cox5a, and IDH3&#x003b1; were not increased in either of the muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>D</italic>). VP16-PPAR&#x003b4; mice exhibited a fiber type switch from glycolytic to more oxidative fibers concurrent with the up-regulation of mitochondrial genes. To determine whether there was any fiber type conversion induced by the GW501516 treatment, the mRNA expression levels of several myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms (MHCI, -IIa, -IId/x, and -IIb) were measured in the muscles from the mice treated with either vehicle or 10 or 30 mg/kg GW501516 for 3 weeks. MHCI is preferentially expressed in the slow twitch oxidative type I fiber, whereas MHCIIa, -IId/x, and -IIb are preferentially expressed in the fast twitch type II fibers, with the former being more oxidative and latter being more glycolytic. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>E</italic>, the expression of these MHC isoforms was not altered by the GW501516 treatment at either 10 or 30 mg/kg, indicating that there was no fiber type switch in these mice. Chronic administration of GW501516 at 10 mg/kg was reported to cause hepatomegaly in mice previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In our study, we did not observe hepatomegaly in the <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice when they were dosed with 10 and 30 mg/kg GW501516 for 3 weeks. Nevertheless, we carried out another study where the <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice were dosed with 3 mg/kg for 3 weeks. The fasted blood glucose was significantly lower in the GW501516-treated mice compared with the control (supplemental Fig. 1). The expression levels of <italic>Pdk4</italic> and <italic>Ucp3</italic> in muscle were significantly increased by the treatment, but there was no change in the expression of <italic>Pgc-1</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>Err</italic>&#x003b1;, and the mitochondrial genes, cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, <italic>Idh3a</italic>, and <italic>Cox5a</italic> (supplemental Fig. 1), which is similar to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>. We also investigated the effect of GW501516 on lipid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative capacity in the lean mice. Both the mRNA and protein levels of PKD4 and UCP3 were significantly increased by the GW501516 treatment in the gastrocnemius muscle in the lean mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). However, the mRNA expression of PGC-1&#x003b1;, PGC-1&#x003b2;, ERR&#x003b1;, cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, IDH3&#x003b1;, and Cox5a was not increased by the GW501516 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). The protein levels of CoxI and CoxIV were also not increased by GW501516 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>). CS activity was not altered in gastrocnemius cell lysates from the GW501516-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>D</italic>). The mRNA expression of MHCI, -IIa, -IId/x, and -IIb was not altered by the GW501516 treatment, indicating that there was no fiber type conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>E</italic>). These results are similar to the findings in the <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Taken together, pharmacological activation of PPAR&#x003b4; with GW501516 improved glucose homeostasis and increased the expression of PKD4, CPT-1b, and UCP3.

To compare the effect of GW501516 on the expression of the PPAR&#x003b4; target genes, both PGC-1&#x003b1; WT and KO cells were treated with either DMSO or GW501516. The mRNA and protein levels of PPAR&#x003b4; target genes as well as FAO rates were determined. PDK4 and UCP3 mRNA levels were comparable in the PGC-1&#x003b1; WT and KO cells, whereas CPT-1b mRNA level was reduced in the KO cells without the GW501516 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>). The mRNA levels of these three genes were induced in both WT and PGC-1&#x003b1; null cells; however, the expression levels of <italic>Cpt-1b</italic> and <italic>Pdk4</italic> were significant lower in the PGC-1&#x003b1; null cells compared with the WT cells upon stimulation with GW501516 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>). The mRNA expression level of UCP3 was comparable with the GW501516 treatment in both WT and KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>), suggesting that the induction of UCP3 by GW501516 was independent of PGC-1&#x003b1;.

Palmitate oxidation with the GW501516 treatment was 30% lower in the PGC-1&#x003b1; KO muscle cells compared with the WT controls, indicating that loss of PGC-1&#x003b1; impairs PPAR&#x003b4;-induced FAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>E</italic>).

However, PGC-1&#x003b1; was still able to induce FAO, to a lesser extent, in the cells lacking these two proteins, suggesting that other factor(s) might mediate PGC-1&#x003b1;-induced FAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). PPAR&#x003b4; is a conceivable candidate, since it interacts with PGC-1&#x003b1;, and its transcriptional activity is enhanced by PGC-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>). To determine whether PPAR&#x003b4; contributes to the regulation of FAO mediated by PGC-1&#x003b1;, primary myotubes were co-transduced with an adenovirus expressing PGC-1&#x003b1; and a PPAR&#x003b4; shRNA to knock down PPAR&#x003b4; expression. PGC-1&#x003b1; protein levels were elevated in the cells transduced with the PGC-1&#x003b1; adenovirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>), whereas PPAR&#x003b4; mRNA levels were markedly reduced in the cells transduced with the PPAR&#x003b4; shRNA adenovirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>). Overexpression of PGC-1&#x003b1; increased the mRNA levels of the PPAR&#x003b4; target genes <italic>Cpt-1b</italic> and <italic>Pdk4</italic> to a similar extent at both the mRNA and protein levels in the PPAR&#x003b4; knockdown cells compared with the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). The FAO rate was increased by PGC-1&#x003b1; overexpression, and this induction was not attenuated when PPAR&#x003b4; was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>E</italic>). PGC-1&#x003b1; overexpression led to a robust increase in the expression of <italic>Err</italic>&#x003b1;, cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, <italic>Cox5a</italic>, and <italic>Idh3</italic>&#x003b1; mRNA, suggesting that there is an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>F</italic>). This induction was modestly but significantly reduced when PPAR&#x003b4; was knocked down. However, the protein levels of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, CoxI, and CoxIV as well as CS activity were not affected by PPAR&#x003b4; knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>G</italic>). Thus, knockdown of PPAR&#x003b4; did not significantly affect the ability of PGC-1&#x003b1; to increase fat oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>D</italic> showed that PPAR&#x003b4; agonism did not enhance PGC-1&#x003b1;-induced mitochondrial gene expression.

As expected, activation of PPAR&#x003b4; with GW501516 resulted in a robust activation of genes involved in lipid metabolism (CPT-1b, PDK4, and UCP3) <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as increased FAO rate in primary muscle cells. However, PPAR&#x003b4; agonism failed to increase mitochondrial gene expression and function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Therefore, the effects of pharmacological activation of the endogenous PPAR&#x003b4; do not fully recapitulate the effects observed in the VP16-PPAR&#x003b4; transgenic mouse or the muscle-specific PPAR&#x003b4; KO mouse model, in which mitochondrial biogenesis was strongly induced or decreased, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In addition, GW501516 treatment did not cause a fiber type switch, as it has been seen in the VP16-PPAR&#x003b4; transgenic and muscle-specific PPAR&#x003b4; mouse model and could be developmentally regulated. Despite the lack of increased mitochondrial function, activation of PPAR&#x003b4; improved glucose homeostasis in the obese and insulin-resistant <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), confirming its potency in ameliorating metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). These data suggest that the effects of PPAR&#x003b4; activity on glucose homeostasis are most likely mediated by increased lipid oxidation rates or other not yet known PPAR&#x003b4; effects, which are not dependent on an increase in muscle mitochondrial gene expression.</p><p>We also investigated the molecular mechanisms by which activation of PPAR&#x003b4; regulates lipid metabolism. PGC-1&#x003b1; has been shown to enhance the transcriptional activity of PPARs in luciferase assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, it was not known to what extent this coactivation is essential for the action of PPAR&#x003b4; on endogenous target gene expression. Our data revealed that PGC-1&#x003b1;, but not PGC-1&#x003b2;, was required for the full activation of <italic>Cpt-1b</italic> and <italic>Pdk4</italic> by PPAR&#x003b4; (). Since PPAR&#x003b4; mRNA levels were not altered in the PGC-1&#x003b1; KO primary myotubes or in the muscle of either the PGC-1&#x003b1; KO mice or the MCK-PGC-1&#x003b1; transgenic mice,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref> it is unlikely that PGC-1&#x003b1; regulates PPAR&#x003b4; expression directly. Thus, the impact of PGC-1&#x003b1; on PPAR&#x003b4;-mediated effects is most likely through coactivation of this receptor. This is supported by the synergistic action of PGC-1&#x003b1; and GW501516 on these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). In addition, our data show that PGC-1&#x003b1; directly coactivates the <italic>Pdk4</italic> promoter via PPAR&#x003b4; in a ligand-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>). Others had reported a similar effect of PGC-1&#x003b1; on the <italic>Cpt-1b</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Interestingly, UCP3 appears to be a PPAR&#x003b4;-specific target gene whose expression was induced by PPAR&#x003b4; agonism in a PGC-1&#x003b1;-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>We further investigated the roles of PGC-1 coactivators in mediating FAO induced by GW501516. Deletion of PGC-1&#x003b1;, but not PGC-1&#x003b2;, significantly reduced the induction of FAO rate induced by GW501516 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Surprisingly, GW-induced fat oxidation was completed abolished in the absence of both PGC-1&#x003b1; and PGC-1&#x003b2; proteins despite an induction of <italic>Cpt-1b</italic>, <italic>Pdk4</italic>, and <italic>Ucp3</italic> expression comparable with the PGC-1&#x003b1; KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). We believe that a strong reduction of mitochondrial function in the absence of both PGC-1 coactivators might contribute to this. Under normal conditions where PGC-1 proteins are expressed, activation of PPAR&#x003b4; triggers an increase in fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation through up-regulation of the key FAO target genes. PGC-1&#x003b1; enhances the action of PPAR&#x003b4; on <italic>Cpt-1b</italic> and <italic>Pdk4</italic> in a PPAR&#x003b4; ligand-dependent manner. In addition, PGC-1 proteins are essential to maintain mitochondrial gene expression, including genes involved in lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle to ensure the proper function of mitochondria. The final product of &#x003b2;-oxidation is metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which yields reducing agents that are subsequently oxidized in the ETC to generate ATP in the functional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>A</italic>). In the absence of PGC-1 proteins, PPAR&#x003b4; activation can still increase the expression of its target genes to a certain extent. However, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, such as tricarboxylic acid cycle and ETC activities, is discordantly reduced, which in turn hinders an increase in fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>B</italic>). Similarly, Koves <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) suggested that high lipid supply, under conditions of low PGC-1&#x003b1;, could provoke a disconnection between mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Our data support the hypothesis that PGC-1&#x003b1; furnishes the mitochondria to cope with high lipid load by coordinately regulating fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and electron transport chain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9.</label><caption><p><bold>A proposed model by which PGC-1 coactivators and PPAR&#x003b4; regulate FAO.</bold><italic>A</italic>, in the presence of PGC-1 coactivators, the mitochondria are furnished with a functional &#x003b2;-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle (<italic>TCA</italic>), and electron transport chain (<italic>ETC</italic>). PGC-1&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b4; activate <italic>Cpt-1b</italic> and <italic>Pdk4</italic> genes synergistically in a ligand-dependent manner, which results in an increase in fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation. The fatty acids are completely oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub> to generate ATP in the functional mitochondria. <italic>B</italic>, in the absence of PGC-1 coactivators, PPAR&#x003b4;-driven <italic>Pdk4</italic> and <italic>Cpt-1b</italic> gene expression is reduced due to a lack of coactivation by PGC-1&#x003b1;. Other genes important for &#x003b2;-oxidation and components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and ETC are markedly decreased in the absence of PGC-1s, which in turn may hinder fat oxidation mediated by PPAR&#x003b4; agonism.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0320981790009"/></fig><p>Although PGC-1&#x003b1; is able to coactivate PPAR&#x003b4; on the <italic>Cpt-1b</italic> and <italic>Pdk4</italic> genes, PPAR&#x003b4; does not seem to be essential for PGC-1&#x003b1;-mediated gene expression, including <italic>Cpt-1b</italic>, <italic>Pdk4</italic>, and mitochondrial genes. Knockdown of PPAR&#x003b4; did not affect the transcriptional program induced by PGC-1&#x003b1;; nor did it reduce PGC-1&#x003b1;-mediated mitochondrial function in primary myotubes. Our results indicate that PGC-1&#x003b1; does not require the presence of PPAR&#x003b4; to activate mitochondrial biogenesis, which is most likely mediated through ERR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our study shows that activation of the endogenous PPAR&#x003b4; using a synthetic ligand increased lipid oxidation and improved glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. However, PPAR&#x003b4; agonism failed to induce mitochondrial gene expression and function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, which was confirmed by another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) published during the revision of this paper. In addition, PGC-1&#x003b1; coactivates PDK4 transcription via PPAR&#x003b4; in a ligand-dependent manner. PGC-1&#x003b1; is required for full activation of FAO by PPAR&#x003b4; in muscle cells. Furthermore, both PGC-1&#x003b1; and PGC-1&#x003b2; are essential for PPAR&#x003b4;-driven fat oxidation. We hypothesize that PGC-1&#x003b1; and PGC-1&#x003b2; provide a functional mitochondrial environment to allow an increased FAO rate through activation of PPAR&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). Conversely, PGC-1&#x003b1;-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty oxidation appear to be independent of PPAR&#x003b4;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_28_18624__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M109.008797_Supplementary_Figure_FINAL.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><label><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></label><p>The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.008797/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Fig. 1.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="FN3"><label>3</label><p>S.
