Ultimately, their success will depend on the development of efficient delivery systems. We show here that a chimeric tetracycline- controlled transcription factor, encompassing the Tet repressor (TetR) from the tetracycline-resistance operon (<italic>tet</italic> from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> transposon Tn<italic>10</italic>) and a cell membrane transducing peptide, is able to regulate transcription from a tetracycline responsive promoter (pCMV2x<italic>tet</italic>O<sub>2</sub>). When added directly to cultured cells, TetR fused to the full-length Antennapedia homeodomain (AntpHD) from <italic>Drosophila</italic> (TetRAntp), was able to selectively repress transcription in cells transiently transfected with a tetracycline-regulated reporter transcription unit. Moreover, TetRAntp could repress expression of a tetracycline responsive reporter transcription unit stably integrated into the genome of HeLa cells, demonstrating the possibility of manipulating endogenous gene expression by cell-permeable transcription factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Engineered transcription factors are powerful tools for manipulating the expression of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c5">5</xref>). Regulation of gene expression at the level of transcription has great potential for basic research, drug target validation and therapy. Progress in the understanding of structural and functional relationships between DNA and primary amino acid sequences in zinc finger and leucine zipper transcription factors, enables the design of customised transcription factors with the ability to bind DNA in the proximity of a target gene. It is anticipated that these transcription factors could find applications in fields of great medical importance, such as in tumour therapy, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, or in pathological conditions where there is a need to provide cytokines, hormones or growth factors in a temporal and spatial regulated manner.</p><p>Delivery of functional transcription regulators into cells and organisms represents a major bottleneck in exploiting transcription factor technology. Artificial transcription factors of limited molecular size can be delivered by electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c6">6</xref>) or by cationic liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c7">7</xref>), although these methods lead to high cell mortality and cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c8">8</xref>). Cationic lipids are commonly used to deliver DNA and have been shown recently to introduce protein-based transcription factors directly into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c9">9</xref>). Despite efficient delivery, the use of cationic lipids to deliver proteins may be restricted to <italic>in vitro</italic> applications due to large complex size and failure to work in the presence of serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Viral vectors have also been successfully employed to deliver engineered transcription factors both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c5">5</xref>). Viral vectors are very efficient and versatile; however, their use for gene delivery <italic>in vivo</italic> has generated some controversy due to their toxicity and immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c8">8</xref>), as well as the risks associated with recombination and integration within the host genome. Furthermore, constitutive regulation of a target gene is not always desirable and certain cells appear unable to tolerate the stable expression of potent, unregulated transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c4">4</xref>). These issues have been addressed by placing the expression of the transcription factor under chemical control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c1">1</xref>) or by directly regulating transcription factor activity using small-molecule inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c4">4</xref>).</p><p>As an alternative to current systems, transcription factors could also be delivered into target cells as recombinant proteins linked to a protein transduction domain (PTD). Protein transduction technology is based on initial observations that the Tat protein from HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c11">11</xref>) and the Antennapedia homeodomain (AntpHD) from <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c12">12</xref>) can enter cells when added to the culture media. A number of peptide sequences that translocate across cell membranes have since been identified, many of which were shown to deliver a wide range of peptide and protein cargoes <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c14">14</xref>). For example, both a PTD sequence derived from the Kaposi fibroblast growth factor and the Tat PTD can mediate delivery of Cre recombinase, inducing recombination of LoxP-flanked target sites in a temporally regulated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c16">16</xref>). The herpes simplex virus protein VP22 has been reported to deliver T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) to cultured cells, inducing dose-dependent expression of a <italic>luciferase</italic> reporter gene under the control of the T7 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c17">17</xref>).</p><p>A major advantage of PTDs is their apparent versatility with respect to the range of cell types that can be transduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c14">14</xref>). This includes certain populations of fragile mammalian nerve cells and quiescent primary lymphocytes, which were refractory to electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c19">19</xref>).</p><p>Here we describe the use of the AntpHD to deliver the tetracycline repressor (TetR) to regulate a tetracycline responsive transcription unit in a temporally regulated and reversible manner. In the absence of tetracycline, TetR represses transcription from a hybrid human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) major immediate-early promoter engineered to contain two <italic>tet</italic> operator sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c20">20</xref>). Transcription is then derepressed when the inducer, tetracycline, is added to the cells. Using this system we show regulation of transcription of transiently expressed and stably integrated transgenes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>To generate pcDNA6/TRAntp, the <italic>antp</italic> homeobox was amplified by PCR from the template pSECTAG2 (C.J.Ingham, unpublished) and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen) using an EcoRI restriction site at the C-terminus of the <italic>tet</italic>R coding sequence.

The vector pDS56&#x0002a;-6xHis allowed expression of recombinant TetR proteins containing a six histidine tag at their C-termini. The presence of the histidine tag facilitates purification of recombinant proteins by nickel chelate chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c21">21</xref>).

For standardisation of transfection, cells were also cotransfected with a control plasmid coding for Renilla Luciferase (pRL-SV40). Levels of Firefly Luciferase and Renilla Luciferase were determined using the Dual Reporter Assay System (Promega). In the absence of tetracycline, cotransfection of plasmids encoding for TetR or TetRAntp repressed the tetracycline-regulated promoter 6.4- and 5.7-fold respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f1">1</xref>). In cells cotransfected with the empty pCMV-control plasmid, the ratio Firefly Luciferase to Renilla Luciferase was comparable in the absence or presence of tetracycline. These results demonstrate that in the absence of tetracycline, the ability of TetR to repress a transcription unit containing the <italic>tetO</italic> element was not affected by the presence of the AntpHD sequence fused to the C-terminus of TetR.</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant TetRAntp binds to <italic>tetO</italic> sequences</title><p>Recombinant TetR and TetRAntp proteins, designed to include a C-terminal 6x histidine tag within their sequence, were expressed in bacteria and purified using a Ni-NTA chelating column.

Purified recombinant proteins were analysed by immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f2">2</xref>B) with anti-TetR serum. The results indicated that both TetR and TetRAntp migrated according to their predicted molecular weights of 25 and 31 kDa, respectively.</p><p>The ability of purified TetR and TetRAntp to bind <italic>tetO</italic> sequences was evaluated by electromobility shift assay. Radioactively labelled DNA containing <italic>tetO</italic> sequences from pcDNA4/TO (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f2">2</xref>C) was incubated with purified recombinant TetR or TetRAntp. Our results show that the electrophoretic mobility of labelled oligonucleotide probes containing <italic>tetO</italic> sequences was retarded in the presence of purified TetR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f2">2</xref>D, lanes 3 and 4) and TetRAntp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f2">2</xref>D, lanes 5 and 6) in a tetracycline-dependent manner. Binding of TetR or TetRAntp to <italic>tetO</italic> sequences was diminished by 58.4 and 35.85&#x00025;, respectively, in the presence of tetracycline, confirming the selectivity of the interaction between TetR and operator DNA. In the absence of tetracycline, the amount of probe bound by TetR was greater than that of TetRAntp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f2">2</xref>D, lanes 4 and 6). This may be due to the denaturing and refolding steps involved in the purification of TetRAntp, resulting in loss in biological activity in a fraction of the purified product.</p><p>Two stoichiometric complexes were formed by TetR-DNA binding, possibly corresponding to the occupation of one or two <italic>tet</italic> operator sites by the TetR dimer. The TetRAntp&#x02013;DNA complex migrated slower than the TetR&#x02013;DNA complexes through the non-denaturing gel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f2">2</xref>D). TetRAntp has a higher estimated isoelectric point (8.75) than TetR (6.02), which may explain the low migration and resolution of the TetRAntp&#x02013;DNA complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of transcription by transduced TetRAntp</title><p>As a preliminary step to determine whether TetRAntp could translocate across the cell membrane, the uptake of purified TetRAntp or TetR into HeLa cells was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. TetRAntp, but not TetR was taken up by a high percentage of cells and localised to both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f3">3</xref>).</p><p>Next, purified recombinant TetRAntp or TetR were added directly to the cell culture medium to assess their ability to transduce across the membrane of living cells and regulate a transcription unit containing <italic>tetO</italic> regulatory sites. After 8 h of incubation, cells were washed and cotransfected with a reporter construct, containing the <italic>luciferase</italic> reporter gene under the control of the pCMV2x<italic>tet</italic>O<sub>2</sub> promoter (pGL3B/TO), together with a plasmid containing the Renilla <italic>luciferase</italic> reporter gene (pRL-SV40) as an internal control. Levels of Firefly Luciferase and Renilla Luciferase expression were determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. Levels of Firefly Luciferase were significantly reduced (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) when cells were treated with 5 &#x000b5;g/well of TetRAntp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f4">4</xref>). Firefly Luciferase expression was repressed by 42.4&#x00025; in the absence of tetracycline when compared to tetracycline-treated cells. The incubation of cultured cells with a lower concentration of TetRAntp protein (1 &#x000b5;g/well) did not repress Firefly Luciferase expression. TetR had no effect on Firefly Luciferase levels, even at the highest protein concentration demonstrating that TetRAntp, but not TetR, repressed transcription of a transiently expressed target gene. Accordingly, the AntHD should have conferred to the repressor the ability to cross the cell membrane.</p><p>To examine whether TetRAntp could repress a stably expressed gene, two HeLa cell lines were established by lentiviral infection. These cell lines were designed to stably express either the green fluorescent protein eGFP or &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter genes from the tetracycline-responsive promoter pCMV2x<italic>tetO</italic><sub>2</sub>. To assess the ability of TetR to repress the stably integrated reporter transcription units, cells expressing eGFP (pCMVTO-eGFP) or &#x003b2;-galactosidase (pCMVTO-LacZ) from the pCMV2x<italic>tetO</italic><sub>2</sub> promoter were transfected with a plasmid encoding for TetR (pcDNA6/TR) and grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline. The relative amounts of eGFP transcripts were quantified by northern blot analysis, which showed a 51&#x00025; reduction in transcription 60 h post-transfection in the absence of tetracycline relative to tetracycline treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f5">5</xref>A). A &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter assay was used to quantify &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression 48 h post-transfection in tetracycline treated and non-treated cells. After 48 h, &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was repressed by 46.6&#x00025; in the absence of tetracycline when compared to tetracycline-treated cells (not shown).</p><p>The ability of TetRAntp to repress transcription of stably integrated transgenes in a tetracycline-dependent manner was assessed in both cell lines. HeLa cells stably expressing eGFP (pCMVTO-eGFP) were treated with purified TetRAntp leading to a 31&#x00025; reduction in eGFP expression in the absence of tetracycline, relative to tetracycline-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f5">5</xref>A). No significant reduction in eGFP transcription was detected in control cells treated with purified TetR (not shown) or buffer alone (6 and 5&#x00025; respectively). To test the effect of TetRAntp on &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression, pCMVTO-LacZ cells were grown in the absence or presence of tetracycline and treated three times over a 48 h time period with purified TetRAntp. After incubation with TetRAntp, levels of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity were repressed by 40.9&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.01) in cells grown without tetracycline when compared to tetracycline treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gng152f5">5</xref>B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the addition of recombinant TetRAntp to cultured cells specifically repressed the activity of the target transcription unit.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have assessed whether the fusion of the <italic>tet</italic> repressor sequence to a cell-permeable peptide would allow the development of a novel generation of transcription factors able to regulate promoter activity when added exogenously to target cells. Our data show that TetRAntp could regulate gene expression in a tetracycline dependent manner; reporter gene activity was repressed upon addition of recombinant TetRAntp and derepressed in the presence of tetracycline. This suggests that the suppression of reporter gene expression was the result of the specific activity of TetRAntp on the tetracycline-responsive promoter. Furthermore, transcription was not repressed when purified TetR was added to the cells. All together, these findings indicate that TetRAntp crossed the surface membrane of healthy metabolically active cells, and that changes in transcriptional activity were not the result of non-specific protein uptake by dying cells or cells with compromised membrane structures. The internalisation of a chimeric transactivator lacking a specific PTD sequence has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c9">9</xref>). Internalisation of this protein occurred in a concentration-dependent manner and activated the expression of Luciferase from a transfected reporter plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c9">9</xref>). We cannot rule out the possibility that in our system non-specific cellular uptake of TetR may have occurred. If that were the case, however, the intracellular concentration of TetR was insufficient to repress transcription. Importantly, our data suggest that intracellular concentrations of TetRAntp reached sufficient levels to suppress the transcription of stably integrated transgenes.</p><p>While Penetratin, the 16 amino acid peptide corresponding to the third helix of the AntpHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c25">25</xref>) has been widely used as a PTD, only a handful of reports describe intracellular delivery using the 60 amino acid AntpHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c26">26</xref>). To date, delivery by Penetratin is generally restricted to cargo of 100 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c27">27</xref>) or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c25">25</xref>). In the work described here, the AntpHD was used to transduce a functional transcription factor encompassing 207 amino acids.</p><p>In general, the success of PTD-mediated protein delivery is difficult to predict and may depend on the nature of the protein cargo. This is clearly illustrated in the case of VP22, which has been shown to mediate intercellular trafficking of large proteins such as P53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c28">28</xref>) and Flp recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c17">17</xref>), although attempts to deliver GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c30">30</xref>) or a chimeric transactivator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c9">9</xref>) were unsuccessful. Additionally, cell-type may also play a role in the outcome of PTD delivery, for example the internalisation of the AntpHD is most effective in cells expressing alpha-2,8-polysialic acid on their surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c32">32</xref>). Conflicting reports suggest that the internalisation of HIV-1 Tat protein may or may not require cell surface heparin sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c34">34</xref>), while the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LPR) has been shown to promote efficient uptake of Tat into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c35">35</xref>).</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> protein transduction has been reported using other PTDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c36">36</xref>). Whether the AntpHD can mediate delivery of biologically active proteins without undesirable effects <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be determined. Furthermore, it will be important to determine whether this technology can be applied to the delivery of other classes of transcription factors, such as zinc fingers. The Tat PTD has been shown to enhance cellular uptake of a chimeric transactivator comprised of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the VP16 transactivation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c9">9</xref>). However, Tat-mediated delivery of the chimeric transcription factor was shown to be less efficient than commercial reagents for protein transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c9">9</xref>). Ye <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c9">9</xref>) speculated that the hypothetical protein denaturation and refolding steps involved in Tat-mediated transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c37">37</xref>) may be a problem in the delivery of highly ordered transcriptional regulators.</p><p>The direct delivery of transcriptionally active proteins into cells using PTD technology has a vast number of applications, in both experimental and therapeutic settings. The publication of the human genome, combined with recent advances in transcription factor engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c38">38</xref>), has opened up the possibility of creating designer transcription factors capable of regulating a given gene with high specificity. However, the delivery of artificial transcription factors into cells and organisms is a considerable problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gng152c40">40</xref>). PTD technology may offer an alternative approach to deliver protein-based transcription factors <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gng152f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> AntpHD does not disrupt the activity of TetR.
