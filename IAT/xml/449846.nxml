To investigate whether the mutations in the AID<sup>R</sup>&#x003c8;V<sup>&#x02013;</sup> clone follow a similar distribution, sequence analysis was extended to the promoter region and the J-C intron of the rearranged light chain gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020179-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Although mutations are found close to the promoter and in the intron downstream of the J segments, the peak incidence clearly coincides with the CDR1 and CDR3, which are also preferred sites of gene conversion in DT40 (unpublished data). Approximately half of all point mutations fall within the RGYW (R = A/G; Y = C/T; W = A/T) sequence motif or its complement WRCY (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), known as hotspots of Ig hypermutation in humans and mice.</p><p>It was previously reported that the deletion of <italic>RAD51</italic> paralogs induces Ig hypermutation in DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020179-Sale1">Sale et al. 2001</xref>).

Nevertheless, the mutation rate in the new <italic>XRCC3</italic> mutant was about 2.5-fold lower than in the AID<sup>R</sup>&#x003c8;V<sup>&#x02013;</sup> clone, and there was a clear slow-growth phenotype of the <italic>XRCC3</italic> mutant compared to wild-type DT40 and the AID<sup>R</sup>&#x003c8;V<sup>&#x02013;</sup> clone (unpublished data).</p><p>To identify the mutations responsible for the loss of sIgM expression in the AID<sup>R</sup>&#x003c8;V<sup>&#x02013;</sup> clone, 94 light chain cDNAs from sorted sIgM(&#x02013;) cells were amplified and sequenced. Although one short insertion and five deletions were detected in this collection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020179-t001">Table 1</xref>), 89&#x00025; of the 245 total mutations are single-nucleotide substitutions within the VJ segments and only few mutations were observed in the C segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020179-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Surprisingly, only about 10&#x00025; of the sequences contained a stop codon or a frameshift, suggesting that the lack of sIgM expression is mainly caused by amino acid substitutions that affect the pairing of the Ig light and heavy chain proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Ig Locus Specificity of Hypermutation</title><p>It has been reported that high AID expression in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020179-Yoshikawa1">Yoshikawa et al. 2002</xref>) and B-cell hybridomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020179-Martin1">Martin and Scharff 2002</xref>) leads to frequent mutations in transfected transgenes. To rule out the possibility that the pseudogene deletions had induced a global hypermutator phenotype, the 5&#x02032; ends of the genes encoding the B-cell -specific marker <italic>Bu-1</italic> and the translation elongation factor <italic>EF1&#x003b1;</italic> were sequenced for the AID<sup>R</sup>&#x003c8;V<sup>&#x02013;</sup> clone.

As these changes most likely represent PCR artifacts, this further supports the view that the hypermutations induced by the &#x003c8;V deletions are Ig-locus-specific.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>These results demonstrate that the deletion of the nearby pseudogene donors abolishes Ig gene conversion in DT40 and activates a mutation activity that closely resembles Ig hypermutation. The features shared between this new mutation activity and somatic hypermutation include (1) AID dependence, (2) a predominance of single nucleotide substitutions, (3) distribution of the mutations within the 5&#x02032; transcribed region, (4) a preference for hotspots, and (5) Ig gene specificity. The only differences between the mutation activity induced by loss of &#x003c8;V and Ig hypermutation in vivo are the relative lack of mutations in A/T bases and a predominance of transversion mutations in the &#x003c8;V knockout clones. However, these differences are also seen in hypermutating Epstein Barr virus&#x02013;transformed B-cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020179-Bachl1">Bachl and Wabl 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020179-Faili1">Faili et al. 2002</xref>) and DT40 mutants of <italic>RAD51</italic> paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020179-Sale1">Sale et al. 2001</xref>), indicating that part of the Ig hypermutator activity is missing in transformed B-cell lines. Interestingly, the rate of Ig hypermutation in the AID<sup>R</sup>&#x003c8;V<sup>&#x02013;</sup> clone seems higher than the rate of Ig gene conversion in the DT40<sup>Cre1</sup> progenitor. An explanation for this could be that some conversion tracts are limited to stretches of identical donor and target sequences and thus leave no trace. The ratio of transversion to transition was lower for the AID<sup>R</sup>&#x003c8;V<sup>partial</sup> clone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Although we can only speculate about the cause of this difference, it might be due to the correction of point mutations by mismatch correction of one or more sites in gene conversion tracts.</p><p>The induction of Ig hypermutation by the blockage of Ig gene conversions supports a simple model explaining how hypermutation and recombination are initiated and regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020179-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Initiating the events is a modification of the rearranged V(D)J segment that is either directly or indirectly induced by AID. The default processing of this lesion in the absence of nearby donors or of high homologous recombination activity leads to Ig hypermutation in the form of a single nucleotide substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020179-g006">Figure 6</xref>, right). However, if donor sequences are available, processing of the AID-induced lesion can be divided into a stage before strand exchange, when a shift to Ig hypermutation is still possible, and a stage after strand exchange, when the commitment toward Ig gene conversion has been made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020179-g006">Figure 6</xref>, left). Whereas completion of the first stage requires the participation of the <italic>RAD51</italic> paralogs, the second stage involves other recombination factors, such as RAD54.</p><p>This difference in commitment explains why disruptions of the <italic>RAD51</italic> paralogs not only decrease Ig gene conversion, but also induce Ig hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020179-Sale1">Sale et al. 2001</xref>), whereas disruption of the <italic>RAD54</italic> gene only decreases Ig gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020179-Bezzubova1">Bezzubova et al. 1997</xref>). The model also predicts that low cellular homologous recombination activity prevents Ig gene conversion even in the presence of conversion donors. Such a low homologous recombination activity might be the reason why human and murine B-cells never use Ig gene conversion despite the presence of nearby candidate donors in the form of unrearranged V segments and why chicken germinal center B-cells have shifted the balance from Ig gene conversion to Ig hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020179-Arakawa3">Arakawa et al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>The AID<sup>R</sup> and the &#x003c8;V knockout DT40 clones are a powerful experimental system to address the role of trans-acting factors and cis-acting regulatory sequences for Ig gene conversion and hypermutation. Compared to alternative animal or cell culture systems, it offers the advantages of (1) parallel analysis of Ig gene conversion and hypermutation, (2) conditional AID expression, (3) easy genome modifications by gene targeting, (4) normal cell proliferation and repair proficiency, and (5) Ig locus specificity of hypermutation. The ability to induce gene-specific hypermutation in the DT40 cell line might also find applications in biotechnology. One possibility is to replace the chicken antibody coding regions with their human counterparts and then to simulate antibody affinity maturation from a repertoire that continuously evolves by Ig hypermutation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>DT40<sup>Cre1</sup>, which displays increased Ig gene conversion due to a v-<italic>myb</italic> transgene and contains a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase, has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020179-Arakawa4">Arakawa et al. 2001</xref>).
