While recognition of autoantigens by the B cell receptor (BCR) on self-reactive immature B cells leads to their deletion by apoptosis, foreign, antigen-specific, mature B lymphocytes respond to BCR engagement by clonal expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Increasing evidence suggests that immature and mature B cells are differently adapted to signal transduction via BCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Among the potential mechanisms for regulating this functional dichotomy are differences in the partitioning of BCR signaling components to lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], the expression of B-cell co-receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], basal levels of distal effector molecules (e.g, transcription factors and anti-apoptotic molecules) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and the levels of activation of specific kinases and phosphatases. Immature B cells do not proliferate in response to BCR triggering, but they do mount an abortive attempt to enter the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and, similar to mature B cells, undergo a rapid unfolded protein response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which indicates an adaptation to an increased demand for protein folding. Recently, a model has emerged that suggests that B-cell fate is determined by the balance between survival and death signals initiated through the BCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although both the BCR-induced death of immature B cells and the BCR-induced expansion of conventional mature B cells are critically dependent upon the <italic>de novo </italic>transcription and translation of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], no study to date has investigated the mechanisms for the opposing phenotypes at the transcriptome level. To address this issue systematically, we undertook a genome-wide screen to identify the BCR-regulated transcriptional module and used functional studies to establish <italic>Myc </italic>as a hub of the network that shapes the response to BCR-priming.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice and antibodies</title><p>For transcriptional analysis of the BCR-triggered responses of T<sub>1 </sub>immature and mature B cells, male C57BL/6 mice were studied at 4 weeks (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). Mice with B lineage cell-specific conditional <italic>Myc </italic>inactivation were generated as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. All experiments used background-, age- and sex-matched controls. All mutant mice and their controls were used at an age between 4 and 10 months. Affinity-purified anti-mouse CD16/32, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse B220, PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD23 and APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD93/C1qRp antibodies were purchased from eBioscience, (San Diego, California, USA). Goat F(ab')<sub>2 </sub>anti-mouse IgM, &#x003bc;-chain specific, was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, Pennsylvania, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>B cell purification, flow cytometry and cell culture</title><p>Single-cell suspensions were prepared from isolated spleen. Untouched B cells were recovered by depletion of non-B cells using the B Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The purity of B cells, which was measured by the percentage of B220<sup>+ </sup>cells, was more than 95%. Cells were either used as the total B cell fraction or were pre-incubated with purified anti-CD16/32 to block Fc receptors and further sorted as CD93<sup>+</sup>CD23<sup>- </sup>(T1 immature) and CD93<sup>-</sup>CD23<sup>+ </sup>(mature) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (MoFlo, Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. B cells were cultured at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml in IMDM medium, which was supplemented with 5% FCS, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine and 50 &#x003bc;M &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, in a humidified incubator at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Tests were performed in 96-well plates at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell viability was monitored by the exclusion of 0.4% trypan blue solution and visualized by light microscopy. The extent of apoptosis was assessed by measuring the activities of caspases 3 and 7 using the Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Charbonnieres, France). The cell cycle was analyzed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Phase-contrast microscopy was used to photograph isolated B cells in culture after 48 h of treatment (Olympus 1X70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The levels of secreted IgM in sample supernatants were determined using Mouse IgM ELISA Quantitation Kit (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, Texas, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Microarrays, hybridization and data analysis</title><p>DNA arrays were prepared in house from the NIA Mouse 15K cDNA clone set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Total RNA from sorted T<sub>1 </sub>immature and mature B cells of 10 mice was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France), followed by one round of amplification with the MessageAmp&#x02122; Kit (Ambion ABI, Austin, Texas, USA). The integrity of the RNA samples was verified using agarose gel electrophoresis and the Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent, Massy, France). Amplified RNA was reverse-transcribed using random primers, and aminoallyl-dUTP was incorporated for indirect labeling with Cy3 and Cy5. Each labeled cDNA sample was hybridized to the arrays at least six times using a dye-swap strategy. All samples were hybridized against amplified Universal Mouse Reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, USA). Arrays were scanned with the ScanArray5000 (Packard Instruments, Rungis, France) or Genepix 4000B scanner, and feature extraction was performed with the Genepix Pro 4.0 software (Axon Instruments MDC, Sunnyvale, California, USA). Data analysis, including intensity-dependent Lowess normalization of the raw data, was done with GeneSpring 7.0 software (Agilent, Massy, France). The data are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession number GSE9215). To analyze gene promoters, we used the web-based Genomatix software (Genomatix, Ann Harbor, Michigan, USA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomatix.de/"/>), which is a bioinformatics tool that utilizes a large library of matrix descriptions for known transcription factor binding sites and algorithms to locate matches in DNA sequences. To study how BCR-recruited molecules and their interactions may determine the phenotypic outcome of B cells, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Rewood City, California, USA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com/"/>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which is a knowledge-based software package, was used to identify the putative BCR-regulated functional module.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time PCR and network analysis</title><p>qPCR was performed on total RNA from two independent biological replicates. Samples were processed on an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Austin, Texas, USA) using the SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich, Lyon, France). All qPCR data were generated using <italic>Hprt1 </italic>as a reference (house-keeping) gene. This gene was chosen based on the results of the microarray analysis, which showed no significant variation in the expression of <italic>Hprt1 </italic>among any of the samples tested. We also verified our qPCR data by performing calculations using a second house-keeping gene, <italic>Cox1</italic>, and obtained similar results. Primer sequences are available upon request.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Opposite responses of immature and mature B cells to BCR triggering</title><p>To understand the transcriptional basis for the BCR-regulated sensitivity to the apoptosis of immature B cells versus the proliferative response of mature B cells, we used antibodies to surface IgM to mimic antigen binding by cross-linking the BCR on both cell types <italic>in vitro</italic>. To assure minimal developmental differences between both cell populations, we chose to use freshly isolated splenic transitional immature B cells, as they represent the latest stage of immature B cells and reside in a microenvironment that is closest to the mature follicular compartment. After negative selection of B cells, we used surface expression of CD93 and CD23 as selection markers to sort cells, i.e. the transitional 1 (T1) immature cells were CD93<sup>+</sup>CD23<sup>- </sup>and the mature cells were CD93<sup>-</sup>CD23<sup>+ </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Since these markers do not interact with the BCR, this selection strategy allowed us to avoid uncontrolled triggering of the receptor during sorting. In accordance with previous observations, cross-linking of BCR on freshly isolated cells induced apoptosis of the T1 immature cells and a mitogenic response of the mature B cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The effects of BCR-stimulation on the sorted B cell populations were assayed by ATP content measurements to evaluate the proliferation status of cells, caspase 3/7 activity to measure the extent of apoptosis and trypan blue exclusion to estimate the viability of cells in culture. In addition, phase contrast microscopy showing large clusters of proliferating mature B cells and much smaller clumps of apoptotic immature cells upon BCR stimulation confirmed the results of the above assays. These observations prompted us to determine how as little as the one day of differentiation that separates the two B cell populations in the spleen results in the switch of the BCR-mediated response from death to intense proliferation.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Opposite responses of T1 immature and mature B cells to BCR triggering</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of magnetically separated, untouched B lymphocytes from the spleens of C57BL/6 mice using APC-conjugated CD93-specific and PE-conjugated CD23-specific antibodies.

However, a general analysis of gene functions following BCR triggering at 2 h revealed a substantial difference in the early transcriptional responses of immature and mature B cells. As opposed to immature cells, BCR triggering on mature B cells elicited a strong transcriptional perturbation of genes that regulated biosynthesis, which indicated an adaptation for the upcoming proliferative burst (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). A much less pronounced induction of cell growth-promoting genes in stimulated immature B cells likely reflects their abortive attempt to proliferate, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Taken together, these data demonstrate that, although the immature compartment exhibits a gene expression pattern that is distinct from that of mature B cells, both cell populations respond to BCR triggering with a relatively similar transcriptional program.</p><p>To identify the early genes that discriminate the responses of the two cell types to BCR stimulation, we used two-way ANOVA (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) at the two-hour time point, while taking maturity stage and treatment as two independent variables. This approach allowed us to identify BCR-induced differences in gene expression with high sensitivity and to discriminate them from any transcriptional variations due to the developmental stage of the cells. The analysis identified 24 genes that likely determined the phenotypic outcome of the mature and immature cells upon BCR triggering. As expected, candidate genes from the top of the list in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> have been shown to stimulate cell growth and proliferation, whereas genes from the bottom have been associated with negative signaling. To validate the array data, we confirmed the expression of 23 out of the 24 genes by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) on total RNA isolated from two independent biological replicates (Table <xref

Assuming that co-expressed genes are regulated by the same transcription factors and share common binding sites in their upstream regions on the one hand and that they should respond to BCR signaling on the other hand, we screened the promoter regions of differentially expressed genes at 2 h for common regulatory sequences. For this purpose, a web-based MatInspector software from Genomatix was used to search promoter regions of the five co-clustered genes for known transcription factor binding sites. Interestingly, all five genes shared two types of antibody producing cell-specific binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) One included those that were recognized by the ETS family of transcription factors, such as <italic>Elk1</italic>, which is known to respond to BCR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and the other included binding sites for <italic>Pax5</italic>, which is a key transcription factor that controls B-cell proliferation and differentiation and which has also been linked to BCR stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

These data indicate the putative binding sites and the identity of transcription factors that may be responsible for the BCR-mediated co-regulation of the most critical cell-fate decision-making genes, and it is intriguing that these are the only predicted B cell-specific transcription factor binding sites that are found in the promoters of all five genes.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Gene expression profiles of T1 immature and mature B lymphocytes in response to BCR triggering</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold><italic>k</italic>-means clustering using standard correlations was applied at several <italic>k </italic>values to classify all 2,454 genes (represented by 3,505 probes on the array) that showed differential expression between any sets of samples (see the key on the right).

A survey of cell cycle-regulating genes indicated that this defect in BCR-triggered proliferation was mediated primarily by the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16 and p27 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

Of note, genes with a positive mature versus immature ratio, many of which have previously been demonstrated to favor proliferation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), showed either increased or unaltered expression upon BCR-priming. This is a likely result of an attempt to compensate for the lack of <italic>Myc</italic>-driven mitogenic signaling.

In discriminating self from non-self, the mammalian immune system relies primarily on B cells, which undergo a step-by-step maturation process to attain immune competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Up until the last moments prior to reaching the mature stage, transitional immature B cells still undergo deletion by apoptosis upon antigen recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is thus intriguing to observe that the same signal can engage such contrasting cell fates in two closely related cell types and that the same phenomenon can be observed <italic>in vitro </italic>where culture conditions are also kept the same. Here, we examined the underlying mechanism that leads to these distinct biological responses that are central to the proper functioning of the adaptive immune system.</p><p>Regardless of the relatively solid evidence for the differential signal transduction pathways from the BCR, it has been demonstrated that both immature and mature B cell-responses are dependent upon <italic>de novo </italic>expression of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, only the study by Schories <italic>et al</italic>. investigated BCR-triggered global transcriptional changes that lead to a defined phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This work focused solely on the anti-IgM-induced apoptosis of an immature B-cell line, which makes the interpretation of the results difficult for two reasons. First, the "immortality" of a cell line significantly changes the initial phenotype from a short-lived and death-sensitive primary B cell to a robust and wildly proliferating "lymphoma" cell that exhibits markedly delayed kinetics of BCR-mediated death. Second, this study neglected the fact that BCR signaling can also induce the proliferation of B cells and that minute differences in gene expression may divert the BCR response from apoptosis to proliferation. Several other genome-wide transcriptional analyses of B-cell responses to BCR stimulation have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], but none of these studies considered comparing the opposing phenotypes, which proved to be critically important for the identification of the decision-making genes. For example, these studies have already identified <italic>Ptger4</italic>, <italic>Marcksl1</italic>, <italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Ifrd1 </italic>and <italic>Jun </italic>among the top most differentially expressed genes, but they failed to discriminate them from other significantly regulated genes when their contribution to the studied B-cell phenotype was assigned.</p><p>Therefore, the identification of the critical molecules required a more structured approach to the complex transcriptional programs that are triggered by the BCR. We performed a comparative gene expression profiling of the opposing responses of immature and mature primary B cells to BCR cross-linking, which led us to identify 24 genes that could discriminate the early responses of the two cell types. Two-way ANOVA allowed us to disregard any transcriptional variations that were due to the developmental stage of the cells and to eliminate the genes showing the equivalent regulation by the BCR in immature and mature cells.</p><p>Interestingly, although the identified genes have not been mechanistically associated with BCR signaling before, with the exception of <italic>Myc </italic>and <italic>Plekha2</italic>, their functions described in other cell types largely agreed with the observed changes in expression. Several of the up-regulated genes in mature versus immature B cells have previously been shown to promote proliferation or differentiation in various cells, while <italic>Myc </italic>and <italic>Ptger4 </italic>have also been implicated in the development and homeostasis of B lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In contrast, limited data exist regarding the down-modulated genes. The pro-apoptotic functions of <italic>Tmem23 </italic>and <italic>Jun </italic>have been demonstrated, and <italic>Plekha2 </italic>is speculated to propagate negative signaling in B cells upon BCR ligation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

They have also suggested that <italic>Myc </italic>responsiveness to BCR ligation is developmentally regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, these studies focused mainly on the relationship between <italic>Myc </italic>expression and the negative selection of B cells by apoptosis. Here, we describe <italic>Myc </italic>as a direct regulator of both proliferation and apoptosis upon acute BCR signaling, especially since B cells lacking <italic>Myc </italic>respond very poorly to BCR ligation and are resistant to apoptosis. This is in agreement with a previous study that found 2- to 3-fold reduced numbers of total splenic <italic>Myc</italic>-deficient B cells and an impaired mitogenic response of these cells to stimulation with IL-4 and the anti-CD40 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although <italic>Myc </italic>has long been appreciated as an inhibitor of differentiation in B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], we showed here, for the first time, that the absence of <italic>Myc </italic>alone facilitates their terminal differentiation to antibody-secreting plasma cells.</p><p><italic>Myc </italic>has recently been described as a "hub" gene that controls several cellular processes in many cell types, including B cells, by regulating up to 10 &#x02013; 15% of all genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This vastness of the Myc transcriptional network makes it difficult to disentangle the contribution of Myc to any given cellular phenotype. However, focusing our study on the early transcriptional events of a specific biological process that occurs under defined <italic>in vitro </italic>conditions allowed us to identify a few changes in gene expression, including that of <italic>Myc</italic>, that discriminate between the two opposing cell fates. An independent experiment performed in a <italic>Myc</italic>-deficient background revealed that most of the identified genes (62%; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) are regulated by Myc. This extent of transcriptional control thus far exceeds the estimated 10 &#x02013; 15% of all genes that are thought to be regulated by <italic>Myc </italic>and classifies <italic>Myc </italic>as the hub gene of our network. Among the 21 genes of the network, excluding the RIKEN sequence and <italic>Myc </italic>itself, 9 genes (43%; <italic>Hrb</italic>, <italic>Ifrd</italic>1, <italic>Jun, Nola2</italic>, <italic>Ptdss1</italic>, <italic>Ptger4, Spata13, Stt3b </italic>and <italic>Eif3s1</italic>) were described as part of a <italic>Myc</italic>-network in B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and an additional 2 genes (9.5%; <italic>M6pr </italic>and <italic>Ptdss1</italic>) have been annotated in the <italic>Myc</italic>-database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The remaining 10 genes have never been reported as either direct or indirect targets of Myc. One of the most notable aspects of this network is the link between <italic>Myc </italic>and <italic>Jun</italic>, which seems to play a key role in the regulation of primary B cell-fate in response to BCR engagement. Indeed, ChIP-on-chip data analysis supports <italic>Jun </italic>as a direct target of <italic>Myc </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and as we show here, <italic>Myc </italic>controls the BCR-dependent regulation of <italic>Jun</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data identify the early changes in the transcriptional mechanisms that discriminate between <italic>in vitro </italic>mimicked negative selection by deletion and clonal expansion of B lymphocytes in spleen. The approach we have taken in this study provided a means to identify the decision-making genes in an otherwise complex transcriptional program that is triggered by the BCR. By integrating our data with previous knowledge, we identify a BCR-operated transcriptional network in which <italic>Myc </italic>functions as a master regulator of the growth and differentiation of B cells. Moreover, we showed that a reduced expression of <italic>Myc</italic>, as the most highly connected hub gene, results in a gross phenotypic change and the transcriptional perturbation of several genes in its neighborhood, thus justifying the role of <italic>Myc </italic>as a critical regulator of BCR-triggered life-or-death decisions. Since the wrong choice between life and death of B cells often leads to pathological conditions, such as immunodeficiency, autoimmunity or cancer, a thorough functional analysis of the molecules of the BCR-operated network may help in the design of better therapies for such diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JM, IMR and XG designed the research; JM and PV performed the experiments; JM, VF, OA and XG analyzed the data; and JM, IMR and XG drafted the paper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional file 1</title><p><bold>Changes in gene expression underlying BCR-induced apoptosis and proliferation</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Experimental design used to identify the genes discriminating BCR-triggered transcriptional responses of immature and mature B cells at 2 and 8 h.
