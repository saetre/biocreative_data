The adult brain is a major site of expression of P-gp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and it had long been exclusively associated to the endothelial cells in capillary walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], until astrocytic endfeet were identified as another specific location <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In order to start deciphering the physiological role of P-gp in astrocytes, we have chosen to study its increase in expression in reactive astrocytes, by looking for the effects of a wide variety of molecules known to induce astroglial activation in <italic>in vitro</italic> culture conditions. This involved, in particular, several agents that had also been shown to stimulate P-gp expression in other cell types, such as Interferon-&#x003b1; and -&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b1;, &#x003b3;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and dibutyryl-cyclic-AMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and also a number of other compounds classically used to induce astroglial differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Surprisingly, only a few of these factors drove astroglial P-gp expression, indicating that P-gp overexpression is not just related to astroglial differentiation, but appears as a specific response to certain stimuli. This increase in P-gp expression thus seems to characterize a specific stage of differentiation, which, in one pathway at least, also involves an increased concentration of the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). The two proteins may be even more functionally linked to each other since some of the "astrogliotic" stimuli able to increase P-gp expression require CNTF as a key intracellular signal.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Enriched astroglial cell cultures were readily obtained from cerebral hemispheres of Swiss mice and of CNTF knockout mice, and maintained for several weeks without signs of cell alteration.</p><sec><title>Expression of P-gp in primary astrocyte culture</title><p>Astrocytes in culture expressed P-glycoprotein as early as 24 h after plating.

At the protein level, the results varied over time: until the 4<sup>th</sup> day in vitro (div), the antibody raised against P-gp detected a band at about 120 kDa; from the 6<sup>th</sup> div a doublet was detected at about 160&#x02013;170 kDa; finally, at 15 div this doublet became predominant and its expression increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>MDR1mRNA and P-gp expression in astroglial cultures.</bold> a/ RT-PCR showing MDR1mRNA. b/ Western blotting using rabbit anti-P-gp polyclonal antibody demonstrating the presence of P-gp as early as 2 div.

This was in particular the case for dBcAMP, IL-1&#x003b2;, LPS, NGF, RA, rhIFN&#x003b1;, rhTGF&#x003b1; and TNF&#x003b1;. In contrast, all the cytokines that belong to the IL-6 family induced a 50% or more increase in expression of P-gp in long-term astrocyte culture. This effect was dose-dependent and was modulated by &#x003b1; receptor subunits, when relevant. For instance, rrCNTF was inefficient when used alone at 30 ng/ml in long-term cultures. However, an increase in the cellular content of P-gp was observed in a significant and reproducible manner when 100, and even further 250 ng/ml of rCNTF were used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). As previously described for the effects of rCNTF on other astroglial markers of differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], addition of 200 ng/ml of c-myc-sCNTFR&#x003b1; induced a potentiation of the effects, and an increase of P-gp cellular content was then observed with the lowest concentration of rCNTF studied (10 ng/ml), and maintained for all other concentrations used (data not shown). Addition of rhLIF and rhCT-1, in the culture medium provoked an increase of about 1.5 to 2-fold of P-gp cellular content (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Addition of rmIL-6 at concentrations below 40 ng/ml in the culture medium was inefficient, but a significant increase of P-gp intracellular content was observed when this concentration was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Addition of rhsIL-6R&#x003b1; to the culture medium induced a major potentiation of the effects, since, in these conditions, all concentrations used triggered a significant increase in P-gp content (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of cytokines on P-gp cellular content in mature astrocytes.</bold> a/ Addition of 100 and 250 ng/ml rCNTF during 24 h induced a statistically significant increase as compared to untreated controls (+51.7% &#x000b1; 15.6, factorial ANOVA significant at 95%, t-test p &#x0003c; 0.01<sup>**</sup> and +75.7 &#x000b1; 30, factorial ANOVA significant at 95%, t-test p &#x0003c; 0.05<sup>*</sup>, respectively). b/ Addition of rhLIF during 24 h induced a significant increase of P-gp expression both at 10 and 30 ng/ml (+42.7 % &#x000b1; 14, factorial ANOVA significant at 95%, t-test p &#x0003c; 0.05<sup>*</sup> and +54.35 % &#x000b1; 12, factorial ANOVA significant at 95%, t-test p &#x0003c; 0.01<sup>**</sup> respectively).

Moreover, like P-gp, CNTF regulation is very specific, since, among different molecules that normally trigger astrogliosis, only those belonging to the IL-6 family provoked an increase of CNTF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). We, therefore, explored the possibility of a functional link between the two molecules by analysing whether the presence of endogenous CNTF in astrocytes was required for the observed modulation of P-gp expression by IL-6 type cytokines and IFN-&#x003b3;. This was tested by analysing the effects of the cytokines in astrocytes taken from CNTF knockout mice. In these cultures, the modulation of P-gp by LIF, CT-1 or IL-6 (even in presence of its specific &#x003b1; receptor subunit) was completely lost (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

Besides a parallel development of expression, the concentration of the two proteins appears, in particular, to be similarly increased following stimulation by IL-6-type cytokines whereas a number of other agents eliciting activation of astrocytes are ineffective. Moreover, astroglial expression of CNTF appeared to be necessary for the effects of IL-6-type cytokines on P-gp expression. Reciprocally, blockade of P-gp activity eliminated the effects of cytokines, even CNTF, on its own expression, suggesting a functional link between the two systems.</p><sec><title>P-gp and CNTF may be involved together in a specific type of astrocytic activation</title><p>The recent discovery of P-gp expression on astrocytic endfeet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and its induction after a stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] has raised the issue of a role of this protein in astrocytes. To address this issue, we have undertaken, here, an analysis of the expression of P-gp over time during development and of its stimulation in mature cells. The first feature in this study is the striking similarity between the results obtained for astroglial P-gp and those previously gathered on the astroglial cytokine CNTF. Indeed, P-gp and CNTF seem to share parallel modulations of expression both during development and under specific stimulations. First, like CNTF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], P-gp is not detectable in the early stages of postnatal development in the central nervous system. Both proteins are detected from P7, and their concentration levels gradually increase, reaching a plateau at P28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Results obtained in <italic>in vitro</italic> astroglial cultures are also indicative of a parallel maturation of the two proteins. P-gp, both at mRNA and protein levels, was expressed in our study as soon as after 24 hours in culture, but Western blot studies revealed that the protein detected in those early cultures did not have the 170 kDa mature form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], that became predominant only after 14 days, the point at which astrocytes exhibit a mature phenotype (see discussion in 25). A very similar time course of expression was observed previously for CNTF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Before 7 days in vitro, immature astrocytes did not express detectable levels of CNTF, whereas at 14 div, when astrocytes form a confluent monolayer and express high levels of GFAP, they exhibit a significant intracellular content of CNTF.</p><p>In vitro, astrocytes activation experiments further indicate a parallel regulation of the two proteins. Even though <italic>in vivo</italic> models of astrogliosis have revealed a concomitant overexpression of both proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], most factors that readily induce astroglial activation <italic>in vitro</italic> fail to increase their expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and the present study). Indeed, for both proteins, only IFN&#x003b3; (in the study by Carroll and colleagues, 31, for CNTF) and the IL-6 family cytokines could trigger a quantifiable increase in expression in astrocytes (this study).</p><p>All these results suggest that the overexpression of CNTF and P-gp participate in the definition of a particular stage of astroglial differentiation. So-called astrogliosis has long been considered as a discrete "activation" stage of astrocytes, on the basis of its characteristic morphological features. However, more recent studies exploring the expression of specific molecules have questioned this view, drawing attention to the fact that reactive gliosis varies qualitatively and quantitatively depending on both the nature of the injury and the microenvironment of the injury site (see references and discussion 30 and 31). The nature of the injury and the microenvironment necessary for the differentiation stage of astrocytes that involves CNTF and P-gp overexpression is, at this point, a matter of speculation. It is interesting to note, nevertheless, that, in agreement with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data, intra-cerebral administration of adenovirus recombinant for CNTF produced an increase in the astroglial content of endogenous CNTF without triggering massive "astrogliotic" morphological changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular concentration of CNTF as a modulator of P-gp expression in astrocytes</title><p>Out of the present study, the relationship between CNTF and P-gp in astrocytes appears as a functional link rather than as a mere co-regulation. Indeed, one main result obtained in this study was the apparent requirement of an intracellular level of CNTF for the expression of P-gp to be modulated by IL-6-type cytokines, since this modulation was not seen in cells that did not express the CNTF gene. The only exogenous cytokine that remained effective in CNTF-/- cells was CNTF itself. This may be explained by the fact that exogenous CNTF, when bound to its receptor, is internalised into the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. As discussed by these authors, endocytosed CNTF may be active inside the cell, as has been demonstrated for neurotrophins/Trks complexes (see 34 for a review). Through this mechanism, therefore, restoration of an intracellular content of CNTF may become sufficient to trigger a increased P-gp expression.</p><p>How an increase in the cellular content of CNTF increases the expression of P-gp was not directly addressed in this study. Nevertheless, a number of elements help to suggest a working hypothesis. A direct transcriptional role of CNTF on the P-gp gene promoter is unlikely for three reasons. First, it has been well demonstrated that the intracellular signalling systems triggered by CNTF are essentially similar to those triggered by LIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Why would LIF not be effective in CNTF-/- astrocytes when CNTF is, would be difficult to explain in case of a direct transcriptional effect. Second, our results demonstrate that the control of P-gp expression requires a modulation of the intracellular content of the cytokine. Third, the stimulation of P-gp expression by cytokines was blocked with antagonists of the activity of the transporter. This indicates that the regulation of P-gp depends upon its own activity and suggests the existence in astrocytes of a positive feedback of the molecule upon its own expression. Such a suggestion is concordant with the well demonstrated positive feedback of P-gp activity upon its expression in various tumor cells, in the presence of non-organic substrates like cytotoxic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>In a mechanistic model based upon this hypothesis, endogenous astroglial CNTF would most likely not appear as a usual cytokine activating signalling pathways after binding to a transmembrane receptor system, but as a "sensor", itself modulated by extrinsic cues. The changes induced in the intracellular concentration of this "sensor" might affect the activity of the P-gp transmembrane transporter and, eventually, lead to a modulation of its gene expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Such a scheme suggests a physiological role for CNTF, a cytokine which, because of the absence of a signal peptide and the lack of a quantifiable release in the culture medium of cells that synthesise it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], was not thought to play a physiological role in the absence of a lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Whether P-gp is the only target of the effects of CNTF, or just the first one identified is obviously an open question at this point.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Tentative mechanistic model of P-gp regulation by CNTF based upon the results of the present study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-3-20-8"/></fig><p>One directly related issue is the role of P-gp in astrocytes. Taking into account the functions of P-gp in other cells, in the protection against potentially harmful chemicals and metabolites, it is plausible that the transporter plays an important role in the response against cell stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], as suggested by its increase in reactive astrocytes. In addition, one may consider another role that has been demonstrated for P-gp and other transporters of the mdr family, namely their ability to transport various organic molecules through cell membranes, including various cytokines. Indeed, P-gp has been shown to transport interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) through cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Whether, among other substrates, P-gp can similarly transport CNTF out of astrocytes is a tempting hypothesis that will require further studies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we have demonstrated a close interaction between two proteins, CNTF and P-gp. These results suggest another role for the CNTF in which it could not be necessary for it to be secreted. Indeed, we have shown that an intrinsic astrocyte P-gp-regulation pathway, in which CNTF has a predominant role, can trigger biochemical changes in astrocytes. This pathway is directly related to the modification of the CNTF-intracellular concentration. Whether P-gp is the only target of CNTF, or just the first one identified and whether, among other substrates, P-gp can similarly transport CNTF out of astrocytes remains to be seen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Astroglial cultures were prepared from cerebral hemispheres of neonatal Swiss mice (Iffa Credo, France) or CNTF knockout mice (BRL, Switzerland).
