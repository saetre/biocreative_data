It remains unknown how the nuclear localization and coactivator functions of lipin-1 are regulated. Here, we show that lipin-1 (including both the alpha and beta isoforms) is modified by sumoylation at two consensus sumoylation sites. We are unable to detect sumoylation of the related proteins lipin-2 and lipin-3. Lipin-1 is sumoylated at relatively high levels in brain, where lipin-1&#x003b1; is the predominant form. In cultured embryonic cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, ectopically expressed lipin-1&#x003b1; is localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and the nuclear localization is abrogated by mutating the consensus sumyolation motifs. The sumoylation site mutant of lipin-1&#x003b1; loses the capacity to coactivate the transcriptional (co-) activators PGC-1&#x003b1; and MEF2, consistent with its nuclear exclusion. Thus, these results show that sumoylation facilitates the nuclear localization and transcriptional coactivator behavior of lipin-1&#x003b1; that we observe in cultured neuronal cells, and suggest that lipin-1&#x003b1; may act as a sumoylation-regulated transcriptional coactivator in brain.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) to lysine residues in target proteins, or sumoylation, is an important regulator of protein functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007031-Johnson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007031-GeissFriedlander1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Immunoblot analysis of extracts from these cells with an anti-V5 antibody revealed a strong band corresponding to V5-lipin-1&#x003b2; as well as a weaker, more slowly migrating band at the mobility expected for V5-lipin-1&#x003b2; modified with one molecule of CFP-SUMO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007031-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, lower arrowhead). A form of lipin-1&#x003b2; that might be modified with two molecules of CFP-SUMO-1 also was faintly detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007031-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, upper arrowhead). To investigate whether these bands represent V5-lipin-1&#x003b2; covalently conjugated to CFP-SUMO-1, a CFP-SUMO-1 mutant (G97A) that cannot be conjugated to target proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007031-Yamashita1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> was used instead of the wild-type CFP-SUMO-1. In this case, both additional bands were absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007031-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). As a separate approach to confirm that lipin-1&#x003b2; is modified by CFP-SUMO-1 in HeLa cells, a lysate from the transfected cells was immunoprecipitated with an anti-V5 antibody, and the immunoprecipitate was examined by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody. This analysis revealed an anti-GFP reactive band in the immunoprecipitate that comigrated with the form of V5-lipin-1&#x003b2; presumptively modified with one molecule of SUMO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007031-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Together, these experiments indicate that lipin-1&#x003b2; is sumoylated in HeLa cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We next examined whether K599 or K629 of lipin-1&#x003b2;, each of which are located within the sumoylation consensus sequence &#x003a6;KXE, are the sites of sumoylation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007031-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, mutation of either K599 or K629 alone substantially reduced sumoylation of lipin-1&#x003b2;. However, simultaneous mutation of the two lysines completely abrogated the sumoylation of lipin-1&#x003b2; <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, we found that the immunopurified V5-lipin-1&#x003b2; mutant (K599/626R, &#x0201c;2KR&#x0201d;) was not modified by SUMO-1 in an <italic>in vitro</italic> sumoylation reaction (data not shown). This indicates that lipin-1&#x003b2; can be sumoylated at either of the sumoylation consensus sites. Although a form of lipin-1&#x003b2; that was modified with two molecules of CFP-SUMO-1 was clearly seen by <italic>in vitro</italic> sumoylation of lipin-1&#x003b2; using untagged SUMO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007031-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), this form was scarcely detectable in the HeLa cell assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007031-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). This discrepancy might be a consequence of steric interference by CFP in the latter case, which could diminish modification of the second lysine when the first lysine is sumoylated.</p><p>Next, we examined whether lipin-1&#x003b1;, the shorter splice isoform of lipin-1 that lacks a 33 amino acid adjacent to the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007031-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), can be sumoylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007031-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, a band corresponding to lipin-1&#x003b1; modified with one molecule of SUMO-1 was obtained when HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids for V5-lipin-1&#x003b1; and CFP-SUMO-1. A presumptive minor form of V5-lipin-1&#x003b1; with two molecules of CFP-SUMO-1 is seen upon long exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007031.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).

Furthermore, simultaneous mutation of the two putative sumoylation sites (K566/596R, &#x0201c;2KR&#x0201d;) also blocked lipin-1&#x003b1; sumoylation, similar to lipin-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007031-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007031.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).

Although most of our work involved analysis of lipin-1 that was ectopically expressed in cultured cells, we also demonstrated that endogenous lipin-1 in rodent brain is sumoylated. This indicates that sumoylation of lipin-1 is physiologically relevant. In the cultured cell models we examined, lipin-1 sumoylation occurs on the two consensus sumoylation sites present in both lipin-1&#x003b1; and lipin-1&#x003b2;. We found that lipin-1&#x003b1;, which is the predominant lipin-1 isoform in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007031-Peterfy1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, is concentrated in the nucleus in both embryonic cortical neurons and cultured SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, and that its nuclear localization is dependent on the presence of functional sumoylation sites. In contrast, lipin-1&#x003b2; is mostly excluded from the nucleus in the neuronal cells we examined.</p><p>Our observations on the different nucleocytoplasmic localizations of lipin-1&#x003b1; and lipin-1&#x003b2; in neuronal cells are reminiscent of previous findings in mature adipocytes, where lipin-1&#x003b1; and lipin-1&#x003b2; were found to be localized to the nucleus and to the cytoplasm, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007031-Peterfy1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Although we do not yet know how sumoylation facilitates the nuclear localization of lipin-1&#x003b1; in neuronal cells, sumoylation might influence its nuclear localization by controlling interactions with the nuclear import/export machinery, and/or by regulating its binding to intranuclear components. In this regard, a recent survey of proteins whose nuclear localization is facilitated by sumoylation reveals that sumoylation sites are frequently located in close proximity to NESs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007031-Du1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In these cases, sumoylation might affect nuclear export by inhibiting the binding of NESs to export receptors. The relevance of this mechanism to nuclear export of lipin-1&#x003b1; remains to be determined.</p><p>Sumoylation of lipin-1&#x003b1;, in addition to mediating its nuclear localization, also appears to be required for its transcriptional coactivator activity toward PGC-1&#x003b1; and MEF2 in neuronal cells (see paragraph below). This transcription-related effect of sumoylation most likely is a simple consequence of its ability to mediate the nuclear localization of lipin-1&#x003b1;, since the sumoylation site mutant of lipin-1&#x003b1; still retains the ability to associate with PGC-1&#x003b1; and MEF2 in cultured cells. We also determined that sumoylation does not influence the PAP1 activity of lipin-1&#x003b1;. This is consistent with the notion that the lipin homologs in yeast and in invertebrates bears no consensus sumoylation site, even though lipin has PAP1 activity in all eukaryotes examined.</p><p>Although lipin-1 is known to be involved in regulation of gene expression in liver and adipocytes, its functional relevance to gene expression in neuronal cells is unknown. Our observations that lipin-1&#x003b1; shows both nuclear localization and transcriptional coactivator activity towards PGC-1&#x003b1; in neuronal cells, suggest that it indeed may act as a transcriptional coactivator in brain. Furthermore, our results argue that sumoylation of lipin-1&#x003b1; is likely to be important for these putative brain functions. PGC-1&#x003b1; was recently found to have major functions in brain, since it controls the expression of a subgroup of antioxidant genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007031-StPierre1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, and its dysfunction is associated with neurodegenerative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007031-McGill1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007031-Weydt2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.
