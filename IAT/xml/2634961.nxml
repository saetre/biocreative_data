TR2 is known to function as an activator (Wei et al. 2000), or a repressor (Chinpaisal et al., 1998, Gupta et al. 2007). Due to the lack of specific ligands, mechanisms triggering its activator or repressor function have remained puzzling for decades. Recently, we found that all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid (atRA) triggers the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), which phosphorylates TR2 and stimulates its partitioning to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, thereby converting the activator function of TR2 into repression (Gupta <italic>et al.</italic> 2008; Park <italic>et al.</italic> 2007). Recruitment of TR2 to PML is a crucial step in the conversion of TR2 from an activator to a repressor. However, it is unclear how phosphorylated TR2 is recruited to PML, an essential step in converting TR2 from an activator to a repressor. In the present study, we use both in vitro and in vivo systems to address the problem of recruiting TR2 to PML nuclear bodies. First, we identify histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) as an effector molecule. HDAC3 is known to interact with TR2 (Franco et al. 2001) and this interaction is enhanced by the atRA-stimulated phosphorylation of TR2 at Thr-210 (Gupta et al. 2008). Secondly, in this study, we also find that the carrier function of HDAC3 is independent of its deacetylase activity. Thirdly, we find another novel activity of atRA that stimulates nuclear enrichment of HDAC3 to form nuclear complex with PML, which is ERK2 independent. This is the first report identifying a deacetylase-independent function for HDAC3, which serves as a specific carrier molecule that targets a specifically phosphorylated protein to PML NBs. This is also the first study delineating how protein recruitment to PML nuclear bodies occurs, which can be stimulated by atRA in an ERK2-independent manner. These findings could provide new insights into the development of potential therapeutics and in understanding how orphan nuclear receptor activities can be regulated without ligands.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are assigned to three distinct classes based on their sequence similarity to the yeast RPD3 (class I), HDA1 (class II), or Sir2 (NAD-dependent) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-deRuijter1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Landry1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Because HDAC3 binds to TR2 at the hinge region that encompasses Thr-210 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Li1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, we assessed its ability to mediate recruitment of Thr-210-phosphorylated TR2 to PML using a two-hybrid interaction test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The wild type (WT) TR2 interacted effectively with HDAC3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Li1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. This interaction was enhanced significantly in the phosphomimetic mutant TR2 (210CP; Thr&#x02192;Glu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Wu1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Gupta3">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>), but was abolished in the phosphorylation-negative mutant TR2 (210CN; Thr&#x02192;Ala). Furthermore, although the SUMOylation-defective mutant TR2 (K238R; Lys&#x02192;Arg) exhibited a basal level of interaction with HDAC3 similar to that of WT TR2, a double mutant containing both the phosphomimetic and the SUMOylation-negative mutations (210CP&#x0002b;K238R) behaved like the phosphomimetic CP210 TR2 in terms of its ability to interact with HDAC3. In contrast, a constitutive TR2 double mutant negative for both phosphorylation and SUMOylation (210CN&#x0002b;K238R) could not effectively interact with HDACs. These data suggest that the interaction of TR2 with HDAC3 is phosphorylation-dependent but SUMOylation-independent. This phosphorylation-dependent interaction was verified using pharmacological agents to activate or inactivate ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). A mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK activator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) increased the association of TR2 with HDAC3, whereas addition of an ERK inhibitor 3-(2-aminoethyl)5-(&#x0005b;4-ethoxyphenyl&#x0005d;methylene)-2,4-thiazolidinedione HCl (AMTZD) completely abolished the effect.</p><fig id="pone-0004363-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004363.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of Thr-210 but not SUMOylation of Lys-238 enhances association of TR2 with HDAC3.</title><p>(A) Interaction of HDAC3 with TR2 full-length (WT/Mut) constructs.

As predicted, the ability of TR2 to associate with PML mirrored the pattern of TR2 association with HDAC3.

These data are consistent with the results of the cell-based assay, further supporting a phosphorylation-dependent, direct interaction between TR2 and HDAC3.

To verify this model, we manipulated the experimental system with regard to two critical elements: atRA and ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In the presence of an ERK2 inhibitor (AMTZD), formation of the TR2&#x02013;HDAC3 complex was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, top panel, lane c). Furthermore, because atRA phosphorylates TR2 through the ERK pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Gupta1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, it was unable to rescue complex formation (lane d). The direct interaction between HDAC3 and PML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Wu2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> was increased slightly by atRA treatment (panel 2, lane b), but ERK2 inhibition did not affect this interaction (lane d). In contrast, the atRA-triggered association of TR2 with PML (panel 3) was completely blocked by inhibiting ERK2 activity (lane d). Taken together, our data suggest two independent pathways. In the first, TR2 recruitment to HDAC3 is atRA-dependent and ERK2-sensitive, whereas the second pathway (in which HDAC3 recruitment to PML is slightly enhanced) is responsive to atRA but is independent of ERK2 activation (see the current working model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). It is possible that TR2&#x02013;HDAC3 and HDAC3&#x02013;PML could exist as two separate complexes because HDAC3&#x02013;PML was formed even in the absence of TR2&#x02013;HDAC3 (i.e., when the culture was stimulated with atRA but inhibited by an ERK2 inhibitor).</p><fig id="pone-0004363-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004363.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Effect of atRA and ERK on endogenous complexes with HDAC3.</title><p>(A) ERK2-dependent association of HDAC3 to TR2 but not PML.

Further, HDAC3 and PML can directly interact with each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Wu2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and this complex formation is not dependent upon TR2 (shown above). We therefore suspected a possibility that atRA could modulate subcellular distribution of HDAC3, thereby enhancing its nuclear distribution. To examine this possibility and to determine if this particular effect of atRA (stimulation of HDAC3-PML complex formation in the nucleus) was dependent upon the ERK2 pathway, we conducted siRNA-mediated knockdown of ERK2 and monitored subcellular distribution of HDAC3 and formation of HDAC-PML complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). It appeared that HDAC3 was indeed detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in normal culture; whereas atRA treatment stimulated significant nuclear enrichment of HDAC3 (comparing fractions of Nuc and Cyt). Interestingly, this particular effect of atRA on HDAC3 nuclear enrichment was not blocked by the addition of siRNA to ERK2 (RNAi). This result suggests that the equilibrium of HDAC3 has shifted in favor of its nuclear localization, and that this phenomenon is ERK2 independent. Thus, the effect of atRA on HDAC3 nuclear enrichment is clearly different from its effect on TR2 phsophorylation that is ERK2-dependent as shown in our previous study.</p><p>To gain insights into the molecular mechanism of atRA-triggered HDAC3 nuclear enrichment, we monitored in vivo interaction of HDAC3 with exportin (the principal export machinery, CRM1) and importin-&#x003b2;1 (karyopherin &#x003b2;1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Interestingly, in atR treated cultures, no change was detected in the interaction of HDAC3 with importin-&#x003b2;1 but a clear reduction was detected in its interaction with exportin 1. This suggests that atRA changes the equilibrium of HDAC3, in favor of its nuclear retention, probably due to a selective blockage of its export machinery. Other studies using immunocytochemistry has shown HDAC3 localization mainly in many fine punctate foci of the cytoplasm and in a diffused pattern in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Yang1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Longworth1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. We also observed a similar nuclear and cytoplasmic pattern of HDAC3 in the control cultures, but a nucleus-enriched pattern in cultures treated with atRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). This validates the biochemical data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>. Therefore, the result showing atRA-stimulated nuclear enrichment of HDAC3 provides some explanation for the increased nuclear HDAC3-PML complex formation. However, how atRA stimulates nuclear retention, or enrichment in the nucleus, of HDAC3 remains to be investigated. This is indicated with a question mark in our current working model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g004">Fig. 4</xref>.</p><p>We also examined the kinetics of endogenous complex formation at different time points following atRA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). The phosphorylation of TR2 at Thr-210 was rapidly stimulated, but was diminished by 16 h (panel 2). TR2 association with HDAC3 was consistently apparent at 2 h and subsided after 16 h (panel 1). The kinetics of TR2 recruitment to PML (panel 3) and its subsequent SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Gupta1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>; panel 4) followed closely that of atRA-stimulated TR2 phosphorylation and HDAC3 association. Among the HDACs examined (HDACs 1&#x02013;6), only HDAC3 showed detectable levels of expression in the P19 culture system (panel 5). The results obtained with this system that contains no foreign constructs validate our proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g004">Fig. 4</xref>): atRA stimulates TR2 localization to PML, where SUMOylation of TR2 converts it into an effective repressor of the Oct4 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Park1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The present study has identified HDAC3 as an important carrier for the transport of TR2 phosphorylated specifically in its DNA-binding domain to PML NBs, a key step in the conversion of TR2's activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the P19 stem cell differentiation model, atRA reduces Oct4 expression. Our previous studies reported a non-genomic mechanism by which atRA stimulates TR2 SUMOylation, a key step in the conversion of TR2 into a repressor of the Oct4 gene. In these earlier studies, we confirmed that atRA rapidly activates ERK2, leading to TR2 phosphorylation at Thr-210 and subsequent recruitment to PML NBs for SUMOylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Park1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Gupta1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we failed to detect a direct interaction of TR2 with PML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Gupta1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>), leaving unanswered the means by which phosphorylated TR2 was recruited to PML. In this current study, we are able to identify this missing link: HDAC3 interacts with TR2 in an atRA-enhanced manner. More importantly, the carrier/chaperone function of HDAC3 in this pathway appears to be independent of its deacetylase activity. However, in this newly identified signaling pathway, some outstanding questions have to be addressed as pointed out in our current working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Apparently, questions remain that how atRA activates ERK2, and how atRA stimulates HDAC3 shuttling to PML at the molecular level.</p><p>HDAC3 interacts directly with the DNA-binding domain of TR2 that encompasses Thr-210 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Li1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, and this interaction is enhanced by specific phosphorylation on Thr-210 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004363-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). The exact mechanism of this enhancement remains unclear. Presumably, phosphorylation could induce conformational changes in TR2 such that it is more likely to interact with the binding domain of HDAC3. The presumed direct interaction between HDAC3 and PML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Wu2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> is increased slightly by atRA treatment, but this is ERK-independent. This remains an interesting point for further investigation. Another important finding of this study is that HDAC3 function in this pathway is independent of its deacetylase activity. Although this observation was made using the TR2 system, HDAC3 can also interact with other proteins, including many nuclear receptors that all harbor a very similar DNA-binding domain. Whether HDAC3 can have a similar role in recruiting other nuclear receptors remains to be determined.</p><p>HDAC3 associates with the nuclear dots that encompass PML NBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Wu2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Khan1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-TussiLuna1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. It also associates with the E3 ligase PIAS in the nuclear dots, an association that relieves the transcriptional repression exerted by HDAC3 during TFII-I mediated gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-TussiLuna1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. It is unclear whether the effect of HDAC3 in this system involves deacetylase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Atsumi1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Relevant to this debate, our current findings present evidence for a deacetylase-independent functional role for HDAC3 in mediating molecular interactions. The functional role of HDAC3 in leukemia has been attributed to its association with the PML&#x02013;RAR fusion protein in a deacetylase-dependent fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Karagianni1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004363-Vanhaecke1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. A variety of therapeutic agents are being tested, targeting HDAC's deacetylase activity.
