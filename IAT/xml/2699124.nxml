This is exemplified by the clinical use of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, which interfere with PGE2 synthesis, as effective antiinflammatory drugs. Here, we show that PGE2 directly promotes differentiation and proinflammatory functions of human and murine IL-17&#x02013;producing T helper (Th17) cells. In human purified naive T cells, PGE2 acts via prostaglandin receptor EP2- and EP4-mediated signaling and cyclic AMP pathways to up-regulate IL-23 and IL-1 receptor expression. Furthermore, PGE2 synergizes with IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 to drive retinoic acid receptor&#x02013;related orphan receptor (ROR)-&#x003b3;t, IL-17, IL-17F, CCL20, and CCR6 expression, which is consistent with the reported Th17 phenotype. While enhancing Th17 cytokine expression mainly through EP2, PGE2 differentially regulates interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; production and inhibits production of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 in Th17 cells predominantly through EP4. Furthermore, PGE2 is required for IL-17 production in the presence of antigen-presenting cells. Hence, the combination of inflammatory cytokines and noncytokine immunomodulators, such as PGE2, during differentiation and activation determines the ultimate phenotype of Th17 cells. These findings, together with the altered IL-12/IL-23 balance induced by PGE2 in dendritic cells, further highlight the crucial role of the inflammatory microenvironment in Th17 cell development and regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Prostaglandins, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in particular, play an important role in the regulation of inflammatory responses. PGE2 is a key mediator of pyrexia, hyperalgesia, and arterial dilation, which increases blood flow to inflamed tissues and, in combination with enhanced microvascular permeability, results in edema. The relevance of this pathway in promoting inflammation is supported by the clinical use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, which interfere with prostaglandin synthesis and are used as effective antiinflammatory agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). However, PGE2 can also exert antiinflammatory properties and is a negative regulator of neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte function, particularly of Th1 cells that produce IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). This apparent paradox has puzzled many investigators for decades. The interplay among PGE2, IL-23, and IL-1&#x003b2; biology may now provide an explanation of this paradox.</p><p>Th17 cells have been recognized as a unique subset of effector T cells that are distinct from the Th1 and Th2 subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), and they have been implicated as potent effectors of autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). We and others have previously reported that IL-23 and IL-1&#x003b2; are crucial factors during development of human Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). In addition, IL-23 and the IL-23&#x02013;dependent Th17 cell population play essential roles in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>PGE2 has been shown to exacerbate inflammation and disease severity in murine models of IBD and collagen-induced arthritis through the IL-23&#x02013;IL-17 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). These effects have been attributed to actions of PGE2 on innate cells, as PGE2 enhances the production of IL-23 and IL-1&#x003b2; in macrophages and DCs, while down-regulating IL-12 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). A recent report has shown that PGE2, together with IL-23, favors the expansion of human Th17 cells from PBMCs, and that PGE2 enhances IL-17 production induced by IL-23 from memory CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism of PGE2-mediated signaling during human Th17 cell development has not yet been examined.</p><p>In this study, we show that PGE2 acts directly on both human and murine T cells to enhance Th17 development and effector cytokine production. In human T cells, PGE2 acts via the prostaglandin receptor EP2- and EP4-mediated signaling and cAMP pathways to up-regulate IL-23 and IL-1 receptor expression. Furthermore, PGE2 synergizes with IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 to drive retinoic acid receptor&#x02013;related orphan receptor (ROR)-&#x003b3;t, IL-17, IL-17F, CCL20, and CCR6 expression, which is consistent with the previously reported Th17 phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). While enhancing Th17 cytokine expression mainly through EP2, PGE2 differentially regulates IFN-&#x003b3; production and inhibits production of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 in both naive and memory Th17 cells predominantly through EP4. Hence, the combination of inflammatory cytokines and noncytokine immunomodulators, such as PGE2, during differentiation and activation determines the ultimate phenotype of Th17 cells. These findings, together with the altered IL-12/IL-23 balance induced by PGE2 in dendritic cells, further highlight the crucial role of the inflammatory microenvironment in Th17 cell development and regulation.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>PGE2 up-regulates IL-23 and IL-1 receptor expression on naive T cells via EP2, EP4, and cAMP signaling</title><p>To study the effects of PGE2 on T cells, we first analyzed the expression of the PGE2 receptors EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. Human naive CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). The purity of these naive T cell populations was routinely &#x0003e;99.5% (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082293/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082293/DC1</ext-link>). Freshly isolated naive T cells constitutively expressed high levels of <italic>EP2</italic> and <italic>EP4</italic> mRNA, whereas <italic>EP1</italic> and <italic>EP3</italic> mRNA expression was low or nonexistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Cell surface expression of EP2 and EP4 protein was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Activation and culture of naive T cells led to a two- to threefold up-regulation of <italic>EP2</italic> and <italic>EP4</italic> transcripts (Fig. S2 A). This up-regulation was not affected by the addition of Th1&#x02013;IL-12&#x02013; or Th17&#x02013;IL-23&#x02013; and/or IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;polarizing culture conditions. <italic>EP1</italic> and <italic>EP3</italic> mRNA levels remained low after activation and culture under these same conditions. These results indicate that EP2 and EP4 constitute the major PGE2 receptors on naive and activated T cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>PGE2 up-regulates IL-23R and IL-1R1 expression on cultured human naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</bold> (A) Real-time PCR analysis of <italic>EP1</italic>, <italic>EP2</italic>, <italic>EP3</italic>, and <italic>EP4</italic> gene expression in human naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

To investigate a potential role of PGE2 in Th17 differentiation, we next examined the effects of PGE2 on the expression of IL-23 and IL-1 receptors. Interestingly, activation and culture of naive T cells in the presence of PGE2 resulted in a strong and reproducible up-regulation of IL-23R expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). <italic>IL-1R1</italic> gene expression was also increased in response to PGE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Butaprost, an EP2 selective agonist, and misoprostol, a nonselective agonist with the highest affinity for EP4 and EP3, increased IL-23R expression comparable to PGE2. In contrast, the EP1/EP3 agonist sulprostone had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>), indicating that the effects of PGE2 on IL-23R expression were specifically mediated through EP2 and EP4 receptors. The addition of the intracellular cAMP analogue dibutyryl-cAMP mimicked the effect of PGE2 on IL-23R expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>), suggesting that the effect of PGE2 was dependent on cAMP formation. These results suggest a mechanism by which PGE2 could affect the Th17 pathway through up-regulation of IL-23 and IL-1 receptor expression.</p></sec><sec><title>PGE2 promotes development of human Th17 cells</title><p>As PGE2 enhanced both IL-23 and IL-1&#x003b2; receptor expression from activated naive T cells, we determined whether PGE2 could modulate the effects of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 during the development of Th17 cells. Activation and culture of naive T cells with PGE2 alone slightly increased IL-17 production in few donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). However, PGE2 significantly enhanced IL-17 production induced by IL-23 and/or IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The combination of IL-23, IL-1&#x003b2;, and PGE2 (IL-23&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;PGE2) did not lead to further increase in IL-17 production over that induced by PGE2 and IL-1&#x003b2;. The addition of IL-23 to IL-23&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;PGE2&#x02013;treated cells compared with IL-23&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; cultures resulted in an enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3, which is in line with the up-regulated expression of IL-23R in the presence of PGE2 (Fig. S2 B), and indicates that the enhanced IL-23R expression is functional. The increase in IL-17 production induced by IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 in response to PGE2 was dose dependent (Fig. S2 C). In addition, the proportion of IL-17<sup>+</sup> and IL-17<sup>+</sup>/IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> producers was increased in IL-23&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;PGE2 cultures compared with IL-23&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;treated cells, whereas IFN-&#x003b3; single producers were present at similar levels (Fig. S2 D). Furthermore, the increased IL-17 production was more strongly controlled by EP2 than EP4 signaling because the EP2 agonist butaprost could mimic the effect of PGE2 to a similar extent, whereas misoprostol was not able to induce such a strong induction of IL-17 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The increase in IL-17 secretion mediated through activation of the cAMP pathway was consistent with the observed EP2 or EP4 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The effects of dibutyryl-cAMP on IL-17 production were consistent and dose dependent (Fig. S2 E). The differential increase of IL-17 production in response to EP2 or EP4 may be caused by the more robust stimulation of intracellular cAMP formation by EP2 compared with EP4, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>PGE2, together with IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23, enhances Th17 cell development predominantly via EP2 signaling and cAMP pathways.</bold> Human naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were activated with anti-CD3/CD28/CD2 beads and cultured for 11 d in the presence of IL-23, IL-1&#x003b2;, PGE2, dibutyryl-cAMP, and/or EP receptors agonists.

Th17 cells also produce IL-17F, IL-22, and CCL20/MIP3&#x003b1;. A similar profile of IL-23&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;PGE2&#x02013;dependent regulation was observed for IL-17F and CCL20 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E, F</xref>). In contrast, IL-22 and IL-26 expression was decreased in the presence of PGE2 alone; however, their expression was not altered by the addition of PGE2 to cultures containing IL-23 and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref> and Fig. S2 F). These results indicated that although IL-22 and IL-26 are an integral part of Th17 biology, their expression is subject to multiple levels of regulation. All the observations on Th17 cytokine production were confirmed at the level of gene expression (Fig. S2 F). These results thus indicate that PGE2 can act directly on naive T cells and enhance Th17 development mainly through the EP2&#x02013;cAMP pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>PGE2 induces IL-17 production in T cell&#x02013;APC co-cultures</title><p>PGE2 pretreatment of APCs promotes Th17 differentiation in mice by altering the IL-12/IL-23 balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In addition, PGE2 enhanced IFN-&#x003b3; and TLR7 induced IL-23 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). It was therefore of interest to determine the effects of PGE2 on T cells in the presence of APCs. Like T cells, human monocytes mainly expressed <italic>EP2</italic> and <italic>EP4</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Activation of monocytes through the TLR2 pathway by peptidoglycan resulted in the production of IL-23 and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). However, when monocytes were activated with PGE2 in the absence of TLR ligands or cytokines, we did not detect any IL-23 or IL-1&#x003b2; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In line with these results, addition of PGE2 to co-culture of naive T cells with monocytes in the absence of exogenously added cytokines did not induce IL-17 production. Interestingly, in the presence of monocytes, the combination of IL-23 and IL-1&#x003b2; failed to induce IL-17 production in most donors; however, addition of PGE2 overcame this suppressive effect and resulted in IL-17 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>).

Addition of PGE2 strongly suppressed the production of IL-10 in both control and Th17-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

The inhibitory effect of PGE2 on IFN-&#x003b3; production was predominantly mediated through EP4 signaling because it could be mimicked by the addition of the EP4 agonist misoprostol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>) and through elevation of cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>). However, when Th17 cells were generated by the combination of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23, PGE2 was not able to inhibit IFN-&#x003b3; secretion, indicating that PGE2 could not effectively interfere with the efficacy of the combined signal transduction pathways.

However, PGE2 did up-regulate the expression of the <italic>IL-1R1</italic> mRNA on the memory T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>), and also modulated cytokine production and transcription factor profiles. The activation of memory T cells with IL-1&#x003b2; enhanced IL-17 production, and the combination of both IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 led to a higher IL-17 up-regulation, as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). The presence of PGE2 alone or with IL-23 did not enhance IL-17 production in most donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>). However, PGE2 enhanced IL-17 production induced by IL-1&#x003b2; and the combination of PGE2, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-23 induced an even stronger IL-17 up-regulation that correlated with enhanced expression of <italic>ROR&#x003b3;t</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>).

These autoimmune disease models are associated with exacerbated Th17 responses, which are driven by the presence of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) In this context, Chizzolini et al. recently reported that another inflammatory mediator, PGE2, enhanced IL-17 production from memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in total human PBMC cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Here, we specifically assessed the PGE2-mediated effects on T cell development and function. We showed that PGE2 signals via EP2 and EP4 receptors and the cAMP&#x02013;PKA pathway to promote human naive T cell differentiation to Th17 cells (proposed model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). PGE2 up-regulated the expression of IL-23R and IL-1R on differentiating naive T cells and, in combination with Th17-driving cytokines, enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation and induced a qualitative and quantitative shift in function and phenotype toward a strong proinflammatory/pathogenic Th17 cell. PGE2 enhanced the percentage of CCR6-positive, in vitro&#x02013;matured Th17 cells that expressed IL-17A, IL-22, IL-17F, CCL20, ROR&#x003b3;t, and IL-23R, and it significantly up-regulated these functional markers of the Th17 phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). This enhanced Th17 functionality was also observed when mature CD45RO<sup>+</sup> memory T cell populations were activated by IL-1&#x003b2; and PGE2. Although previous studies have reported that PGE2 has antiproliferative effects on T cells, we did not observe a strong inhibition of proliferation when naive T cells were cultured in the presence of IL-23 and IL-1&#x003b2; (unpublished data). There are two plausible explanations that may reconcile PGE2's apparent antiproliferative effect and our pro-Th17 cell development findings: (a) in the presence of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23, PGE2 may favor the development and/or expansion of Th17 cells, while down-regulating proliferation of non-Th17 cells; (b) PGE2 may act on &#x0201c;non-Th17 cells&#x0201d; and convert them into IL-17 producers, while suppressing overall T cell proliferative responses, resulting in an &#x0201c;apparent&#x0201d; increase in the number of Th17 cells. Furthermore, in addition to these direct effects of PGE2 on T cells, PGE2 was also essential for the induction of IL-17 production from naive T cells in an APC-dependent manner. We demonstrate that PGE2 inhibits IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-10 production by Th17 cells and thus regulates their pathogenic potential. The opposing effects of PGE2 on increased IL-17 production and reduced IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-10 production are mediated by differential signaling through EP2 and EP4 receptors, which is unique in PGE2 signal transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). Finally, we show that the PGE2 effects on Th17 function can be extended from human to murine biology. Overall, we show that the proinflammatory activity of PGE2 is mediated through the IL-23&#x02013;Th17 pathway.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed model for PGE2 effects during Th17 cell development.</bold> (A) Binding of PGE2 to EP2 and EP4 enhances intracellular cAMP formation and signaling, leading to up-regulation of IL-23R and IL-1R1 expression, as well as inhibition of the expression of T-bet and production of IFN-&#x003b3;.

We show that EP2 and EP4, but not EP1 or EP3, are the receptors mediating PGE2 effects on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In addition, PGE2 activities are likely mediated through the cAMP&#x02013;PKA pathway, as the effects of PGE2 can be mimicked in the presence of the cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP. These findings are in line with the previously reported induction of the cAMP&#x02013;PKA pathway by EP2 and EP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Furthermore, we show that stimulatory and inhibitory activities of PGE2 on cytokine production seem to be mediated by specific PGE2 receptors, as enhanced IL-17 production is preferentially mediated by EP2 signaling, whereas inhibition of IL-10 and IFN-&#x003b3; production occurs mainly through EP4 signaling. In addition, the inhibition of IL-10 production induced by cAMP was not observed in the presence of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23, suggesting the induction of additional signaling pathway(s) in response to EP4 stimulation. It has been shown that EP4, but not EP2, can also induce a concomitant activation of phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). However, addition of phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase and MAP kinase inhibitors to our cultures completely inhibited all cytokine production by T cells (unpublished data), so it was not possible to formally test this hypothesis. It is of interest to note that PGE2 and the cAMP pathway have been shown to up-regulate IL-10 expression in monocytic cells through a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) in the IL-10 promoter. However, the cAMP-induced PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the CRE-binding protein 1 does not seem to have an important regulatory role in T cells, which is also reflected by their lack of responsiveness to catecholamine-induced, cAMP-dependent IL-10 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>).</p><p>Human CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells producing IL-17 were first identified from peripheral blood or gut of healthy and Crohn's patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), and increasing efforts have been made to characterize this cell subset. Two groups independently identified CCR6 as a chemokine receptor selectively expressed on Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). CCR6 is involved in the recruitment of pathogenic T cells in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), and Th17 cells are increasingly recognized as crucial mediators of those diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Therefore, the up-regulated CCR6 expression in IL-23&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;PGE2&#x02013;driven Th17 cells is consistent with the generation of cells bearing the phenotype of pathogenic effector Th17 cells. In addition, the higher expression of Th17 cytokines in CCR6<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from cells treated with a combination of IL-23, IL-1&#x003b2;, and PGE2 compared with IL-23&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;treated cells suggest a stronger maturation of Th17 cells in the presence of PGE2. It has been recently shown that human IL-17&#x02013;producing cells are contained within the CD161<sup>+</sup> fraction of circulating or tissue-infiltrating T cells and that these cells originate from CD161<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of umbilical cord blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Additional data also suggest that such CD161<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells are crucial mediators of intestinal inflammation during Crohn's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>).</p><p>IL-10 was originally described as an immunosuppressive cytokine produced by Th2 cells. However, it is now recognized that all T cell subsets can produce this cytokine as a feedback response to suppress immune pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Indeed, we have previously shown that TGF-&#x003b2; induced IL-10 production even in the presence of IL-6 and/or IL-23, and that IL-10 can restrain the pathogenicity of Th17 cells in a mouse model of CNS autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). As shown in this study, human Th17 cells stimulated in the presence of IL-1&#x003b2; and/or IL-23 produced IL-10. Thus, the ability of PGE2 to strongly inhibit IL-10 production is crucial to enhancement of Th17-mediated inflammation and pathogenicity.</p><p>PGE2 is also an important regulator of Th1 cells, particularly through the inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). We show here that PGE2 also inhibited IFN-&#x003b3; production by Th17 cells generated in the presence of IL-1&#x003b2; or IL-23; however, the signaling pathways induced by both cytokines prevented this inhibition and led to the development of both IL-17<sup>+</sup>/IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, as well as IL-17<sup>+</sup>/IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> producers. These results are in accordance with the phenotype of Th17 cells observed by Chizzolini et al. when culturing PBMCs in the presence of IL-23 and PGE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Interestingly, ex vivo Th17 cells producing IL-17 alone or both IL-17 and IFN-&#x003b3; have been identified in the blood and gut of Crohn's patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Our results support the idea that the presence of IL-23, IL-1&#x003b2;, and PGE2 would lead to the development of Th17 cells bearing a phenotype/cytokine profile close to that found during disease.</p><p>Our results show that PGE2 directly acts on murine Th17 cells to enhance IL-17 production. This extends previous studies demonstrating that in the mouse system, PGE2's pro-Th17 effects were mediated through enhanced DC and macrophage production of IL-23 and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Hence, the mechanisms of PGE2-mediated expansion of pathogenic Th17 cells are likely through both T cell&#x02013;dependent and myeloid cell&#x02013;dependent pathways.</p><p>In the mouse culture system, it is well established that the combination of TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-6 is necessary and sufficient to promote both in vitro (and likely in vivo) development of IL-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. It is important to note that IL-6 is a major driver of IL-1R1 and IL-23R in murine T cells. Our assessment of PGE2's influence on murine T cell differentiation toward Th17 cells indicated that PGE2 cannot replace TGF-&#x003b2; and/or IL-6 for induction of Th17 cells in a 3-d naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell assay (unpublished data). This was not unexpected, as TGF-&#x003b2;/IL-6 can promote 30&#x02013;70% of IL-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in our culture system. PGE2 has more profound effects on differentiating Th17 cells in our human culture system. Although we did not observe a TGF-&#x003b2;/IL-6&#x02013;dependent effect on naive human T cells, we found that PGE2 induced IL-1R and IL-23R in naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which enhanced the development of Th17 cells induced by IL-23 and IL-1&#x003b2;. Although TGF-&#x003b2; is clearly required for the generation of murine Th17 cells, its role during the development of the human counterpart is still controversial. In this regard, Santarlasci et al. recently suggested that TGF-&#x003b2; was not critical for human Th17 cell development; instead, TGF-&#x003b2; would indirectly favor expansion of Th17 cells through inhibition of Th1 cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study highlights the role of the inflammatory microenvironment as a critical factor in Th17 development and regulation. Our findings also shed light on a paradox where the important role of PGE2 in mediating inflammation remained controversial in respect to its effects on T helper cell function and cytokine production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Human cell cultures.</title><p>Buffy coats were obtained from normal healthy human volunteers participating in the Stanford Medical School Blood Center blood donation program in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
