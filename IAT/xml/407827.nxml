In order to understand the molecular mechanisms which regulate the <italic>cENS-1/cERNI</italic> promoter, we analyzed the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements of this promoter in CES and differentiated cells.

Mutation of the B region in the whole <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter strongly decreases the promoter activity in CES cells, suggesting that this region is essential for activating the promoter. The B region is similar to the previously described response element for the transcription factor CP2 and we show by supershift experiments that a protein complex containing CP2 is bound to this B response element. All these results identify a nuclear factor belonging to the CP2 transcription factor family that is crucial for the activation of the <italic>cENS-1/cERNI</italic> promoter.

These cells are pluripotent, can grow <italic>in vitro</italic> for long term and can contribute to many embryonic tissues including germ line when they are grafted into an host embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c2">2</xref>). They then provide a very good model to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying the control of pluripotency and differentiation commitment. In addition to the mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell model, it could help to define more precisely the pathways conserved and involved in the maintenance of pluripotency during embryonic development.</p><p>In the mouse embryo, few regulators of ES cell pluripotency have been characterized so far. It has been shown that <italic>Oct-3/4</italic> is a key regulator of ES cells pluripotency and is involved in the control of other genes like <italic>FoxD3</italic> or <italic>FGF4</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c3">3</xref>). <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>FoxD3</italic>, <italic>FGF4, FGFR2</italic> and recently <italic>Nanog</italic> have also been shown to be involved in the regulation of embryonic cell pluripotency <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c9">9</xref>). The <italic>in vivo</italic> knock-out of these genes leads to a slight decrease in the number of cells originating from the epiblast and to a rapid embryonic lethality. Moreover, it has been impossible to derive <italic>in vitro</italic> ES cells from these mutant embryos.</p><p>In order to identify new sets of critical genes for ES cell biology, we used a gene trap based strategy in CES cells. We have identified a gene family which is specifically expressed in CES cells and early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c10">10</xref>). The <italic>Embryonic Normal Stem</italic> (<italic>ENS</italic>) genes are strongly expressed in CES cells, but their expression rapidly decreases after the induction of CES cell differentiation by retinoic acid, or during embryoid body formation. In the embryo, <italic>ENS</italic> genes are highly expressed in the epiblast prior to gastrulation, and their expression is then restricted to the prospective neural plate, and later to the border of the neural plate. Up to now, three genes of this family have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c10">10</xref>): 1) <italic>cENS-1</italic> which contains an open reading frame identical to <italic>cERNI</italic> (Early Response to Neural Induction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c11">11</xref>), inserted between two repeated sequences; 2) <italic>cENS-2</italic> which is a truncated form of <italic>cENS-1</italic>; 3) <italic>cENS-3</italic> which possesses two open reading frames corresponding to <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic>-retrovirus related gene. The coding region for <italic>ENS-1</italic> does not show any known homology with retroviral gene and does not seem to be conserved among birds other than galliforms. However, the occurrence of LTR-like repeated structures at both ends of <italic>ENS</italic> genes suggested that these genes might be derived from an ancestral retrovirus or transposon structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c10">10</xref>). In the putative U3 region of the LTR-like structures, we have previously isolated a promoter region, and shown that its activity is much stronger in CES cells than in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c10">10</xref>). This result was surprising because it has been shown that retroviral LTRs are usually silenced in mouse ES cells and early mouse embryo, and correlated with a high methylation of these sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c13">13</xref>). This silencing has not yet been observed in chicken blastula. Early chicken blastodermal cells (from which CES cells are derived) are permissive for infection by Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) and readily expressed RSV genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c14">14</xref>), suggesting that CES cells could be more permissive to retroviral gene expression than mouse ES cells.</p><p>It is also possible that <italic>ENS</italic> LTRs are protected from gene silencing by specific molecular regulators or by a positive position effect. The restricted expression pattern of <italic>ENS</italic> genes in embryonic stem cells and in the early embryo is of particular interest, and led us to study the mechanisms underlying <italic>ENS</italic> gene expression. Based on a systematic analysis of the regulatory elements of <italic>cENS</italic> genes, we report here that one <italic>cis</italic>-acting element, belonging to the first 310 bp of the <italic>cENS-1/cERNI</italic> promoter, is responsible for its activity in CES cells. These results as a whole reveal the existence of a nuclear factor, which belongs to the CP2 transcription factor family. Moreover, we observed that the pattern of expression of <italic>CP2</italic> in early embryo before gastrulation is very similar to that of <italic>cENS/cERNI</italic> which strongly suggests that <italic>CP2</italic> also plays an essential role in gene expression early in embryonic development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and DNA transfection</title><p>The 9N2-5 CES cell line was maintained <italic>in vitro</italic> and transfected as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c10">10</xref>) with several modifications. Briefly, CES cells were cultivated in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM)/F12 (Invitrogen) containing 5&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAN, Austria) supplemented with 1 ng/ml IGF1 (Sigma), 0.5 ng/ml mSCF (R&#x00026;D), 1 ng/ml hIL-6 (Peprotek), 1 ng/ml hIL6-sR (Peprotek 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> M), &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, sodium pyruvate and non-essential amino acids on an irradiated feeder of STO cells at 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. QT6 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c15">15</xref>) were cultivated in HamF12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 2&#x00025; FBS complemented with 10&#x00025; TPB (Tryptose Phosphate Broth, Difco). The day before transfection, the cells were plated in 12-well dishes at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well for the 9N2-5 cells or 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> per well for QT6 cells. Cells were cotransfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) with 300 ng of DNA construct and 30 ng of the Renilla Luciferase Reporter construct, pRL-TK, to normalize for transfection efficiency. After 5 h of incubation in diluted culture medium containing only 1&#x00025; FBS, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and regular medium was added to each well. On the following day, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega), then Firefly and Renilla luciferase luminescence assays were successively performed using Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Firefly reporter gene values were normalized to the activity of the Renilla luciferase, used as internal control.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA constructs</title><p>All the pGL2 luciferase reporter vectors were purchased from Promega. ENS reporter constructs were produced using PCR amplification with multiple primers that introduced a 5&#x02032;-MluI restriction site at positions &#x02013;738, &#x02013;456, &#x02013;308, &#x02013;179 and &#x02013;32, respectively paired with a single 3&#x02032;-antisense primer that generated a 3&#x02032;-MluI restriction site at position &#x0002b;83. Primer sequences are available in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh545tb1">1</xref>. PCR products and pGL2-basic vector were digested with MluI, purified and then ligated to produce, respectively, p738-luc, p456-luc, p308-luc, p179-luc and p32-luc. Reporter constructs and the pGL2 basic negative control vectors were used for transient transfection studies. Monomers or trimers of the &#x02013;313/&#x02013;180 region were constructed as follows: the &#x02013;313/&#x02013;180 region was amplified by PCR with BamHI &#x02013;313 S and BglII &#x02013;180 AS primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh545tb1">1</xref>). After digestion with BamHI/BglII, PCR products were ligated in the BamH1 site of pGEM-7Z. BglII restriction enzyme was then added to the ligation mix to eliminate multimers with various orientations. Multimers were then excised from pGEM-7Z by NsiI/KpnI and ligated into p179-luc or pGL2-promoter (Promega). Multimer copy numbers and identities were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Multimers (one or three copies) of the wild-type or mutated A and B response element (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh545tb1">1</xref>) were cloned in the SacI restriction site of the p179-luc construct or of pGL2-promoter. Insert identities were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Targeted mutagenesis on p456-luc for the B response elements has been performed with the Quick Change Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the primers: B mutagenesis S and B mutagenesis AS.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear extracts</title><p>Nuclear extracts were prepared with the Active Motif nuclear extract kit (Active Motif) and stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C until further use.

Approximately 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> c.p.m. of the probe were added to a 30-&#x000b5;l reaction mixture in the presence or absence of 10 &#x000b5;g of nuclear extract in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 20&#x00025; glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and 1 &#x000b5;g of poly(dI&#x02013;dC)-poly(dI&#x02013;dC). For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated for 10 min with nuclear extract prior to the addition of labeled double-stranded probe. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes and unbound probes were separated by electrophoresis on a 4&#x00025; glycerol and 5&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel in 0.5&#x000d7; TBE at 160 V for 120 min. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. EMSA supershift assays were performed with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against CP2 (anti-LSF from BD Biosciences). Then 250, 25 or 2.5 ng of this antibody was added to the reaction mix after the addition of the labeled probe.</p></sec><sec><title>Methylation interference assays</title><p>Probes were labeled as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c16">16</xref>). For sense or antisense oligoprobes, only the sense or antisense oligonucleotide was labeled. For the guanine methylation procedure, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> c.p.m. of the probe was methylated using 1 &#x000b5;l of dimethyl sulfate (DMS) (Merck) for 3 min at room temperature in 200 &#x000b5;l of 50 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 8.0)&#x02013;1 mM EDTA. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 &#x000b5;l of stop buffer &#x0005b;5 M sodium acetate (pH 7.0), 1 M &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol&#x0005d;. The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 30 &#x000b5;l of water. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as described above, but with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> c.p.m. of modified <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probe and 30 &#x000b5;g of crude nuclear extracts. After autoradiography, the DNA was electro-eluted from the bands corresponding to the retarded probe and the free unbound probe. After precipitation with ethanol, the amounts of radioactivity of the bound and free probe were adjusted and the DNA was cleaved in 100 &#x000b5;l of 1 M piperidine for 30 min at 90&#x000b0;C. The cleaved products were separated by electrophoresis through a denaturing 18&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel and were autoradiographed.</p></sec><sec><title>Real time PCR</title><p>Total mRNA were extracted from CES cells using RNeasy kits (Qiagen).

The promoter sequence is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f1">1</xref>. Analysis of the promoter sequence using MatInspector Professional release 6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c19">19</xref>) revealed several putative <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements for factors implicated in regulating constitutive gene expression (like AP1). It also revealed three well conserved binding elements for GATA-1 in the proximal region of the promoter. However, the analysis did not identify any candidates known to be involved in regulating ES cell specific genes. In order to localize functional <italic>cis</italic>-acting element(s) in the <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter, luciferase reporter constructs were designed and generated for use in transient transfection assays. By using 5&#x02032; deletion mutants of the <italic>cENS1</italic> promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (cENS-luc), we carried out DNA transfection experiments in CES cells, CES cells induced to differentiate and QT6 cells, a quail fibroblast cell line. Our largest construct contained the first 738 bp of the promoter. We chose this fragment because it includes the putative U3 region of ENS genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c10">10</xref>). Successive deletions of cENS-luc from &#x02013;738 to &#x02013;456 did not reduce the expression level of the reporter gene in CES cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f2">2</xref>). An additional deletion to position &#x02013;308 did not decrease the promoter activity in these cells (not shown). In contrast, a further deletion to position &#x02013;179 gave a 20-fold decrease, indicating that critical <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements are located between &#x02013;308 and &#x02013;179. None of these constructs showed a strong transcriptional activity either in CES cells induced to differentiate with retinoic acid for 48 h or in QT6 cells, a quail immortalized fibroblast line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c15">15</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f2">2</xref>). QT6 cells were used in the following experiments as a model for differentiated cells.</p></sec><sec><title>A &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region is a key region for promoter activation in CES cells</title><p>To address the possible enhancer function of the DNA sequences that are located between &#x02013;308 and &#x02013;179, we cloned this region as one or three copies upstream of a SV40 basal promoter, which drives the expression of the luciferase reporter gene (SV40 basal promoter in pGL2-promoter). These constructs were transfected in CES cells or in QT6 cells. Three copies of the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region increased luciferase activity 17-fold in QT6 cells and 13-fold in CES cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f3">3</xref>A). One copy of the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region also increased luciferase activity in both cell lines. This stimulatory effect was independent of the orientation of the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region too. To test this enhancer activity on the <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter, we placed one or three copies of the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region upstream of the &#x02013;179/&#x0002b;83 <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter region (p179-luc construct). This minimal promoter contains a TATA-like box as a known <italic>cis</italic>-acting element, and has a weak transcriptional activity in CES cells. As with the SV40 basal promoter, one or three copies of the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region increased luciferase activity in CES and QT6 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f3">3</xref>B). However when the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region was placed upstream of the &#x02013;179/&#x0002b;83 <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter, in QT6 cells, the activation level decreased strongly compared to the basal SV40 promoter (from 17-fold to 4-fold with three copies of the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region and from 10-fold to 3-fold with one copy). In contrast, the level of activation was not altered in CES cells (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f3">3</xref>A and B).</p><p>As a whole, these results indicate that the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region acts as a transcriptional enhancer for the expression of a reporter gene in undifferentiated CES cells as well as in QT6 cells. Moreover, when located upstream of the &#x02013;179/&#x0002b;83 region, this &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region is specifically active in undifferentiated CES cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Two distinct protein&#x02013;DNA interacting regions are located in the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region</title><p>To investigate potential DNA&#x02013;protein binding sites located in the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region and involved in <italic>cENS-1/ERNI</italic> promoter activity, we performed gel retardation experiments using CES cells nuclear extracts. Seven overlapping oligonucleotides were designed to cover the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f4">4</xref>A). The putative AP-1 site identified <italic>in silico</italic> and located in probe I was apparently not bound <italic>in vitro</italic> by nuclear proteins from CES cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f4">4</xref>B, lane 2). In contrast, the oligonucleotides II, V and VI were bound by CES nuclear factors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f4">4</xref>B, lanes 5, 14 and 17). These three complexes were competed for by 100-fold molar excess of the respective unlabeled oligonucleotides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f4">4</xref>B, lanes 6, 15 and 18). The DNA&#x02013;protein complexes observed with probes V and VI migrated to the same positions suggesting that they are identical and located on a DNA sequence situated between positions &#x02013;251 and &#x02013;230 of the ENS-1 promoter, in the overlapping region of the V and VI oligonucleotides.

A unique DNA&#x02013;protein complex was detected with the labeled probe incubated with CES nuclear extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f6">6</xref>B, lane 2). A competition with 10- or 100-fold molar excess of wild-type B oligonucleotide strongly decreased the signal corresponding to the DNA&#x02013;protein complex, confirming the specificity of this interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f6">6</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4). A competition with a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides mutated, respectively, on the C<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>11</sub> and G<sub>14</sub> residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f6">6</xref>A), which are important for DNA&#x02013;protein interaction as proven by methylation interference analysis, did not decrease the signal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f6">6</xref>B, lanes 5 to 8). These results confirmed that each of these four nucleotides are essential for the interaction with nuclear binding proteins. It also demonstrates that each part of the direct repeat is necessary for DNA&#x02013;protein complex formation. To determine whether each of the nucleotides of the B sequence participates in this interaction, mutated labeled probes covering the first part of the repeat were used in gel shift retardation assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f6">6</xref>A and C). Results showed that the interaction with nuclear proteins was abrogated only when the C<sub>1</sub> or the G<sub>4</sub> residues were mutated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f6">6</xref>C, lanes 1 and 4). A probe, in which the T<sub>5</sub> residue is mutated, exhibited a weaker signal compared to the wild-type probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f6">6</xref>C, lane 5), suggesting that this nucleotide improves the stabilization of the DNA&#x02013;protein complex. The same results were obtained with probes mutated in the second part of the direct repeat (not shown). The two parts of this direct repeat are separated by a linker of five nucleotides (CCAGG). In order to check the function of this spacing sequence, we tested probes containing spacers of different lengths. Band shift assays performed with these oligonucleotides are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f6">6</xref>D. Deletion or addition of three nucleotides to the linker decreased the interaction between DNA and nuclear factors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f6">6</xref>D, lanes 6 and 10), while the addition of six bases totally abolished the interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f6">6</xref>D, lane 14). The optimal B response element is then summarized by the sequence <bold>C</bold>AA<bold>G</bold>TNNNNN<bold>C</bold>AA<bold>G</bold>T where bold characters indicate bases essential for the DNA&#x02013;protein complex formation.</p></sec><sec><title>The B region is essential for promoter activation in CES cells</title><p>To test the enhancer activity of the B response element, multimers of this region were placed upstream of the SV40 basal promoter. The different constructs were transfected in parallel into CES cells and QT6 cells. One copy of the B region in sense or antisense orientation increased the activity of the basal SV40 promoter from 5&#x02013;7 fold in CES cells to 10-fold in QT6 cells. Three copies of the B region in sense or antisense orientation also strongly increased the activity of the basal SV40 promoter from 10-fold in CES cells to 20-fold in QT6 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f7">7</xref>A). In comparison, the mutated B response element was inactive in the two cell lines. These data prove that the B region exhibits an enhancer activity, like the &#x02013;308/&#x02013;180 region, and strongly suggest that it could be a key activator of the <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter. This hypothesis is also confirmed by targeted mutagenesis of the B response element in the p456-luc construct. In this construct, the cytosine residue of the first CNRG box in the B response element was substituted by an adenine residue (see Materials and Methods), leading <italic>in vitro</italic> to the loss of the protein&#x02013;DNA interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f6">6</xref>C). Compared to the wild-type &#x02013;456/&#x0002b;83 <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter, the promoter with a mutated B element exhibited a strong decrease in its activity in CES cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f7">7</xref>B) showing that the B response element plays an essential role within its natural sequence environment. All these data support the fact that the B element is essential for the <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter activation in CES cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The B response element is bound by the transcription factor CP2</title><p>Analysis of the B response element revealed that it is similar to the CP2 consensus binding sequence CNRG-N<sub>6</sub>-CNRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c20">20</xref>). The CP2 response element, like the B response element, is composed of a direct repeat essential for protein binding. In order to test whether the B response element is bound <italic>in vitro</italic> by the transcription factor CP2, we performed supershift experiments using a mouse monoclonal antibody, which recognizes human CP2. Addition of anti-CP2 to the reaction after complex formation generated antibody-dependent supershifts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f7">7</xref>C, lanes 4 to 6, top arrow) which were not seen with use of an IgG control antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f7">7</xref>C, lane 7). Increasing dilutions of the anti-CP2 progressively restored the unshifted DNA&#x02013;protein complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f7">7</xref>C, lanes 5 to 6, bottom arrow). The anti-CP2 incubated with nuclear extracts of CES cells did not interfere with the DNA&#x02013;protein complex formed with the A response element (not shown). To confirm the specificity of the anti-CP2, we performed immunoblots using protein extracts from CES and HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f7">7</xref>D). A band of 64 kDa was detected in undifferentiated and differentiated CES cells (lane 1 and 2) and HeLa cells (lane 3) at the described size of CP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c21">21</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the B response element binds the chicken CP2 transcription factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression pattern of chicken <italic>CP2</italic> in CES cells and early embryo</title><p>Chicken <italic>CP2</italic> has been previously shown to regulate the &#x003b1;A-crystallin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c21">21</xref>). Based on the <italic>cCP2</italic> cDNA sequence published in that reported work, we amplified the chicken <italic>CP2</italic> by PCR from RNAs extracted from CES cells indicating that <italic>cCP2</italic> is expressed in CES cells. <italic>In silico</italic> transduction of this <italic>cCP2</italic> coding sequence (GenBank accession no. AY298725) revealed an amino acid sequence, which is very similar to those of human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c22">22</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c23">23</xref>) and is also identical to the published sequence of chicken CP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c21">21</xref>), but with a small deletion of 10 amino acids (from position 323 to position 332). This small deletion is localized in the oligomerization domain (from position 266 to 403) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c24">24</xref>) but preserved the DNA binding domain (from position 189 to 239) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c21">21</xref>) and the serine 291, whose phosphorylation is important for CP2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c25">25</xref>). CP2 expression was detected in undifferentiated and differentiated CES cells by immunoblot using a mouse monoclonal anti-CP2 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f7">7</xref>D). These results are consistent with the fact that the B region is active in undifferentiated and differentiated cells when placed upstream of the SV40 basal promoter. The spatial pattern of the <italic>cCP2</italic> gene expression was examined during embryogenesis by whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. By using a probe located in the coding sequence of <italic>cCP2</italic>, we observed a particular expression pattern during early chick embryogenesis. <italic>cCP2</italic> is expressed in the epiblast of embryos at the pre-primitive streak stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f8">8</xref>A and B). In embryos at the primitive streak stage, it is also expressed in the extending primitive streak and in the prospective neural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c11">11</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f8">8</xref>C&#x02013;F). At stages 7 and 8, the <italic>cCP2</italic> expression was mostly localized in the neural folds and the somites of the embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f8">8</xref>G&#x02013;I) but also in the regressing primitive streak. Later at stage12, <italic>cCP2</italic> was ubiquitously expressed in the whole embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh545f8">8</xref>J). The pattern of expression before stage 12 is quite similar to that previously described for cENS-1/cERNI with few differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c11">11</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The <italic>cENS-1/cERNI</italic> gene is expressed specifically in CES cells, in the epiblast of chicken blastula as well as in the prospective neural plate of chick gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c11">11</xref>). Even though the functions of <italic>cENS-1/cERNI</italic> remain elusive either for the biology of CES cells or for the neural induction of embryonic ectoderm, its specific expression pattern is of particular interest to understand the mechanisms which lead to both the formation of the neural plate and the maintenance of cell pluripotency. These genes are so far the only genes identified with a specific expression in undifferentiated CES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c10">10</xref>). They can then be considered as endogenous reporter genes to identify transcription mechanisms and signaling pathways that might account for determining the pluripotency state of embryonic stem cells. Few mechanisms which regulate ES-specific gene expression have been identified so far. <italic>Oct-3/4</italic> is one of the genes whose specific expression in pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c28">28</xref>) and implication for transcriptional regulation of ES-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c3">3</xref>) are the best understood in the mouse. Analyzing the transcriptional regulation of <italic>cENS-1/cERNI</italic> will then provide new insights on ES-specific transcription regulatory mechanisms but also on neural induction. Therefore, the primary aim of our studies was to identify first specific regulatory elements located on the ENS promoter and then <italic>trans</italic>-activating factors that might be involved in the cell-specific activity of this promoter. Functional dissection of the <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter through testing in pluripotent ES cells versus differentiated cells, either differentiated cells derived from ES cells or fibroblast cells, lead us to identify two main ways of regulating the <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter. One way, described in this study, is mediated by the CP2 transcription factor, which works as a transcriptional activator. Another still not fully identified pathway, induces a selective repression of the <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter in differentiated cells.</p><sec><title>Identification of CP2 transcription factor as essential for <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter activation</title><p>Molecular and functional assays clearly led to identifying a consensus CP2 responsive element (5&#x02032;-CAAGTCC AGGCAAGT-3&#x02032;) in the <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter. Specific mutation of this response element strongly abrogates the function of the promoter in transient transfection assay in CES cells. Moreover, bandshift assay clearly demonstrated the presence of the nuclear factor CP2 in CES cells. Cloning of the chicken <italic>CP2</italic> product in CES cells confirmed the identity and expression of <italic>cCP2</italic> in these cells. <italic>CP2</italic> (also known as <italic>LSF</italic> or <italic>LBP-1c</italic>) belongs to a transcription factor family whose founding member is the <italic>Drosophila grainyhead</italic> (also known as <italic>NTF-1</italic> or <italic>Elf-1</italic>) gene, an important factor in developmental patterning in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c31">31</xref>). The phylogenetic tree of this transcription factor family is composed of two distinct branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c32">32</xref>). The first contains <italic>grainyhead</italic> and its homologue mammalian <italic>grainyhead</italic> (<italic>MGR</italic>), <italic>brother of MGR</italic> (<italic>BOM</italic>) and <italic>sister of MGR</italic> (<italic>SOM</italic>). The second contains <italic>dCP2</italic> and the mammalian <italic>CP2</italic>, <italic>LBP1-a</italic> (<italic>NF2d9</italic> for the mouse homologue) and <italic>LBP-9</italic> (<italic>CRTR-1</italic> in the mouse) genes. <italic>CP2</italic> controls the expression of a wide range of genes in human, mouse or chicken cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c38">38</xref>). RT&#x02013;PCR amplification of <italic>cCP2</italic> and immunoblots using two distinct anti-CP2 antibodies revealed that it is expressed in QT6 and CES cells (not shown), in addition to published data indicating that <italic>cCP2</italic> is expressed ubiquitously in chick embryonic tissues from stage 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c21">21</xref>). Our present data show that <italic>cCP2</italic> is differentially expressed in cell layers and tissues of the early chicken embryo. First, <italic>cCP2</italic> is expressed in the epiblast of chick gastrula in the tissue from which CES cells are derived. However, during gastrulation, <italic>cCP2</italic> expression is stronger in the primitive streak and the Hensen node and is absent in the non-neural ectoderm of stage 3 and 4 embryos. This is consistent with a previous study which demonstrated that a graft of the Hensen node induced <italic>cENS-1/cERNI</italic> expression in the area opaca of chicken embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c11">11</xref>). This also suggests that <italic>cCP2</italic> could be essential for <italic>cENS-1/cERNI</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic> because its absence in the non-neural ectoderm is correlated with the absence of <italic>cENS-1/cERNI</italic> in this tissue. As expression of the <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter in transient transfection assays strongly depends on the integrity of the CP2-response element, we might consider that CP2 is the major transcription activator of <italic>cENS-1</italic> gene. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude a contribution from other transcription factors, whose binding sites were identified <italic>in silico</italic> in the promoter sequence. However, the observation that major expression of <italic>cCP2</italic> in the early embryo (before and around gastrulation) strongly correlates with that of <italic>cENS-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh545c10">10</xref>), is highly supportive of a major role attributable to <italic>cCP2</italic> in the regulation of the expression of <italic>cENS-1</italic> during early chicken embryogenesis. In the mouse, the expression pattern of <italic>CP2</italic> is not described at gastrulation stages. Preliminary experiments indicate that CP2 is expressed in mouse ES cells and that the B region is also active in mouse ES cells (unpublished results). Together, these data support the idea that CP2 could be an important regulator of gene expression in embryonic stem cells.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh545f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structure of <italic>cENS-1</italic> promoter.
