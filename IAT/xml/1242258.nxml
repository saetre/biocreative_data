Although the IFN-&#x003b1;/rivabirin is the only approved therapy with 10&#x02013;30% clinical efficacy, the protective molecular mechanism involved during the treatment is still unknown. To analyze the effect of HCV polyprotein expression on the antiviral response of the host, we developed a novel vaccinia virus (VV)-based delivery system (VT7-HCV7.9) where structural and nonstructural (except part of NS5B) proteins of HCV ORF from genotype 1b are efficiently expressed and produced, and timely regulated in mammalian cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Regulated transcript production and viral polypeptide processing was demonstrated in various cell lines infected with the recombinant VT7-HCV7.9, indicating that the cellular and viral proteolytic machineries are functional within these cells. The inducible expression of the HCV polyprotein by VV inhibits the synthesis of both host and viral proteins over the time and also induces apoptosis in HeLa and HepG2-infected cells. These effects occur accompanying with the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF-2&#x003b1;. In cells co-infected with VT7-HCV7.9 and a recombinant VV expressing the dominant negative eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51A mutant in the presence of the inductor isopropyl-thiogalactoside (IPTG), protein synthesis is rescued. The IFN-inducible protein kinase PKR is responsible for the translational block, as demonstrated with PKR-/- and PKR+/+ cell lines. However, apoptosis induced by VT7-HCV7.9 is mediated by the RNase L pathway, in a PKR-independent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings demonstrate the antiviral relevance of the proteins induced by interferon, PKR and RNase L during expression from a VV recombinant of the HCV polyprotein in human cell lines. HCV polyprotein expression caused a severe cytopathological effect in human cells as a result of inhibition of protein synthesis and apoptosis induction, triggered by the activation of the IFN-induced enzymes PKR and RNase L systems. Thus, the virus-cell system described here highlights the relevance of the IFN system as a protective mechanism against HCV infection.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was identified as the causative agent for the majority of posttransfusion and sporadic non-A, and non-B hepatitis cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The World health organization (WHO) estimates that more than 3% of the world's population is infected with the virus. HCV belongs to the genus of Hepacivirus and is a member of the <italic>Flaviviridae </italic>family, along with Pestivirus and Flavivirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The HCV genome is a positively charged single stranded RNA molecule that includes two untranslated regions at the 5' and 3' ends, and a large open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 3010&#x02013;3030 amino acid polyprotein that is co- and posttranslationally cleaved by cellular and viral proteases to produce mature structural (Core, E1, E2 and p7) and nonstructural (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. One striking characteristic of HCV is its strong propensity to persist in the infected host, which often leads to severe liver damage, ranging from chronic hepatitis to liver cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The IFN-&#x003b1; monotherapy became the mainstay for treatment of HCV infection until recently, when IFN-&#x003b1;/ribavirin, and pegylated IFN-&#x003b1;/ribavirin combination therapies became available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The IFN-based regimens are still the only approved therapies for HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although the beneficial effect has been documented by numerous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], only 10&#x02013;40% of patients respond to treatment. The molecular mechanisms involved in protection during IFN therapy are not fully understood. Due to the clinical relevance of HCV infection and the differential responses of patients to IFN therapy, it is essential to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the sensitivity and resistance patterns of HCV infection in an appropriate model system.</p><p>In order to establish a robust <italic>in vitro </italic>infection model system for HCV, a variety of different approaches, mainly those based on infection with human patient sera of primary human liver cells or diverse cell lines of hepatic or lymphoid origin, have been explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Nonetheless, so far the success of these attempts has been limited due to the extremely low HCV replication levels that prevent detailed studies. The development of subgenomic HCV replicons that generates high-level replication of HCV RNAs in cell culture, has overcome this hurdle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In spite of an efficient expression of the structural proteins and high levels of replication, it has not been possible to generate viral particles in cell cultures. Moreover, important information on the potential effect of the structural proteins on the host cell could not be obtained. An alternative approach has been viral delivery systems. In such systems, cells are transfected with a plasmid containing a cDNA clone under the control of a T7 promoter, and then infected with a virus that expresses T7 RNA polymerase. Although this approach has been met with some degree of success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], it is limited by the efficiency with which the plasmid can be transfected into hosts cells. In the case of hepatocyte derived cell lines, the transfection efficiency is often rather low. This inefficiency could be overcome in certain cases, by using recombinant fowlpox viruses to deliver HCV minigenomes under the control of a T7 promoter into cells co-infected with an adenovirus expressing T7 RNA polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although this system improved the efficiency of delivery, it was not possible to control HCV gene expression. Recently, a virus production system has been developed which is based on the transfection of the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 with a genomic HCV RNA replicon derived from an individual with fulminant hepatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The limited virus yields and virus spread of this cell culture system has been improved using a particular permissive cell line derived from Huh-7 designated Huh-7.5.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This provides a significant advance in order to understand the biology of HCV infection in culture systems.</p><p>To characterize the antiviral response of the host during expression of the HCV polyprotein, we developed a novel poxvirus-based delivery system (VT7-HCV7.9), that is inducible and able to express structural and nonstructural (except part of NS5B) proteins of HCV ORF from genotype 1b in hepatic and non-hepatic mammalian cell lines. In this virus-cell system, we observed that HCV polyprotein expression controls cellular translation through eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51 phosphorylation, with involvement of the IFN-inducible double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR. Moreover, in VT7-HCV7.9 infected cells, we found that HCV polyprotein expression brings about an apoptotic response through the activation of the RNase L pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the near full-length HCV genome under regulation (VT7-HCV7.9)</title><p>In order to study the effect of HCV gene expression on host cellular mechanisms, we developed a novel system based on a poxvirus vector that when induced, expresses the structural and nonstructural (except part of NS5B) proteins of HCV ORF from genotype 1b. Briefly, BSC40 cells infected with the recombinant VT7lacOI virus, that inducibly expresses the T7 RNA polymerase, were transfected with the plasmid transfer vector pVOTE.1-HCV7.9. This transfer vector directs the insertion of the HCV DNA fragment into the viral hemagglutinin (HA) locus under the transcriptional control of the T7 promoter, to generate the recombinant VT7-HCV7.9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Upon induction with IPTG, the T7 RNA polymerase is expressed which in turn, allows the transcription of HCV genes in VT7-HCV7.9 infected cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Construction and characterization of the recombinant VT7-HCV7.9 virus</bold>. <bold>A</bold>: Generation of recombinant VT7-HCV7.9.

Continuous metabolic labelling of BSC40 cells infected with VT7-HCV7.9 in the presence of IPTG, revealed by SDS-PAGE the synthesis of polypeptides not present in the absence of IPTG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, see new proteins denoted with asteriks). Significantly, in the presence of IPTG, overall protein synthesis was reduced in VT7-HCV7.9 infected cells when compared to protein synthesis in the absence of the inductor. This translational inhibitory effect was specific, since protein synthesis was not affected in cells infected with VT7, with or without IPTG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The synthesis of HCV proteins in VT7-HCV7.9 infected cells was also documented by Western blot analysis, using sera from an HCV-infected patient. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, HCV proteins of the expected size, for structural and nonstructural polypeptides, were detected only in VT7-HCV7.9 infected cells upon induction with IPTG. The size of specific HCV proteins was confirmed following reactivity with antibodies against Core, E2, NS4B and NS5A (not shown). A heterogeneous pattern of HCV-specific proteins was observed, perhaps as a result of different stages of proteolytic processing of the polyprotein. Confocal microscopy using sera from an infected patient revealed that the HCV proteins expressed in VT7-HCV7.9 infected cells upon induction with IPTG, formed large cytoplasmic aggregates and produced severe disruption of the golgi apparatus, a phenomenon not observed in cells infected in the absence of IPTG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

As a control, we included a recombinant VT7-VP3 inducibly expressing the IBDV capsid protein VP3. This virus was constructed similarly to VT7-HCV7.9, and expresses an mRNA encoding VP3 ORF from the vaccinia virus genome via T7 polymerase. Cells infected with VT7-HCV7.9, in the presence or absence of IPTG, were metabolically labelled for 30 min with <sup>35</sup>S-Met-Cys Promix at 4, 8, 12 and 16 h.p.i., whole cell lysates fractionated by SDS-PAGE and the protein pattern examined by autoradiography. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, a clear reduction in cellular and viral protein synthesis was observed after 4 h.p.i in cells infected with the recombinant VT7-HCV7.9 virus in the presence of IPTG, in contrast with cells infected in the absence of the inductor, or in cells inducibly expressing the VP3 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

As such, we determined whether HCV polyprotein expression altered this initiation step. Thus, the levels of phospho-eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51 in VT7-HCV7.9 infected cells, in the presence or absence of IPTG, were determined by immunoblot analysis.

A shorter time-course analysis of the extent of inhibition of protein synthesis and of eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51 phosphorylation indicates that such effects are clearly observed by 6 h.p.i in VT7-HCV7.9 infected cultures in the presence of IPTG (not shown).</p><p>To further assess the role of eIF-2&#x003b1; phosphorylation on the translational arrest, we examined whether expression of the dominant negative non-phosphorylated mutant Ser51-Ala (eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51A) was capable of rescuing the translation inhibitory effects of HCV gene expression. To this end, different combinations of recombinant viruses, VT7-HCV7.9, VT7 and VV-eIF2&#x003b1;NP (inducibly expressing the eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51A mutant), were assayed in the presence or absence of IPTG.

Consequently, both viral and host factors have been implicated during the effective clinical response or resistance phenomenon of patients to IFN treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Different <italic>in vitro </italic>model systems have been developed to study the role of HCV polyprotein on host cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The implication of IFN-induced genes and their action in the antiviral response of the host to HCV expression is not yet fully understood.</p><p>To further characterize the antiviral response of the host during expression of HCV polyprotein, we developed a novel virus-cell system based on a poxvirus vector, that inducibly expresses the structural and nonstructural (except part of NS5B) proteins of HCV ORF from genotype 1b. The generated recombinant VT7-HCV7.9 virus contains the HCV DNA coding region inserted within the VV HA locus, under the transcriptional control of a T7 promoter, and expresses the T7 RNA polymerase upon induction with IPTG (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Current systems relying on viral delivery of T7 RNA polymerase are restricted by the efficiency with which HCV cDNAs can be transfected into cells, which in the case of hepatocyte and hepatocyte-derived cell lines, is often low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The poxvirus-based system described here permits both the regulated production of the HCV transcripts into cells and the efficient delivery of the HCV genome into a wide variety of primary and continuous cell lines.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that upon induction with IPTG, HCV proteins are efficiently produced in VT7-HCV7.9 infected cells of various origins. This observation indicates that the DNA fragment of HCV ORF included in the VV genome, is efficiently transcribed and translated into a viral polyprotein precursor that is correctly processed into mature structural and nonstructural HCV proteins, as confirmed with specific antibodies to individual HCV proteins. Significantly, inducible expression of HCV polyprotein in VT7-HCV7.9 infected cells caused a considerable reduction in the production of infectious VV, as well as striking inhibition in total protein synthesis, both viral and cellular. The translational block was observed by 6 h.p.i when all of the HCV proteins were produced. The inhibition of protein synthesis by HCV was highly specific and could not be solely attributed to the induction of HCV RNA transcript since cells infected with VT7-VP3 that expressed the IBDV ORF VP3 mRNA, did not trigger translational inhibition. Furthermore, the HCV ORF included in the VT7-HCV7.9 recombinant virus lacks the 5' UTR, bearing the HCV IRES, and the 3' UTR, both implicated in HCV replication and liver injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The inhibition of protein synthesis that we have observed in induced VT7-HCV7.9 infected HeLa and HepG2 cells was associated with a significant increase in the phospho-eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51 levels, suggesting that HCV expression might control the cellular translation through eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51 phosphorylation. This translational control was confirmed with a dominant negative non-phosphorylated (NP) mutant Ser51-Ala (eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51A). Expression of the eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51A mutant in cells co-infected with VV-eIF-2&#x003b1;-NP and VT7-HCV7.9 in the presence of IPTG, rescued the translational block induced by HCV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Moreover, we showed that phosphorylation of eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51 was carried out by the cellular kinase PKR, as revealed in knockout PKR-/- cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The role of PKR and eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51 phosphorylation in HCV infection has been widely studied due to the relevance of this kinase in the cellular antiviral response. As has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], PKR mediated phosphorylation of eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51 results in inhibition of translation and a blockade of viral protein synthesis, which in turn, inhibits virus replication. For this reason, viruses employ a variety of strategies to inhibit PKR activation and function. Several groups have described the role of certain HCV proteins in cellular translation. HCV NS4A and NS4B proteins mediate translational inhibition and, perhaps, increased degradation of certain cellular proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In contrast, NS5A and E2 proteins are reported to enhance translation by inhibiting PKR functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Therefore, it seems that during the course of HCV infection, there is a balance between inhibition and enhancement of host cell translation depending on the degree of activation/inhibition of the PKR pathway. Most of these studies have relied on systems that express HCV proteins individually. Nontheless, since all HCV proteins are potentially produced <italic>in vivo </italic>during virus infection of hepatocytes, it is important to use a full-length genome rather than individual HCV proteins to study the molecular mechanisms involved in virus-host cell interactions and in HCV pathogenesis. In our viral delivery system, the overall expression of structural and nonstructural HCV proteins by recombinant VT7-HCV7.9 virus did not reverse the action of PKR, since host cell translation was inhibited through phosphorylation of eIF-2&#x003b1;-S51 by the kinase. An incapability to prevent PKR activation by HCV polyprotein expression was reported by Fran&#x000e7;ois and co-workers when they analysed the response to IFN of the human cell line UHCV-11 engineered to inducibly express the entire HCV genotype 1a polyprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Although we could not exclude the possibility that a certain level of inhibition of PKR by NS5A or E2 occurs at a much localized level, the resistance to IFN exhibited by some HCV genotypes as a result of viral protein expression, cannot be explained solely by inhibition of the negative control of PKR translation. It is possible that during the course of HCV infection, NS5A plays a role in inhibiting PKR locally at the site of HCV protein synthesis. NS5A may, however, participate in the blockade of IFN's antiviral action through another mechanism, such as the reported interaction with the Ras-associated Grb-2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. These results confirm the necessity to re-evaluate all types of interactions between any particular HCV protein and its cellular partner(s) in the context of expression of all of the HCV proteins. Consequently, as shown here by confocal microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), the HCV proteins are localized within aggregates in the cell cytoplasm which might influence their interaction with PKR, a protein found surrounding the nucleus, in microsomes and in the nucleolus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Several <italic>in vitro </italic>studies reveal that synthesis of HCV structural proteins or the full-length genome have a direct cytotoxic effect or activate an apoptotic response in osteosarcoma, hepatoma and B cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Furthermore, the alteration of ER membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and the activation of signalling pathways characteristic of an ER-stress condition, have been found to be associated with the expression of HCV proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Although these data suggest that HCV may alter intracellular events with possible consequences on liver pathogenesis, the complex mechanism and the role of the viral proteins implicated are currently unknown. As we have shown in this work, expression of most of the HCV genome from VV induces a cell death phenomenon by apoptosis that should contribute to liver pathogenesis. Apoptosis induced by HCV polyprotein expression was prevented by Bcl-2 and by a general caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) indicating a caspase-dependent death process. Even though PKR is the main kinase responsible for eIF-2&#x003b1; phosphorylation and for translation inhibition induced by the expression of HCV in VT7-HCV7.9 infected cells, it does not appear to be involved in apoptosis within this system, as revealed from studies performed in PKR+/+ and PKR-/- knockout cells. The extent of apoptosis induction by HCV expression was the same in PKR+/+ and in PKR-/- cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>), suggesting that other pathways may be involved. PKR induces apoptosis in response to activation by different stimuli, such as the accumulation of dsRNA as a by-product during virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], or when PKR is overexpressed in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Several authors, however, have reported that PKR can also be activated through the binding of heparin and other polyanions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], or by the cellular activator protein PACT/RAX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. The events that mediate induction of apoptosis by PKR have been widely studied and both PKR-induced translational block by phosphorylation of eIF-2&#x003b1;, and NF-kB activation, have been shown to be activated during apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Since PKR has a number of potential substrates and signalling targets, it is likely that the phosphorylation of eIF-2&#x003b1; by PKR in response to HCV expression is not sufficient to mediate the pro-apoptotic effects of this kinase.</p><p>In this study, we also demonstrate the activation of endogenous RNase L and its role in the apoptosis induced by HCV expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A,C</xref>). Although it is widely accepted that the IFN-induced proteins PKR and RNase L require the expression of dsRNA for their activation (either directly in the case of PKR or indirectly via 2'-5'-OAS in the case of RNase L), there are several reports that documented the effect of HCV proteins on PKR and 2'-5'-OAS activation. The NS5A and E2 proteins can suppress the PKR pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], whereas the Core protein can transcriptionally activate the 2'-5'-OAS gene through an IRES present within IFN-inducible gene promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Like PKR, the 2-5AS/RNase L system can control virus growth by inducing apoptosis in response to viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Overexpression of RNase L or activation of the endogenous enzyme induces apoptosis by a mitochondrial-caspase dependent pathway that is suppressed by Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Similarly, apoptosis induced by HCV polyprotein expression was inhibited by Bcl-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Although the apoptotic levels induced by HCV proteins remain invariable in PKR+/+, PKR-/-, and RL+/+ cells, the levels are significantly decreased in RL-/- cells, indicating that inducible expression of HCV proteins by VT7-HCV7.9 triggers apoptosis through RNase L in a PKR-independent pathway. Under physiologic conditions, RNase L activity is tightly regulated by 2'-phosphodiesterase and RNase L inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] such that only a limited activation of RNase L occurs. The mechanism of the regulation of RNase L inhibitor is unknown, but the reduction of its expression seems to be advantageous for host defence together with the enhanced 2-5 OAS activity. Yu and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] described that hepatic overexpression of PKR mRNA, and reduced expression of an RNase L inhibitor mRNA, are parameters that seem to contribute to an anti-HCV response. In agreement with our results, it has been reported that the absence of RNase L has an anti-apoptotic effect in multiple cell types treated with a variety of different agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The effects that have been observed in this study upon HCV polyprotein expression from VV are likely to have biological significance during HCV infection as there is ample evidence that VV recombinants can be used to study the function of multiple genes and that the assigned function mimics the effects described in non-viral systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have developed an efficient viral delivery system expressing the polyprotein of HCV in numerous mammalian cell lines in a faithfully, efficient and time regulated manner, allowing us to analyze the host response to HCV proteins.

These two pathways are likely to limit the replication capacity of HCV.

All VV recombinants were grown in BSC40 cells and purified by banding on sucrose gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of the recombinant vaccinia VT7-HCV7.9 virus</title><p>A 7.9 Kb DNA fragment containing the structural (C, E1, E2 and p7) and nonstructural (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and the amino terminal region of NS5B) proteins of HCV ORF from genotype 1b was excised with <italic>EcoRI </italic>from the original full-length HCV genome containing plasmid pcDNA-hcv1b (kindly provided by Ilkka Julkunen from National Public Health Institute, Finland). This DNA fragment was cloned into the VV insertion/expression vector pVOTE.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>] previously digested with <italic>EcoRI </italic>and dephosphorylated by incubation with alkaline phosphatase, Calf Intestinal (CIP) as described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. The resulting plasmid, pVOTE.1-HCV7.9 directs the insertion of HCV genes into the HA locus of the VT7lacOI genome under the transcriptional control of the T7 promoter. BSC40 cells were infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus VT7lacOI at a multiplicity of 0.05 PFU/cell, and then transfected with 10 &#x003bc;g of plasmid DNA pVOTE.1-HCV7.9 using lipofectamine reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The selection and amplification of the recombinant VT7-HCV7.9 virus was carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. The purity of the recombinant virus was confirmed by PCR analysis. The plasmid pVOTE.1 as well as the VV recombinant VT7lacOI, were kindly provided by Bernard Moss (NIH, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolic labelling of proteins</title><p>Different cell lines grown in 12 well plates were infected at an infection multiplicity of 5 PFU/cell with the viruses indicated, and maintained either in the presence or absence of the inductor isopropyl-&#x003b2;-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (1.5 mM final concentration). For continuous metabolic labelling of proteins, the cells were rinsed three times with Met-Cys-free DMEM at 4 h post-infection (p.i) and incubated with 100 &#x003bc;Ci of [<sup>35</sup>S] Met-Cys Promix (Amersham) per mL in a mixture of Met-Cys-free DMEM and complete DMEM (9:1) for 16&#x02013;20 h. After three washes with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) cells were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and analysed by sodium-dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by autoradiography. For discontinuous metabolic labelling of proteins, the cells were rinsed three times and incubated with Met-Cys-free DMEM 30 minutes prior to labelling. After incubation, the medium was removed and 50 &#x003bc;Ci of [<sup>35</sup>S] Met-Cys Promix per mL in Met-Cys-free DMEM was added for an additional 30 minutes. The cells were washed with PBS and treated as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>The HCV-antibody positive human sera used in this study was kindly provided by Dr Rafael Fern&#x000e1;ndez from the Ram&#x000f3;n and Cajal Hospital (Spain). The rabbit polyclonal anti-serum against live vaccinia virus was previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. The rabbit polyclonal anti eIF2&#x003b1; [PS<sup>51</sup>] phosphospecific antibody was supplied by BIOSOURCE. The monoclonal antibody against &#x003b2;-actin was supplied by SIGMA. Rabbit polyclonal anti-eIF2&#x003b1; antibody was supplied by Santa Cruz, CA.</p><p>For immunoblot analyses, total cell extracts were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Gelman Sciences). Filters were mixed with antisera in PBS containing non-fat dry milk at 5% (BLOTTO), incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, washed three times with PBS, and further incubated with secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase in BLOTTO. After the PBS wash, the immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescense Western blotting reagents (ECL) (Amersham).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Specific antibody for Golgi apparatus (anti-Gigantine) was kindly provided by Manfred Renz from the Institute of Immunology and Genetics Karlsruhe (Germany).</p><p>HeLa cells cultured on coverslips were infected at 5 PFU/cell with VT7-HCV7.9 in the presence or absence of IPTG (1.5 mM final concentration). At 16 h.p.i, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 2% Triton X-100 in PBS (room temperature, 5 min). Cells were incubated with a human antibody recognizing HCV proteins together with anti-Gigantine antibody. Coverslips were then extensively washed with PBS, and incubated in darkness for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, with secondary antibody conjugated with green fluorochrome Cy2 (Jackson Immunoresearch) and with the DNA staining reagent ToPro (Molecular Probes). Images were obtained by using Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal laser microscope, were collected by using Lasersharp 2000 software and were processed in LaserPix.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of the extent of apoptosis</title><p>The cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Roche) was used according to manufacturer's instructions.
