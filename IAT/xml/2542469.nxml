They interact directly with one another and with cytoplasmic dynein. The developing brain is especially sensitive to reduced Lis1 or Ndel1 levels, as both proteins influence spindle orientation, neural cell fate decisions, and neuronal migration. We report here that Lis1 and Ndel1 reduction in a mitotic cell line impairs prophase nuclear envelope (NE) invagination (PNEI). This dynein-dependent process facilitates NE breakdown (NEBD) and occurs before the establishment of the bipolar spindle. Ndel1 phosphorylation is important for this function, regulating binding to both Lis1 and dynein. Prophase cells in the ventricular zone (VZ) of embryonic day 13.5 <italic>Lis1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse brains show reduced PNEI, and the ratio of prophase to prometaphase cells is increased, suggesting an NEBD delay. Moreover, prophase cells in the VZ contain elevated levels of Ndel1 phosphorylated at a key cdk5 site. Our data suggest that a delay in NEBD in the VZ could contribute to developmental defects associated with Lis1&#x02013;Ndel1 disruption.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: BP, basal progenitor; co-IP, coimmunoprecipitation; DHC, dynein heavy chain; DIC, dynein intermediate chain; LAP2, lamin-associated protein 2; NE, nuclear envelope; NEBD, NE breakdown; NRK, normal rat kidney; PNEI, prophase NE invagination; RG, radial glia; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; S/T-P, Ser/Thr-Pro; VZ, ventricular zone.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Lis1 haploinsufficiency causes a severe developmental brain disorder in humans, type 1 lissencephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cardoso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Mei et al., 2008</xref>).

The C terminus of Lis1 binds to a microtubule motor, cytoplasmic dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Reiner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>), whereas the N terminus contains a LisH homodimerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kim et al., 2004</xref>). Between these domains is a coiled-coil region that provides flexibility to the Lis1 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tarricone et al., 2004</xref>). Ndel1 contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain that interacts with Lis1 and an unstructured C terminus possessing five Ser/Thr-Pro (S/T-P) sites targeted by Pro-directed kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Niethammer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Derewenda et al., 2007</xref>). Ndel1 also binds directly to dynein. In fact, Lis1 and Ndel1 are thought to associate with cytoplasmic dynein as a heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tarricone et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Cytoplasmic dynein is a multisubunit complex that contributes to processes requiring force generation. Dynein interacts with membranes through another multisubunit protein, dynactin, which also regulates dynein processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">King and Schroer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schroer, 2004</xref>). Although evidence that Lis1 and Ndel1 regulate dynein is accumulating, the precise mechanism is unclear. Lis1 modestly stimulates dynein's ATPase function in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mesngon et al., 2006</xref>), and there is evidence for functional interactions in several organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vallee and Tsai, 2006</xref>). Reduction of Lis1 in developing rat neurons inhibited interkinetic nuclear oscillations in the ventricular zone (VZ), reduced mitosis, and perturbed the acquisition of a bipolar morphology in the subventricular/intermediate zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tsai et al., 2005</xref>). In mice, reduction of Lis1, Ndel1, or dynein heavy chain (DHC) disrupted the link between the centrosome and the nucleus in migrating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shu et al., 2004</xref>). Lis1 overexpression could partly compensate for Ndel1 reduction, but not vice versa. Neither protein was able to rescue DHC deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sasaki et al., 2005</xref>). More recently, Lis1 reduction was shown to alter spindle orientation in neuroepithelial stem cells so that the cellular cleavage plane was biased toward asymmetrical cell divisions and neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>). It was hypothesized that this resulted in the early depletion of a progenitor pool.</p><p>Two observations prompted us to explore another process that might be influenced by Lis1 pathways. The first was that dynein activity facilitated nuclear envelope (NE) breakdown (NEBD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Salina et al., 2002</xref>) by promoting prophase NE invagination (PNEI) in a microtubule-dependent manner, resulting in NE tearing. The second observation was a curious enrichment of Lis1 at the NE in prophase cells and in cells treated with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smith et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coquelle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cockell et al., 2004</xref>). These observations suggest that Lis1 could function in neuroepithelial stem cells before its role in spindle orientation by contributing to dynein-dependent PNEI. We used in vivo and in vitro approaches to explore this possibility and found that both Lis1 and Ndel1 influence PNEI in cultured cell lines and in the developing mouse brain. Furthermore, we find that Ndel1 phosphorylation may be a key regulatory step and, as such, could fine tune the timing of NEBD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Reducing Lis1 expression in COS-7 cells reduces PNEI</title><p>As expected, Lis1 and Ndel1 accumulated at the NE and within invaginations in prophase cells (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803071/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803071/DC1</ext-link>). PNEI can be quantified by examining prophase nuclei labeled with Hoechst dye and determining the percentage with invaginations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To determine whether Lis1 is important for PNEI, we transiently expressed a Lis1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which reduced Lis1 expression by 80% after 48 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). An shRNA for DHC reduced DHC expression by 70%. Scrambled sequences were used as negative controls. Lis1 shRNA reduced PNEI by &#x0223c;40%, whereas DHC RNAi reduced PNEI by &#x0223c;50% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The data support a model in which Lis1, like dynein, facilitates NEBD by promoting PNEI.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Lis1 and Ndel1 contribute to PNEI.</bold> (A) COS-7 cell nuclei labeled with Hoechst.

Therefore, we anticipated that reducing Ndel1 expression might have a similar effect on PNEI. The Ndel1 shRNA reduced Ndel1 protein expression by &#x0223c;50% in 48 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, top) and also reduced PNEI by &#x0223c;50% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The phenotype was rescued by coexpression of human myc-tagged Ndel1, so the level of expression of wild-type Ndel1 from the cytomegalovirus promoter was apparently high enough to overcome shRNA expression driven by the U6 promoter. Interestingly, the phenotype was not rescued by coexpression of an Ndel1 construct with mutations in five key cdk phosphorylation sites (Ndel15A; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Thus, Ndel1 phosphorylation could be a regulatory step in PNEI.</p></sec><sec><title>Increasing Lis1 or Ndel1 expression in COS-7 cells increases PNEI</title><p>We expected that transient overexpression of Lis1 or Ndel1 would block PNEI by disrupting normal stoichiometry of protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Instead, we found that overexpression of Lis1 nearly doubled PNEI compared with controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). This was dependent on intact microtubules, as the increase was blocked by nocodazole (unpublished data). A mutant construct that expresses an N-terminal fragment of Lis1 containing the LisH domain reduced PNEI by 50%, suggesting that Lis1 dimers are likely to be used during dynein-dependent PNEI. This fragment did not accumulate at the prophase NE (unpublished data), so the redistribution of Lis1 to the NE may also depend on homodimerization. Overexpression of Ndel1 was found to have a similar effect on PNEI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). This supports a model in which Ndel1 and Lis1 promote the microtubule-dependent invaginations attributed to dynein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beaudouin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Salina et al., 2002</xref>). Lis1 and Ndel1 expression may be elevated in prophase cells (Fig. S1, A and E), so transient overexpression of either protein may recapitulate or hasten a state conducive to PNEI.</p></sec><sec><title>S/T-P phosphorylation sites in Ndel1 are important for stimulation of PNEI</title><p>Interestingly, the phosphomutant Ndel15A did not induce PNEI. Normal PNEI was only modestly reduced by Ndel15A, so it did not significantly perturb endogenous Ndel1 function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). S197, T219, and S231 are targets for cdk5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Niethammer et al., 2000</xref>), whereas cdk1 targets S242 and T245 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yan et al., 2003</xref>). Because cdk5 mainly functions in postmitotic neurons, we expected that a construct in which S/T&#x02192;A mutations were restricted to the cdk5 sites (Ndel13A) would retain its ability to stimulate PNEI. However, this was not the case (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Both cdk5 and the cdk5 activator, p35, were present at substantial levels in COS-7 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>), raising the intriguing possibility that cdk5 activity is important during PNEI.</p><p>To further examine the role of phosphorylation, we increased or reduced cdk5 and cdk1 activity. The effect on PNEI was determined in cells with normal Ndel1 levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>) and in cells overexpressing Ndel1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Increasing cdk5 or cdk1 activity in the absence of Ndel1 overexpression did not alter PNEI. However, increasing the activity of both kinases almost doubled PNEI compared with controls. Furthermore, a significant inhibitory effect (50%) was observed when dominant-negative kinases (dncdk5 and dncdk1) were coexpressed. Neither dncdk5 nor dncdk1 was able to reduce PNEI when expressed individually, indicating that either (a) endogenous cdk5 or endogenous cdk1 is sufficient to allow normal PNEI to occur, or (b) the reagents incompletely inhibit their respective kinases. In fact, inhibiting cdk1 may actually increase PNEI (although this did not reach statistical significance), suggesting a complex relationship between the activity of this kinase and PNEI.</p><p>The aforementioned reagents produced somewhat different results when Ndel1 was also overexpressed. Cdk5 and cdk1 together enhanced PNEI over that stimulated by Ndel1. However, in this situation, the individual kinases were equally effective at stimulating PNEI. Expressing both dncdk5 and dncdk1 prevented PNEI induced by Ndel1 overexpression. However, PNEI was also inhibited when dncdk1 or dncdk5 was expressed individually, so each kinase alone is insufficient to fully phosphorylate ectopic Ndel1 at the appropriate sites to allow it to induce PNEI. Together, the data suggest that the activities of cdk5 and cdk1 can compensate for one another under some conditions. However, they also point to a dosage affect, i.e., the cell must have sufficient amounts of appropriately phosphorylated Ndel1 to carry out normal PNEI.</p></sec><sec><title>Ndel1 phosphorylation impacts Lis1 and dynein binding</title><p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> shows a schematic of Ndel1 indicating the positions of cdk target residues. The pS231Ab antibody was generated against a peptide phosphorylated at S231, which is thought to be targeted by cdk5, not cdk1. To gain more insight into the role of Ndel1 phosphorylation, we turned to in vitro assays with purified proteins. We exposed Ndel1 to cdk5/p25 (p25 is a stable fragment of p35), cdk1/cyclin B, or both. Cdk5/p25 caused a distinct Ndel1 banding pattern in Coomassie-stained gels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Cdk1/cyclin B produced a modest band shift. The band pattern observed when both kinases were included was distinct from that produced by cdk5 alone, indicating that both kinases target Ndel1 in vitro. pS231Ab recognized Ndel1 phosphorylated in vitro by cdk5 or by cdk5 and cdk1 together but not by cdk1 alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yan et al. (2003)</xref> demonstrated that an Ndel1 construct with S/T&#x02192;E mutations bound more Lis1. In support of this, we find that Ndel1 phosphorylated in vitro by both cdk5 and cdk1 pulled down approximately fivefold more Lis1 than unphosphorylated Ndel1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). This was also true in coimmunoprecipitations (coIPs) of Ndel1 or Ndel15A coexpressed with active or dominant-negative kinases in COS-7 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). We anticipated that Ndel1 phosphorylation would have a similar impact on dynein binding but found instead that more unphosphorylated Ndel1 coimmunoprecipitated with purified bovine brain dynein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Moreover, Ndel1 phosphorylation reduced the amount of Lis1 that coimmunoprecipitated with dynein, suggesting that phosphorylation not only strengthens Ndel1 binding to Lis1 but promotes the release of Lis1&#x02013;pNdel1 complexes from dynein. Phosphorylation by either kinase alone was insufficient to reduce dynein binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Thus, although it is clear that Ndel1 phosphorylation impacts its interactions with the dynein motor machinery and PNEI, phosphorylation by individual kinases could have different biological consequences than phosphorylation by both kinases.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Ndel1 phosphorylation alters Lis1 and dynein interactions.</bold> (A) Schematic of five S/T-P sites in Ndel1 showing the residue recognized by the pS231Ab antibody.

(2002)</xref> estimated that an NEBD delay was caused by microtubule disruption in living normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, which normally complete NEBD 10 min after the appearance of invaginations. After exposure to 1 &#x003bc;M nocodazole, the same process required 15 min. This represents a 5-min delay or a 50% increase in the duration of NEBD, which could have serious consequences in vivo. Our data do not allow us to estimate the duration of the delay caused by Lis1 deficiency. However, the finding that the proportion of mitotic cells with intact NEs was almost doubled in <italic>Lis1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> embryos suggests a significant delay, which could conceivably alter cell fate. Neural stem cells in the cortical VZ are classified as neuroepithelial cells, radial glia (RG), or basal progenitors (BPs), and these appear to be progressively more restricted in their cell fate potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gotz and Huttner, 2005</xref>). During early development, NE and RG cells undergo mitosis at the apical surface nearest the ventricle. They divide symmetrically to expand their population or asymmetrically to produce BP cells or neurons. BP cells divide at the basal surface of the VZ (away from the ventricle) and are more restricted in their potential, primarily giving rise to neurons. There is evidence that G2 is of longer duration in BP cells, which are more likely to produce neurons, than in NE or RG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Calegari et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, Lis1 loss causes increased neurogenesis at the expense of the stem cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>). Although this has been correlated with altered cleavage plane orientation, our data raise the intriguing possibility that the defect originates even earlier in response to delayed NEBD, which could drive cells toward the BP fate and division within the sub-VZ. Our newly established link between Ndel1 phosphorylation and PNEI could allow precise control over the timing of NEBD by coordinated stimulation of cdk1 and cdk5 in response to intrinsic and extrinsic cues.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>NRK and green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were used as indicated.
