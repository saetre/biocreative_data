In order to investigate the molecular requirements of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase H1 (termed RNase H1 here) with respect to the sense RNA strand, we synthesized a series of oligonucleotides containing 2&#x02032;-deoxy-2&#x02032;-fluoro-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-ribose (2&#x02032;F-RNA) as a substitute for the natural &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-ribose sugars found in RNA. Our results from a series of RNase H1 binding and cleavage studies indicated that 2&#x02032;F-RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrids are not substrates of RNase H1 and ultimately led to the conclusion that the 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl moiety of the RNA strand in a DNA&#x0002f;RNA hybrid is required for both binding and hydrolysis by RNase H1. Through the synthesis of a series of chimeric sense oligonucleotides of mixed RNA and 2&#x02032;F-RNA composition, the gap requirements of RNase H1 within the sense strand were examined. Results from these studies showed that RNase H1 requires at least five or six natural RNA residues within the sense RNA strand of a hybrid substrate for both binding and hydrolysis. The RNase H1-mediated degradation patterns of these hybrids agree with previous suggestions on the processivity of RNase H1, mainly that the binding site is located 5&#x02032; to the catalytic site with respect to the sense strand. They also suggest, however, that the binding and catalytic domains of RNase H1 might be closer than has been previously suggested. In addition to the above, physicochemical studies have revealed the thermal stabilities and relative conformations of these modified heteroduplexes under physiological conditions. These findings offer further insights into the physical binding and catalytic properties of the RNase H1&#x02013;substrate interaction, and have been incorporated into a general model summarizing the mechanism of action of this unique enzyme.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ribonuclease H (RNase H) class of enzymes are endonucleases that cleave the RNA moiety of RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrids in the presence of divalent cations such as Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> leaving 5&#x02032;-phosphate and 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl oligonucleotide products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c2">2</xref>). RNase H was first described in 1970 by Hausen and Stein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c3">3</xref>) in calf thymus, and since then RNase H proteins have been found in a wide variety of organisms, ranging from bacteria to vertebrates. A significant function of RNase H is its critical action in the life cycle of retroviruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c4">4</xref>) and, as such, RNase H serves as an ideal drug target for anti-HIV therapies. RNase H1 from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is structurally homologous to that of HIV-1 and mammalian RNase H, and is the best characterized member of the family. Although the X-ray crystal structure of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1 has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c7">7</xref>), a tertiary structure of the complex between <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1 and its substrate has yet to be resolved. Despite the extensive studies conducted, the biological role of this enzyme is not yet well defined. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase H1 has, however, been implicated in DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c8">8</xref>) and in chromosomal DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c9">9</xref>).</p><p>The use of antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) as selective inhibitors of gene expression offers a rational approach for the prevention and treatment of some gene-mediated disorders. The three most commonly exploited therapeutic routes of AONs include translation arrest, splicing arrest and activation of RNase H1. The RNase H1-mediated degradation of a target mRNA is considered the most effective mode of action of AONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c11">11</xref>) for it is simply more potent than ones which are limited to interfering with the splicing or translational machinery. As such, understanding the mechanisms of catalytic function and substrate recognition for RNase H1 is critical in the design of future potential antisense oligonucleotides, as well as for the design of potential inhibitors of retroviral reverse transcriptases such as HIV.</p><p>While many AONs display promising affinities for RNA, only a handful form hybrids with RNA that are recognized and cleaved by RNase H1. These include DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c12">12</xref>), phosphorothioate DNA (S-DNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c14">14</xref>), cyclohexene nucleic acids (CeNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c15">15</xref>), &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-arabinonucleic acids (ANA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c16">16</xref>) and 2&#x02032;-deoxy-2&#x02032;-fluoro-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-arabinonucleic acids (2&#x02032;F-ANA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c17">17</xref>). Of these, ANA and 2&#x02032;F-ANA represent the first and only examples of 2&#x02032;-modified &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-furanoside AON that are recognized and cleaved by RNase H1.</p><p>The crystal structure of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1 suggests that the active site is nestled within a cluster of lysines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c7">7</xref>). These positively charged amino acids are believed to bind electrostatically to the heteroduplex and thus define the binding surface of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c18">18</xref>). The interaction between the binding surface of the enzyme and the phosphate groups on the substrate is postulated to take place within the minor groove of the heteroduplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c19">19</xref>). For this reason, the minor groove width is believed to be an important structural parameter for DNA&#x0002f;RNA hybrids that enables them to act as substrates of RNase H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c19">19</xref>). RNase H1 does not bind to double-stranded DNA or single-stranded nucleic acids and although the enzyme is capable of binding to RNA&#x0002f;RNA hybrids, it does not hydrolyze them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c20">20</xref>). Studies have shown that the minor groove width of DNA&#x0002f;RNA hybrid duplexes is 8.5 &#x0212b;, lying between that of A-form RNA&#x0002f;RNA hybrids (11 &#x0212b;) and B-form DNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrids (7.5 &#x0212b;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c19">19</xref>). Presumably, it is this difference that allows RNase H1 to discriminate between DNA&#x0002f;RNA and RNA&#x0002f;RNA species. Moreover, it has also been suggested that any heteroduplex which contains protrusions in the minor groove or its proximity (e.g. 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-alkyl RNA&#x0002f;RNA) will interfere with binding to the active site and ultimately preclude the activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c18">18</xref>).</p><p>Structural requirements for DNA&#x0002f;RNA hybrids to be suitable substrates for RNase H1 are well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c22">22</xref>); however, the tolerance level of this enzyme towards modifications which do not alter the conformation of the duplex is not clearly understood, especially with respect to the sense RNA strand. Not surprisingly, due to their therapeutic applicability, the majority of experiments to date have focused on determining modifications that are tolerated by RNase H1 within the antisense strand (AON). One of the aims of this study was to examine the molecular requirements imposed on RNase H1 by the sense RNA strand.</p><p>Our initial objective was to examine whether a fully modified sense oligonucleotide, upon hybridization with a proven RNase H1-inducing DNA target, is capable of being degraded by RNase H1. The most conservative RNA analog with respect to possible changes in chemical structure is probably 2&#x02032;-deoxy-2&#x02032;-fluoro-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-ribonucleic acid (2&#x02032;F-RNA), where the 2&#x02032;-OH group is replaced by a fluorine.</p><p>The ability of fluorine to serve as a &#x02018;hydroxyl mimic&#x02019; and participate in hydrogen bonding has been extensively described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c23">23</xref>). The electronegativities of a hydroxyl group and fluorine are very similar, and the van der Waals radius of fluorine is 1.47 &#x0212b;, which lies in between that of oxygen (1.57 &#x0212b;) and hydrogen (1.2 &#x0212b;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c23">23</xref>). Accordingly, fluorine, just as the natural hydroxyl functionality, drives the sugar of 2&#x02032;F-RNA to the C3&#x02032;-<italic>endo</italic> conformation due to the gauche effect, ultimately leading a fully modified rF-RNA oligonucleotide, like RNA, to adopt the A-form helix conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c25">25</xref>). This is evident from the similar circular dichroic (CD) spectra of 2&#x02032;F-RNA&#x0002f;RNA duplexes, which indicate that they belong to the A-form conformational family, with the sugars puckering in the C3&#x02032;-<italic>endo</italic> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c26">26</xref>). The only significant difference between the two moieties is that whereas a hydroxyl group can serve as a strong hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, fluorine is only capable of acting as a weaker acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c27">27</xref>).</p><p>Oligonucleotides containing 2&#x02032;-deoxy-2&#x02032;-fluoro-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-ribose were first investigated as potential antisense agents by ISIS Pharmaceuticals in 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c26">26</xref>). 2&#x02032;F-RNA was found to have high binding affinity and selectivity for RNA targets, but unfortunately was not found to be resistant to nucleases and did not elicit RNase H1 activity when bound to RNA. Our objective, however, was not to employ 2&#x02032;F-RNA for its potential antisense properties, but rather as a modified oligonucleotide to investigate the molecular requirement of RNase H1 within the sense strand.</p><p>In this report, we have conducted several binding and RNase H1 induction assays involving a series of modified sense oligoribonucleotides containing 2&#x02032;-deoxy-2&#x02032;-fluoro-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-ribose acting as a substitute for the natural <sc>d</sc>-ribose. In the process, we have shown that the 2&#x02032;-OH moiety of the RNA strand in an RNA&#x0002f;DNA duplex is required for both binding and catalysis by <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1. Furthermore, we have also determined the minimum number of natural RNA residues required within the sense strand to elicit RNase H1 activity. These studies increase our understanding of the specific molecular requirements of RNase H1 with respect to the sense strand and the physical binding properties of the RNase H&#x02013; substrate interaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>&#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP (&#x0003e;5000 Ci&#x0002f;mmol), <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Quebec). 5&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-dimethoxytrityl-3&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-(2-cyanoethyl)-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-diisopropylphosphoramidites of the various 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-deoxy- and ribonucleosides were purchased from Dalton Chemical Laboratories (Toronto). 1-(5-<italic>O</italic>-dimethoxytrityl-2-fluoro-3-<italic>O</italic>-(&#x003b2;-cyanoethyl-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-diisopropylphosphoramidite)-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-ribofuranosyl)-adenine was obtained from Promega Biosciences (California).

All oligomers were tested for hybridization affinity (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> measurements, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf429tb2">2</xref>) and for the ability to direct cleavage by <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1.</p><p>The melting curves of the modified oligonucleotides hybridized to DNA or RNA exhibited &#x02018;sharp&#x02019; monophasic transitions, indicative of formation of a single cooperative complex. As expected, the thermodynamic stability of 2&#x02032;F-RNA&#x0002f;RNA as well as 2&#x02032;F-RNA&#x0002f;DNA duplexes are higher than those of corresponding RNA&#x0002f;RNA and RNA&#x0002f;DNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c26">26</xref>) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf429tb2">2</xref>). This is consistent with the higher pre-organization of the 2&#x02032;F-RNA residues in the C3&#x02032;-<italic>endo</italic> conformation which entropically favors double helix formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c25">25</xref>). Also worth noting is the fact that all duplexes tested for RNase H1 degradation displayed thermal stability well above 22&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C (the temperature of the RNase H1 assay), indicating that the strands were fully associated upon incubation with the enzyme.</p><p>Interestingly, the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of the I<sub>4</sub>&#x0002f;DNA duplex (35.2&#x000b0;C) is lower than that of rA:dT (39.0&#x000b0;C). This is puzzling considering that the 14 pre-organized 2&#x02032;F-RNA residues present in I<sub>4</sub>&#x0002f;DNA should in theory enhance the thermodynamic stability of this duplex relative to the native RNA&#x0002f;DNA duplex. The role of the 2&#x02032;-OH groups in hydration of the duplex may be responsible for the observed decrease in <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>. This proposal is consistent with the suggestion that RNA&#x0002f;RNA duplexes are generally more stable than DNA&#x0002f;DNA duplexes because the 2&#x02032;-OH groups in RNA duplexes propagate conserved networks of water molecules that stabilize the duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c34">34</xref>). Despite the suggestion that fluorine atoms are also hydrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c35">35</xref>), the stabilization provided by fluorine as compared to hydroxyl groups is likely not as significant. It is hence clear that 2&#x02032;F-RNA residues can provide a stabilizing entropic effect at the expense of a stabilizing hydration effect provided by 2&#x02032;-OH RNA residues. Therefore, the drop in <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> for the F<sub>1</sub>:dT and F<sub>4</sub>:dT systems would suggest that the destabilization generated by introducing RNA units is more significant than the gain in stability provided by hydration. There will be a point, however, where these effects will &#x02018;balance out&#x02019; such that one would start seeing an overall gain in stability after introducing even more RNA units (e.g. I<sub>6</sub> or I<sub>10</sub>).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f1">1</xref> summarizes the results of the RNase H1 assays conducted in this study. The lanes indicated by a &#x02013; sign represent the controls of each assay prior to the addition of RNase H, and those with a &#x0002b; sign represent reactions of duplexes after a 30 min incubation time with RNase H. Our initial objective was to examine whether a modified sense oligonucleotide, upon binding to a DNA target, is capable of being degraded by RNase H1. Hence, we first examined the susceptibility of fully modified <sup>32</sup>P-labeled rFA<sub>18</sub> (rFA) bound to dT<sub>18</sub> (dT) to degradation by <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f1">1</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). This was done in conjunction with three controls: an RNA:DNA control, rA:dT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f2">2</xref>, lanes 1 and 2) and two RNA:RNA controls, rA:rU (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f1">1</xref>, lanes 3 and 4) and rFA:rU (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f1">1</xref>, lanes 7 and 8). The degradation ladder found in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f1">1</xref> (lane 2), which corresponds to the natural RNA&#x0002f;DNA substrate, confirms the viability of the assay. Furthermore, as expected, neither RNA&#x0002f;RNA (lane 4) nor 2&#x02032;F-RNA&#x0002f;RNA (lane 8) served as substrates of RNase H1. With respect to the test in question (rFA:dT), the absence of a degradation ladder in lane 6 demonstrates that the fully modified <sup>32</sup>P-labeled rF-RNA sense strand bound to its complementary DNA antisense strand is not a substrate of RNase H1.</p><p>Previous studies have elucidated the importance of the 2&#x02032;-OH groups in the general catalytic mechanism of RNase H1, mainly that the divalent metal cation interacts with the 2&#x02032;-OH group of the nucleotide 5&#x02032; to the scissile linkage by forming an outer sphere metal hydrate complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c36">36</xref>). Furthermore, other studies have suggested that the 2&#x02032;-OH group of the nucleoside 3&#x02032; to the scissile linkage acts as both a proton donor and an acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c37">37</xref>). In other words, the 2&#x02032;-OH functionality may act as a general base to facilitate the nucleophilicity of an attacking water molecule or as a general acid to increase the electrophilicity of the phosphorus center (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f2">2</xref>). By replacing a hydroxyl group with a fluorine, not only have the general acid capabilities of the hydroxyl group been abolished, but the basic capabilities of the 2&#x02032; moiety have also been reduced because fluorine generally acts as a weak base. All other factors being equal, a modified sense strand containing a 2&#x02032; functionality with diminished general acid and base properties loses the power to elicit RNase H1 activity. These findings could explain why a fully modified sense strand (rFA<sub>18</sub>) that lacks the critical 2&#x02032;-OH moiety (rFA<sub>18</sub>) is not cleaved by the enzyme.</p><p>We next examined the susceptibility of the modified sequence I<sub>1</sub> (with one 2&#x02032;-OH substitution within a 2&#x02032;F-RNA<sub>18</sub> strand) to RNase H1 degradation in anticipation of possible cleavage at the site of hydroxyl substitution. As with the fully 2&#x02032;F-modified sense strand, I<sub>1</sub>:dT was also not a substrate of RNase H1, as can be seen from the absence of a degradation ladder in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f1">1</xref> (lane 10). This implies that RNase H1 requires a minimum number of hydroxyl groups within the backbone of the sense strand for recognition and&#x0002f;or hydrolysis of the substrate. We hence set out to determine this number by treating oligomer I<sub>4</sub> (with four hydroxyl substitutions) bound to dT<sub>18</sub> with RNase H1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f1">1</xref>, lane 13). Interestingly, four hydroxyl insertions (I<sub>4</sub>:dT) were not sufficient to elicit cleavage of the hybrid. This is somewhat different to the findings of Hogrefe <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c38">38</xref>), who determined that a DNA&#x0002f;DNA duplex incorporating four contiguous RNA units is a substrate for RNase H1. The discrepancies likely result from the different structural features of duplex DNA (Hogrefe system) as compared to a DNA&#x0002f;RNA-like hybrid (I<sub>4</sub>&#x0002f;DNA). By using a system that more closely mimics the natural DNA&#x0002f;RNA substrate, we feel we were able to more precisely ascertain the sense strand gap requirements of RNase H1.</p><p>Next we prepared the six hydroxyl substitution sequence (I<sub>6</sub>) and tested its ability to activate RNase H1. Indeed, the data shows that the I<sub>6</sub>:dT hybrid duplex served as a substrate of RNase H1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f1">1</xref>, lane 18). Unfortunately, since 2&#x02032;F-RNA monomers are no longer commercially available, we were unable to synthesize and test the I<sub>5</sub> sequence (with five hydroxyl substitutions), and hence cannot state at this time that RNase H1 requires a minimum of six 2&#x02032;-OH residues within the sense strand to hydrolyze its substrate. Nevertheless, it is safe to conclude that in order for RNase H1 to bind and cleave a DNA&#x0002f;RNA substrate, the enzyme requires more than four contiguous 2&#x02032;-OH groups within the sense strand.</p><p>The majority of studies to date have shown that the minimum number of consecutive natural DNA residues required within the antisense strand to elicit <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1 is also only four (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c39">39</xref>). In theory, one would expect the minimum gap requirement for both the antisense and sense strands to be similar, considering that RNase H1 is binding to both strands of the duplex. This theory may still hold, however, for one cannot ignore the possible discrepancies with respect to this &#x02018;minimum&#x02019; DNA antisense gap required to elicit the enzyme, with some research groups reporting five as the minimum gap requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c40">40</xref>). These discrepancies may be attributed to the different sources of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1 and&#x0002f;or differences based on the location of the gap within the antisense strand. Nevertheless, the majority of studies have shown that <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1 requires only four natural DNA residues within the antisense strand for recognition and hydrolysis of a duplex substrate.</p><p>In a similar argument to that presented above, the difference in gap requirement within the sense and antisense strands may also be due to structural differences amongst the two hybrid systems studied. Hybrids used to study the gap requirements within the antisense strand have been mainly RNA&#x0002f;RNA-like (A-form), whereas hybrids used in this study to examine the gap requirements within the sense strand are more DNA&#x0002f;RNA-like (&#x02018;A-like form&#x02019;). Thus, helical structure, which has been shown to play a key role in RNase H1 recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c19">19</xref>), could have accounted for the deviating gap requirements observed.</p><p>Next, we conducted a series of competitive binding studies in order to determine whether RNase H1 is capable of binding to a DNA&#x0002f;RNA-like substrate lacking 2&#x02032;-OH moieties within the sense strand. To do this, we tested the binding affinity of both 2&#x02032;F-RNA:DNA and 2&#x02032;OMe-RNA:DNA via experiments that measured the ability of these duplexes to inhibit the RNase H1-mediated degradation of a wild-type 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNA:DNA duplex substrate (<sup>32</sup>P-rA<sub>18</sub>:dT<sub>18</sub>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f3">3</xref>A). In this experiment, natural RNA&#x0002f;RNA and DNA&#x0002f;DNA substrates were used as competitive controls. RNA&#x0002f;RNA duplexes have the proper A-form conformation required for binding to RNase H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c20">20</xref>), but are not hydrolyzed by the enzyme due to a non-optimal minor groove width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c41">41</xref>) and&#x0002f;or the presence of protruding 2&#x02032;-OH groups in the minor groove of the helix which block the catalytic site of the enzyme upon binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c18">18</xref>). Accordingly, one can see from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f3">3</xref>A that the competitor RNA&#x0002f;RNA duplex is clearly binding to the enzyme at all three concentrations of substrate as it is retarding the rate of degradation of the wild-type substrate. A DNA&#x0002f;DNA duplex, however, is not recognized by RNase H1 and, accordingly, does not retard the rate of degradation of the wild-type substrate in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f3">3</xref>A. Clearly then, the lack of inhibition displayed by either the 2&#x02032;OMe- or 2&#x02032;F-RNA&#x0002f;DNA duplexes, even at a 10-fold concentration of competitor duplex (20 nM concentration of substrate), indicates that these substrates bind weakly or not at all to the substrate. This is in line with the results obtained by Lima and Crooke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c20">20</xref>), who tested the binding affinity of RNase H1 to 2&#x02032;OMe-RNA&#x0002f;DNA, a hybrid that mimics the conformation of a normal RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrid. Their data showed that the association constant between RNase H1 and the 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylated substrate was one-thirtieth of that between enzyme and the natural substrate. They suggested that very weak affinity consequent to 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation may be due to steric hindrance by the methyl groups and&#x0002f;or loss of the hydrogen bonds. Choosing a modification such as fluorine rather than a methoxy group allowed us to bypass the steric hindrance argument imposed by the methyl group. Thus, these findings strongly suggest that the 2&#x02032;-OH group within the sense strand plays a key role in the binding step of the substrate to RNase H1.</p><p>Similar studies were conducted with sequences I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>4</sub> as well (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f3">3</xref>B). As can be seen from the figure, neither rFA:dT, I<sub>1</sub>:dT nor I<sub>4</sub>:dT seem to be acting as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme at a substrate concentration of 20, 50 or 100 nM. Thus, one can conclude that the lack of sufficient 2&#x02032;-OH groups within the sense strand disrupts the binding affinity of RNase H1 for these helices. In fact, these results reinforce our notion that the 2&#x02032;-OH groups of the sense strand are involved in both the binding and catalytic steps of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1. The possible role of the 2&#x02032;-OH groups in hydration of the duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c34">34</xref>) and in providing essential water molecules that can act as anchors for the enzyme might be an explanation as to why these molecules do not bind to the enzyme.</p><p>Next, the exact locations of the RNase H1-mediated cleavage sites in the I<sub>6</sub>:dT sequence were determined by examining the degradation products adjacent to an I<sub>6</sub> alkaline cleavage ladder (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f4">4</xref>). Upon treatment with base, sugars containing 2&#x02032;-OH groups are susceptible to internucleotide cleavage which occurs via an in-line attack on the internucleotide phosphorus center, followed by hydrolysis of the 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate intermediate to form 2&#x02032;&#x0002f;3&#x02032;-monophosphate and 5&#x02032;-hydroxyl products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c42">42</xref>). 2&#x02032;F-RNA sugars are less susceptible to base hydrolysis due to the lack of the 2&#x02032;-OH moiety within the sugar backbone. Accordingly, when I<sub>6</sub> alone is exposed to an alkaline solution (pH 9.0, 90&#x000b0;C), six products are formed, consistent with hydrolysis occurring only at each of the six ribose (2&#x02032;-OH) units present within oligomer I<sub>6</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f4">4</xref>). It is important to note, however, that there exists a slight shift in mobility between enzymatically hydrolyzed 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled fragments (I<sub>6</sub>&#x0002f;dT) and chemically hydrolyzed 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled fragments (I<sub>6</sub> alkaline ladder). This shift originates from the fact that RNase H1 hydrolyzes an RNA strand leaving 5&#x02032;-phosphate and 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl oligonucleotide products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c2">2</xref>) (refer to the mechanism in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f2">2</xref>), whereas chemical hydrolysis results in 5&#x02032;-hydroxyl and 2&#x02032;&#x0002f;3&#x02032;-phosphate products. This same reasoning can be used to explain the presence of two distinct adjacent degradation bands in some RNase H1 assays where background chemical cleavage (induced by the reaction medium prior to the addition of enzyme) was present.</p><p>By examining the pattern of cleavage of I<sub>6</sub> by RNase H1 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f4">4</xref>, it is clear that cleavage only occurred at positions within the modified RNA strand containing ribose sugars (2&#x02032;-OH), implying that the 2&#x02032;-OH moiety is indeed involved in the hydrolytic step of the enzyme as well. Furthermore, we observe three dominant sites of cleavage corresponding to positions A<sub>9</sub>, A<sub>10</sub> and A<sub>11</sub>, and a slower rate of cleavage at position A<sub>12</sub>. Very little cleavage, if any, was observed at positions A<sub>8</sub> and A<sub>7</sub>, which correspond to the ribose (2&#x02032;-OH) residues closest to the 5&#x02032; end. Previous structural studies have suggested that the enzyme exhibits a selective binding directionality with respect to the RNA strand of the heteroduplex substrate such that the binding region of the enzyme is positioned several residues 5&#x02032; to the catalytic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c18">18</xref>). Furthermore, it was also suggested that RNase H1 initiates an endonucleolytic cleavage near the 3&#x02032; end of the RNA and then exonucleolytically degrades the RNA in the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; direction with respect to the RNA sense strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c43">43</xref>). Our degradation patterns conform with these findings.</p><p>We have shown that RNase H1 is not capable of binding a fully modified 2&#x02032;F-RNA strand bound to its DNA complement and that RNase H1 requires a minimum number of hydroxyl groups within the sense strand to bind to its substrate. This, along with the suggested catalytic importance of the 2&#x02032;-OH moiety, suggests that the RNase H1 binding domain cannot bind to regions of the duplex lacking 2&#x02032;-OH groups within the sugar backbone of the sense strand. Extending this to our I<sub>6</sub>:dT substrate, we can hence assume that RNase H1 does not bind between regions A<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>6</sub> and A<sub>13</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>18</sub> because they are 2&#x02032;F-RNA domains lacking a 2&#x02032;-OH group. The only possible region where binding could occur is between sugars A<sub>7</sub> and A<sub>12</sub>. Considering the cleavage pattern observed, and assuming that the binding domain exists 5&#x02032; to the catalytic domain, we propose that RNase H1 binds close to sugars A<sub>7</sub> and A<sub>8</sub> within the duplex in a way that masks those sites from cleavage. The catalytic domain, located 3&#x02032; to the binding domain, is then able to cleave the sense strand at positions A<sub>9</sub>, A<sub>10</sub>, A<sub>11</sub> and A<sub>12</sub>. Also worth noting is the fact that the intensity in none of the degradation bands decreased over time, indicating that RNase H1 cuts each I<sub>6</sub> strand at only one position and does not further process the degraded substrate.</p><p>Since the I<sub>4</sub>:dT duplex (with four hydroxyl substitutions) did not bind to the enzyme, we can conclude that the binding domain requires a DNA&#x0002f;RNA hybrid segment of at least 5 or 6 bp (region A<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>12</sub> in I<sub>6</sub>&#x0002f;dT). According to this model, and to the observed cleavage patterns, the binding and catalytic domains must somehow overlap because cleavage in I<sub>6</sub>:dT is only observed between positions A<sub>8</sub> and A<sub>12</sub>, which constitutes a segment where RNase H1 is likely binding due to the presence of the essential 2&#x02032;-OH groups. This contrasts with the proposal by Lima and Crooke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c44">44</xref>) that there exist at least five residues between the binding and catalytic sites of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1. The only way that the binding and catalytic domain could be at least five residues apart in our system is if the RNase H1 binding domain is capable of binding to the region of the helix lacking 2&#x02032;-OH moieties (A<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>6</sub>). But if this is possible, one cannot explain why cleavage at position A<sub>8</sub> did not occur. We propose instead that the catalytic and binding domains of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1 are closer in proximity than has been previously suggested and might not be completely separate entities in themselves.</p><p>Modeling studies based on the crystal structure of the enzyme alone suggest that RNase H1 interacts with 9&#x02013;10 bp of RNA&#x0002f;DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c45">45</xref>). According to this, the enzyme is likely interacting with I<sub>6</sub>:dT at both the modified (2&#x02032;F-RNA) and natural (RNA) portions of the I<sub>6</sub> sense strand. Although the enzyme might contact 9&#x02013;10 bp within the I<sub>6</sub>:dT duplex, our conclusions suggest that the actual binding interaction likely constitutes a segment consisting of only about 5 or 6 bp. Confirming such findings would require a co-crystal structure of RNase H1 with its substrate.</p><p>Another modified sense strand that was tested in our RNase H1 assays is F<sub>1</sub> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf429tb1">1</xref>). This sequence represents an oligoribonucleotide containing a single 2&#x02032;F-RNA sugar substitution in the center. As expected, the F<sub>1</sub>:dT duplex was a substrate of RNase H1, but to study more precisely the effects of a single 2&#x02032;-OH &#x02192; 2&#x02032;F-RNA substitution on processivity of this modified sense strand, we compared the RNase H1-mediated degradation products of an F<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;dT duplex adjacent to those of an RNA&#x0002f;DNA substrate (rA&#x0002f;dT) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f5">5</xref>). Note that these assays revealed the presence of two distinctly close degradation bands that resulted from the presence of both background chemical cleavage products (represented in the lane 0 min) and enzymatic cleavage products (represented by the lanes 15 and 30 min).</p><p>As can be seen from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f5">5</xref>, the &#x02018;interference fingerprint&#x02019; (denoted by the box) indicates that the single 2&#x02032;F-RNA modification at position A<sub>9</sub> interfered with the ability of RNase H1 to cleave at that site, as well as at the two adjacent sites (A<sub>8</sub> and A<sub>10</sub>) around it. The absence of degradation at position A<sub>9</sub> was expected and confirms the notion that RNase H1 requires the 2&#x02032;-OH moiety for cleavage. Furthermore, the lack of degradation at positions A<sub>8</sub> and A<sub>10</sub> agrees with the propositions recently made by Iwai <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c37">37</xref>). They proposed that the 2&#x02032;-OH group of the nucleoside on the 3&#x02032; side of the scissile linkage acts as both a proton donor and an acceptor and that the 2&#x02032;-OH group of the second nucleoside 5&#x02032; to the scissile linkage acts as a proton acceptor. Translating this to our system, cleavage cannot occur at position A<sub>10</sub> due to the absence of the essential 2&#x02032;-OH group on the nucleoside (A<sub>9</sub>) 5&#x02032; to the scissile linkage. Moreover, cleavage cannot occur at position A<sub>8</sub> due to the lack of the same 2&#x02032;-OH group on the nucleoside (A<sub>9</sub>) now 3&#x02032; to this scissile linkage.</p><sec><title>Circular dichroism studies</title><p>If by modifying the 2&#x02032;-OH group into a 2&#x02032;-F within the sense strand in turn changes the overall conformation of the resulting helix, a negative result from a RNase H1 assay cannot be used to directly implicate the 2&#x02032;-OH group in the mechanism of cleavage of RNase H. For this reason, CD spectral analysis was used to establish whether incorporation of 2&#x02032;F-RNA units within RNA has a fundamental influence on the conformation of the hybrid duplex structure.</p><p>The CD spectra of the duplexes studied are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f6">6</xref>.

The CD spectra of the riboF-A<sub>18</sub>&#x0002f;dT<sub>18</sub>, I<sub>1</sub>:dT and I<sub>4</sub>:dT duplexes are similar to the rA<sub>18</sub>&#x0002f;dT<sub>18</sub> spectrum, suggesting that all duplexes share similar conformations in solution.</p></sec><sec><title>General model reviewing the molecular requirements and mechanism of action of RNase H</title><p>In conclusion, our findings have been incorporated into a general model reviewing the mechanism of action of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1. In the first stage, it has been suggested that RNase H1 assists in the formation of the mRNA&#x0002f;AON complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c46">46</xref>). This is followed by binding of RNase H1 to its substrate. For binding to occur, the following prerequisites must be met: (i) an A-form helix, which includes DNA&#x0002f;RNA and RNA&#x0002f;RNA type duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c47">47</xref>); (ii) at least five or six ribonucleotide (2&#x02032;-OH) residues in the sense strand of the substrate (this work); (iii) the presence of a divalent metal cation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c1">1</xref>) such as Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>; (iv) 9&#x02013;10 bp within a DNA&#x0002f;RNA hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c46">46</xref>), even though the actual binding interaction likely only requires 5&#x02013;6 bp (this work); (v) the key amino acid residues required for binding (Cys13, Asn44, Asn16 and Asn45), which have been shown to contact both the RNA and DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c19">19</xref>).</p><p>Once bound, the following criteria must be met by the substrate for efficient RNase H mediated hydrolysis to occur: (i) the AON&#x0002f;RNA duplex should have an intermediate minor groove width similar to that of DNA&#x0002f;RNA-like hybrids, which is wide enough to accommodate the chemical reaction that will take place at the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c48">48</xref>); (ii) the presence of a 2&#x02032;-OH moiety in the sugars 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; to the scissile linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c37">37</xref>; supported by this work); (iii) no protrusions in the minor groove that might interfere with the 2&#x02032;-OH metal hydrate complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c36">36</xref>); (iv) the key amino acids required for catalysis are Asp10, Asp70, His124, Asp34 and Glu48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c51">51</xref>).</p><p>With respect to the molecular mechanism of action of RNase H1 at the catalytic site, the most recent general acid&#x02013;base mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c49">49</xref>), outlined schematically in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf429f7">7</xref>, suggests that Asp10 and Asp70 are responsible for the binding of the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion to the correct position in the active site of the enzyme; His124 accepts a proton from the attacking water molecule A, which acts as a general base; Asp34 holds this water molecule; finally, Glu48 anchors another water molecule B that acts as a general acid. Furthermore, it has also been proposed that the <italic>pro</italic>-Rp-oxygen 3&#x02032; to the scissile linkage contributes to orient His124 to the best position for the catalytic function through the formation of a hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf429c52">52</xref>).

Upon degradation of the RNA strand, or upon reaching a segment of the duplex that does not conform to the binding and&#x0002f;or catalytic requirements of RNase H1, the enzyme dissociates from the complex and is thus available to process another substrate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf429f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Electrophoresis gel showing RNase H-mediated cleavage of duplexes. dT<sub>18</sub> or rU<sub>18</sub> (15 pmol) was pre-annealed with 20 000 c.p.m. of 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-target RNA in 60 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.8 containing 2 mM dithiothreitol, 60 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.
