Neurons in the SCN send axonal projections to hypothalamic and non-hypothalamic target regions involved in reproduction, including the medial preoptic area, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Alterations to circadian rhythm, either through surgical hypothalamic lesions or genetic mutation, have downstream effects on circadian behaviour and hormonal function. In animal models, circadian disruption is often associated with a decrease in reproductive performance. Mutations in key circadian rhythm genes affect female fertility through irregular estrous cycles, pregnancy failure, and reduced survival to weaning in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Miller1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Boden1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

PWS is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome generally recognized at birth because of severe hypotonia, hypogonadism, and failure to thrive, followed by developmental delay, hyperphagic obesity, and relative growth hormone deficiency in early childhood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-GunayAygun1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and altered endocrine function are also characteristic of PWS. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism typically manifests as hypoplastic external genitalia and delayed gonadal maturation, with delayed menarche and oligomenorrhea in females, and cryptorchidism and hypogonadism in males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Eiholzer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

The fertility rate for <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice is split into three age categories as marked. All mice tested were paired with C57BL/6 mice that were 6&#x02013;10 weeks old.

Because the early loss of fertility seen in our mice was not accompanied by these histological changes in the gonads, it does not seem that loss of reproductive ability is linked to accelerating aging in the testes or ovaries in mice lacking <italic>Magel2</italic>.</p><p><italic>Magel2</italic>-null females have a delay in the onset of puberty, contrasting with the <italic>Clock&#x00394;19</italic> females that display normal timing of both vaginal opening and vaginal estrus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Miller1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Because <italic>Magel2</italic>-null females show no anatomical differences of external or internal reproductive organs, and their ovaries have grossly normal folliculogenesis with mature Graafian follicles, ovarian steroidogenesis is not likely perturbed and is therefore not a likely culprit for abnormal estrous cycling in these mice. Rising levels of estrogens produced by developing follicles in the ovary feed back to the hypothalamus, amplifying GnRH pulses, and to the pituitary, sensitizing it to increasing GnRH. The combination of these hypothalamic and pituitary effects result in a precisely timed surge of LH on the afternoon of proestrus, which leads to ovulation some 10&#x02013;12 h later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Goldman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Cytological examination of the vaginal epithelium revealed few proestrus events in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null females, coupled with reduced or no corpora lutea in the ovary suggestive of missed ovulation. Normal folliculogenesis in the female <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice, and normal pituitary hormone levels (LH, FSH) in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null males, suggests a defect in the hypothalamic response to rising estrogen levels, perturbing the precision of the reproductive system. Poor responsiveness could occur despite normal numbers and placement of GnRH neurons. Abnormal estrous profiles and differential ovulation rates have consistently been shown in the <italic>Clock&#x00394;19</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Miller1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Kennaway1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Dolatshad1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, which do not show a LH surge following proestrus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Miller1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Like the <italic>Magel2</italic>-null females we describe here, the <italic>Clock&#x00394;19</italic> mice also have an approximate one pup decrease in litter size, which has been attributed to a reduction in the number of ova per ovulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Kennaway1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, but how these ovulations are occurring in the absence of an LH surge remains unexplained.</p><p>By the time male <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice become functionally infertile around the age of 24 weeks, they have significantly lower testosterone levels than controls. Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells in the testes following stimulation by LH pulses from the pituitary gland, which are regulated by rhythmic pulses of GnRH controlled by the SCN. Low testosterone and infertility have been reported in mice lacking <italic>Bmal1</italic>, a core circadian gene also expressed in Leydig cells. These mice have a threefold increase in serum LH, which indicates a defect in the ability of Leydig cells to produce testosterone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Alvarez1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Magel2</italic> is not expressed in adult mouse testes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Boccaccio1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, and we did not detect <italic>Magel2-</italic>LacZ reporter gene expression in Leydig cells in adult <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice (data not shown). Serum LH levels were not significantly different in the <italic>Magel2-</italic>null males compared to controls, which indicates impaired hypothalamic or pituitary response to the reduced testosterone seen in these mice. Because the structure of the GnRH system appears intact in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice, and no testicular abnormalities were detected, abnormal regulation between the central and peripheral components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is a possible explanation for reduced testosterone levels in the <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice.</p><p>Sexual motivation and successful reproduction in rodents is highly dependent on olfactory ability, with anosmic mice failing to breed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Yoon1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Normal male rodents also show a clear preference for estrus female odors compared to male odors, and rats that do not display an olfactory preference for females generally do not copulate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Portillo1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice of both sexes develop an olfactory defect between 10 and 24 weeks of age as evidenced by increased time to find food following a fast. Because the null mice also showed reduced foraging and digging during these tests, and because they are generally hypoactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Kozlov1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Bischof1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> the increased time cannot specifically be attributed to an olfactory defect, and may partially result from decreased food-motivation. Consistent with this idea, during the olfactory preference tests, <italic>Magel2-</italic>null mice clearly preferred soiled bedding over clean bedding, indicating functional olfactory detection. However, while control male mice prefer estrus female odor, <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice did not discriminate between bedding soiled by males or soiled by females, indicating a defect in the detection or response to pheromone cues. Pheromone detection in the mouse has been shown to be a result of a direct neural connection between the main olfactory epithelium and the hypothalamic GnRH neuron system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Yoon1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Mandiyan1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, warranting additional examination of the olfactory system in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice. Low sexual motivation resulting from reduced testosterone and an inability to respond to female odor cues is the most likely explanation for impaired reproductive function in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null males.</p><p>The reduced fertility of <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice is consistent with that seen in other circadian mutant mice, but subtler than the infertility and incomplete sexual maturation seen in PWS.

A recent study of hormone levels in people with PWS aged 16 years and older demonstrated testosterone levels below the normative range in 19 of 23 males, and LH levels below the normative range in 5 of 24 males, while FSH levels were variably low, normal, or high in the same cohort <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Brandau1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Because several genes are lost in PWS, combined loss of <italic>Magel2</italic> and other Prader-Willi candidate genes may have an additive deleterious effect. For example, mice lacking a different PWS gene encoding a second MAGE protein, necdin, show a significant reduction in GnRH neuron number in the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Miller2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Muscatelli1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Loss of GnRH neuron number, consequent to loss of necdin, coupled with loss of proper feedback circuitry from loss of MAGEL2, would be predicted to have a more serious effect on reproductive function in individuals with PWS with congenital absence of both genes. Further, failure to thrive associated with loss of the snoRNA HBII-85 could contribute to later infertility in PWS, although fertility was reportedly normal in two independent strains of mice deficient for the murine ortholog MBII-85/Snord116 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Ding1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004291-Skryabin1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Further studies on reproductive and other hypothalamic functions in <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice under conditions of worsened (e.g. through exposure to constant darkness) or improved (e.g. by pharmacological reinforcement of the circadian period or more stringent photoperiods) circadian function may provide compelling evidence for additional examination and regulation of circadian rhythm in people with PWS.
