In recent years, research focusing on RNA molecular biology has shown that these post-transcriptional events play important roles in the overall regulation of gene expression. In addition to the obvious processing steps (such as capping, polyadenylation and splicing), post-transcriptional modification of certain nucleosides in mRNA also occurs, but has received substantially less attention. This has been due to the difficulty in determining what role, if any, modified nucleosides play in the regulation of gene expression.</p><p>Despite the huge diversity of nucleoside modifications found in rRNA, tRNA and snRNA, the modified nucleosides found in eukaryotic mRNA are few and are structurally simple. The <italic>N</italic><sup>7</sup>-amino group is methylated on the &#x02018;cap&#x02019; guanosine (m<sup>7</sup>G). The 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-hydroxyl group on the ribose moiety is methylated only on the first two encoded nucleosides (N<sub>m</sub>). If the first encoded nucleoside is an adenosine, it can be doubly methylated&#x02014;at both the 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-position on the ribose and the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-amino position on the purine ring to form (<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyl-,2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl-)-dimethyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A<sub>m</sub>). All of these methylated residues are part of the cap structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c3">3</xref>). The only other modified nucleoside found in mRNA is <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), which is present at low levels throughout the body of the mRNA.</p><p>m<sup>6</sup>A is present in mRNA in all higher eukaryotes tested, including mammals, plants and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c8">8</xref>), and in viruses that replicate in the nucleus &#x0005b;adenovirus, SV40, RSV, herpesviruses, influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c9">9</xref>)&#x0005d;. It is present on average in one to three residues per typical mammalian mRNA molecule. It is present only within a defined sequence context that has been conserved across diverse species from plants to man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c9">9</xref>). Despite its ubiquity and conserved sequence specificity, the functional significance of this modification remains a mystery. Point mutagenesis of m<sup>6</sup>A sites in viral RNAs had no apparent effect on viral replication or infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c11">11</xref>). Inhibition of mRNA methylation with agents such as cycloleucine and <italic>S</italic>-tubercidinylhomocysteine leads to accumulation of mRNA precursors in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c14">14</xref>), but the pleiotropic nature of these agents makes it impossible to ascertain whether the effects are mediated through inhibition of m<sup>6</sup>A formation, or by inhibition of methylation of some other moiety. More recently, Tuck <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c15">15</xref>) have shown that m<sup>6</sup>A-deficient mRNA encoding dihydrofolate reductase is translated less efficiently than m<sup>6</sup>A-containing mRNA.</p><p>m<sup>6</sup>A has not previously been observed in the mRNA of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c16">16</xref>), even though this organism does contain a gene (<italic>IME4&#x0002f;SPO8</italic>) with striking sequence similarity to the mammalian gene encoding the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-adenosine methyltransferase subunit, MT-A70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c17">17</xref>). This sequence similarity raised the possibility that yeast mRNA does contain m<sup>6</sup>A, but only under nutritional conditions conducive to high expression of the <italic>IME4</italic> gene. <italic>IME4</italic> mRNA levels are very low in exponentially-growing cells and are greatly elevated during sporulation and in stationary phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c18">18</xref>).</p><p><italic>IME4</italic> is a key gene in the highly regulated pathway that leads to meiosis and sporulation in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c19">19</xref>). Sporulation occurs only in the diploid <italic>MATa&#x0002f;MAT</italic>&#x003b1; cell type, and requires nitrogen starvation and a respirable carbon source. Under these conditions, expression and activation of the <italic>IME1</italic> gene and its product lead to the initiation of a complex cascade of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c20">20</xref>) that culminates in the formation of four haploid ascospores within the confines of the original mother cell. The <italic>IME4</italic> gene is important for <italic>IME1</italic> transcript accumulation as well as downstream events, and is essential for meiosis and sporulation in standard laboratory strains. The mechanism by which Ime4p exerts its effects is unknown, although the protein does not function as a transcriptional activator or repressor in tethering assays (B.Jursic, Y.Wang and M.Clancy, unpublished results).</p><p>The close sequence similarity between the <italic>IME4</italic> gene and MT-A70 leads to the hypothesis that Ime4p activates meiosis and spore formation by a mechanism that involves the formation of m<sup>6</sup>A in yeast RNA, possibly mRNA. In order to test this hypothesis, we have measured the m<sup>6</sup>A content of total RNA and polyadenylated RNA isolated from vegetative yeast cells and sporulating yeast cells, and have observed an increase in m<sup>6</sup>A formation in both types of preparations. Moreover, inactivation of the <italic>IME4</italic> gene leads to the loss of m<sup>6</sup>A in the mRNA of the mutant yeast incubated in sporulation medium. We also examined whether mutations in the catalytic MTase motif IV sequence of Ime4p lead to sporulation defects, as expected if the formation of m<sup>6</sup>A is important for <italic>IME4</italic>&#x02019;s role in promoting sporulation. Indeed, such mutations do lead to severely defective sporulation. Taken together, these results suggest that the formation of m<sup>6</sup>A is important for RNA biogenesis during sporulation in yeast.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Isolation of total RNA from yeast</title><p>RNA analyses used the rapidly-sporulating SK1 strain (Hanson SK1-<italic>can1</italic>; ATCC).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf573f4">4</xref> summarizes the chromatographic data from 10 control experiments and nine sporulation experiments. In each experiment, non-sporulating and sporulating RNA samples were chromatographed sequentially. In all cases, roughly equivalent amounts of radioactivity were loaded.

The m<sup>6</sup>A peak, as expected, represents a tiny fraction of the total <sup>3</sup>H c.p.m., but is easily distinguished from the predominant methylated nucleosides due to its relatively long retention time. There was in fact an increase in the amount of m<sup>6</sup>A present in the RNA prepared from the sporulating yeast cells as compared with the non-sporulating cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf573f4">4</xref>B and C). Although the absolute amount of the modified nucleoside is small compared with the others, the relative difference in the amount of m<sup>6</sup>A is significant&#x02014;1.6-fold.</p><p>m<sup>6</sup>A is present in one residue in each of the large and small subunits of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c31">31</xref>). Because the vast majority of methylated nucleosides (primarily ribose-methylated) occur in rRNA, by loading an equal number of counts in each sample, the data are essentially normalized for newly synthesized rRNA. m<sup>6</sup>A is also present in a few tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c32">32</xref>) and in the snRNA U6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c34">34</xref>). In all of these cases, the nucleoside modification appears to be stoichiometric; i.e. every mature rRNA subunit contains exactly one m<sup>6</sup>A residue and each potential m<sup>6</sup>A site in the snRNA and tRNA is in fact methylated. This is in contrast to m<sup>6</sup>A sites in mammalian mRNA, where potential m<sup>6</sup>A sites are not methylated on every mRNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c14">14</xref>). Furthermore (also in mam malian systems), the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-adenosine methyltransferase(s) that methylate rRNA and snRNA are different from the mRNA <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-adenosine methyltransferase that is the homolog of <italic>IME4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c35">35</xref>). It is likely that the baseline level of m<sup>6</sup>A seen in the control cells is from ribosomal, transfer and small nuclear RNAs for two reasons: first, by analogy to this distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A in other organisms, and, secondly, based upon previous work that shows that mRNA prepared from yeast grown under normal (non-sporulating) conditions does not contain m<sup>6</sup>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c16">16</xref>). We hypothesize that the increment in m<sup>6</sup>A levels in sporulating cells is the result of <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-adenosine methylation in mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of methylated nucleosides in polyadenylated RNA prepared from sporulating yeast cultures</title><p>Yeast cells were again grown in sporulation medium, labeled with &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H-<italic>methyl</italic>&#x0005d;methionine, RNA was isolated, and polyadenylated RNA was prepared by oligo-dT selection. The yeast culture and total RNA preparation had to be scaled up 10-fold in order to recover enough labeled polyadenylated RNA for HPLC analysis. The polyadenylated RNA was treated with ribonuclease, pyrophosphatase and phosphatase exactly as was done for the total RNA, and nucleosides were analyzed by HPLC. The chromatographic profile of the &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H-<italic>methyl</italic>&#x0005d;-labeled nucleosides is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf573f5">5</xref>. A peak of radioactivity, albeit in low amounts, is clearly present in the m<sup>6</sup>A fractions. No m<sup>6</sup>A peak was detected in polyadenylated RNA prepared from cells growing under non-sporulating conditions. The ratio of the m<sup>6</sup>A peak to the A<sub>m</sub> peak provides evidence that the m<sup>6</sup>A seen in mRNA prepared from sporulating yeast is not simply carry-over from contaminating rRNA. In total RNA, the m<sup>6</sup>A peak is approximately 0.01 times the height of the A<sub>m</sub> peak, whereas in the polyadenylated samples the m<sup>6</sup>A peak and the A<sub>m</sub> peak are roughly equivalent. These results support the hypothesis that induction of <italic>IME4</italic>, by the appropriate genetic and nutritional signals, leads to <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-adenosine methylation in some or all polyadenylated RNA.</p><p>An additional, unanticipated finding is also evident in this data. The amounts of the 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylyated nucleosides, U<sub>m</sub>, G<sub>m</sub> and A<sub>m</sub>, are substantially and consistently reduced in the polyadenylated RNA fraction from sporulated cells as compared with the control cells. It is likely that the amount of C<sub>m</sub> is also reduced, although the C<sub>m</sub> peak is not distinguishable from the m<sup>7</sup>G peak. This result suggests that in addition to the appearance of m<sup>6</sup>A in the mRNA of yeast during sporulation, there is a significant decrease in the 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of other nucleosides. However, Sripati <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c16">16</xref>) reported that there are no other methylated nucleosides in yeast mRNA, so the significance of this finding is not known. One possible explanation is that yeast mRNA cap nucloesides are in fact methylated at the 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic> position, and this methylation is reduced under sporulating conditions. An alternative explanation is that these peaks represent contamination with rRNA. We feel that this is not likely due to the remarkable consistency in the relative peak heights across experiments.</p><p>To assess whether the appearance of m<sup>6</sup>A depended on IME4, a similar experiment was done using SK1 cells containing an <italic>ime4</italic> null mutation. SK1-<italic>ime4</italic> cells were labeled with <sc>l</sc>-&#x0005b;<italic>methyl</italic>-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;methionine exactly as in the experiments above, in methionine-free SD medium and in sporulation medium. mRNA was isolated and prepared as before, and analyzed for m<sup>6</sup>A content by HPLC. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf573f6">6</xref>A, no m<sup>6</sup>A peak was detected in the mRNA from the SK1-<italic>ime4</italic> cells either in control medium or in sporulation medium. Interestingly, the changes in the peaks corresponding to the 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl nucleosides were observed just as they were for the wild-type SK1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf573f6">6</xref>B). This experiment indicates that <italic>IME4</italic> is necessary for <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-adenosine methylation in the mRNA of sporulating yeast, and also indicates that the putative changes in cap methylation are independent of Ime4p activity, and of the loss of m<sup>6</sup>A.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutagenesis of motif IV</title><p>While previous work demonstrated that the <italic>IME4</italic> gene is essential for sporulation in standard laboratory strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c19">19</xref>), it was possible that the proposed methyltransferase activity of the protein was not important for this process. To address this issue, we created mutations in the highly conserved motif IV sequence, found at amino acids 348&#x02013;351 in Ime4p. Examples of the consensus sequence (N&#x0002f;D&#x0002f;S, P&#x0002f;I, P, Y&#x0002f;F&#x0002f;W) are found in all <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup> adenosine-directed methyltransferases. These residues form part of the active sites of these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c42">42</xref>) and mutations strongly reduce or eliminate catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c46">46</xref>). We expected, therefore, that the analogous mutations would reduce or eliminate any methyltransferase activity of Ime4p. Thus, the conserved acidic and aromatic amino acids at positions 348 and 351 (aspartate and tryptophan, respectively) were changed to alanine to form the D348A and W351A alleles. The mutant alleles were transferred to the <italic>CEN</italic>-based plasmid vector pRS316, forming W351A-<italic>CEN</italic> and D348A-<italic>CEN</italic>.</p><p>The activity of the mutant alleles in promoting sporulation was assessed. We chose a standard laboratory strain background (S288c) for these experiments, because unlike the rapidly sporulating SK1 cells used above, these strains are completely dependent on <italic>IME4</italic> for sporulation. SK1-<italic>ime4</italic> cells, in contrast, are impaired in sporulation but can complete the process to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c47">47</xref>), a property that could obscure any effects of the W351A and D348A mutations. Thus, plasmids containing mutant and wild-type alleles were transferred into MC309, an <italic>ime4</italic>-deficient yeast strain, and the ability of the plasmids to complement the sporulation deficiency of this strain was assessed. The production of full-length stable proteins was verified by western blotting (data not shown) following cloning the mutant and wild-type alleles in frame with the HA tag sequence in vector pYeF1-U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c22">22</xref>).</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf573tb1">1</xref> shows the results of an experiment in which the kinetics of spore formation were compared in MC309-<italic>ime4</italic> null mutant cells carrying plasmid-borne mutant D348A or W351A alleles versus wild-type and vector-only controls. Cells carrying the wild-type allele began to form visible spores between 8 and 12 h after shift to sporulation as assessed by bright-field microscopy. By 24 h, &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of the cells had sporulated, with final levels achieved by 48 h. The mutant alleles, in contrast, were severely compromised in their ability to promote sporulation of the <italic>ime4</italic>-deficient strain. Cultures of cells containing the D348A mutation achieved only 5&#x00025; sporulation, &#x0223c;10-fold less than for the wild-type. The W351A allele was even more impaired, with &#x0003c;1&#x00025; of the cells forming microscopically-visible asci even after prolonged incubation in sporulation medium (144 h).</p><p>We also used DAPI staining and epifluorescence microscopy to examine the timing and extent of the meiotic divisions in these cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf573tb2">2</xref>). As expected from the kinetics of spore formation, binucleate and tetranucleate cells began to appear between 5 and 8 h after the shift in the culture carrying the wild-type <italic>IME4</italic> allele, and cells that had completed both meiotic divisions comprised more than 50&#x00025; of the population by 24 h. In contrast, cultures carrying the mutant alleles produced only a small fraction of tetranucleate cells, even after 48 h (&#x0223c;7.5 and 0.5&#x00025; for the D348A and W351A alleles, respectively.) Thus, the low fraction of asci appearing in these cultures reflects the failure of the cells to undertake the meiotic divisions. We conclude that the motif IV element is very important for <italic>IME4</italic> function in promoting sporulation in yeast, a result that suggests a direct role for m<sup>6</sup>A in this process.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This work brings together two disparate research problems: control of yeast differentiation and nucleoside modification. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> sporulation (meiosis) is controlled by a complicated cascade of genes that are highly regulated by genetic and environmental signals. <italic>IME4</italic> is expressed throughout sporulation, and its activity is important at early times for accumulation of the <italic>IME1</italic> and <italic>IME2</italic> mRNAs, and later for unknown aspects of spore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c47">47</xref>, M.Clancy, unpublished results). The mechanism whereby <italic>IME4</italic> influences activation of sporulation has been previously unknown, but, unlike many of the regulatory genes in the cascade, it does not appear to function as a transcription factor (B.Jursic, Y.Wang and M.Clancy, unpublished results).</p><p>The work presented here strongly suggests that <italic>IME4</italic> encodes an mRNA <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-adenosine methyltransferase and that the formation of m<sup>6</sup>A serves an important function in promoting sporulation in yeast. These experiments were motivated by the high degree of sequence similarity between MT-A70 and <italic>IME4</italic>, including regions encompassing consensus methyltransferase motifs that were identified by comparison with prokaryotic <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferases enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c42">42</xref>). These similarities led to the hypothesis that Ime4p may function like MT-A70, as an <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine-binding component of an RNA- directed methyltransferase.</p><p>In accord with this idea, preparations of total RNA and polyadenylated RNA isolated from sporulating cells contained higher levels of m<sup>6</sup>A than did those from vegetative cells. As expected, m<sup>6</sup>A was present in total RNA prepared from yeast cells growing in log phase. Upon switching the <italic>MATa</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1; diploid yeast to sporulation medium, <italic>IME4</italic> expression was induced, and a concomitant 1.6-fold rise in the amount of m<sup>6</sup>A in total RNA was observed. Consistent with the hypothesis that Ime4p is an mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A-methyltransferase subunit, m<sup>6</sup>A was now present in the polyadenylated RNA fraction, where it had been undetectable in polyadenylated RNA prepared from vegetative cells. These experiments support the hypothesis that Ime4p is an essential component of the methyltransferase responsible for this increase. Furthermore, SK1 cells that lack a functional <italic>IME4</italic> gene do not have detectable levels of m<sup>6</sup>A in their mRNA when incubated in sporulation medium. The high degree of homology of <italic>IME4</italic> to MT-A70, the temporal correlation of <italic>IME4</italic> induction and the appearance of m<sup>6</sup>A in mRNA, and the results of the <italic>IME4</italic> mutation experiments strongly support the hypothesis that Ime4p is directly responsible for yeast mRNA methylation. These experiments do not rule out the possibility that other RNA species may also be hypermethylated when <italic>IME4</italic> is induced. Indeed, m<sup>6</sup>A is present in both the large and small rRNA subunits and in tRNA in all eukaryotes and many prokaryotes, and is present in a few snRNA in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c33">33</xref>). The methyltransferases that are responsible for <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-adenosine methylation in these RNA species have not been isolated, but several lines of evidence suggest that <italic>IME4</italic> is not involved. First, rRNA, tRNA and snRNA methylation is constitutive, but <italic>IME4</italic> is expressed at high levels only in sporulating and stationary phase cells. Additionally, we have shown that <italic>in vitro</italic>, the human <italic>IME4</italic> homolog, mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A-MT, is not able to methylate human rRNA- or U6 snRNA-like substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c34">34</xref>, J.Bokar and M.E.Shambaugh, unpublished results).</p><p>The putative active-site mutations in methyltransferase motif IV of <italic>IME4</italic> led to a severe reduction in sporulation, strongly supporting the hypothesis that the methyltransferase activity of this protein and the formation of m<sup>6</sup>A are important for sporulation in yeast. We observe, however, that the motif IV mutations permit some level of sporulation in these cells, albeit at markedly reduced levels, whereas the null mutant strain does not sporulate at all. One possibility is that the individual D348A mutation and, to a lesser extent, the W351A mutation, still have residual catalytic activity, allowing a low level of m<sup>6</sup>A to be formed that is below the limit of detection of m<sup>6</sup>A in our HPLC assay. Another explanation is that <italic>IME4</italic> has additional functions distinct from the methyltransferase catalytic activity. This would be reminiscent of a similar study involving the dimethyladenosine residue near the 3&#x02032; end of the 18S rRNA. The Dim1 protein that is responsible for this modification is essential for viability, while the modification itself is not essential; rather, the inviability of <italic>dim1</italic> cells is the result of failure in ribosomal precursor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c48">48</xref>).</p><p>How might mRNA methylation in yeast, catalyzed by Ime4p, lead to induction of the sporulation pathway? Recent microarray studies show that more than 500 mRNAs are present at elevated levels in sporulating cells, including some encoding proteins involved in general aspects of mRNA biogenesis, as well as many that promote sporulation-specific processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c20">20</xref>). We suggest that <italic>IME4</italic> activity governs part of this global response to nutritional and cell-type signals by facilitating a general process such as splicing, 3&#x02032;-end formation, nuclear pre-mRNA turnover, export or localization of mature mRNAs, or translation efficiency.</p><p>The function of m<sup>6</sup>A in mRNA in higher eukaryotes has remained elusive, despite numerous lines of investigation. Several groups have used two general approaches in an effort to define the role of m<sup>6</sup>A in mRNA biogenesis and function in mammalian cells and their viruses. Mutations of the major methylation sites within the Rous sarcoma virus <italic>src</italic> and <italic>env</italic> genes have been tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c11">11</xref>). Mutations of several of these sites, which rendered them incapable of being methylated, did not lead to any differences in steady-state levels of <italic>src</italic> mRNA in mutant versus wild-type virus in infected CEF cells. No differences in the levels of <italic>src</italic> mRNA in the nuclear fraction were detected either, and no unusual spliced products were observed. Furthermore, there was no difference in the translation of the <italic>src</italic> protein, packaging of RNA into virions or infectivity of mutant virus compared with wild-type. Several explanations for the lack of an effect of these methylation mutations have been proposed. If methylation affects the kinetics of processing or transport, it may be necessary to study only newly synthesized mRNA to observe the effect. Alternatively, multiple methylation sites may be redundant for function. A second series of experiments explored m<sup>6</sup>A function by using methylation inhibitors. Cycloleucine treatment of CHO cells resulted in a 96&#x00025; decrease in <sup>3</sup>H-methyl incorporation into polyadenylated RNA, and the decay of this hypomethylated polyadenylated RNA from the nucleus was prolonged in pulse-chase experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c12">12</xref>). Cycloleucine treatment of cells infected with B77 avian sarcoma virus resulted in a shift in the ratio of subgenomic <italic>env</italic> RNA to genome-length RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c49">49</xref>). The methylation inhibitor, <italic>S</italic>-tubercidinylhomocysteine, caused a significant delay in the cytoplasmic appearance of newly synthesized polyadenylated RNA in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c13">13</xref>). Another inhibitor, neplanocin, led to nuclear accumulation of an unspliced pre-mRNA in CHO cells stably transfected with a bovine prolactin minigene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c14">14</xref>). Taken together, these experiments support a model in which methylation of specific internal adenosine residues in mRNA somehow affects the efficiency of processing and&#x0002f;or transport of nuclear pre-mRNA to mature cytoplasmic mRNA. The major limitation of these experiments is that they all used methylation inhibitors that function by altering the equilibrium of the <italic>S</italic>-adenosylhomocysteine&#x0002f;<italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine pool, and therefore are likely to have pleiotropic effects on a wide range of methyltransferases. More recently, Tuck <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c15">15</xref>) have shown that m<sup>6</sup>A-deficient mRNA encoding dihydrofolate reductase is translated less efficiently than m<sup>6</sup>A-containing mRNA. In these experiments, the mRNA was made m<sup>6</sup>A-deficient by treatment of cells with the non-selective methylation inhibitor, cycloleucine. The translation efficiency was determined <italic>in vitro</italic> using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate assay. This observation has not been confirmed in an <italic>in vivo</italic> system.</p><p>The most well characterized changes in mRNA biogenesis during sporulation involve splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c53">53</xref>). Sporulation induces the expression of the novel splicing factor encoded by the <italic>MER1</italic> gene, as well as the expression of a relatively large number of intron-containing pre-mRNAs, many containing non-canonical splice junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c54">54</xref>). It is possible that methylation by Ime4p facilitates recognition of particular pre-mRNAs by components of the splicing or export machinery, thereby contributing to the regulation of expression of these mRNAs during sporulation. It is also possible that methylation of the pre-mRNA facilitates 3&#x02032;-end maturation. Indeed, the best-studied methylation substrate in mammalian systems is the single site in the RNA encoded by a bovine prolactin minigene, which occurs 1 nt upstream of the polyA site. In yeast, 3&#x02032;-end formation can respond to nutritional conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c53">53</xref>), and some genes encoding components of the polyadenylation cleavage and specificity factor are induced during sporulation, including <italic>NAB4&#x0002f;HRP1</italic> and <italic>CLP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf573c20">20</xref>).</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that Ime4p methylates specific internal adenosine residues in a subset of mRNAs produced in sporulating cells, possibly including the <italic>IME1</italic>, <italic>IME2</italic> and <italic>NDT80</italic> mRNAs among many others. Methylation of these transcripts may alter their expression by modifying their splicing, stability, translation efficiency or compartmentalization, ultimately leading to high level accumulation of RNAs corresponding to <italic>IME1</italic> and other sporulation-specific genes. These exciting hypotheses are directly testable, and will need to be addressed in future studies. However, the discovery that m<sup>6</sup>A is induced in the mRNA of sporulating yeast, along with the finding that mutations within the putative catalytic methyltransferase motifs in <italic>IME4</italic> severely attenuate sporulation, provide the strongest evidence yet that this nucleoside modification has a critical role in a gene regulatory pathway.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf573f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Conserved protein sequences of putative mRNA <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-adenosine methyltransferases.
