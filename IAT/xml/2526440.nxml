Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) regulates proliferation and differentiation by activating TSH receptor (TSHR) in thyrocytes. In this study, we found that Id2, one of the Id family proteins, is a major target for regulation by TSH in FRTL-5 thyroid cells. TSH rapidly increases the Id2 mRNA level in FRTL-5 thyroid cells but the Id2 protein showed biphasic regulatory patterns, being transiently reduced and subsequently induced by TSH treatment. Transient reduction of Id2 protein was noted within 2 hr of TSH treatment and was mediated by proteasomal degradation. Moreover, reduced Id2 expression correlated with the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pathway, which is activated by TSH. Although TSH increases the activity of the Id2 promoter, TSH-induced activation of this promoter was independent of c-Myc. Id2 did not alter TTF-1- and Pax-8-mediated effects on the regulation of the Tg promoter. Thus, in summary, we found that TSH regulates Id2 expression, but that Id2 does not alter the expression of thyroid-specific genes, such as Tg, in FRTL-5 thyroid cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Thyroid Gland</kwd><kwd>Thyrotropin</kwd><kwd>Id2 protein</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), insulin, and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) stimulate cell cycle progression and proliferation in various thyrocyte culture systems, including established rat thyroid cell lines (FRTL-5, WRT, and PC Cl3) and primary cultures of rat, dog, sheep, and human thyroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).

The signaling pathways activated by TSH are associated with the induction and activation of a number of thyroid-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors, which transcribe a set of genes that control thyrocyte proliferation and maintenance of function.

Id2 and Id4 mRNA expression was increased by TSH (1 mU/mL) treatment; however Id1 and Id3 were not modulated. The induction of Id2 mRNA by TSH was rapid and prolonged. Its maximal level was reached within 1 hr and this level was maintained for 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Id4 mRNA was also rapidly induced (within 1 hr) by TSH treatment but returned to its basal level by 6 hr. Different patterns of Id RNA expression were observed in insulin-treated cells. The TSH-responsive Id2 did not respond to insulin, whereas Id1 and Id4 RNA increased following exposure to insulin, and Id3 mRNA expression was virtually unaffected.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of Id protein levels by TSH in FRTL-5 thyroid cells</title><p>Since the Id RNA expression studies suggested that Id2 is a major TSH-responsive gene, we investigated Id2 protein levels in FRTL-5 cells following TSH treatment. Id2 protein was regulated biphasically in response to TSH treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, Id2 was expressed basally in untreated FRTL-5 thyroid cells; however, the level of Id2 rapidly decreased within 2 hr of TSH treatment and subsequently recovered to the basal level. After an 8-hr exposure to TSH, the expression of Id2 was higher than that of untreated cells. The influence of TSH on FRTL-5 cell signaling was further monitored by detection of S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This phosphorylation event reflects the activity of S6 kinase, which is activated by both TSH and forskolin in thyroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein was observed in TSH-treated cells within 1 hr and was maintained for 12 hr. In a similar experiment, forskolin induced a transient decrease of Id2 protein expression that coincided with the TSH-mediated activation of S6 kinase. Insulin also transiently decreased Id2 protein expression during the S6 kinase activation phase.</p><p>Previously, it has been shown that Id family proteins are short-lived proteins whose degradation is dependent on the proteosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, Id2 was rapidly down-regulated, which suggested that Id2 proteins would also be degraded by the proteasomal pathway in response to TSH treatment. To investigate this, we pretreated FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells with or without MG132, a specific proteosome inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), prior to TSH treatment. MG132 completely blocked Id2 degradation induced by TSH or forskolin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). These results strongly support the hypothesis that TSH- and forskolin-induced Id2 degradation is mediated by the proteosomal pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pathway is involved in TSH-mediated Id2 degradation</title><p>Given that the transient decrease of Id2 level in TSH-treated cells occurred during the activation phase of S6 kinase, we hypothesized that PI3 kinase may be involved in TSH-mediated Id2 degradation in thyroid cells. Moreover, activation of S6 kinase by TSH is dependent on PI3 kinase, mTOR, and PKA in thyroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). To identify the involvement of PI3 kinase, mTOR and PKA signaling in TSH-induced Id2 degradation, the cells were pretreated with the specific inhibitors LY294002, wortmannin, rapamycin, H89, and PD98059 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) for 2 hr prior to incubation with TSH or forskolin. Both LY294002 and wortmannin, which are specific PI3 kinase inhibitors, prevented TSH-mediated Id2 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). However, rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, and H89, a PKA inhibitor, had no effect on Id2 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). PD98059, a MAPK inhibitor, also had no effect on TSH-induced Id2 degradation (data not shown). These results indicate that PI3 kinase pathways are involved in TSH-induced proteosomal degradation of Id2.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of Id2 promoter activities by TSH in FRTL-5 thyroid cells</title><p>In the above studies, we found that Id2 mRNA was induced by TSH treatment, and that its protein level was also upregulated after 8 hr by TSH treatment. To confirm if Id2 promoter activity is regulated by TSH, we transfected FRTL-5 cells with pGId2-2750, a luciferase reporter that contained-2,750 bp of the 5'-region of the mouse Id2 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and measured its activity following TSH treatment. The high affinity Myc-binding sites (CACATG at position -1,880 and CACGTG at position -1,950) in the Id2 promoter are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>. These E-boxes are known to be important sites for Myc-mediated transactivation of the Id2 promoter during serum-mediated fibroblast stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The construct, pGId2-2750 del (1330-2230), did not contain the Myc-binding sites. TSH increased not only wild-type pGId2-2750 promoter activities, but also increased the activity of the mutant pGId2-2750 del (1330-2230) that is devoid of Myc-binding sites. Although several studies suggested that TSH can induce c-Myc expression in thyroid cells, these results suggest that induction of Id2 promoter activities in FRTL-5 thyroid cells by TSH may not depend on c-Myc.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of transcriptional activities of Id proteins and effects of Id2 protein on TTF-1/Pax-8 activity in FRTL-5 cells</title><p>In the above study, we found that TSH regulates the induction of Id2 promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression in FRTL-5 thyroid cells. All four Id family proteins possess related HLH dimerization domains that can interact with similar bHLH proteins. Recent studies suggested that Id family proteins are phosphorylated and have transcriptional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). We tested the effects of TSH on the transcriptional activities of Id proteins using GAL4-dependent transcriptional systems. GAL4 fusion protein expression plasmids, GAL4-Id1, GAL4-Id2, GAL4-Id3, and GAL4-Id4, were co-transfected with the reporter plasmid pG5-luc, and reporter activities were monitored in the presence or absence of 1 mU TSH. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, GAL4-Id1, GAL4-Id3, and GAL4-Id4 proteins did not activate GAL4-dependent transcription. GAL4-Id2 protein had weak, albeit significant, transcriptional activity, but this was not modulated by TSH. These observations suggest that TSH signaling does not directly affect Id2-mediated transcriptional activity in FRTL-5 thyroid cells.</p><p>Id proteins have been shown to interact with Pax family transcription factors, such as Pax-2/-5/-8, and to inhibit the DNA binding of Pax transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Pax-8 is a thyroid-limited transcription factor, which is involved in normal thyroid development and transcriptional regulation of the thyroid-specific genes Tg, TPO, and sodium iodide symporter (NIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). To determine whether Id2 is involved in regulating transcription of the Tg gene, we cotransfected the Tg promoter constructs, -808 Tg-pGL3, -688 Tg-pGL3, and -207 Tg-pGL3, with or without the expression plasmid constructs pCDNA3-Id2 into FRTL-5 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>, Id2 did not change the reporter activities of -808 Tg pGL3, -688 Tg pGL3, or -207 Tg pGL3, which has binding motifs for Pax-8 and TTF-1. In addition, in Cos-7 cells, Id2 did not affect TTF-1-mediated or Pax-8-mediated Tg gene transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B, C</xref>). These observations suggest that Id overexpression may not alter the expression of thyroid-specific genes such as Tg in thyroid cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we investigated the regulation of expression and functions of Id family proteins in FRTL-5 thyroid cells.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, the specific PI3 kinase inhibitors, LY 294002 and wortmannin, prevented TSH-induced Id2 degradation in FRTL-5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Several studies have suggested that TSH activates PI3 kinase-dependent signaling pathways to regulate thyrocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). We propose that PI3 kinase pathways that are activated by TSH may be responsible for the degradation of specific proteins, such as Id2, in thyroid cells. However, the biological significance of the transient reduction of Id2 in TSH-activated thyroid cells was not fully evaluated in this study.</p><p>The expression of Id2 is transcriptionally regulated through the activation of several transcription factors, such as c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The human Id2 promoter contains a cluster of three E-boxes that are high-affinity Myc-binding sites (CACATG at position -1,880 and CACGTG at position -1,590) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). TSH and cAMP both enhance the expression of the c-Myc proto-oncogene in cultured thyroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). We further tested whether the Id2 promoter activation was under the direct control of c-Myc in FRTL-5 cells. However, the inducibility of a mutant Id2 promoter, which has no Myc-binding sites, by TSH was comparable to the wild-type Id2 promoter. These findings suggest that Id2 induction by TSH may not involve c-Myc-dependent transcriptional mechanisms.</p><p>TSH is known to regulate differentiation functions in thyroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Specifically, TSH regulates the expression of thyroid-specific genes, such as Tg, TPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and NIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) by modulating thyroid transcription factors. Recent studies suggest that Pax-2/-5/-8 bind to Id proteins and that Id proteins antagonize the activity of members of the Pax transcription factor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Thus, we investigated potential functional cross-talk between Id2 and thyroid-specific transcription factors in both thyroid and non-thyroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Id2 overexpression did not alter Tg promoter activity in thyroid cells and did not affect TTF-1 or Pax-8-induced Tg promoter activities. These overexpression experiments suggest that Id2 does not cross-talk with thyroid transcription factors in the regulation of Tg gene transcription. Because thyroid transcription factors, TTF-1 and Pax-8, are not only involved in transcriptional regulation, but also regulate the development of the thyroid gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), it is possible that Id2 cooperates with these thyroid transcription factors in certain aspects of thyroid development.</p><p>Previous studies revealed that Id2 binds to the Rb protein and abolishes its growth-suppressing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, we found that Id2 overexpression did not alter the phosphorylation status of Rb in response to TSH treatment (data not shown). The role of Id2 in TSH-mediated cell cycle regulation and thyrocyte proliferation should, therefore, be evaluated in future studies.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that Id2, one of the Id family proteins, is a major target for regulation by TSH. However, TSH-mediated Id2 expression did not alter the effects of TTF-1 and Pax-8 on the regulation of Tg gene expression.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref
