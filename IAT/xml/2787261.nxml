With the use of the proper three-dimensional serum-free culture conditions, expanded MSCs can be stimulated to differentiate along the chondrogenic pathway when the appropriate factors, such as certain members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; superfamily, are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This research has led to the first clinical application of autologous bone marrow stromal cells for the repair of full-thickness articular cartilage defects in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, to date, the delivery of MSCs into cartilaginous lesions has neither clinically nor experimentally resulted in sustained regeneration of hyaline cartilage <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Inadequate delivery of the soluble factors necessary to drive the chondrogenic differentiation of the transplanted cells <italic>in vivo </italic>is a major impediment to effective chondrogenesis <italic>in situ </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To overcome this limitation, gene transfer approaches are being explored clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] to enable the sustained delivery of chondrogenic and anti-inflammatory factors to cartilage defects.</p><p>Another obstacle was identified from studies of <italic>in vitro </italic>chondrogenesis using MSCs or chondrocytes treated with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily. BMPs are a group of secreted polypeptides with pleiotropic roles in many different cell types and were originally identified by their ability to induce endochondral bone formation in ectopic extraskeletal sites <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Among other BMPs, BMP-2 and BMP-7 are known to induce differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells and preosteoblasts into mature osteoblasts, and to enhance the differentiated function of osteoblasts, which have led to the clinical application of these proteins for bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We and others have tested several BMPs for their potential use in cartilage regeneration including BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6 and BMP-7, which were shown to induce chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells and to up regulate the levels of type II collagen and aggrecan in chondrocytes and chondroprogenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. During development of the limbs, however, BMPs along with other regulators also mediate the replacement of chondrogenesis by endochondral ossification comprising chondrocyte maturation, hypertrophy, transition from type II to type X collagen with subsequent chondrocyte apoptosis, while osteoprogenitor cells differentiate into osteoblasts and replace the cartilage with mineralized bone tissue. Equivalently, chondrogenic cultures induced by BMPs showed high expression of genes associated with chondrocyte hypertrophy, including collagen type (COL) X and indian hedgehog (IHH), among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This suggests that the chondrogenic differentiation of the MSCs advanced to the end stage, hypertrophic state that is typical of endochondral ossification during skeletal development. This conclusion correlates well with existing <italic>in vivo </italic>data. For example, delivery of BMP-2 expressing MSCs resulted in tissue hypertrophy and the formation of osteophytes, when transplanted orthotopically to osteochondral defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or ectopically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] in small animal models. Moreover, such hypertrophy-associated changes are not exclusively found in terminal differentiated growth plate chondrocytes, but are also present in pathological conditions such as osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Inspired by these observations, we aim to further explore the effects of chondrogenic-induction by BMPs on hypertrophy, maturation and apoptosis. We have previously shown that adenoviral delivery of individual cDNAs encoding BMP-2 or TGF-&#x003b2;1 into primary MSCs is capable of driving chondrogenesis in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study, using adenoviral-mediated gene transfer our aim was to compare the effects of BMP-4 and BMP-2 expression on chondrogenesis of primary MSCs and to investigate whether levels and extent of hypertrophy <italic>in vitro </italic>is influenced by the choice of transgene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Construction and preparation of recombinant adenoviral vectors</title><p>The complete coding sequence of the human BMP-4 gene [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M22490">M22490</ext-link>] cloned into &#x003bb; gt10 bacteriophage vectors (ATCC No. 40342; Manassas, VA, USA) was isolated and purified according to standard protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The isolated &#x003bb; gt10 DNA was then digested with EcoRI to release the 1.7 kB sized BMP-4 cDNA insert, which was then cloned into the EcoRI site of the pAdlox shuttle vector, and first-generation, E1, E3-deleted, serotype 5 adenoviral vectors carrying the cDNAs for human BMP-4 were constructed by <italic>cre</italic>-<italic>lox </italic>recombination as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The vectors encoding BMP-2, firefly luciferase (Luc) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) from jellyfish were generated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The resulting vectors were designated Ad.BMP-2, Ad.BMP-4, Ad.Luc and Ad.GFP, and suspensions of recombinant adenovirus were prepared by amplification in 293 cells followed by purification using three consecutive CsCl gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

The collected cells were spun at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>rpm for five minutes, resuspended in complete DMEM (containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin), and plated at 4 to 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>nucleated cells per 75 cm<sup>2 </sup>flask (Falcon, Beckton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Unattached cells were removed after three days, and adherent colonies were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in DMEM with 10% FBS supplemented with 1 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor (FGF) -2 for expansion of chondroprogenitor cells. Medium changes were performed every three to four days, and after 14 days adherent colonies were trypsinized and replated in several 75 cm<sup>2 </sup>tissue culture flasks. At confluence (approximately 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/T-75 flask), the cultures were infected in 750 &#x003bc;L serum-free DMEM for two hours at a dose of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>vp/cell of Ad.BMP-2, or Ad.BMP-4.

Following viral infection, the supernatant was aspirated and replaced with 10 mL complete DMEM.</p></sec><sec><title>Aggregate culture and transgene expression</title><p>Twenty-four hours post-infection, the MSC cultures were trypsinized, washed and placed in aggregate culture as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and as modified by Penick and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Briefly, MSCs were suspended to a concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cell/mL in serum-free DMEM containing 1 mM pyruvate, 1% ITS + Premix (insulin, transferrin and selenous acid containing culture supplement), 37.5 mg/mL ascorbate-2-phosphate and 10<sup>-7 </sup>M dexamethasone (all Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 200 &#x003bc;L aliquots (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells) were distributed to a polypropylene, v-bottom 96-well plate (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) to promote aggregate formation. As mentioned above, to particular control aggregates 25 ng/mL BMP-2, 25 ng/mL BMP-4, or 10 ng/mL TGF-&#x003b2;1 recombinant protein (all R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was added to induce chondrogenesis. The cell pellets were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and formed spherical aggregates within 24 hours. Changes of media were performed every two to three days, with the recombinant protein being also freshly added to the respective controls. The aggregates were harvested at various time points for further analyses.</p><p>Media conditioned by the aggregates over a 24-hour period were collected at day 3, 7, 14 and 21 of culture and assayed for BMP-2 and BMP-4 expression using the appropriate commercially available ELISA kits (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell proliferation, glycosaminoglycan and alkaline phosphatase assays</title><p>For analysis of cell proliferation in aggregates, the WST1 test was performed at day 3, 7, 14 and 21 of culture according to the directions of the supplier (Boehringer, Ingelheim, Germany). Briefly, at time points indicated, pellets were washed twice with PBS and incubated with the WST1 reagent for two hours at 37&#x000b0;C. After this incubation, the formazan dye produced by metabolically active cells was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 450/690 nm in 96-well plates (Falcon).</p><p>Cell proliferation in aggregates was further assessed by quantitative detection of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), which correlates with the number of viable cells present using the CellTiter-Glo<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Mannheim, Baden-W&#x000fc;rtemberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, pellets were homogenized mechanically using a pellet pestle and mixed with 100 &#x003bc;L of CellTiter-Glo<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>reagent, which was generated by reconstitution of CellTiter-Glo<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>substrate with CellTiter-Glo<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>buffer. After incubation for 10 minutes at room temperature luminescence was measured using a plate-reading luminometer.</p><p>For analysis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content, aggregates were washed with PBS, digested with 200 &#x003bc;L of papain digest solution (1 &#x003bc;g/mL, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and incubated for 16 hours at 65&#x000b0;C. Total GAG content was measured by reaction with 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue using the Blyscan&#x02122; Sulfated Glycosaminoglycan Assay (Biocolor Ltd., Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland) as directed by the supplier. For normalization, DNA content of aggregates was also determined fluorometrically using the Quant-iT&#x02122; PicoGreen<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>kit as directed by the supplier (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany).</p><p>Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured densitometrically using change in absorbance at 405 nm by the conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol and inorganic phosphate, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Briefly, aggregates were homogenized mechanically and incubated with 0.1 mL of alkaline lysis buffer (0.1 M glycin, 1% triton X-100, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) at room temperature for one hour. Thereafter 100 &#x003bc;L of lysis buffer was added which was supplemented with p-nitrophenylphosphate (2 mg/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and stopped after 15 minutes with 50 &#x003bc;L 50 mM NaOH before optical densities were determined at 405 nm in an ELISA reader. ALP activity was referred to a standard curve made from p-nitrophenol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and normalized to the DNA content and given as relative ALP activity in U/&#x003bc;g.</p></sec><sec><title>Histological and immunohistochemical analyses</title><p>For histological analyses, aggregates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for one hour before tissue processing. After dehydration in graded alcohols, the aggregates were paraffin embedded, and sectioned to 5 &#x003bc;m. Representative sections were stained using H&#x00026;E for evaluation of cellularity and alcian blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for the detection of matrix proteoglycan. ALP activity was also detected by a histochemical assay performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and alternate sections were used for immunohistochemistry.</p><p>For immunohistochemical analyses, sections were washed for 20 minutes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and incubated in 5% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Following washing in TBS, sections were pre-digested with pepsin at 1 mg/mL in Tris-HCl (pH 2.0) for 15 minutes at room temperature for COL II detection, or with chondroitinase ABC (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 10 minutes for chondroitin-4-sulfate (CS4) detection (5 U/mL in distilled water), or with 0.25% trypsin containing 1 mM EDTA for 15 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C for COL X detection, before sections were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C primary antibodies diluted in 0.5% BSA. As primary antibodies monoclonal anti-COL II (Acris Antibodies GmbH, Hiddenhausen, Germany), anti-CS4 (Millipore GmbH, Schwalbach, Germany) or anti-COL X antibodies (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) were used. Immunostaining was visualized by treatment with peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) followed by diaminobenzidine staining (DAB kit; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The slides were finally counterstained with hemalaun (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). For all immunohistochemical analyses, controls with non-immune immunoglobulin (Ig) G (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) instead of the primary antibodies were performed.</p><p>Although more sophisticated and accurate methods of lacunae size determination have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we used a simple random field histomorphometric cell surface area measurement procedure to approximate cell sizes in aggregates. For each aggregate analyzed, three individual mid-sections stained with H&#x00026;E or alcian blue were taken, and the surface areas of 10 randomly chosen lacunae by two independent investigators (AFS and BP) in a blinded fashion were measured from each of three representative microscope views taken from the center or the periphery (outer 200 &#x003bc;m area) section using the KS 400<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>computerized image analysis system (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany). At least three different aggregates per group and bone marrow preparations from five different preparations were analyzed.</p><p>For comparison, we also analyzed the sizes of the lacunae within different zones of growth plate cartilage obtained from a four-year-old child, from whom a sixth toe was removed. Specifically, from the toe we obtained four physes (two joints) and at least three sections per physis were analyzed by measuring the surface areas of 10 randomly chosen lacunae from each of three representative microscope views by two independent investigators (AFS and BP). The lacunae were taken from the reserve, proliferative, hypertrophic or calcifying zone.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell viability and apoptosis assay</title><p>As annexin 5 (Ann5) is expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes and in osteoarthritic cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we were next interested in the appearance of live and apoptotic cells within our aggregate system after 10 and 21 days, which was visualized using the Ann5-Cy3 apoptosis detection kit (APOAC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) as directed by the supplier. The assay uses the Cy3.18 dye as red fluorochome conjugated with Ann5-Cy3 for apoptosis detection through binding to phosphatidylserine epitopes on the plasma membrane of early apoptotic cells, and the hydrolysis of the non-fluorescent 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (6-CFDA) to the green fluorescent compound 6-carboxyfluorescein by the esterases of living cells to label viable cells. This combination allows the differentiation among early apoptotic cells (Ann5 positive, 6-CFDA positive), necrotic cells (Ann5 positive, 6-CFDA negative), and viable cells (Ann5 negative, 6-CFDA positive). Aggregates were incubated with 50 &#x003bc;L of the double labelling staining solution for 10 minutes at room temperature. After staining, aggregates were washed five times with 100 &#x003bc;L of binding buffer, fixed overnight in PBS-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, infiltrated with isoamylacetate (Merck, Hohenbrunn, Germany), embedded in paraffin, and sectioned to 4 &#x003bc;m.

For this, 6 to 10 pellets per group and time point for each donor were pooled and homogenized using a pellet pestle and repeated titration in 1 mL of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Total RNA was subsequently extracted using Trizol reagent with an additional purification step using separation columns (NucleoSpin RNA II kit; Macherey-Nagel GmbH, D&#x000fc;ren, Germany) including a DNase treatment step according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA from aggregates of each condition (2 &#x003bc;g each group) was used for random hexamer primed cDNA synthesis using BioScript reverse transcriptase (Bioline GmbH, Luckenwalde, Germany).</p><p>For semi-quantitative PCR analyses equal amounts (100 ng) of each cDNA were used as templates for amplification in a 30 &#x003bc;L reaction volume using MangoTaq DNA Polymerase Taq (Bioline GmbH, Luckenwalde, Germany) and 5 pmol of gene-specific primers, which were used to detect mRNA transcripts characteristic of chondrogenic, hypertrophic or osteogenic differentiation states. The sequences, annealing temperatures and product sizes of forward and reverse primers used for COL II, aggrecan core protein (AGC), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), fibromodulin (FMD), SRY (sex determining region Y) - box9 (SOX9), COL I, COL X, osteopontin (OP), IHH, runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX 2) are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, with elongation factor 1&#x003b1; (EF1&#x003b1;) serving as housekeeping gene and internal control.

These results suggest that BMP-2 and BMP-4 gene transfer induced a significant chondrogenic and hypertrophic response in MSC aggregates on mRNA level over time.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We and others have shown previously that primary MSCs undergo chondrogenesis following genetic modification with Ad.BMP-2 or Ad.TGF-&#x003b2;1 in aggregate culture <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] or when transplanted into chondral defects <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the present study we adapted the MSC aggregate culture system to determine whether adenoviral delivery of BMP-4 can lead to chondrogenesis of primary MSCs <italic>in vitro</italic>, and to evaluate the extent of hypertrophy compared with BMP-2-modified cultures.</p><p>Adenoviral delivery of BMP-4 led to reliable chondrogenesis in human MSC aggregate cultures in a fashion comparable with that noted when the same dose of the BMP-2 transgene was administered as shown by staining with alcian blue, COL II and CS4 and the quantitative GAG assay, indicating increased GAG levels at days 14 and 21 in the BMP-2-modified aggregates. Notably, chondrogenic differentiation induced by either transgene increase levels of metabolic activity and cell proliferation compared with controls as evidenced by the WST1 and ATP assays. Moreover, high levels of chondrocyte hypertrophy occurred in MSC pellet cultures modified with either BMP transgene, as assessed by lacunar size, and expression of ALP, COL X and Ann5, and was overall slightly more advanced in the BMP-2-modified cultures compared with the BMP-4 modified cultures reaching significance levels in the ALP assay at all time points. Notably, exact the lacunar size comparisons between growth plate tissues and <italic>in vitro </italic>cell pellets might be inaccurate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) due to artifacts that may appear during fixation and processing of these different types of tissues.</p><p>The RT-PCR data are in general agreement with the biochemical and histological observations, showing high levels of chondrogenic mRNAs in aggregates after BMP-stimulation, such as AGC, COMP, COL II, SOX9 and FMD. Likewise, transcripts encoding the hypertrophy associated genes COL X, OP, ALP, RUNX2 and IHH were also strongly present in both types of BMP-modified aggregates compared with controls.</p><p>These observations are in broad agreement with our previous study using alginate cultures of the murine mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cell line, stably transfected with BMP-2 or BMP-4 cDNAs, where similar differences in the pattern of chondrogenesis and hypertrophy were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Although in this previous study the expression of osteogenic and hypertrophy markers were partly attributed to the presence of &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate, similar increases in hypertrophy associated genes were seen in the present study where &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate was absent. Our results are consistent with those reported by Mackay and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and Mueller and Tuan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] who likewise showed that the addition of &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate is not necessary to obtain a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype.</p><p>Our study is also in agreement with studies of <italic>in vitro </italic>chondrogenesis with primary MSCs using recombinant proteins, where BMP-4 was identified as a strong inducer of chondrogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], which produced less hypertrophy compared with BMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Correspondingly, <italic>in vivo </italic>implantation of BMP-4 into abdominal muscles of rats led to ectopic cartilage and bone formation when delivered as recombinant protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] or via genetically modified cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Notably, the latter study revealed differential effects on chondrogenesis and osteogenesis depending on the type of cell analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our study is limited to the use of bone marrow-derived MSCs and other effects may be seen when different cells are employed. Orthotopic BMP-4 gene delivery via retrovirus transduction of muscle-derived stem cells was shown to improve cartilage repair in rat osteochondral defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and also when it was administered via adenovirus to dedifferentiated chondrocytes in osteochondral defects in rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In both studies improved repair in the BMP-4-treated defects compared with non-chondrogenic controls at 12 or 24 weeks respectively was observed, but detailed analyses of hypertrophy and apoptosis have not been performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>BMP-2 and BMP-4 have been implicated in embryogenesis and morphogenesis of various tissues and organs, where they regulate growth, differentiation, chemotaxis and apoptosis of a variety of cell types, including mesenchymal, epithelial, hematopoietic and neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Interestingly, in conditional knock-out experiments it has been found that a threshold level of BMP signaling is required for the onset of chondrogenesis, and hence some chondrogenic condensations failed to form in limbs deficient in both BMP-2 and BMP-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. However, in the condensations that do form, subsequent chondrogenic differentiation proceeds normally even in the absence of BMP-2 and BMP-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In contrast, it was found that the loss of both BMP-2 and BMP-4 results in a severe impairment of osteogenesis. Deletion of BMP-4 alone did not impair osteogenesis or fracture repair, while deletion of BMP-2 alone did not impair osteogenesis but strongly prevented fracture repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. This indicates that the presence of BMP-2 or BMP-4 is a prerequisite for osteoblastogenesis and these morphogens can apparently compensate for each other to a certain extent. However, they are less important for chondrogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>During limb development, cartilage is gradually replaced by endochondral ossification, a process in which the chondrocytes mature, hypertrophy and express COL X with reduced production of COL II. Subsequently the cartilage becomes vascularized and infiltrated by osteoprogenitor cells, while the chondrocytes undergo apoptosis. The osteoprogenitor cells differentiate into osteoblasts, replacing the cartilage with mineralized bone; BMP-2 and BMP-4 are important regulators of these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. By using chondroprogenitor cells in high density, three-dimensional cultures these regulatory mechanisms can be partially recapitulated. Thus it is not surprising that studies on <italic>in vitro </italic>chondrogenesis using MSCs or chondrocytes incubated with members of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily reveal considerable hypertrophy and high levels of COL X expression. Although the use of COL X as a marker of chondrogenic hypertrophy in MSC-based systems has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], it correlates well thus far to the existing <italic>in vivo </italic>data. For example, MSCs genetically modified to express BMP-2 display a significant level of tissue hypertrophy and osteophyte formation, when transplanted orthotopically to osteochondral defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or ectopically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] in small animal models. TGF-&#x003b2;1 has been shown to induce hypertrophic and osteometaplastic changes in the synovium of rabbit joints, when directly delivered by first-generation adenovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, implantation of chondrocytes genetically modified to express BMP-7 has been shown to generate good hyaline cartilage repair tissue after six weeks <italic>in vivo</italic>, but after one year the repair cartilage is no better than that of controls, with only 0 to 28% of the transplanted cells being detectable at that time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. This is agreement with a recent large animal study in pigs, that showed good hyaline cartilage repair after six weeks, when chondral defects were filled with periosteum cells genetically modified with BMP-2, while at six months the hyaline repair tissue had almost completely vanished and was replaced by fibrocartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. These observations might be attributed to mechanisms of hypertrophic differentiation and subsequent apoptosis, although clarifying analyses <italic>in vivo </italic>have not been conducted thus far. However, the presence of Ann5-positive cells in our hypertrophic aggregates modified with BMP-2 or BMP-4 <italic>in vitro </italic>correspond with these data.</p><p>Our data suggest that the degree of hypertrophic differentiation can be modulated by the choice of morphogenetic stimulus, while still maintaining efficient chondrogenesis. This permits cautious optimism that it may prove possible ultimately to achieve effective regeneration of articular cartilage in the absence of hypertrophic differentiation. Hypertrophic differentiation of neo-cartilage tissue with subsequent apoptosis development is certainly an undesired effect in cartilage defects <italic>in vivo</italic>, because this would lead to loss of the transplanted repair cells with subsequent matrix degradation. However, the relevance of chondrogenic hypertrophy and apoptosis of human MSCs induced by TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily members for cartilage repair <italic>in vivo </italic>has to be considered still unclear to this end, because this study is limited by its <italic>in vitro </italic>nature. Therefore, clarifying <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments are necessary before such factors can be recommended for further clinical use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Adenoviral BMP-4 gene transfer efficiently induces the chondrogenic differentiation of human primary MSCs as effectively as BMP-2 gene transfer. However, both transgenes induced high levels of chondrocyte hypertrophy after three weeks of <italic>in vitro </italic>culture. It remains to be seen, whether it may be possible to develop methods for allowing robust chondrogenesis while preventing hypertrophic differentiation using different genes or proteins, which would presumably improve the outcome of cell-based approaches to cartilage repair <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AGC: aggrecan core protein; ALP: alkaline phosphatase; Ann: Annexin; ATP: adenosine 5 triphosphate; Ad: adenoviral vector; BMP: bone morphogenetic protein; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CFDA: carboxyfluorescein diacetate; COL: collagen; CS: chondroitin sulphate; COMP: cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified eagle media; EF1&#x003b1;: elongation factor 1&#x003b1;; ELISA: enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FGF: fibroblast growth factor; FMD: fibromodulin; GAG: glycosaminoglycan; GFP: green fluorescent protein; H&#x00026;E: hematoxylin and eosin; Ig: immunoglobulin; IHH: indian hedgehog; Luc: luciferase; MSC: mesenchymal stem cell; OP: osteopontin; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; RUNX2: runt-related transcription factor 2; SD: standard deviation; SOX9: SRY (sex determining region Y) - box9; TBS: Tris-buffered saline; TGF: transforming growth factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors have read and approved the manuscript and contributed to the study design, data analysis, interpretation of data and drafting and revision of the manuscript.
