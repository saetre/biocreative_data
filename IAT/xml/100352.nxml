IA-1 expression is restricted to fetal but not adult pancreatic and brain tissues as well as tumors of neuroendocrine origin. Using various GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD)&#x0002f;IA-1 fusion protein constructs, we demonstrated that IA-1 functions as a transcriptional repressor and that the region between amino acids 168 and 263 contains the majority of the repressor activity. Using a selected and amplified random oligonucleotide binding assay and bacterially expressed GST&#x02013;IA-1DBD fusion protein (257&#x02013;510 a.a.), we identified the consensus IA-1 binding sequence, T<sup>G</sup>&#x0002f;<sub>T</sub><sup>C</sup>&#x0002f;<sub>T</sub><sup>C</sup>&#x0002f;<sub>T</sub><sup>T</sup>&#x0002f;<sub>A</sub>GGGG<sup>G</sup>&#x0002f;<sub>T</sub>C<sup>G</sup>&#x0002f;<sub>A</sub>. Further experiments showed that zinc-fingers 2 and 3 of IA-1 are sufficient to demonstrate transcriptional activity using an IA-1 consensus site containing a reporter construct. A database search with the consensus IA-1 binding sequence revealed target sites in a number of pancreas- and brain-specific genes consistent with its restricted expression pattern. The most significant matches were for the 5&#x02032;-flanking regions of IA-1 and NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 genes. Co-transfection of cells with either the full-length IA-1 or hEgr-1AD&#x0002f;IA-1DBD construct and IA-1 or NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 promoter&#x0002f;CAT construct modulated CAT activity. These findings suggest that the IA-1 protein may be auto-regulated and play a role in pancreas and neuronal development, specifically in the regulation of the NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Insulinoma-associated antigen-1 (IA-1) encodes a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein that was originally isolated from a human insulinoma subtraction library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c1">1</xref>). The IA-1 gene is unique because it contains a high percentage of alanine and proline residues (&#x0223c;40&#x00025;, 250 a.a.) at its N-terminus and five zinc-finger motifs (250 a.a.) symmetrically arranged at the C-terminus. IA-1 expression was detected in a large number of neuroendocrine tumors including insulinoma, retinoblastoma, medullablastoma, pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, pituitary tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c1">1</xref>; M.S.Lan, M.Zhu and M.B.Breslin, unpublished observation), and small cell lung carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c2">2</xref>). IA-1 expression, detected in early human fetal brain and pancreas development, is dramatically reduced in later stages of development, and absent in normal adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c3">3</xref>; M.S.Lan, M.Zhu and M.B.Breslin, manuscript in preparation) suggesting that the IA-1 gene might function as a developmentally regulated transcription factor in neuroendocrine cells.</p><p>Using a rat pancreatic amphicrine cell line, AR42J, induction of IA-1 expression was found to coincide with AR42J cells converting to insulin-producing endocrine cells. Additionally, an increase in islet-specific transcription factors Pdx1, NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 and Nkx6.1 was seen in parallel with IA-1 induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c3">3</xref>). Therefore, the expression of IA-1 is closely associated with other pancreas-specific transcription factors whose role in endocrine pancreas development is well established. Based on the expression pattern of IA-1, it is reasonable to suggest that it may function as an upstream regulator of key islet differentiation factors.</p><p>Pancreas development proceeds by the interaction of numerous transcription factors to orchestrate a complex cascade of events resulting in the development of both endocrine and exocrine tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c4">4</xref>&#x02013;6). The endocrine pancreas is composed of clusters of cells, the islets of Langerhans, which include &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b4; and pancreatic polypeptide cells embedded in the exocrine pancreas. Extensive genetic studies have revealed a complex network of transcription factors including Pdx1&#x0002f;IPF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c8">8</xref>), Isl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c9">9</xref>), Pax4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c10">10</xref>), Pax6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c12">12</xref>), NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c13">13</xref>), Nkx2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c14">14</xref>), Nkx6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c15">15</xref>), Hes-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c16">16</xref>), Hlxb9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c18">18</xref>) and neurogenin 3 &#x0005b;<italic>ngn</italic>3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c19">19</xref>)&#x0005d;, which regulate the development of islet cells at different stages.</p><p>To understand the functions of IA-1 as a transcription factor, it is crucial to identify the downstream target genes it may regulate. In this study, we used a selected and amplified binding site selection (SAAB) strategy to determine the consensus sequence that is recognized by the IA-1 DNA-binding domain (DBD). We report here the consensus IA-1 binding sequence and the potential target genes containing the IA-1 binding site in their 5&#x02032;-flanking regions. A database sequence search and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) competition analyses revealed that both the IA-1 gene itself and a neuroendocrine transcription factor, NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2, are the potential downstream target genes for IA-1. Further functional studies using fusion constructs between the GAL4 DBD and IA-1 protein or the full-length IA-1 protein revealed that IA-1 possesses transcriptional repressor activity suggesting a primary role in IA-1 gene auto-regulation and NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 gene expression in pancreas and nervous system development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transient transfection for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter assay</title><p>HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) and &#x003b2;TC-1 (mouse insulinoma) cells were maintained in low glucose Dulbecco&#x02019;s Minimal Essential Medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U&#x0002f;ml penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml streptomycin.

Mutation analysis of any two G nucleotides in the GGGG core abolished IA-1 binding, demonstrating that the core GGGG nucleotides are critical for IA-1 binding activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>A region of the IA-1 promoter binds IA-1 protein</title><p>Previous studies on the human IA-1 promoter revealed that deletion of a region between &#x02013;111 and &#x02013;66 bp resulted in a 3-fold reduction in promoter activity and the remaining promoter activity was almost undetectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c24">24</xref>). Comparison of this region with the consensus IA-1 binding site shows that it shares a high degree of homology with the consensus IA-1 binding site. To test whether the IA-1 protein binds to this region, a &#x02013;103 to &#x02013;63 bp double-stranded probe was labeled and used in an EMSA. Bacterially expressed GST&#x02013;IA-1DBD protein bound to this site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f4">4</xref>A). Increasing amounts from 10, 50, 100 and 500 times molar excess cold competitor &#x02013;103&#x0002f;&#x02013;63 bp IA-1 oligonucleotide shows that 50 times excess competitor is sufficient to completely block the DNA&#x0002f;IA-1DBD protein complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f4">4</xref>B). Competition between the &#x02013;103&#x0002f;&#x02013;63 bp IA-1 promoter probe, the full-length C5, C5L and C5R oligonucleotides revealed that the full-length or C5R oligonucleotide sequence competed, but less efficiently than the cold IA-1 promoter probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f4">4</xref>A). The ability of IA-1 protein to bind to its own promoter region strongly suggests that the IA-1 gene is active in auto-regulating its own level of expression in target cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Auto-regulation of IA-1 promoter activity</title><p><italic>In vitro</italic> binding assays showed that IA-1 can bind to the &#x02013;103&#x0002f;&#x02013;63 bp region in its own promoter. In order to assess the ability of IA-1 to affect its own gene transcription, a portion of the IA-1 promoter (&#x02013;189&#x0002f;&#x02013;16 bp), containing the IA-1 binding site was subcloned upstream of an E1bTATA box driven CAT reporter gene. To better assess IA-1 binding and transcriptional activity, we switched the IA-1 protein N-terminal repression domain (a.a. 1&#x02013;256) with the hEgr-1 activation domain (AD) and fused it in frame with the IA-1 DBD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f5">5</xref>A). In this experiment, instead of assessing IA-1 transcriptional repression activity we observed transcriptional activation activity. Co-transfection of the &#x02013;189&#x0002f;&#x02013;16 bp IA-1 promoter&#x0002f;E1bTATA&#x0002f;CAT construct with the chimeric hEgr-1AD&#x0002f;IA-1DBD construct increased CAT activity &#x0223c;3-fold in &#x003b2;TC-1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f5">5</xref>A). The hEgr-1AD or IA-1DBD construct alone had no effect on the CAT activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f5">5</xref>A) demonstrating that the observed induction of IA-1 5&#x02032;-upstream sequence activity requires the specific DNA binding of the IA-1 protein. We also examined the transcriptional repressor activity of the full-length IA-1 using IA-1p(&#x02013;426&#x0002f;&#x0002b;40 bp)CAT reporter vector, which has a higher basal CAT activity. The full-length CMV&#x02013;IA-1 cDNA expression vector resulted in an 80&#x00025; repression in IA-1 promoter driven CAT activity in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f5">5</xref>B). This result is consistent with the GAL4 reporter assay and demonstrates that IA-1 functions as a transcriptional repressor in regulating its own promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>IA-1 zinc-fingers 2 and 3 are sufficient for transcriptional activity</title><p>Using SAAB, we demonstrated that the IA-1 protein could bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Therefore, we further characterized the IA-1 zinc-fingers critical for transcriptional activity. This analysis was performed using the hEgr-1 AD fused in frame with different IA-1 zinc-finger regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f6">6</xref>). The various hEgr-1AD&#x0002f;IA-1 zinc-finger constructs were transiently transfected along with a &#x02013;426&#x0002f;&#x0002b;40 bp IA-1 promoter&#x0002f;CAT construct into &#x003b2;TC-1 cells. The IA-1 zinc-finger constructs were assessed for their ability to activate the IA-1 promoter&#x0002f;CAT activity. The intact zinc-finger region (fingers 1&#x02013;5) induced &#x0223c;15-fold increase in CAT activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f6">6</xref>). Zinc-finger 3 alone could activate the IA-1 promoter to approximately half the level (&#x0223c;6.5-fold) of the intact zinc-finger 1&#x02013;5 construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f6">6</xref>). The constructs that contain zinc-fingers 2 and 3 can completely mimic the same activation level as the intact 1&#x02013;5 zinc-finger domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f6">6</xref>). This experiment shows that zinc-fingers 2 and 3 contain all the information necessary to specifically modulate target gene transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Database search for potential IA-1 target genes</title><p>An 83&#x00025; or better sequence homology search using the IA-1 consensus sequence of the eukaryotic promoter and GenBank database revealed a selected number of genes from brain and pancreas that may be regulated by IA-1. Most notable in the list are the transcription factors from mouse Pax6, and NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2. These factors are expressed in pancreatic endocrine tissues and have been shown to be critical in pancreas development. Further sequence search with the IA-1 promoter binding site revealed two additional potential target genes, Pax4 and Pdx-1. Comparison of the consensus IA-1 binding site with the IA-1, Pax4, Pdx-1, Pax6 and NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 promoters revealed that these sites share a significant degree of homology even outside the consensus binding site with one another (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf197tb2">2</xref>). However, Pax4 and Pdx-1 sites differ from the consensus binding site within the GGGG region. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing three tandem repeats of the mouse Pax4, Pdx-1, Pax6 and NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 IA-1 binding sites were used to perform an EMSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f7">7</xref>A). As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f7">7</xref>A, only the Pax6 and NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 binding sites were able to bind the GST&#x02013;IA-1DBD protein. This is consistent with the mutation analysis that we performed on the C5 sequence that showed a mutation of any two G nucleotides abolishes IA-1 protein binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of Pax6 and NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 promoters by IA-1</title><p>In order to study the potential role IA-1 plays in the regulation of its target genes, three tandem copy repeats of the Pax6 or NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 IA-1 binding sites were subcloned upstream of an E1bTATA&#x0002f;CAT reporter gene. Co-transfection of the 3X Pax6 or 3X NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 E1bTATA&#x0002f;CAT constructs with hEgr-1AD&#x0002f;IA-1DBD constructs into &#x003b2;TC-1 cells revealed that the NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 construct was induced &#x0223c;6-fold over the E1bTATA&#x0002f;CAT construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f7">7</xref>B). No effect was seen on the 3X Pax6 binding site construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f7">7</xref>B). Most notable about this observation is that although the Pax6 site can bind IA-1DBD protein <italic>in vitro</italic>, the Pax6 IA-1 binding site is in the opposite orientation (on the minus strand) with respect to the IA-1 or NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 binding sites. This suggests that the IA-1 binding site may function in an orientation-dependent manner.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>IA-1 belongs to a class of transcription factors that contain a SNAG repressor domain in the N-terminus and Cys<sub>2</sub>-His<sub>2</sub> type zinc-finger motifs in the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c22">22</xref>). Currently, there are 20 proteins that belong to this class and they can be subdivided into three groups: (i) Snail&#x0002f;Slug proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c25">25</xref>), (ii) growth factor independence 1 (Gfi-1) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c26">26</xref>), and (iii) IA-1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c27">27</xref>). The IA-1 subclass contains the IA-1 and methylated in liver tumor-1 (<italic>mlt-1</italic>) genes. In this study, we have shown that either the IA-1 full-length or fused with the GAL4DBD construct demonstrated transcriptional repressor activity. The repressor domain was localized to a region between amino acids 168 and 263 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f1">1</xref>). Within this portion of the IA-1 protein, a high number of proline and alanine residues, 39 out of 95 (41&#x00025;), are present. Comparison of this type of motif with another transcriptional repressor molecule, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Even-skipped protein, shows that this is a similar motif required for transcriptional repressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c28">28</xref>). Surprisingly, the seven amino acid SNAG domain, MPRGFLV, located in the N-terminus of IA-1, does not function as a repression domain in the cell type tested. The seven amino acid SNAG domain, MPRSFLV, present in the Gfi-1&#x0002f;Gfi-1b proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c29">29</xref>) and the Snail&#x0002f;Slug proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c30">30</xref>) were shown to be critical for maximum repression activity of these molecules. The IA-1 SNAG domain differs from the Snail&#x0002f;Slug, Gfi-1&#x0002f;Gfi-1b SNAG domains by a single amino acid substitution (G for S); however, this residue was not shown to be important for the repression activity for Gfi-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c22">22</xref>), but may render the IA-1 SNAG domain inactive. Alternatively, the IA-1 SNAG domain may function in a cell-type-specific manner since IA-1 expression is restricted to a limited number of cell types. Further analysis of the functional activity of IA-1 in other cell types not tested here is required.</p><p>Although we showed that the IA-1 protein is a transcriptional repressor, the downstream target genes regulated by the IA-1 protein remained unknown. Therefore, we designed an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay using randomized oligonucleotides and bacterial expressed recombinant protein. SAAB analysis revealed that the purified GST&#x02013;IA-1DBD protein bound to a specific 12 bp consensus sequence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf197tb1">1</xref>). EMSA analysis with the most frequently observed clone, C5, bound the GST&#x02013;IA-1DBD protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f2">2</xref>). Further studies showed that zinc-fingers 2 and 3 were sufficient for transcriptional activity. A zinc-finger motif consists of &#x0223c;27&#x02013;30 amino acid residues. It exists as an independently folded unit that binds a zinc ion and is responsible for sequence-specific DNA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c32">32</xref>). The C-terminus of the IA-1 protein contains four intact Cys<sub>2</sub>-His<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger motifs and a truncated first zinc-finger motif (missing the second histidine residue). Therefore, the number of bases recognized by the IA-1DBD should not be more than 12 bp given that each zinc-finger is expected to bind three bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c32">32</xref>). Mutation analysis of the consensus IA-1 sequence (C5 sequence) showed that the GGGG core is critical for binding because mutation of any two of these G nucleotides abolishes IA-1 protein binding activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f3">3</xref>). The IA-1 protein belongs to a subclass of proteins within the SNAG domain family and shares a significant degree of homology with another protein, mlt-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c27">27</xref>). The highest degree of homology between these two proteins is in the zinc-finger domain. Comparing each of the 27&#x02013;28 amino acids in the zinc-fingers, 25 (89&#x00025;), 26 (96&#x00025;), 16 (57&#x00025;), 10 (37&#x00025;) and 24 (89&#x00025;) amino acids are identical in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth zinc-finger motifs between human IA-1 and mouse mlt-1 proteins. The high degree of homology within the zinc-finger regions of IA-1 and mlt-1 suggests that they can bind similar DNA binding elements. Analysis of the zinc-finger regions revealed that zinc-fingers 2 and 3 were required for transcriptional activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f6">6</xref>). Whereas zinc-finger 2 of mlt-1 is &#x0223c;90&#x00025; identical to IA-1, zinc-finger 3 is only 57&#x00025; identical suggesting that these two proteins would have different DNA binding sequences and targets. Mlt-1 is expressed in normal adult brain, spleen, stomach and liver and its expression is silenced by methylation of the promoter region in liver and neuroblastoma tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c27">27</xref>). In contrast, IA-1 is expressed in fetal brain and pancreas as well as tumors of neuroendocrine origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c3">3</xref>). Due to their difference in tissue distributions, IA-1 and mlt-1 probably regulate completely different sets of genes.</p><p>Computer analysis of potential IA-1 regulated genes identified several pancreas-specific transcription factors. EMSA analysis and the transient transfection studies of promoter&#x0002f;CAT constructs showed that IA-1 and NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 are two downstream target genes modulated by IA-1. A high-affinity IA-1 binding site was identified in the IA-1 promoter. The &#x02013;103&#x0002f;&#x02013;63 bp IA-1 promoter site was effectively competed away by itself but not completely competed away with full-length C5 or C5R oligonucleotides indicating that the IA-1 promoter binds IA-1 protein better than the C5 sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf197f4">4</xref>A). This suggests that the IA-1 gene can auto-regulate its own expression as a negative feedback mechanism and&#x0002f;or modulate downstream genes in cooperation with other transcription factors. IA-1 gene expression is transient occurring during embryogenesis, whereas NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 gene expression is maintained at a relatively constant level during endocrine and neuronal development, which suggest that the effect of IA-1 on the NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 gene is transient. Within a narrow window of differentiation, certain genes are being turned on or off as required. Similarly, another upstream regulator of the NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 gene, <italic>ngn</italic>3, performs its critical role in NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 gene activation as well as in the control of endocrine cell precursor differentiation transiently (33&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c35">35</xref>). NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 is a helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix transcription factor. The null mutation of the NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 gene arrests islet cell development at a late stage and results in mice suffering severe postnatal diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c13">13</xref>). Furthermore, the NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 expression is restricted to primitive neuroectodermal tumors including medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma and small cell lung carcinoma, which correlate with the IA-1 gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf197c36">36</xref>). Recently, <italic>ngn</italic>3 was shown to be required for the specification of a common precursor for the four pancreatic endocrine cell types thus placing it upstream of all the other previously identified transcription factors in the cascade. Deletion and mutation analyses of the NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 promoter revealed that the two proximal E box sequences, E1 and E3, can bind to <italic>ngn</italic>3&#x0002f;E47 heterodimer and mediate <italic>ngn</italic>3-induced activation of the NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 promoter (33). Since the IA-1 binding site is located in between the TATA box and the E1, E2 and E3 elements of the NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 promoter, it is tempting to speculate that IA-1 may counter-regulate <italic>ngn</italic>3 to modulate NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 gene expression. Further analysis of the NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 promoter is necessary to determine what role, if any, IA-1 may play in its regulation during pancreatic endocrine cell development. Identification of IA-1 as a regulator of NeuroD&#x0002f;&#x003b2;2 during pancreatic development would place a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor molecule in the complex cascade of factors important for endocrine cell development.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf197f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> IA-1 functions as a transcriptional repressor in HeLa cells.
