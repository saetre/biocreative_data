The NS2 protein also induced ER stress and activated the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B). A significant increase in cyclin A transcriptional levels was observed in NS2-expressing cells but was accompanied by a concomitant increase in the proteasomal degradation of cyclin A protein.

The causative agent of CSF is Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), which is classified as a member of the <italic>Pestivirus </italic>genus within the <italic>Flaviviridae </italic>family of viruses, accompanied by the genera Flavivirus and Hepacivirus (Hepatitis C viruses; HCV) (Lackner, Muller et al. 2004). CSFV contains a 12.3 kb positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that consists of 5' and 3' non-translated regions (NTR) flanking a large open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein of approximately 3898 amino acids. The polyprotein is processed into 12 mature proteins, namely, N<sup>pro</sup>, C, E<sup>rns</sup>, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B and at least two precursor proteins, E2-p7 and NS2-3 have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, the functions of CSFV proteins such as N<sup>pro</sup>, NS3 and NS5B have been studied extensively. However, the nonstructural NS2 protein has been thought to function only as an NS2/NS3 auto-protease essential for high productivity of CSFV <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moulin and coworkers have previously demonstrated that CSFV requires uncleaved NS2-3 and NS4A for infectious particle formation but concluded that NS2 protein alone had no essential function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The N-terminus of NS2 is generated by cellular signal peptidases and the protein remains associated with intracellular membranes, presumably at the ER. The N-terminal half of NS2 is highly hydrophobic and is likely to be involved in membrane association. However, despite this information, the subcellular localization, membrane topology and protein structure have not been determined and may be due to its biochemical properties and its toxicity when expressed in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Studies of other Flavivirus NS2 proteins have determined alternative functions that aid viral replication. Recently, it was reported that the HCV NS2 protein inhibits cellular proliferation by the induction of cell cycle arrest at S-phase through the down-regulation of cyclin A expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The S-phase of the cell cycle can provide a cellular environment that is beneficial for viral replication. There is evidence from other viruses, such as herpes viruses, that the evolution of viral proteins that regulate the host cell cycle provides a replicative advantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1, a retrovirus, encodes a Tax oncoprotein that promotes entry of host cells into S-phase and blocks mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>It is from these parallels that we hypothesize that the CSFV NS2 protein has properties that can alter cell cycle replication. Presently, no data exists on the subcellular localization of CSFV NS2 protein and its effects on cell growth and cell cycle progression. The swine endothelial vascular cell is one of the CSFV target cells, vascular endothelial cells maintain the haemostatic balance by providing a quiescent, anti-thrombotic barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This present study was initiated to demonstrate the subcellular localization of CSFV NS2 protein and elucidate the effects and mechanisms of this protein on cell growth and cell cycle progression. Here, we show that the expression of NS2 protein causes cell growth retardation in swine umbilical vein endothelial cell line (SUVEC) established in our lab previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and increased the proportion of the cells in the S-phase with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase. The cell cycle effects were associated with the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and the rapid degradation of cyclin A but not the down-regulation of cyclin A transcription. Furthermore, we show that CSFV NS2 protein localized in ER and induced ER stress. The results of these findings have potentially important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis for this economically important agricultural disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Vectors, virus and cell culture</title><p>The pEGFP-C1 and pEGFP-N1 eukaryotic expression vector were purchased from Clontech (USA) and competent <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>DH5&#x003b1; used for cloning were purchased from Tiangen Biotech (China).

Cyclin A expression level was significantly decreased in both cell lines that expressed NS2 protein compared with control cells. Furthermore, when the GFP-NS2-expressing and NS2-GFP-expressing cell lines were pre-treated with MG132, blocking proteasomal degradation of proteins, the relative intensity of cyclin A western blot signal was significantly increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), suggesting that cyclin A is rapidly degraded in the presence of NS2. To further support these findings, quantitative real-time RT-PCR was employed and showed that cyclin A mRNA levels in the GFP-NS2-expressing and NS2-GFP-expressing cell lines were significant higher than in control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). This suggests that the induction of cell cycle arrest in the S-phase by CSFV NS2 protein is associated with the increase of cyclin A proteasomal degradation rather than a decrease of cyclin A transcription. Moreover, transcription of GRP78, the ER molecular chaperone was also increased in GFP-NS2-expressing cell lines compared with controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Analysis of the activity of NF-&#x003ba;B in GFP-NS2-expressing and NS2-GFP-expressing cell lines using a TransAMTM NF-&#x003ba;B p50 Transcription Factor Assay Kit demonstrated that the NF-&#x003ba;B was significantly activated compared with control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Together, these analyses have shown that expression of CSFV NS2 results in the up-regulation of GRP78, cyclin A and NF-&#x003ba;B suggesting a role of NS2 in ER stress activation. Additionally, NS2 induces cell cycle arrest at the S-phase and is associated with the increased proteasomal degradation of cyclin A.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The effect of CSFV NS2 expression on the porcine cyclin A protein level</bold>.

Despite this vast amount of research, the subcellular localization and function of the CSFV NS2 protein is still unclear. Previous studies have presumed that the CSFV p7 protein assists NS2 localization by forming a leader sequence that properly orients NS2 in the ER membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, until now, no experimental data on CSFV NS2 protein membrane topology or protein structure has been available. Furthermore, the function of this protein is yet to be determined, particularly with regard to its effect on host cell physiological changes. In this study, we constructed an expression vector and generated stably expressing cell lines of CSFV NS2 in fusion with the GFP protein that allowed the analysis of many of these properties. Co-localization studies clearly showed that GFP-NS2 and NS2-GFP localized in the ER. Moreover, the results of the bioinformatics analysis showed that N-terminal half of CSFV NS2 is highly hydrophobic involved in membrane association (data not show). Recently, Yamaga and colleagues (2002) demonstrated that the membrane-association of HCV NS2 is p7-independent and this protein contains at least two internal signal sequences for membrane association and likely has multiple transmembrane domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], confirming our findings.</p><p>In this study, the effect of CSFV NS2 protein on CSFV-target SUVEC cells proliferation was determined. Various analyses showed that the CSFV NS2 protein was able to inhibit the cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest at S-phase. Recently, it was reported that the HCV NS2 protein inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in the S-phase in mammalian cells through inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation and down-regulation of cyclin A expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, in this study, the western blot analysis suggested that cyclin A protein levels were not simultaneously elevated, by contrast, the cyclin A protein levels in the CSFV NS2 protein-expressing cell lines were significantly lower than that in the control cell lines. To investigate whether the turnover rate of the cyclin A in the NS2-expressing cell lines was accelerated, the NS2-expressing cell lines were treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 for 24 h. Interestingly, the cyclin A protein levels were significantly elevated in treated compared with untreated cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Furthermore, we also revealed that the CSFV NS2 protein significantly promoted the transcription of cyclin A through the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B in SUVEC cells, which consist with the previous study that CSFV infection activated the NF-&#x003ba;B activity in the porcine vascular endothelial cells cultured <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These results suggested that the CSFV NS2 protein played an important role not only in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B that consequently increased the transcription levels of cyclin A but also in the accelerated proteasomal degradation.</p><p>The Flaviviridae family of viruses encompasses many important human pathogens, including HCV. A characteristic of Flaviviruses is their utilization of the ER as the primary site for polyprotein processing, glycoprotein biogenesis and particle assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The ER is an organelle that has essential roles in multiple cellular processes that are required for cell survival and normal cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Viruses that use the ER as an integral part of their replication strategy must contend with the ER stress response and the downstream consequences of ER stress signalling. Recently, it was reported that HCV NS2 protein activated endoplasmic reticulum stress signalling, HCV NS2 expression increased phosphorylation of elF2&#x003b1; and up-regulated luciferase expression driven by molecular chaperone GRP78 and transcription factors ATF6, or GADD153 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with the characterization of the HCV NS2 protein as a membrane protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], our observations also show that the CSFV NS2 protein is an ER membrane protein that is likely to be responsible for inducing ER stress. In the current study, we show that the CSFV NS2 protein was found to localize in the ER and able to induce ER stress, as indicated by the significant up-regulation of the molecule chaperon GRP78, a typical marker of ER stress. Since it was demonstrated that under conditions of ER stress, mammalian cells accelerated the retrograde export of proteins from the ER to the cytosol for ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], taken together, we speculate that the CSFV NS2-expressing cells accelerated the retrograde export of cyclin A proteins from the ER to the cytosol for ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation. Yang and colleagues have previously demonstrated that HCV NS2 protein inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in the S-phase through inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation and down-regulation of cyclin A protein expression, but failed to analyse its effect on mRNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The present study showed that CSFV NS2 protein employed a different mechanism to inhibit the host cells proliferation compared with the HCV NS2 protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, the CSFV NS2 protein localized in the ER and inhibited the SUVEC cell growth and regulated division through cell cycle arrest in the S-phase. The induction of cell cycle arrest in the S-phase by CSFV NS2 protein is associated with an increase in cyclin A degradation rather than a decrease in cyclin A transcription level. The present study has provided knowledge that will enable us to further explore the membrane topology and functions of CSFV NS2 protein that have remained largely unexplored.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>QHT organized the whole process, took part in all the experiments and wrote the manuscript.
