For activation, the drug must be chemically reduced, but little is known about the targets of the active metabolites. Applying two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we searched for protein targets in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content>. Of all proteins visualized, only five were found to form adducts with metronidazole metabolites: thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, superoxide dismutase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and a previously unknown protein. Recombinant thioredoxin reductase carrying the modification displayed reduced enzymatic activity. In treated cells, essential non-protein thiols such as free cysteine were also affected by covalent adduct formation, their levels being drastically reduced. Accordingly, addition of cysteine allowed <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> to survive in the presence of otherwise lethal metronidazole concentrations and reduced protein adduct formation. Finally, we discovered that thioredoxin reductase reduces metronidazole and other nitro compounds, suggesting a new model of metronidazole activation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> with a central role for thioredoxin reductase.

When recombinantly expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> BL21 (DE3) in the presence of metronidazole, the capability of thioredoxin reductase to reduce thioredoxin was significantly diminished. Moreover, levels of non-protein thiols, e.g., cysteine, were found to be drastically lowered in metronidazole-treated <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> cells due to adduct formation between activated metronidazole and accessible sulfhydryl groups. In accordance with this finding, addition of cysteine to the growth medium allowed the cells to survive otherwise lethal metronidazole concentrations and significantly reduced protein adduct formation. Finally, we propose an alternative mode of metronidazole activation by thioredoxin reductase, because it showed nitroreductase activity in enzymatic assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Metronidazole Modifies a Small Number of Proteins in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content></title><p>After having treated <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> trophozoites for different time periods (1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 6 h) and with varying metronidazole concentrations (10 &#x003bc;M&#x02013;1 mM), cell lysates were prepared for 2DE experiments. Metronidazole concentrations between 50 &#x003bc;M and 100 &#x003bc;M proved to be the most suitable because cells were viable for more than 5 h, a time span which is sufficient for the cell to react to stress by expression of mRNA and proteins. In addition, therapeutic levels lie within this range. Because higher metronidazole concentrations led to rapid disintegration of the cells, and incubation periods for more than 2 h with 50 &#x003bc;M metronidazole did not reveal any additional changes in the protein profile, we chose exposure to 50 &#x003bc;M metronidazole for 2 h as our standard condition when challenging cells with metronidazole. We reproducibly found seven new protein spots on the gels that were isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometric tryptic peptide fingerprinting in combination with additional verification of selected peptide sequences by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (identified peptides and tandem mass spectra are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050211-sg001">Figures S1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050211-sg005">S5</xref>). These seven spots corresponded to five proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g001">1</xref>B), identified as superoxide dismutase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and a protein designated as &#x0201c;hypothetical protein XP&#x0005f;650662&#x0201d; in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> protein database (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050211-t001">Table 1</xref>). The last will further be referred to as &#x0201c;metronidazole target protein 1&#x0201d; (Mtp1), since its presence on 2D gels abolishes its hypothetical status. Surprisingly, the new spots did not correspond to newly synthesized protein, but appeared at the expense of other neighboring spots as shifted isoforms at a more basic isoelectric point (pI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g001">1</xref>B). The widths of the shifts in pI differed with each of the proteins. Thus, it was hypothesized that metronidazole exposure leads to modification of these five proteins, and that the newly appearing spots correspond to isoforms of pre-existing protein in the cell. Concomitant treatment of the cells with 100 &#x003bc;M cycloheximide to block protein synthesis did not prevent the appearance of the shifts on the gel when cells were exposed to metronidazole (unpublished data). This supported our notion that the observed spots do not correspond to newly synthesized protein. Moreover, we did not find any proteins significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in expression during metronidazole exposure; mRNA expression was also not found to be altered (M. Tazreiter, unpublished data). Thus, presumably, <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> does not react to short-term metronidazole treatment by mRNA synthesis or by synthesis of proteins that are involved in stress response or antioxidant defense. This indicated that the protein shifts might be due to metronidazole adduct formation with the five proteins rather than to a general stress response of the cell.</p><fig id="pbio-0050211-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>2DE of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> Cell Extracts Reveals Adduct Formation upon Metronidazole Treatment</title><p>(A) The adducts formed can be identified as shifts to more basic pI values on 2D gels.

Again, treatment regimens with 50 &#x003bc;M of the respective nitroimidazole for 2 h were chosen as the experimental conditions. Indeed, two-dimensional (2D) gels revealed that the same proteins were affected, but the width of the pI shifts to the basic differed according to the varying pKa's of the nitroimidazoles, which can be attributed to the different side chains at the N1 position. Protein shifts upon ornidazole treatment were slightly narrower, whereas protein shifts with tinidazole were considerably narrower than those observed with metronidazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Interestingly, the 2-nitroimidazole azomycin also shifted the same proteins. With regard to pI interval, the shifts by azomycin were wider than shifts by the other nitroimidazoles tested, but the amount of the respective proteins shifted was smaller.

We reasoned that, if the decrease in thiol levels were to be attributed to oxidative stress, exposure of the cells to metronidazole under aerobic conditions would result in even more strongly reduced thiol levels, whereas, under anaerobic conditions, the observed effect should be significantly mitigated or even absent. However, our experiment showed that the reduction of thiol levels, to 36&#x00025; of the level of untreated cells, was the most strongly pronounced after metronidazole exposure under anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), followed by exposure to metronidazole under microaerophilic conditions, with 51&#x00025;, and then under aerobic conditions, with 54&#x00025;. Thus, oxygen did not promote, but conversely, counteracted the reduction of thiol levels upon metronidazole exposure, which strongly suggests that covalent adduct formation of activated metronidazole with thiol groups is the reason for the decrease in non-protein thiol levels.

Indeed, non-protein thiol levels were found to be affected by azomycin, even if considerably less than by metronidazole, paralleling the observation that azomycin shifts the same proteins as metronidazole, albeit to a smaller extent.

In contrast to our failed attempts to identify metronidazole on peptides that were directly isolated from 2D gels, we observed, by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS) of intact proteins, that a high proportion of recEh TrxR and recEh Trx displayed a shift in molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The shift in the deconvoluted spectra of both recEh Trx and recEh TrxR (but here only illustrated with recEh Trx), corresponded to a mass gain of 141 Da.

In this scheme, the activated 5-nitroimidazole is first reduced to an electrophilic nitrosoimidazole, which is subsequently attacked at its C4 atom by a sulfhydryl group. This is accompanied by further reduction to a hydroxylamine group, which is finally reduced to an amino group. Thus, the nitroimidazole loses two oxygen atoms from the nitro group and one proton from C4, and gains two hydrogens, resulting in a decrease in mass of 31 Da. At physiological pH and under the conditions applied during LC-ESI-QTOF-MS, however, the amino group is protonated, leading to a total mass decrease of only 30 Da. Since metronidazole has a mass of 171.16 Da, a protein that binds metronidazole can be expected to increase in mass by about 140 Da because it gains 141 Da from the bound 5-aminoimidazole derivate of metronidazole but loses the proton of a sulfhydryl group.</p><fig id="pbio-0050211-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>RecEh Trx Increases in Mass upon Modification with Metronidazole or Tinidazole</title><p>(A) Detection of mass increment by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS.

After the uptake of 5-nitroimidazoles into the cell (1), the nitro group is reduced to form a nitro radical anion (2). According to the model of Wislocki and colleagues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, the nitro radical anion is further reduced (&#x02212;16 Da) to a highly reactive 5-nitrosoimidazole (3) which forms adducts (&#x02212;2 Da) with sulfhydryl groups via the C4 of the imidazole ring (4). Adduct formation is accompanied by reduction (2 e<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) of the nitroso group to a hydroxylamine group (&#x0002b;2 Da). Subsequently (5), the hydroxylamine group is further reduced (2 e<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) to an amino group (&#x02212;16 Da), resulting in the stable and non-reactive 5-aminoimidazole adduct. At physiological pH or under the conditions applied during MS, the amino group is protonated (&#x0002b;1 Da) (6). A total of six e<sup>&#x02212;</sup> is necessary at the nitrogen of the former nitro group to obtain the aminoimidazole adduct which, compared to the corresponding nitroimidazole, decreases in mass by 30 Da. The bound protein or thiol loses one proton during adduct formation. Thus, in total, nitroimidazole adducts gain the molecular mass of the respective nitroimidazole less 31 Da.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050211.g004"/></fig><p>When allowing for the methodological restraints of the LC-ESI-QTOF-MS instrument, which has a mass deviation of &#x000b1;4 Da when analyzing a protein of the size of recEH Trx, the calculated theoretical mass gain of 140 Da after modification by activated metronidazole corresponds well with the observed shift of 141 Da. In order to check whether the proposed model also applies for other 5-nitroimidazoles than metronidazole, we expressed recEh TrxR and recEh Trx in presence of tinidazole, which has a molecular mass of 247.3 Da. The result obtained with metronidazole was paralleled by that with tinidazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g004">Figure 4</xref>A); the shifts in the deconvoluted spectra amounted to 217 Da (molecular weight of the nitroimidazole less 30 Da). Moreover, it is important to add that the proposed model for nitroimidazole binding is also supported by the fact that, on 2D gels, the pI values of all five proteins identified were shifted to the basic, probably due to the reduction of the nitro group of the nitroimidazoles to a basic amino group.</p><p>Additional peaks that can be observed on the mass spectra of metronidazole- and tinidazole-bound recEh Trx correspond to mass increments of approximately 16 Da or 32 Da, and very likely can be attributed to oxidation (one or two oxygen atoms, respectively).

As an alternative method (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050211-t002">Table 2</xref>), nitroreductase activity of recEh TrxR was indirectly determined by measuring reduction of cytochrome c by reduced nitro compounds &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, or by superoxide radical anions generated by the transfer of an electron from nitroradical anions to oxygen, respectively. In both cases, reduction of cytochrome c could be attributed to the previous reduction of the assayed nitro compounds, i.e., CDNB, the 2-nitroimidazole azomycin, and the 5-nitroimidazole metronidazole, by recEh TrxR (4 &#x003bc;g/ml). As expected, CDNB was readily reduced at a rate of 171 nmol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at concentrations as low as 10 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050211-t002">Table 2</xref>). This rate lies in the range of the determined nitroreductase activity of recEh TrxR when measuring NADPH consumption. The 36&#x00025; higher reduction of CDNB in the first assay is likely due to the 10-fold higher CDNB concentration used. The 2-nitroimidazole azomycin was also readily reduced at a concentration of 100 &#x003bc;M (63 nmol min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

In the absence of recEh TrxR, no reduction of cytochrome c was observed. In contrast to thioredoxin reductase activity, nitroreductase activity was not impaired with metronidazole-bound recEh Trx (unpublished data).

Thus, in the case of CDNB and azomycin, roughly half of the cytochrome c reduction is mediated by superoxide radical anions, whereas the metronidazole nitroradical anions directly transferred most of the electrons to cytochrome c. These results provide direct evidence for the formation of superoxide radical anions upon nitroimidazole treatment in general and within limits upon metronidazole treatment, and thereby for the generation of oxidative stress in the microaerophilic cell.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show for the first time that metronidazole forms adducts with proteins and non-protein thiols in an in vivo model, i.e., a parasite that is commonly treated with this drug.

In contrast to the in vitro data from the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, we found discrete changes in the protein profile of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> after metronidazole treatment, i.e., modification of five proteins, rather than indiscriminate protein adduct formation. It is possible that there are some more proteins affected, because 2DE does not cover the whole proteome of a given organism. Very large proteins, low-abundance proteins such as transcription factors, and highly hydrophobic membrane proteins that could also potentially form adducts with nitroimidazoles cannot be identified by our approach. Nevertheless, even if allowing for these restraints, the number of affected proteins can be expected to remain small.</p><p>Because we made similar observations with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Entamoeba dispar</named-content> (the nonpathogenic relative of <italic>E. histolytica)</italic>, <italic>G. intestinalis, T. vaginalis,</italic> and <italic>Es. coli</italic> (unpublished data), we suggest that adduct formation with a defined subset of proteins can take place in any organism that is treated with nitroimidazoles (unpublished data): the presumed reduction of the nitro group to an amino group during adduct formation with the proteins leads to easily discernable shifts on 2D gels to more basic pI values. It is, therefore, interesting to speculate that nitroimidazoles could be an invaluable tool in proteomics, because our data suggest that they allow identification of nitroreductases and associated proteins by shifting them to more basic pI values that can easily be detected on 2D gels.</p><p>Apart from forming covalent adducts with proteins, metronidazole also diminishes non-protein thiol levels in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), including that of cysteine. The observed decrease in non-protein thiol levels is due to covalent adduct formation with metronidazole and not due to oxidative stress generated by the activated drug, because the drop in thiol levels was most pronounced in the total absence of oxygen and least pronounced under aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>Since cysteine is a compound of essential importance to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> cell physiology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, and because it is assumed to function as the major reductant in the cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, its depletion could contribute to metronidazole toxicity in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content>. On the other hand, cysteine could also predominantly have a protective role because other essential thiols in the cell, such as coenzyme A, might also form adducts with metronidazole. Interestingly, after 2 h of incubation, non-protein thiol levels in cells treated with 50 &#x003bc;M metronidazole and 50 mM cysteine were almost diminished to the same extent as non-protein thiol levels in cells treated with metronidazole alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Longer incubation periods with additional 50 mM cysteine in the growth medium, however, might lead to consumption and, consequently, detoxification of metronidazole. This is indicated by the observation that the toxic effect of metronidazole was drastically reduced after addition of 50 mM cysteine, because more than 70&#x00025; of the cells in a culture survived 20-h exposure to (otherwise lethal) 50 &#x003bc;M metronidazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). In addition, raised cysteine levels also led to less protein adduct formation after metronidazole treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), which indicates the interdependence of non-protein and protein sulfhydryl groups with regard to metronidazole toxicity and which could be an explanation for the protective effect of cysteine during metronidazole exposure.</p><p>Treatment of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> cells with the clearly less toxic 2-nitroimidazole azomycin also led to the modification of the five proteins found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) and a decrease in non-protein thiol levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), albeit to a far smaller extent. Interestingly, the capability of azomycin to diminish non-protein thiol levels in the cell was also much more decreased by oxygen than was the case with metronidazole. Thus, the lower toxicity of azomycin could be based on its reduced tendency to form adducts with sulfhydryl groups and on its higher reactivity with oxygen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050211-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>A potentially detrimental effect of metronidazole binding to protein function is indicated by the significant decrease of the thioredoxin reductase activity of recEh TrxR after metronidazole treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g005">Figure 5</xref>). However, it is also conceivable that the observed oxidation of several amino acids concomitant with nitroimidazole binding, as observed with recEh Trx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), contributes to a diminished enzymatic function.</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> thioredoxin reductase was found to be a nitroreductase that is able in vitro to reduce CDNB, as well as the nitroimidazoles azomycin and metronidazole (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050211-t002">Table 2</xref>). In contrast to thioredoxin reductase activity of recEh TrxR, nitroreductase activity of metronidazole-bound recEh TrxR was not decreased (unpublished data), suggesting that nitroreduction is directly exerted by the FAD or FMN cofactor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Azomycin (2.4 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at a concentration of 100 &#x003bc;M) was more effectively reduced in the nitroreductase assay than metronidazole (1.2 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at a concentration of 1 mM), possibly due to the higher redox potential of azomycin (<italic>E</italic><sup>1</sup><sub>7</sub> &#x0003d; &#x02212;418 mV) as compared to metronidazole (<italic>E</italic><sup>1</sup><sub>7</sub> &#x0003d; &#x02212;486 mV) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, CDNB, which was the compound tested to be most efficiently reduced (6 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at a concentration of 10 &#x003bc;M) by recEh TrxR, exerted only a mildly toxic effect on <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> in our experimental setting&#x02014;arguably because it does not form adducts with the same proteins as observed with nitroimidazoles and because it does not lead to a reduction of non-protein thiol levels in the cell (D, Leitsch, unpublished data). It is also possible, however, that CDNB does not enter the cell as readily as metronidazole.</p><p>When superoxide dismutase was added to the reactions, cytochrome c reduction rates in the presence of CDNB and azomycin were approximately halved (47&#x00025; and 53&#x00025;, respectively), whereas in the presence of metronidazole, 75&#x00025; of the original rate was retained. These findings provide direct evidence for the generation of oxidative stress upon nitroimidazole treatment, because superoxide radical formation is evident. However, reoxidation of metronidazole by oxygen, with only 25&#x00025; of the metronidazole nitroradical anions reoxidized, was by no means as complete and as rapid as anticipated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, it is doubtful whether the futile-cycle effect is really as influential on metronidazole toxicity as has been suggested.</p><p>Although the nitroreductase activity of recEH TrxR is rather low, it is comparable to the nitroreductase activities determined for <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. thaliana</named-content> and mammalian thioredoxin reductases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. According to our quantitative evaluations of 2D gels from <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> cell extracts, thioredoxin reductase amounts to approximately 0.2&#x00025; of the total protein in the cell, equaling 10&#x02013;20 million copies per cell. Our estimate of the concentration of non-protein sulfhydryl groups amounts to 11 fmol/cell, i.e., only a 400-fold excess of non-protein sulfhydryl group levels over those of thioredoxin reductase. It is therefore conceivable that nitroimidazole reduction by thioredoxin reductase plays an important role in the decrease of non-protein thiol concentrations in the treated cell. In this context, it is interesting to note that studies in <named-content content-type="genus-species">G. intestinalis</named-content> have shown that the turnover of metronidazole reduction by purified ferredoxin was also not very pronounced (4 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), when purified PFOR instead of cell extract was used as the electron donor for ferredoxin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We suggest that, due to spatial proximity to the reactive nitroimidazole species generated, reduction of nitroimidazoles by thioredoxin reductase renders this enzyme vulnerable to nitroimidazole adduct formation. Thioredoxin, superoxide dismutase, and Mtp1, in turn, can be expected to be localized in proximity to thioredoxin reductase or to interact with thioredoxin reductase. This could render these proteins prone to nitroimidazole modification as well. Proteins that do not interact with thioredoxin reductase are likely to be less affected, because activated nitroimidazoles react with non-protein thiols or other compounds before they can react with proteins that are more distant to the site of nitroimidazole reduction. Thioredoxin needs to be reduced by thioredoxin reductase in order to fulfill its multiple purpose as a reductant protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas superoxide dismutase could be required to remove superoxide anion radicals that are indirectly generated by the nitroreductase activity of thioredoxin reductase. Superoxide dismutase might minimize the damage caused by superoxide when being positioned near thioredoxin reductase. Metronidazole target protein 1 (Mtp1) has no close homolog in any other organism whose genome has been sequenced so far, but it contains an O-glycosyl hydrolase domain and displays extended homology to an &#x003b1;-amylase in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content>. Recent research suggests that thioredoxins are also of decisive importance for starch degradation in plants. Very strong evidence has been presented for thioredoxin-mediated regulation of &#x003b1;-amylases in barley grain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Reduction of intramolecular disulfide bonds in amylases renders these enzymes more soluble, which is a prerequisite for amylase activity. Since Mtp1, as a protein of about 14 kDa, contains as many as six cysteines, it is conceivable that it requires thioredoxin in order to be functional. In the case of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, the situation could be different because arsenate reductase activity has been observed with human purine nucleoside phosphorylase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. This gives reason to speculate about the potential nitroreductase activity of the corresponding enzyme in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content>. Possibly, purine nucleoside phosphorylase binds to the imidazole ring of nitroimidazole compounds,because purines have an imidazole moiety. However, in the same study, the authors found arsenate reductase activity to strongly depend on reductants, especially DTT, which suggests that purine nucleoside phosphorylase could require reduction by thioredoxin as well. Very surprisingly, we did not find PFOR or ferredoxin among the proteins forming adducts with metronidazole, although PFOR can be readily found on 2D gels when analyzing <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> cell extracts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. High percentage (20&#x00025;) acrylamide gels did not show any shifted proteins in the range of ferredoxin (approximately 6 kDa). It has been reported that, in contrast to <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. vaginalis</named-content> or <italic>G. intestinalis,</italic> PFOR was not found to be down-regulated in metronidazole-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, which supports the assumption that PFOR might not be involved in nitroimidazole activation in this organism. However, this is questioned by the fact that ferredoxin 1 levels were found to be decreased in metronidazole-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. At the moment, we do not have a conclusive explanation for these contradictory results, but it is conceivable that down-regulation of ferredoxin 1 in metronidazole-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> could also be an accompanying effect of down-regulation of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. As a potential parallel, thioredoxin has been shown to regulate a large number of proteins in plants, including enzymes involved in glycolysis such as aldolase, enolase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and triose phosphate isomerase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, loss of thioredoxin activity or diminished thioredoxin levels in the cell could also impair the cellular metabolism, consequently leading to a down-regulation of ferredoxin.</p><p>Interestingly, a thioredoxin reductase originally with different annotation had been sequenced before the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> genome project had started. It was called disulphide oxidoreductase (Eh34) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; or later, flavin reductase, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, and was found to have reduced expression in metronidazole-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. The very slight differences in the sequences of thioredoxin reductase from the genome project and Eh34 (2&#x00025; on the DNA level) and the absence of an exact copy of the Eh34 gene in the genome database have not been resolved conclusively (I. Bruchhaus, personal communication). Eh34 was hypothesized by the authors to be involved in metronidazole activation because recombinant overexpression of Eh34 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> rendered cells more vulnerable to metronidazole &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. These unexpected findings of our colleagues strengthen our argument that thioredoxin reductase is involved in metronidazole activation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> because down-regulation of thioredoxin reductase, as an enzyme known to be involved in oxidative stress response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, would otherwise be highly counterproductive during metronidazole exposure that leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species, at least under microaerophilic conditions.</p><p>The data gathered prompted us to propose a model of metronidazole action in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> that implies, apart from generation of reactive oxygen species in the presence of oxygen, that toxicity of metronidazole could be attributed to covalent adduct formation with essential thiols and the proteins described, leading to impaired protein function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Arguably, the formation of covalent adducts and oxidative stress could even intertwine, because metronidazole toxicity was shown to be exacerbated in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> under microaerophilic conditions as compared to metronidazole treatment in the complete absence of oxygen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. At first glance, this is counterintuitive, because our results show that higher oxygen levels lead to less non-protein thiol depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Moreover, azomycin is by far less toxic to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> than metronidazole although it gives rise to more superoxide anion radicals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050211-t002">Table 2</xref>). However, azomycin forms fewer adducts with the five proteins identified, of which three, i.e., superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin reductase, and thioredoxin, are known to be involved in antioxidant defense. We show here that metronidazole-modified recEh TrxR displays a considerably reduced thioredoxin reductase activity. Thus, it is conceivable that the higher sensitivity of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> to metronidazole in the presence of oxygen is not due to a increased toxicity of metronidazole itself, but due to a reduced tolerance to oxygen because the cell's capability to remove harmful oxidants is impaired. Thioredoxin, for example, requires prior reduction by thioredoxin reductase in order to reduce peroxiredoxin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, an enzyme that oxidizes hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. Since, in contrast to thioredoxin reductase activity, the nitroreductase activity of thioredoxin reductase is not diminished by metronidazole binding, superoxide radicals might be continuously generated after reduction of oxygen by activated nitroimidazoles. Superoxide dismutase breaks down superoxide radical anions to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The latter would then accumulate due to a reduced peroxiredoxin activity.</p><fig id="pbio-0050211-g006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Model of Metronidazole Activation and Metronidazole Action in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content></title><p>After uptake by the cell, metronidazole is reduced by thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) (as shown in this study; black arrow), possibly by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (hypothesized in this study; dotted arrow) and, probably, by ferredoxin (shown to reduce metronidazole in <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. vaginalis</named-content> and <italic>G. intestinalis;</italic> interrupted arrow). After activation, metronidazole can develop its toxicity in a 2-fold way, either as a nitroradical anion or, if further reduced, as a reactive nitrosoimidazole (red arrows). The nitroradical anion can reduce O<sub>2</sub> and thereby generate reactive oxygen species, which are highly detrimental to the microaerophilic <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> cell. Alternatively, the nitrosoimidazole is generated, which forms adducts with non-protein thiols and/or proteins, resulting in the depletion of non-protein thiols and the modification of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), thioredoxin (Trx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), metronidazole target protein 1 (Mtp1), and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). Presumably, these five proteins become targets of modification due to their close spatial proximity to the site of metronidazole activation, i.e., thioredoxin reductase. The formation of covalent metronidazole adducts with proteins involved in antioxidant defense is likely to render the cells more vulnerable to oxidative stress, thereby exacerbating metronidazole toxicity to <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> in the presence of oxygen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050211-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050211.g006"/></fig><p>In any case, even in the complete absence of oxygen, metronidazole is a potent drug, suggesting that adduct formation of nitroimidazoles with the proteins identified and with non-protein thiol compounds can be very effective in killing <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. histolytica</named-content> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050211-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

In any case, nitro compounds had been previously reduced by recEh TrxR. Therefore, it was assumed that reduction of one nitro group by Eh TrxR subsequently resulted in one reduced cytochrome c molecule. Reaction mixtures contained 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM NADPH, 50 &#x003bc;M cytochrome c, 4 &#x003bc;g/ml recEh TrxR (equal to 118 nM) and different amounts of CDNB, azomycin, or metronidazole, respectively. Reduction of cytochrome c was measured over a time span of 5 min at 25 &#x000b0;C. In order to assess the proportion of electrons that are directly transferred from the reduced nitro compounds to cytochrome c, 2.5 &#x003bc;M bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (i.e., an approximately 20-fold excess over Eh TrxR) were added to the reactions to remove all generated superoxide radical anions.
