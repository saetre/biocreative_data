Several viticultural practices increase flavonoid content in the fruit, but the underlying genetic mechanisms responsible for these changes have not been completely deciphered. The impact of post-veraison sunlight exposure on anthocyanin and flavonol accumulation in grape berry skin and its relation to the expression of different transcriptional regulators known to be involved in flavonoid synthesis was studied. Treatments consisting of removing or moving aside the basal leaves which shade berry clusters were applied. Shading did not affect sugar accumulation or gene expression of <italic>HEXOSE TRANSPORTER 1,</italic> although in the leaf removal treatment, these events were retarded during the first weeks of ripening. Flavonols were the most drastically reduced flavonoids following shading and leaf removal treatments, related to the reduced expression of <italic>FLAVONOL SYNTHASE 4</italic> and its putative transcriptional regulator <italic>MYB12</italic>. Anthocyanin accumulation and the expression of <italic>CHS2</italic>, <italic>LDOX</italic>, <italic>OMT</italic>, <italic>UFGT, MYBA1</italic>, and <italic>MYB5a</italic> genes were also affected. Other regulatory genes were less affected or not affected at all by these treatments. Non-transcriptional control mechanisms for flavonoid synthesis are also suggested, especially during the initial stages of ripening. Although berries from the leaf removal treatment received more light than shaded fruits, malvidin-3-glucoside and total flavonol content was reduced compared with the treatment without leaf removal. This work reveals that flavonol-related gene expression responds rapidly to field changes in light levels, as shown by the treatment in which shaded fruits were exposed to light in the late stages of ripening. Taken together, this study establishes MYB-specific responsiveness for the effect of sun exposure and sugar transport on flavonoid synthesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bHLH</kwd><kwd>flavonoids</kwd><kwd>grape</kwd><kwd>leaf removal</kwd><kwd>MYB12</kwd><kwd>PAR</kwd><kwd>sugar</kwd><kwd>source</kwd><kwd>sink</kwd><kwd>WDR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Grapes (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L.), both for fresh and wine consumption, are an important source of flavonoids, including anthocyanins, flavonols, and flavan-3-ols. These molecules are particularly relevant in this fruit species since they define colour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Somers and Evans, 1974</xref>) and affect taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baxter <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vidal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hufnagel and Hofmann, 2008</xref>). In addition, they possess a high antioxidant capacity and contribute to protection against cardiovascular diseases and cancer (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin and Weng, 2006</xref>) when consumed as part of a Mediterranean diet. In order to increase berry flavonoid content in the vineyard, it is fundamental to understand the biosynthesis of these molecules and how this is affected by the environment and different viticultural practices.</p><p>Flavonoid biosynthesis is derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), one of the most-characterized secondary metabolic routes in plant systems. Although different groups of proteins are responsible for producing, transporting, and storing flavonoids, the two most-studied classes correspond to the biosynthetic (structural) enzymes and the transcription factors controlling the pathway. Flavonoid transcriptional regulators have been extensively studied in plant species such as maize, petunia, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and, lately, in grapes and apples. From all the possible transcription factors responsible for controlling the pathway, R2R3 MYB, &#x003b2; helix-loop-helix (bHLH), and trypthophan-aspartic acid repeat (WDR) proteins have been the most-extensively analysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Payne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Simplified overview of flavonol and anthocyanin biosynthesis within the phenylpropanoid pathway and its regulation in grape by characterized <italic>MYB</italic> genes (flavan-3-ols are not shown in this pathway).

In particular, many of the white grape cultivars present in the world today arose from multiallelic mutations of the MYBA1 and MYBA2 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lijavetzky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">This <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), which control the last biosynthetic step of anthocyanin synthesis, a glycosylation reaction mediated by the UDP-GLUCOSE FLAVONOID 3-<italic>O</italic>-GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE (UFGT) enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).

In grapes, an AtMYB4 homologue (Genbank accession EF113078), found to be a repressor of <italic>UFGT</italic> (JT Matus <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results) was recently isolated and characterized. A putative flavonol-related MYB transcription factor (MYB12; Genbank accession FJ418175) was also found while performing a genome-wide analysis of grape MYB members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Co-activators belonging to other transcription factor families (bHLH and WDR) have also been isolated recently (JT Matus <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results). From all these genes in grape, only <italic>MYBA</italic> genes have been studied in terms of their modulation by light and hormonal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), as well as by temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mori <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The impact of environmental factors and viticultural practices on the flavonoid content and composition of grape berries has been widely studied in diverse wine-producing regions (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Downey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Light and all those practices which promote its incidence on berries throughout grape ripening, significantly increase the accumulation of flavonoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cortell and Kennedy, 2006</xref>) and the expression of their biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Downey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Light-induced flavonoid synthesis requires changes in gene expression mediated by three major classes of photoreceptors: phytochromes, blue/UV-A light receptors, and UV-B light receptors (reviewed by Arg&#x000fc;elo-Astorga and Herrera-Estrella, 1998). The best-characterized light receptors in plants are phytochromes (PHY; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quail, 1994</xref>). These receptors are able to promote gene expression by three different signal transduction pathways. Of these, the cyclic GMP (cGMP)-mediated pathway regulates genes such as those involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis and <italic>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</italic> (<italic>CHS</italic>) was the first gene shown to be dependent on PHY-cGMP signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Millar <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christie and Jenkins, 1996</xref>).</p><p>In addition to light, temperature also influences flavonoid production, although in a negative manner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mori <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> demonstrated that high temperature increases anthocyanin degradation in grape skin, together with a decrease in expression of flavonoid biosynthetic and <italic>MYBA</italic> genes. On the other hand, low temperature increases anthocyanin production, as has been observed in grape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mori <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and other crop species (maize: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christie <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; red orange: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lo Piero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; apple: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ubi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Field practices which control vegetative growth of grapevines directly affect the incidence of light on grape clusters. These include shoot, tip, and leaf removal. Leaf removal is generally recommended between the onset of ripening (veraison) and harvest, eliminating approximately one-third of the basal leaves. This practice is applied with the purpose of balancing foliage vigour relative to fruit production, increasing exposure of clusters to sunlight, facilitating ventilation, and diminishing the incidence of fungal diseases. Considering the fact that photosynthetic activity of basal leaves is lower than that of intermediate and apical leaves after berries begin to soften (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hunter and Visser, 1989</xref>), post-veraison leaf removal should increase light incidence on the clusters, without significantly affecting the photosynthetic activity of the whole plant. From this period onwards, sugars transported into grapes originate mainly from intermediate and apical leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hunter and Visser, 1989</xref>). However, the effect of the time after veraison at which this practice is applied could have a substantial impact on grape physiology, since basal leaves lose their photosynthetic activity gradually during the ripening period.</p><p>In addition to this unresolved issue, there are no studies which correlate the changes observed in the content of grape flavonoids under different environmental conditions, with the expression of regulatory genes other than <italic>MYBA</italic> genes. In this work, the relationship between the expression of members of different transcription factor families and their target genes and flavonoid synthesis was studied under different post-veraison light exposure and leaf removal treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Experimental design and berry sampling throughout ripening</title><p>Different treatments were applied to a commercial Cabernet Sauvignon field at veraison (onset of ripening), located in the Maipo Valley, Chile (33&#x000b0;36&#x02019; S, 70&#x000b0;39&#x02019; W), during the 2006/2007 growing season.

Light is a fundamental requirement for colour formation in grapes and other fruit crops such as apple. Despite this, differences in the experimental design, the analytical measurements used, the cultivar chosen, the geographical location of the experimental site and many other factors, have produced contradictory results regarding the relationship between anthocyanin content and light in grapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hunter <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergqvist <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spayd <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Downey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).

In the leaf removal treatment (T4), the levels of the most methylated di- and tri-hydroxylated derivates (Po3G and Mv3G, respectively) were significantly lower in the second week after veraison, even when they were compared with the delayed (T2) and shaded (T3) treatments. Dp3G, Pt3G, and Cy3G were not detected in the samples from the leaf removal treatment at this ripening stage. This observation suggests an effect of removing source organs (basal leaves) on flavonoid synthesis during the initial stages of berry ripening. Despite this, and with the exception of Mv3G, all anthocyanin levels in T4 increased to those observed in the fully exposed T1 treatment after the fourth week, suggesting the activation of a compensation process, at least regarding anthocyanin accumulation. Pt3G and Po3G abundances were even higher in the leaf-removal treatment compared to T1 at 8 WAV, prior to harvest. Mv3G levels were significantly higher in the exposed treatment, and although the leaf removal treatment increased Mv3G concentration by the fourth week, it never reached the same levels as in T1.</p><p>Although the least abundant anthocyanin observed was Cy3G, its concentration increased in the fully shaded treatment (T3) during ripening when compared to T1, T2, and T4. All other non-acylated glycosides began to decrease during the latter stages of ripening in all treatments. Similar results regarding possible shifts in anthocyanin composition have been suggested, in which low light and cool climates could increase the concentration of non-acylated cyanidin glycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Downey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Since significant differences were observed in the metabolic profiling of anthocyanins, it was reasonable to expect a differential expression in some of the flavonoid biosynthetic genes, under the treatments applied in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Metabolites were analysed in even-numbered weeks, whereas gene expression was determined in odd-numbered weeks. This sampling approach enabled us to observe different possible regulatory mechanisms for flavonoid synthesis in a fruit development stage-specific manner. In general, biosynthetic genes were not affected by treatments during the first week of sampling, although metabolites already showed differences between treatments. This led us to propose a possible non-transcriptional regulation of flavonoid synthesis during the initial weeks of berry ripening. In fact, it has been shown that the activity of several enzymes of the pathway, such as PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE (PAL), can be affected by light through a non-transcriptional mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sreelakshmi and Sharma, 2008</xref>). From the third week, biosynthetic genes already differ in expression, depending on each treatment. Regulation at the transcriptional level is thus suggested for the mid and latter stages of berry skin ripening.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Changes in the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, the MYBA regulator and <italic>HEXOSE TRANSPORTER1</italic>, under different light exposure or leaf removal treatments.

At 3 WAV and 5 WAV, a significantly higher expression value for the T1 treatment was observed, indicating that these genes are being regulated by light.

Since source organs were being removed in this treatment, a possible gene being affected could be a sugar transporter, which incorporates sugars exported from the leaves into the berries, contributing to the sink&#x02013;source balance. The grape <italic>HEXOSE TRANSPORTER1</italic> (<italic>HT1</italic>) is expressed in all berry tissues and leaves and is involved in sugar import into the berry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fillion <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> (bottom), <italic>HT1</italic> expression was affected only in the early stages of berry skin ripening (1 WAV), exclusively in the leaf removal treatment. This down-regulation could be due to a decrease in source organ potential in the period in which leaves are highly photosynthetically active (first weeks after veraison).</p><p>In addition to a possible role of HT1 in the first stages of mesocarp berry growth, before veraison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vignault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), removing source organs diminished <italic>HT1</italic> expression in berry skin, suggesting an important role of this transporter in this particular berry tissue. HT1 is also regulated post-transcriptionally by a hexokinase-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of this practice on the expression and regulation of invertases, sucrose transporters, and recently-isolated hexose transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hayes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), to understand the global impact on sugar accumulation.</p><p>Even though mesocarp cells are specialized in incorporating and hydrolysing sucrose into glucose and fructose for storage during grape ripening, exocarp cell sugar transport could directly affect skin colour pigmentation in the same cells, as there is a direct relationship between sugar content and anthocyanin synthesis in grape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vitrac <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) and other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Solfanelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

By this means, at 1 WAV, a decrease in <italic>HT1</italic> expression under the leaf removal conditions could diminish sugar import into exocarp cells, with the consequent repression of flavonoid-related expression at 3 WAV. Hormone signalling (e.g. ethylene or abscisic acid) may be playing an additional role in this response since organ removal constitutes a stress event to the plant.

FaMYB1 is an anthocyanin repressor found in strawberry.

This gene is down-regulated by UV-B in order to increase the content of these protective UV-screening molecules only under stress conditions. Recently, a grape MYB4 homologue repressor was isolated and characterized (JT Matus <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results). Despite its similarity to AtMYB4, this gene negatively regulates <italic>UFGT</italic> expression, thus it is a direct repressor of anthocyanin synthesis.

It is possible that another bHLH gene could be regulated by light conditions. The WDR1 co-activator was only affected at 5 WAV between treatments T1 and T3. Therefore, MYB factors may participate in this regulation more directly than bHLH or WDR factors, in response to environmental conditions such as light. New members from these families should be isolated and tested to resolve this issue. In any case, differences observed between the responsiveness of transcriptional regulators and target gene expression levels may imply the effect of additional regulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Flavonols are the most drastically affected flavonoids under shadow treatments, an effect possibly mediated by the MYB12 transcription factor</title><p>Among flavonoids, the accumulation of flavonols was the most dramatically affected in berry skins under the treatments applied in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>).

This change in expression was correlated with a 2-fold increase in total flavonol content compared to T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>), although this level is still very low compared to T1 or T4 treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Viticultural practices affect the plant directly if they constitute a stress event such as organ removal, but can also affect the plant indirectly as a consequence of the modified microenvironment. Gene regulation of a metabolic pathway under these conditions varies in terms of the intensity and timing of the practice imposed. In this study, it was possible to observe that leaf removal at veraison has an early diminishing effect on sugar transport and flavonoid synthesis, especially on flavonol accumulation, during the ripening of the berry skin. For most anthocyanins, nevertheless, these differences are compensated at harvest. Although leaf removal increases sun exposure of the cluster, it is necessary to evaluate the exact changes in sink&#x02013;source relationships that may occur in this condition.</p><p>Light and sugar are capable of inducing significant changes in flavonoid-related gene expression. In this study, it was shown that <italic>MYB</italic> genes regulating flavonoid synthesis are differentially affected by light. MYBs regulating the final anthocyanin or flavonol biosynthetic steps are more affected than MYBs controlling several points of the pathway. Other regulatory genes isolated so far do not respond in the same manner as MYB factors. It is important to examine the presence and function of regulatory elements in the promoters of these light responsive genes in order to understand these differences. In addition, it is suggested that other regulatory mechanisms (not related to transcriptional control) could also be governing flavonoid synthesis at least during the initial stages of berry ripening.</p><p>This work exemplifies how the flavonoid content and the genes controlling their synthesis are affected and could be manipulated by viticultural practices such as canopy management. New research efforts will be needed fully to understand the interaction between the plant, the environment, and the field practices in order to modify the quality of grapes. As an interesting projection for continuing the study of the regulation of flavonoid synthesis, it is necessary to analyse whether other viticultural practices, such as irrigation regimes, modify the expression of any of the regulatory genes considered in this study. Screening the expression of biosynthetic genes and their transcription factors under different environmental conditions and field practices will increase our understanding of the complex regulatory network under which flavonoids are being synthesized and accumulated.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern336/DC1">Supplementary material</ext-link> is available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern336/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>.</bold> Basal leaf moving for treatments T1 and T2 using nylon zip-ties.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern336/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>.</bold> HPLC chromatogram for (A) anthocyanidinic (Abs 520 nm) and (B) low molecular weight phenolic compounds, which include flavonol derivatives (Abs 280 nm).</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern336/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>.</bold> Cluster morphology at 9 weeks after veraison.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern336/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>.</bold> Primers used for quantification of transcripts by means of real-time quantitative PCR.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern336/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>.</bold> Concentration of all anthocyanin compounds from the different light exposure treated berry skins, taken from 2&#x02013;8 weeks after veraison.</p><p><bold>Video S1.</bold> Daily time-course of the experimental field in which sunlight treatments were imposed (north orientation).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="ern336_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="ern336_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime" xlink:href="ern336_null030965-file002.mov"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks to Hector Morales for his contribution in HPLC-DAD analysis.
