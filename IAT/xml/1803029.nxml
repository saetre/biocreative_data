Interestingly, several well characterized genes that function at the early steps of eye development encode different splice variants.

By using the GAL4/UAS binary expression system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Brand1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> to drive expression of B52 in a tissue-specific manner, it was possible to obtain viable adults harboring phenotypes in the eye (GMR-gal4 driver) or in bristles (HS-gal4 and sca-gal4 drivers) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Labourier1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

When <italic>UAS-B52</italic> females are mated to <italic>ey-gal4</italic> males, only 40&#x00025; of the progeny reached the adult stage. 45&#x00025; of surviving flies had reduced eye size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g001">Fig. 1A, panel c and Fig. 1B, panel b</xref>) and 10&#x00025; lacked one eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g001">Fig. 1A, panel d and Fig. 1B, panels c and d</xref>).

The observed phenotypes appear to be specific for B52 Over-expression because relatively weak defects of retinal development or no phenotypes are observed with another SR protein, dASF, when overexpressed by the same driver using <italic>UAS-dSF2</italic> lines (data not shown). Both western-blotting and semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR of RNA from eye imaginal disc confirmed this assumption and demonstrated that in transgenic flies the over-expression of B52/SRp55 did not exceed 2 fold compared to wild type (not shown). Thus, moderate excess of B52/SRp55 in developing eyes gives rise to the same phenotype as low levels of eyeless gene expression. However, quantitative RT-PCR failed to demonstrate dramatic changes in <italic>eyeless</italic> total mRNA levels in B52/SRp55 transgenic flies compared to wild type. The expression levels of other master genes involved in eye formation were also not detectably changed.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>B52 levels affect alternative splicing of developmentally regulated eyeless gene</title><p>Failure to find quantitative changes in <italic>eyeless</italic> expression levels prompted us to test whether qualitative changes occurred that could account for the observed phenotypes associated with B52 over-production. While most studies about <italic>eyeless</italic> gene function have considered only one isoform encoded by this gene, one report in the literature alluded to isolation of a cDNA that encodes a longer isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Hauck1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The latter isoform is also present among ESTs described in the fly Database and corresponds to inclusion of an exonic sequence contained in the first intron of the previously described <italic>eyeless</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Sequence comparison between four <italic>Drosophila</italic> species revealed that the intron/exon structure of the eyeless gene is highly conserved and all contain similar exonic sequences in the first intron (not shown). This exon codes for protein fragment that is higly conserved at the beginning and final third with a central region that is less conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). RT-PCR analysis of RNA from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. virilis</italic> revealed that this exon is alternatively spliced in these two fly species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Together these observations suggest that the longer splice variant carries out an essential function that depends on alternative splicing. Here we refer to the isoform including exon 2 as <italic>ey(2a)</italic>.</p><p>Previous results identified the spliced form <italic>ey(2a)</italic> in embryos and larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Hauck1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, however, the levels of individual e<italic>y</italic> and e<italic>y(2a)</italic> isoforms were not compared at the different developmental stages. Therefore, mRNA products of <italic>eyeless</italic> gene were examined by RT-PCR and normalized to ribosomal <italic>Rp49</italic> mRNA at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Both larvae and pupae contained larger amounts of <italic>ey(2a)</italic> than <italic>ey</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g002">Fig. 2D, lanes 2&#x02013;3</xref>). In contrast, embryos and adult flies had almost equal levels of both types of mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g002">Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 4</xref>). To determine whether these two isoforms are expressed in different tissues or are co-expressed in the same tissues, we analysed their distribution in two larval tissues. In third instar larvae, <italic>ey</italic> is expressed in the eye disc and in the brain. RT-PCR analysis on these two isolated tissues revealed that both <italic>ey</italic> isoforms are co-expressed in these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g002">Fig. 2D, lanes 5 and 6</xref>). Albeit, both tissues contained larger amounts of <italic>ey(2a)</italic> than <italic>ey</italic> mRNA. Moreover, cultured SL2 cells expressed both isoforms (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig 3C</xref>), suggesting that they are expressed in the same cells.</p><p>Given the existence of <italic>ey</italic> exon 2 alternative splicing in the eye imaginal disc, we asked whether B52 over-expression under the control of <italic>ey-gal4</italic>, which triggers the phenotypes depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, can perturb exon 2 inclusion. RT-PCR analyses, using primers that discriminate exon 2 inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3A, panel ey(2a)</xref>) from exon 2 skipping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3A, panel ey</xref>), on WT and ey&#x0003e;B52 eye imaginal discs showed that exon 2 inclusion is increased by B52 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3A, all panels compare lanes 1 and 2</xref>), suggesting that B52 is involved in exon 2 splicing. To further investigate this hypothesis, we asked whether B52 loss of function can affect <italic>ey</italic> exon 2 alternative splicing. To this end, we took advantage of a <italic>B52<sup>s2249</sup></italic> mutant that contains a <italic>P{lacW}</italic> transgene inserted 16 nt downstream from the <italic>B52</italic> transcription start site (<italic>Flybase</italic>). <italic>B52<sup>s2249</sup></italic> homozygous larvae die at the first- and second-instar larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Rasheva1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> and present study), similar to the <italic>B52<sup>28</sup></italic> null larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Ring1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

RT-PCR analyses with <italic>eyeless</italic>-specific primers revealed, however, that B52 depletion is correlated with a reduction in the <italic>ey(2a)</italic> mRNA isoform and with a parallel increase in the expression level of <italic>ey</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3B, lower left panel compare lanes 1 and 2</xref>).

We observed that SL2 cells express both <italic>ey</italic> isoforms in a ratio similar to that observed in brain and eye tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Cells were incubated with <italic>B52</italic> double-stranded RNA, and the level of B52 protein was determined by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3C, panel B52</xref>). As a control, cells were treated in parallel with <italic>dASF</italic>-specific dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3C, panel dASF</xref>). Following six days of treatment, each dsRNA efficiently and specifically depleted the corresponding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3C, compare panels B52 and dASF to panel &#x003b1;-tubulin</xref>). RT-PCR analyses of dsRNA-treated cells showed that B52 depletion triggered a significant decrease in <italic>ey(2a)</italic> mRNA levels with a concomitant increase in <italic>ey</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3C, upper panel lane 2</xref>), whereas dASF depletion had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3C, upper panel lane 1</xref>). Depletion of either B52 or dASF, however, did not affect the expression of a specific isoform of <italic>doublesex</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3C, panel <italic>dsx</italic> lanes 1&#x02013;3</xref>), known to be regulated by SRp20, another member of the SR protein family. Altogether our results show that varying the B52 level <italic>in vivo</italic> modulates exon 2 inclusion and provides strong evidence that B52, but not another SR protein, is required for <italic>ey</italic> exon2 inclusion.</p><p>Sites on RNA that bind B52 with high affinity and specificity (BBS) have previously been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Shi1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. When RNA aptamers containing multi-mers of these BBS were expressed in transgenic flies under the same genetic driver of B52 over-production, they fully restored wild type phenotypes, implying that B52 binds to its target sequences <italic>in vivo</italic> to regulate alternative splicing. To test whether exon 2 of <italic>eyeless</italic> contains sequences recognized by B52, UV crosslinking experiments were performed under splicing conditions using Kc cells nuclear extracts as a source of B52 protein and three probes corresponding to contiguous sequences of exon 2, named (a), (b) and (c), which cover its entire length. Radiolabeled probes (a) and (b) bound to a &#x0223c;52 kDa band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3D, lane 1&#x02013;2</xref>), which was also detected with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to the B52 high affinity binding site established by SELEX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Shi1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> that was used as positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3D, lane 4</xref>), making it very likely that the protein corresponded to B52. The identity of the protein was further confirmed using RNA affinity selection procedure on (a), (b) and (c) fragments, where B52 was detected by anti-B52 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Both (a) and (b) but not (c) RNA fragments are able to bind B52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3E, panel B52 lanes 1&#x02013;3</xref>). Neither fragment, however, showed binding to dASF which, like B52, contains two RRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3E, panel dASF, lanes 1&#x02013;3</xref>). Consistent with these results, competition experiments showed that the (a)- and the (b)-exon 2 sequences competed with the crosslinking of B52 high affinity binding site (BBS) whereas (c)-type sequence did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g003">Fig. 3D, lanes 5&#x02013;11</xref>), confirming that both (a) and (b) sequences behave as B52 binding sites.

To this end, we expressed either <italic>ey</italic> or <italic>ey(2a)</italic> cDNAs with the UAS/Gal4 system. Reproducibly, when expressed in the eye disc under the control of the <italic>ey-gal4</italic> driver, Ey(2a) induced formation of small eyes that are the result of reduced number of ommatidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g004">Fig. 4A, panels c and f</xref>). However, all the structures of the ommatidia were present (panel i), implying that Ey(2a) does not interfere with normal process of differentiation of the eye but limits its size. In contrast, expression of the Ey isoform led to more variable phenotypes ranging from a small reduction and disorganization of the eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g004">Fig. 4A, panels b, e and h</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Curtiss1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>) to over growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). Quantization of these results indicated that small changes in the amount (1.5 to 2 fold) of either isoform were responsible for the observed phenotypes. Given that B52 also regulates splicing in a dose-dependent manner, these results confirmed our finding that B52 finely tunes eye organogenesis by controlling the amount of these splice variants.</p><p>The <italic>ey</italic> gene is a master control gene for eye morphogenesis, because the Ey isoform of the gene has the ability to induce ectopic eye structures in several imaginal discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Halder1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Gehring2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we decided to study the potential of Ey(2a) to induce ectopic eyes by using the Gal4 system to target its expression to imaginal discs where it is normally not transcribed. Comparison of phenotypes induced by MS1096, which allows specific expression of either Ey or Ey(2a) in the wing disc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Milan1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, revealed that Ey(2a) was less efficient to trigger ectopic eye structures in the adult wings than Ey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g004">Fig. 4B, compare panels a and b</xref>). The eye structures reproducibly were smaller in size with Ey(2a) in comparison to those obtained with the Ey isoform. This observation was further confirmed using the <italic>dpp</italic>-Gal4 driver, which is expressed in all imaginal discs. Again, more pronounced eye morphogenesis was obtained with the Ey isoform than with Ey(2a) where only small foci of unstructured ommatidia were observed (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Ey(2a) is less potent than Ey in activating transcription of target genes and in binding to cognate DNA sequences</title><p>The above results are consistent with the hypothesis that Ey and Ey(2a) have distinct function(s) during eye morphogenesis. As several genes are under the control of the <italic>ey</italic> gene to switch on the eye development pathway, it is conceivable that Ey and Ey(2a) isoforms differ in their ability to activate target genes. To test this hypothesis, we determined the expression level of specific target genes after ectopic expression of either isoform in the wing disc. We considered well-characterized direct targets of Ey, <italic>eyes absent (Eya)</italic> and <italic>shifted (shf)</italic>, which were examined using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, gel shift assays, and reporter analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Pauli1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Ostrin1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that while both <italic>ey(2a)</italic> and <italic>ey</italic> isoforms were overexpressed to similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g004">Fig. 4C, panel ey</xref>), induction of ey-target genes mediated by Ey(2a) was lower compared with Ey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g004">Fig. 4C, compare lanes 2 and 3 of each panel</xref>). As expected neither isoforms stimulated transcription of <italic>optix</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g004">Fig. 4C, panel opx</xref>), confirming the specificity of induction of the direct target genes.</p><p>The differences in expression of the target genes could be explained if Ey(2a) and Ey isoforms exhibited different affinities for target DNA sequences. The Ey protein contains two DNA binding domains, a paired domain (PD) and a paired-type homeodomain (HD) both of which are capable of binding specific DNA sequences. Only PD, but not HD, protein has been shown to be essential for eye development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Punzo2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that Ey(2a) has additional amino-acids immediately upstream from its paired domain, it is possible that this modification affects its binding ability and/or specificity. To directly test these possibilities, the two Ey paired domains (denoted PD and PD(2a)) were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> as gluthatione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), and their DNA binding abilities were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). In the presence of a large excess (200 fold) of cold competitor, the extended paired domain PD(2a) did not bind to CD19-2, the high affinity binding site for the shorter eyeless paired domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Czerny1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g005">Fig. 5B, compare lanes 3 and 7</xref>). PD(2a) also bound less efficiently to other paired domain recognition sites, including sowt3, a sequence found upstream of <italic>so</italic> and demonstrated to regulate its transcription by Eyeless <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Niimi1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g005">Fig. 5B, compare lanes 4 and 8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g005">Fig. 5C, right panel</xref> for quantitative comparison). Weak binding affinity was also demonstrated for P6CON, a high affinity binding site for Pax6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Epstein1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, the human homolog of Eyeless (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g005">Fig. 5B, compare lanes 1 and 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g005">Fig. 5C, left panel</xref> for quantitative comparison). The specificity of binding of recombinant proteins to these sequences was observed, however, when increasing amounts of unlabeled probes were added and showed to compete with themselves in the presence of large excess of competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g005">Fig. 5D, left and right panels</xref>).</p><p>Since P6CON sequence was also refractory for binding the paired domain of Pax6(5a), a Pax6 isoform with a 14-amino-acid insertion in the paired domain that arises by alternative splicing (Epstein et al., 1994), it was important to determine whether PD(2a) has the same specificity as Pax6(5a). EMSA assays were, therefore, performed with 5aCON, a sequence that selectively binds Pax6(5a) paired domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Epstein1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. As previously observed, 5aCON did not have a high affinity for PD(2a) compared to PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000253-g005">Fig. 5B, compare lanes 2 and 6</xref>). Furthermore, while 5aCON changed the EMSA binding profile of Pax6(5a) paired domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Epstein1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, no changes in gel shift were observed with PD(2a). Together, these results suggest that the 60 additional amino-acids at the N-terminal part of the paired domain of <italic>eyeless</italic> weaken its DNA binding activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we show that B52, an SR protein splicing factor, controls the production of two alternatively spliced isoforms <italic>ey</italic> and <italic>ey (2a)</italic> of <italic>eyeless</italic>, a master control gene for eye morphogenesis. Our data not only establish the mechanistic link between a splicing factor and a critical component of eye development, but also demonstrate the significance of this regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. To date, only the <italic>ey</italic> isoform has been extensively studied, and its ectopic expression shown to induce functional eyes on the legs, wings, and antennae of the fly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Halder1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we demonstrate that <italic>ey</italic> and <italic>ey(2a)</italic> isoforms generated by alternative splicing are co expressed throughout <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. The importance of this splicing event for eye formation is underscored by its conservation among several <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and its involvement in changing the DNA binding properties of a hallmark feature of Pax gene family, the PD domain. Unlike Ey, Ey(2a) has an impaired ability to trigger efficient <italic>ey</italic> target gene expression and to bind efficiently to DNA cognate sequences. Intriguingly, our data further suggest that <italic>ey(2a)</italic> is apparently acting in a dominant-negative fashion toward <italic>ey</italic>. Over-production of <italic>ey(2a)</italic> in the eye causes a small eye phenotype, whereas, under the same conditions <italic>ey</italic> overproduction produces local eye over-growth. Thus, during eye formation, small changes in the <italic>ey/ey(2a)</italic> equilibrium may ensure a correct number of ommatidia and thereby control eye morphogenesis. In this context, it may be relevant that the activity of the <italic>eyeless</italic> gene is adjusted by a splicing event producing two isoforms with antagonistic activities rather than a transcription factor, like <italic>twin of eyeless</italic> (<italic>toy</italic>), that may turn it on and off in a more restricted way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Czerny2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our data also provide support for the idea of a direct connection between pre-mRNA splicing and eye development being conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Gehring1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Quiring1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. As in vertebrates, where the single <italic>Pax6</italic> gene produces two alternatively splicing isoforms, referred to as <italic>Pax6</italic> and <italic>Pax6(5a)</italic> that exhibit distinct functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Epstein1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, the <italic>eyeless</italic> gene also encodes two isoforms with different transcriptional properties. In the case of the <italic>Pax 6</italic> gene, alternative splicing generates two transcripts that differ in the inclusion of 14 amino acids encoded by the additional exon 5a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Epstein1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. This insertion occurs immediately N-terminal of an &#x003b1;-helix that is important for the recognition of specific DNA sequences by the PD domain and thereby profoundly alters its DNA-binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Epstein1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. When tested on the well-known bipartite paired domain recognition sequences both <italic>ey(2a)</italic> and <italic>Pax6(5a)</italic> PD domains fail to bind <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Czerny2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>; this study). However, Pax6(5a) but not Ey(2a) could interact with the highly specialized recognition sequence 5aCON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Epstein1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, this study), suggesting that Ey(2a) might have a different specificity from Pax6(5a). Alternatively, additional amino acids N-terminal to PD domain of Ey(2a) may mask the PD domain and thus prevent its interaction with target DNA sequences. Future experiments are needed to establish the structure of the Ey(2a) PD domain with its additional N-terminal amino acids and to more definitively test whether Ey(2a) activates target genes other than those recognized by Ey and/or mediates assembly of different transcriptional complexes to exhibit distinct transcriptional activation properties.</p><p>Our experiments suggest that one of the functions mediated by B52 during <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye development is to attenuate the effect of an over-expression of <italic>ey</italic> that could be detrimental for eye morphogenesis. This proposal stems from the ectopic expression experiments showing that over-expression of B52 is associated with partial or complete loss of the eye, a phenotype that is equivalent to inactivation of an eye-specific enhancer of the <italic>eyeless</italic> locus by transposon insertion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Hauck1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Further support comes from B52 depletion experiments showing a two fold reduction of <italic>ey(2a)</italic> and concomitant increase of <italic>ey</italic> mRNA levels. However, the e<italic>yeless</italic> alternative splicing event was not identified in large scale analysis of alternatively spliced pre-mRNAs that are aberrantly regulated in B52-deficient tissue culture cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Blanchette1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that previous studies have used a robust system to select alternative splicing events and only weak expression of eyeless was detected in SL2 cells (present study), it is likely that the two fold changes in the <italic>ey/ey(2a)</italic> ratio was below the threshold to be detected by Blanchette et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Blanchette1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, genetic and biochemical analyses like the ones described in this paper appear to be essential to decipher the function of specific isoforms, whose levels are moderately altered during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development.</p><p>The exact mechanism by which B52 influences alternative splicing of <italic>eyeless</italic> pre-mRNA is still unknown. <italic>In vitro</italic> data showed that B52 binds directly the alternative exon 2 and mediates its inclusion. However, computational scanning of the target exonic sequence for previously reported SELEX consensus RNA binding sequence recognized by B52 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Hoffman1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Shi1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, failed to reveal any match to this sequence, suggesting that B52 interacts with a set of distinct RNA sequences to regulate the <italic>eyeless</italic> splicing event. It is also possible that, as with other RNA binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Bourgeois1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Tacke1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>eyeless</italic>-regulated splice sites require the formation of large, multi-protein complexes compatible with the requirement for a higher order of complexity, rather than a single RNA-protein interaction. Identification of partners assembled in these complexes will be informative about mechanism(s) leading to tissue-specific regulation of <italic>eyeless</italic> alternative exon 2. We cannot completely rule out the possibility, however, that deregulation of <italic>eyeless</italic> alternative splicing in both <italic>B52<sup>-</sup></italic> larvae and in <italic>B52</italic> RNAi-mediated knock down in SL2 cells may be due to an indirect effect. But failure to observe similar splicing phenotype associated with either over expression or depletion of another SR protein, dASF, further supports the idea that eyeless alternative splicing is specifically mediated by direct interaction of B52 with exon 2 sequences.</p><p>B52 deficiency does not seem to induce major defects in growth and differentiation of the eye disc during larval stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000253-Rasheva1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> and does not abolish eyeless pre-mRNA splicing, but rather makes a specific contribution to its regulation during eye morphogenesis.
