The 5' regulatory region and exons 1&#x02013;2 are derived from <italic>CYP2A7</italic>, and exons 3&#x02013;9 are derived from <italic>CYP2A6</italic>. Conventional methods for detection of <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>consist of two-step PCR protocols that are laborious and unsuitable for high-throughput genotyping.

We first validated the assay on 104 DNA samples that were also genotyped by conventional two-step PCR and by cycle sequencing. <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>allele frequencies were then determined using the Pyrosequencing assay on 181 multi-ethnic DNA samples from subjects of African American, European Caucasian, Pacific Rim, and Hispanic descent.

It was first identified as the human coumarin 7-hydroxylase enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>is also the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of nicotine to cotinine. Substantial inter-individual and inter-ethnic differences in enzyme activity are thought to be attributable to genetics as well as to environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Individuals lacking a functional <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>gene have impaired nicotine metabolism and are therefore less prone to nicotine addiction and possibly tobacco-related cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>gene is located on chromosome 19, adjacent to the inactive and highly homologous <italic>CYP2A7 </italic>gene. Of the 17 different allelic variants in <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>that are reported to abolish or decrease enzymatic activity, five are the result of unequal crossover and gene conversion events between <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>and <italic>CYP2A7 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The hybrid <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>allele is the product of such a crossover event; it contains the 5' regulatory region and exons 1&#x02013;2 of the <italic>CYP2A7 </italic>gene and exons 3&#x02013;9 of the <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>gene. The overall effect is a change in 10 amino acids and a reduction in enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The method currently used to genotype <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>involves a two-step PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The first step (PCR I) amplifies a 2.3 kb fragment encompassing a region from 240 bp upstream of the start codon to exon 3. This method uses a forward primer that binds to a site that is identical in both <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>and <italic>CYP2A7 </italic>gene sequences. However, amplification of the <italic>CYP2A7 </italic>gene is prevented by use of a reverse primer that is specific for <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>exon 3 sequence. Thus, the primer set can amplify both <italic>CYP2A6*1 </italic>wild-type and <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>variant but not the <italic>CYP2A7 </italic>gene. The PCR I product serves as a template for two separate allele-specific PCR reactions (PCR II). Genotype determination is by gel electrophoresis of allele-specific products for <italic>CYP2A6*1 </italic>and <italic>CYP2A6*12</italic>. Although accurate and reliable, this method is not practical for use in large population screening.</p><p>The aim of this study was to design a Pyrosequencing assay to genotype the <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>hybrid allele that could be adapted to higher-throughput studies. The unique sequence structure of the hybrid allele lends itself to this technology. The Pyrosequencing method involves solution-based fluorescent real-time DNA sequencing whereby a sequencing primer is hybridized to a single-stranded PCR amplicon that serves as a template for sequential polymerase-catalyzed incorporation of nucleotides. Each incorporation event facilitates a cascade of enzymatic reactions that generates light displayed as a series of peaks (Pyrogram<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>traces) representative of the nucleotide sequence. The Pyrosequencing method has been used for many applications, such as SNP genotyping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], DNA methylation analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and gene copy number assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>DNA samples from 90 individuals of the Polymorphism Discovery Resource (PDR) and 14 individuals of a multi-generational Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)/Utah family (Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ) were used to optimize and validate the Pyrosequencing assay. An additional 181 samples from the Coriell SNP500 panel and the NIGMS Human Variation panels HD24AA, HD24EC, HD24CHI, and HD07 Japanese <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ccr.coriell.org/Sections/Collections/NIGMS/Populations.aspx?PgId=177"/> were genotyped using the validated Pyrosequencing assay to assess multi-ethnic variation in frequency of the <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>allele. The combined panels included African Americans (n = 47), European Caucasians (n = 48), Pacific Rim (n = 54), and Hispanics (n = 32). The repository retains no links to individuals, and the Coriell Institutional Review Board reviews the procedures of the repository annually. In addition, 7,159 participants aged 12 years or older from Phase 2 (1991&#x02013;1994) of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] were screened using the Pyrosequencing assay to facilitate automation into the workflow. Use of these samples for this study was approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS) Institutional Review Board. Since the initial informed consent for use of participant blood for research did not include genetics, the CDC/NCHS Ethics Review Board approved a revised plan in 2001 which allows for the linkage of genetic results to NHANES data through the NCHS Research Data Center to ensure that confidentiality of study participant's identity is maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Assay Design and Validation</title><p>The Pyrosequencing assay was designed on the basis of sequences for the <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>and <italic>CYP2A7 </italic>genes obtained from the Ensembl Gene ID ENSG00000213052 and ENSG00000198077 databases, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The two sequences were aligned from 240 bp upstream of the start codon up to and including 25 bp of exon 3 to locate suitable PCR primer regions to specifically amplify <italic>CYP2A6*1 </italic>and <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>alleles but not the <italic>CYP2A7 </italic>gene. The forward PCR primer is located upstream of exon 2 and targets a region that is identical in both <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>and <italic>CYP2A7 </italic>sequences. The 3'-biotinylated reverse primer is specific to <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>sequence and binds to the beginning of exon 3. The reverse primer does not bind to the <italic>CYP2A7 </italic>sequence because of the presence of two neighboring nucleotide mismatches in the primer binding site. The specificities of the PCR primers and the primer melting temperatures were verified by use of the NCBI BLAST server <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/"/>.</p><p>The internal forward sequencing primer is nested just downstream of the forward PCR primer in intron 1. It contains two degenerate nucleotides to enable the primer to hybridize to both <italic>CYP2A6*1 </italic>and <italic>CYP2A6*12</italic>-specific PCR products that differ from each other by two nucleotides at the primer binding site. The sequencing primer is positioned to interrogate two key nucleotide sites that allow for clear distinction between <italic>CYP2A6*1 </italic>and <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>alleles. Primer location and sequences are described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of DNA sequence for <italic>CYP2A6*1 </italic>and <italic>CYP2A6*12</italic></bold>.

The 25 &#x003bc;l PCR reaction contained 20 ng DNA, 0.4 &#x003bc;M of each primer, 1&#x000d7; HotStarTaq Master Mix, and 1&#x000d7; Q-solution. Amplification was performed with initial denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 58&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 72&#x000b0;C for 90 sec, and a final 72&#x000b0;C extension for 2 min 30 sec. PCR products (15 ul) were processed in a 96-well format for Pyrosequencing analysis by use of a Vacuum Prep Workstation, following the standard manufacturer's protocol (Biotage AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Single-stranded DNA was prepared by capture of the biotinylated strands onto steptavidin-coated Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) with subsequent removal of non-biotinylated single strands. The bead-DNA complex was treated with ethanol, denaturation buffer, and wash buffer and released into a PyroMark Q96 plate containing a mixture of annealing buffer and 0.8 &#x003bc;M sequencing primer. The plate was incubated at 80&#x000b0;C on a heat block for 2 minutes, followed by a slow cool for an additional 5 minutes by turning off the heat block. The plate was transferred directly into a Biotage PSQ 96HSA System for sequence determination. Data were analyzed with PSQ HS 96 SNP software that automatically scores genotypes by using a novel SNP algorithm based on comparison of real-time sequence output (Pyrogram traces) with a theoretical histogram.</p><p>A two-phase approach was used to genotype the 90 Coriell PDR DNA samples prior to analysis by the Pyrosequencing assay. First, the conventional two-step PCR method was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The PCR I product from this method was also directly sequenced through use of the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A reverse sequencing primer (5'-AGACTCTGGTCCACACTGGTCAA-3') in intron 1 was designed to capture all sequence differences between <italic>CYP2A6*1 </italic>and <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>in exon 1.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>CYP2A6*12</italic> Allele Frequency Determination</title><p>The Pyrosequencing assay was used to assess multi-ethnic variation in frequency of the <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>allele by genotyping individuals from the African American, European Caucasian, Pacific Rim, and Hispanic population groups. For accurate assessment of allele frequency, it was important to look at <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>copy number, since the entire <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>gene can be deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The gene copy number was determined by use of a TaqMan assay, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This assay uses a FAM-labeled probe specific to <italic>CYP2A6 </italic>and a VIC-labeled probe specific to <italic>CYP2A7 </italic>that serves as an internal reference for 2 copies.</p></sec><sec><title>Automation of the Pyrosequencing Workflow</title><p>The Pyrosequencing assay was used to screen 7,159 individuals from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) as part of a larger study of genetic variation in xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes <italic>(manuscript in preparation)</italic>. To accommodate the large number of samples, robotics were integrated into the workflow. Increased genotyping throughput and accuracy of sample handling was accomplished by use of the Matrix Hydra DT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hudson, NH) to prepare 96-well plates of DNA. The DNA samples were allowed to dry and were stored at room temperature until needed. A Matrix WellMate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hudson, NH) was used for multiple dispensing steps throughout the process such as dispensing of PCR mastermix into PCR plates, dispensing of the bead mix for biotinylated PCR capture, and dispensing of the annealing buffer and sequencing primer mix into the PyroMark Q96 plate. In addition, the robotic arm of the PSQ 96HSA system was used for multiple plate testing.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Pyrosequencing assay genotype results were 100% concordant with those obtained by conventional two-step PCR and cycle sequencing for the 90 PDR and 14 CEPH family members. The PDR is a multi-ethnic collection of unrelated individuals designed to serve as a resource for polymorphism discovery. No phenotypic or ethnic information is linked to the individual samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It also provides a robust source of DNA material for assay optimization and validation. Genotyping results generated for the CEPH multi-generational family pedigree displayed Mendelian inheritance patterns. This satisfied the validation of our Pyrosequencing assay and provided us with samples to use as positive controls for future <italic>CYP2A6*12 </italic>genotyping.
