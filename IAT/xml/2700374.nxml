To investigate the role of PIDD in cell death initiation, we generated PIDD-deficient mice. Processing of caspase-2 is readily detected in the absence of PIDDosome formation in primary lymphocytes. Although caspase-2 processing is delayed in simian virus 40&#x02013;immortalized <italic>pidd<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts, it still depends on loss of mitochondrial integrity and effector caspase activation. Consistently, apoptosis occurs normally in all cell types analyzed, suggesting alternative biological roles for caspase-2 after DNA damage. Because loss of either PIDD or its adapter molecule RAIDD did not affect subcellular localization, nuclear translocation, or caspase-2 activation in high molecular weight complexes, we suggest that at least one alternative PIDDosome-independent mechanism of caspase-2 activation exists in mammals in response to DNA damage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>PIDD (p53-induced protein with a death domain [DD]) was identified as one of many transcriptional targets that may mediate apoptosis induction by the tumor suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lin et al., 2000</xref>). PIDD is widely expressed in various organs and cell types and is characterized by the presence of certain structural motives, including Leu-rich repeats, ZU5 domains, and a C-terminal DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tinel and Tschopp, 2004</xref>). DD-containing proteins play important roles in the formation of multimeric signaling complexes that regulate diverse cellular responses, including cytokine secretion, nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) activation, cell survival, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Reed et al., 2004</xref>). RAIDD (receptor-interacting protein-associated ICH-1/CED-3 homologous protein with a DD), a bipartite adapter molecule, was identified as a possible interaction partner of PIDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tinel and Tschopp, 2004</xref>). RAIDD contains a caspase recruitment domain as well as a C-terminal DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duan and Dixit, 1997</xref>). The caspase recruitment domain of RAIDD was previously described to interact with pro&#x02013;caspase-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duan and Dixit, 1997</xref>) and has been implicated in the activation of this ill-defined initiator caspase thought to be required for DNA damage&#x02013;induced apoptosis in certain tumor cells and the metabolic death of oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Degterev and Yuan, 2008</xref>). A trimolecular complex containing PIDD, RAIDD, and caspase-2 was subsequently identified as the long-sought-after activation platform of caspase-2 and dubbed the PIDDosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tinel and Tschopp, 2004</xref>). This complex appears to form spontaneously in cell extracts from different cell lines upon temperature shift in vitro, but formation in extracts from cells undergoing apoptosis after DNA damage has not been detected so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Read et al., 2002</xref>). A second, PIDD-containing multimeric protein complex was described shortly thereafter that contains the Ser-Thr kinase RIP-1 (receptor-interacting protein 1) and IKK-&#x003b3;/NF-&#x003ba;B essential modulator, the regulatory subunit of the I&#x003ba;B kinase complex, which were both implicated in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling after genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Janssens et al., 2005</xref>). Subsequent analysis revealed that PIDD possesses autoproteolytic activity, facilitating the generation of two different active protein fragments, termed PIDD-C and PIDD-CC. Although PIDD-CC was proposed to be required for activation of caspase-2 and cell death, PIDD-C was suggested to activate NF-&#x003ba;B, DNA repair, and survival after low grade DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tinel et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with a proapoptotic role for PIDD in p53-induced cell death, its overexpression facilitated caspase-2 activation and cell death induction in response to DNA damage in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tinel and Tschopp, 2004</xref>), and RNA interference or antisense oligonucleotides targeting PIDD mRNA delayed cell death induced by overexpression of p53 in H1299 colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baptiste-Okoh et al., 2008</xref>) or K562 myelogenous leukemia cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lin et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, a correlation between apoptotic index and PIDD expression was recently reported in oral squamous cell carcinoma patient samples, whereas no correlation was found regarding the p53 mutation status in these tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bradley et al., 2007</xref>). The latter finding is consistent with the observation that the basal expression of PIDD does not depend on the presence of functional p53, suggesting multiple modes of regulation of PIDD protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cuenin et al., 2008</xref>). Although all of these findings support a critical role for PIDD in cell death and caspase-2 activation, targeting RAIDD or PIDD expression by siRNA failed to interfere with caspase-2 processing in response to 5-fluoruracil treatment in HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, thymocytes and fibroblasts from mice lacking RAIDD were reported to respond normally to cell death induction by DNA-damaging agents or TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berube et al., 2005</xref>). However, cell death induced by overexpression of PIDD in fibroblasts strictly depended on the presence of RAIDD but not caspase-2, suggesting that PIDD can also engage cell death in a manner independent of this initiator caspase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berube et al., 2005</xref>). To investigate the relevance of PIDD for caspase-2 activation and cell death under physiological conditions, we have generated a PIDD-deficient mouse model by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of PIDD-deficient mice</title><p>Our targeting strategy aimed to replace exons 3&#x02013;15 of the PIDD locus, replacing all relevant protein domains with the open reading frame of &#x003b2;-galactosidase followed by a <italic>loxP</italic> element-flanked neomycin resistance cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Correct targeting of the <italic>pidd</italic> locus was confirmed by Southern blot analysis and exon-specific PCR on genomic DNA derived from embryonic stem cells and, subsequently, tail tissue, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and liver derived from wild-type, <italic>pidd</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup>, and <italic>pidd<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>; and not depicted). RT-PCR analysis was performed to confirm the absence of <italic>pidd</italic> mRNA in thymocytes and SV40-immortalized MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Finally, to ascertain lack of protein, a polyclonal antiserum was generated using the DD of PIDD (aa 770&#x02013;910) as immunogen. Reactivity of the affinity-purified IgG fraction was confirmed in MEFs that overexpress a Flag-tagged version of mouse PIDD (mPIDD). Three protein fragments corresponding to the full-length protein, processed PIDD-C, and PIDD-CC were detected by the anti-Flag antibody and the purified anti-PIDD IgG fraction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811105/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link> and not depicted). Transient cotransfection of 293T cells with an expression construct encoding mPIDD together with two different lentiviral vectors encoding alternative short hairpin RNAs targeting mPIDD confirmed specificity of the purified antiserum (Fig. S1 and not depicted). Western blot analysis performed on thymocyte extracts derived from wild-type and <italic>pidd<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice revealed that PIDD-CC appears to be the only detectable form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Efforts to identify endogenous full-length protein or PIDD-C by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation were repeatedly unsuccessful, suggesting that PIDD may be rapidly autoprocessed in thymocytes (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Targeting the <italic>pidd</italic> locus in mice.</bold> (A) Schematic representation of the <italic>pidd/lrdd</italic> gene locus on mouse chromosome 7 (chr 7).

Lymphocytes overexpressing antiapoptotic Bcl-2 in all hematopoietic cells and cells lacking p53 or its proapoptotic target gene <italic>puma<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, a BH3-only Bcl-2 family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Villunger et al., 2003</xref>), were included in some of our assays as internal controls. Thymocytes were put in culture without further treatment (spontaneous death) or exposed to DNA damage triggered by topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, the DNA-intercalating drug doxorubicin, or &#x003b3; or UV irradiation. In parallel, cells were also exposed to heat stress or were treated with the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine, the ER stressors tunicamycin, brefeldin A, or thapsigargin as well as cytochalasin D or taxol, both of which disrupted cytoskeletal structures, or to death receptor agonists Fas ligand or TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Cell viability was monitored over time using Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometric analysis. Loss of PIDD failed to protect thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), mature T and B cells, or granulocytes (not depicted) from any of the tested cell death stimuli. In contrast, overexpression of Bcl-2 or loss of <italic>p53</italic> or <italic>puma</italic> each efficiently protected thymocytes and mature T and B cells from DNA damage&#x02013;induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and not depicted), which is consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Villunger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erlacher et al., 2006</xref>). To test whether the proposed PIDD&#x02013;RAIDD&#x02013;caspase-2 apoptosis pathway could act in a redundant manner with the Bcl-2&#x02013;regulated one, we also assessed survival in thymocytes lacking PIDD and p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (Puma) simultaneously. However, the degree of protection from apoptosis induced upon DNA damage was comparable between <italic>puma<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>pidd<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>puma<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> double-deficient thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), arguing against such redundancy. To exclude the possibility that loss of PIDD may have an impact on the survival of lymphocytes in vivo, masked by the lack of coregulatory factors in our in vitro analysis, we also exposed wild-type and <italic>pidd<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice to graded doses of whole body irradiation (2.5 and 5.0 Gy) and evaluated lymphocyte cellularity as well as subset distribution of immature and mature T and B cells in thymus, bone marrow, and spleen 20 h after irradiation. Consistent with our findings in vitro, loss of PIDD did not enhance the survival of lymphocytes after irradiation in vivo (Fig. S2 A and not depicted).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1"

By using a monoclonal antibody (clone 11B4) that recognizes the large subunit of caspase-2, we were able to detect its pro-form (50 kD) as well as an &#x0223c;32-kD fragment that arises from intrasubunit cleavage between the p20 and the p10 subunit during autoprocessing, after prior removal of the caspase recruitment domain, or processing and the large subunit only (p20), which is generated by subsequent autoproteolysis or proteolysis of the pro-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">O'Reilly et al., 2002</xref>). Because the generation of these fragments can also be caused by caspase-3&#x02013;mediated cleavage of caspase-2, it has to be pointed out in this study that the appearance of processed caspase-2 fragments in Western blotting analysis does not necessarily reflect its true dimerization-induced activation.</p><p>In primary thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) and splenocytes (not depicted), cleaved caspase-2 was readily detectable after exposure of cells to etoposide treatment or &#x003b3; irradiation.

Our study clearly indicates that PIDD and caspase-2 are dispensable for apoptosis induction in response to DNA damage, growth factor deprivation, ER stress, disruption of cytoskeletal architecture, and pan-kinase inhibition as well as Fas ligand&#x02013; or TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced cell death in lymphocytes and SV40-transformed MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).

It is unclear at present whether apoptosis induced by overexpression of p53 is impaired in PIDD-deficient cells, as suggested by knockdown experiments in H1299 carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baptiste-Okoh et al., 2008</xref>), but stabilization of p53 by adding the Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a killed PIDD-deficient MEFs as effectively as wild-type cells while sparing <italic>p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> MEFs, arguing against a prominent role for PIDD in p53-induced apoptosis (unpublished data).</p><p>Caspase-2 processing occurred with comparable kinetics in wild-type, <italic>raidd<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, and <italic>pidd<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> thymocytes after DNA damage and was always observed concomitantly with the appearance of the activated form of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Similar observations have been made in HCT116 cells treated with PIDD- or RAIDD-specific siRNA, but the cleavage of caspase-2 observed in response to 5-fluoruracil treatment in these cells was attributed to incomplete knockdown of the PIDDosome components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2006</xref>). However, our observations reported in this study suggest that caspase-2 cleavage occurs secondary to MOMP and activation of the classical apoptosome during apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Consistently, all of these events were blocked by preserving mitochondrial integrity, either by overexpression of Bcl-2 or loss of Puma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Importantly, PIDD also does not act in a redundant manner with the Bcl-2&#x02013;regulated pathway of caspase-2 processing, as its cleavage, as well as cell death, is comparable in <italic>puma<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>pidd<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>puma<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Our data on caspase-2 processing are in line with the observation that its cleavage depends on the presence of Apaf-1 and caspase-9 in primary lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">O'Reilly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Marsden et al., 2004</xref>) and cannot be used as a readout for its activation during apoptosis induction and contradict reports where activation of caspase-2 was positioned upstream of MOMP and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release in response to DNA damage in tumor cell lines such as Jurkat or HeLa cells or when recombinant caspase-2 was added directly to isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Robertson et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2004</xref>). Primary MEFs lacking caspase-2 were also reported to resist cell death induced by disruption of the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ho et al., 2008</xref>), which we failed to observe in SV40-immortalized MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). All of these differences may be inherent to the cell types analyzed and/or the mode of immortalization/transformation, which can affect the apoptotic response of cells in a highly diverse manner. In line with the latter, we also observed that caspase-2 processing was delayed in <italic>pidd<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> SV40-immortalized MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). This phenomenon was observed in independent clones derived from individual mouse embryos (unpublished data). Nevertheless, MEFs of both genotypes were equally sensitive to apoptosis in response to all stimuli tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Similar observations have been previously reported using MEFs lacking RAIDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berube et al., 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, cleavage of caspase-2 upon DNA damage strictly depended on the presence of activated effector caspase-3 and/or -7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). All together, this suggests that the PIDDosome may contribute to caspase-2 processing after DNA damage in an effector caspase-dependent manner. Although counterintuitive at first sight, effector caspases appear to possess the potential to influence events considered to occur upstream of mitochondria such as the activation and translocation of Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lakhani et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we propose that modulation of caspase-2 activity via the PIDDosome does not contribute to apoptosis but may rather influence other events triggered by DNA damage such as NF-&#x003ba;B activation, cell cycle arrest, and/or DNA repair. Consistently, a role for PIDD and caspase-2 in G2/M checkpoint control and nonhomologous end joining of double-strand breaks was reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi et al., 2009</xref>). However, our experiments investigating the role of PIDD in NF-&#x003ba;B activation upon DNA damage are currently too preliminary to draw firm conclusions.</p><p>Finally, we also excluded that multimerization-induced activation of caspase-2 in high molecular weight complexes depends on the presence of the PIDDosome because gel filtration analysis revealed that such caspase-2&#x02013;containing complexes can also form in the absence of the PIDDosome upon temperature shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>) but contain the active form of the protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Read et al., 2002</xref>). It will be important to demonstrate that such a high molecular weight complex containing caspase-2 actually forms in whole cells in vivo upon apoptosis induction or may only be triggered in vitro upon temperature shift. Finally, subcellular localization of caspase-2 before and after exposure of cells to DNA damage was not affected by loss of PIDD or RAIDD, but, interestingly, caspase-2 accumulated in the nucleus of SV40-MEFs upon etoposide treatment before detectable signs of apoptosis and the activation of effector caspases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our findings suggest that at least one alternative PIDDosome-independent mechanism of caspase-2 activation exists in mammals. Furthermore, caspase-2 dimerization and activation may even occur in the absence of any activating platform, as observed upon overexpression in bacteria. A local and transient increase in protein concentration either alone or in combination with one of the many described posttranslational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krumschnabel et al., 2009</xref>) may suffice to promote its full activation. Finally, we postulate that caspase-2 activation by PIDD does not contribute to apoptosis induction but regulates events triggered in response to DNA damage such as cell cycle arrest or repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of <italic>pidd<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and other mouse strains used</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Austrian Tierversuchsgesetz (in accordance with Austrian legislation BGB1 Nr. 501/1988 i.d.F. 162/2005) and have been granted by the Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung, Wissenschaft und Kultur.
