Earlier studies have suggested that EPO improves several metabolic parameters when administered to chronically ill kidney patients. Thus we applied the EPO over-expression model to investigate the metabolic effect of EPO in vivo.</p><p>At 12 weeks, EPO expression resulted in a 23&#x00025; weight reduction (P&#x0003c;0.01) in EPO transfected obese mice; thus the mice weighed 21.9&#x000b1;0.8 g (control, normal diet,) 21.9&#x000b1;1.4 g (EPO, normal diet), 35.3&#x000b1;3.3 g (control, high-fat diet) and 28.8&#x000b1;2.6 g (EPO, high-fat diet). Correspondingly, DXA scanning revealed that this was due to a 28&#x00025; reduction in adipose tissue mass.</p><p>The decrease in adipose tissue mass was accompanied by a complete normalisation of fasting insulin levels and glucose tolerance in the high-fat fed mice. EPO expression also induced a 14&#x00025; increase in muscle volume and a 25&#x00025; increase in vascularisation of the EPO transfected muscle. Muscle force and stamina were not affected by EPO expression. PCR array analysis revealed that genes involved in lipid metabolism, thermogenesis and inflammation were increased in muscles in response to EPO expression, while genes involved in glucose metabolism were down-regulated. In addition, muscular fat oxidation was increased 1.8-fold in both the EPO transfected and contralateral muscles.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that EPO when expressed in supra-physiological levels has substantial metabolic effects including protection against diet-induced obesity and normalisation of glucose sensitivity associated with a shift to increased fat metabolism in the muscles.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Erythropoietin (EPO) was introduced for clinical use in 1989 in the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

This weight reduction is followed by a normalisation of several metabolic parameters including diet-induced glucose intolerance in the high-fat fed EPO transfected mice. The effects are reversible as increased weight gain and impairment of the metabolic parameters i.e. glucose tolerance are observed after withdrawal of the inducible EPO expression.</p><p>Our results show that the mechanism for EPO-induced protection against obesity is through increased fat oxidation as determined directly and by regulation of muscular gene expression, in particular inducing genes involved in lipid metabolism and glyconeogenesis and decreasing glucose metabolism in the high-fat fed mice. In support of this Davenport et al showed that 14 weeks of EPO administration in haemodialysis patients increased muscle glycogen content and lowered muscle fat content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005894-Davenport1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, while Cayla et al. showed that EPO induces a shift in muscle fibre composition from fast glycolytic fibres to slow oxidative fibres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005894-Cayla1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that EPO is indeed involved in shifting muscle metabolism towards increasing fat oxidation. Moreover, we also found that EPO induced an increased expression of genes involved in thermogenesis. This correlates well with the findings of Fagher et al., who showed that EPO increases heat production in muscles from haemodialysis patients as measured by direct calorimetry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005894-Fagher1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. We have in our current set-up not been able to measure energy expenditure in the EPO transfected mice. Yet the increases in genes involved in thermogenesis in our study suggest that in addition to the increased fat oxidation, increased heat production could play a role in the elevated energy expenditure in the EPO transfected mice.</p><p>In the present study, we have measured glucose and insulin tolerance after 12 weeks. At this point the EPO transfected mice had accumulated significantly less adipose tissue than the control mice. EPO expression induced a normalization of glucose tolerance in the high-fat fed mice, while no differences in the insulin sensitivities were observed between the control and EPO transfected mice. The normalization observed in glucose tolerance could most likely be an indication of reduced adipose deposits rather than a direct effect of EPO on glucose disposal rate. This is supported by the down-regulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism, showing that the main effect of EPO most likely to due to the increased overall fat oxidation. The finding that the glucose response to glucose tolerance test is much higher in the high-fat fed controls, also suggests that these have impaired insulin secretion, when challenged with glucose, and that EPO over-expression counteracts this impairment. Our study was not designed to unravel mechanisms underlying altered glucose metabolism. However, although speculative, one explanation could be that EPO influences gut hormones and their effect on insulin secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>EPO over-expression induced muscle hypertrophy and capillarisation</title><p>We also show that EPO expression induced muscle hypertrophy as measured by increased muscle weight, while no changes in the amount of protein per muscle weight were observed. The hypertrophic response was most pronounced in the transfected muscle, but we also observed a borderline increase in muscle mass in the contra lateral muscles.

Interestingly, a transgenic animal model of muscular Akt over-expression showed a similar phenotype as our EPO expressing mice with muscle fibre hypertrophy, resistance to diet-induced obesity and significant improvements in several metabolic variables including glucose tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005894-Izumiya1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

The high affinity binding site mediates binding to the homodimer EPO receptor and is responsible for the haematopoietic response, while the low affinity binding site mediates binding to the EPO receptor - common &#x003b2; receptor heterotrimer complex, a interaction, which has been proposed to be responsible for the pleiotropic effects of EPO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005894-Brines3">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. We have generated an EPO analogue with mutations in the high affinity binding site for the homodimer EPO receptor, which is responsible for the hematological response. Electrotransfer of this EPO analogue induced muscle hypertrophy and moderate reductions in body weight. However, the EPO analogue was not able to prevent accumulation of adipose tissue. It should be noted that our study used murine EPO, and thus further studies are warranted to fully understand the metabolic sites on both murine and human EPO.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>EPO secretion from the muscle</title><p>Recently the skeletal muscle was identified as an endocrine organ that produces and releases a number of biologically active substances, known as myokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005894-Pedersen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. These myokines participate in cell-to-cell and organ-to-organ cross-talk and may be involved in mediating the health beneficial effects of exercise and play important roles in the protection against diseases associated with low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005894-Pedersen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In our study EPO mimics a myokine in that it is produced and secreted from skeletal muscles and exhibits paracrine and endocrine effects on other muscles. So far no one has been able to show that EPO is secreted from muscles in response to exercise. Contrarily a swimming study showed that serum EPO actually decreased after a training bout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005894-Mounier1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus even though we have utilised the DNA electrotransfer method to over-express and secrete EPO from muscles it does not prove that EPO is indeed secreted natively from muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that over-expression of EPO protects against diet-induced obesity and this reduction in weight gain was associated with improvement of metabolic parameters in high-fat fed mice in particular increased fat oxidation in the muscles. In addition we found that EPO expression induced muscle hypertrophy and increased capillarisation. Although the strategies used in this study show that haematological and metabolic effects of EPO cannot be separated, they open a new avenue for the development of EPO versions to counteract metabolic syndrome without exacerbated and undesired hematocrit increase.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals and muscle preparation</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimentation and after permission from the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate. Animal experiments were performed on eight to ten weeks old female C57Black/C mice from Taconic (Tornbjerggaard, Denmark), while force measurements were performed on 4-week-old Wistar rats. The mice were maintained in a thermo-stated environment under a 12-hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and drinking water. The mice were fed either a standard maintenance diet (normal chow, 2844 kcal/kg, 4&#x00025; crude fat, Altromin pellets, Spezialfutter-Werke, Germany) or a high-fat diet containing 60 kcal&#x00025; fat (high fat, 5240 kcal/kg, 34.9&#x00025; crude fat, D12492, Research Diets, Bomholtgaard, Denmark). Food and water were weighed daily and consumption calculated. The animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and intact tibialis cranialis (TC) muscles were excised and quickly frozen on dry ice and absolute alcohol. The subcutaneous fat deposits were dissected by removing the encapsulated fat pad located in the right flank; while the abdominal fat deposits were isolated by insertion into the peritoneal cavity and dissecting out the fat pad associated with the uterus and ovaries. The adipose tissue was then isolated from the non-adipose structures. Moreover, the dorsal fat compartments around the kidneys were cleaned for adipose tissue. Together these compartments constitute the abdominal fat mass.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Plasmid constructs and in vivo DNA electrotransfer</title><p>The plasmids pTet-On, encoding the rtTA transactivator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005894-Gossen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005894-Kistner1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, and pTetS, encoding the tS silencer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005894-Lamartina1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, were both obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA, USA). pBI-mEPO encoding murine EPO under the control of an rtTA-dependent promoter was kindly provided by Dr. Fattori.
