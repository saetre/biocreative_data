Recent studies provide evidence that the parasite interferes with chromatin remodeling at the TNF-&#x003b1; promoter that is normally associated with LPS stimulation, but that is not required for TLR4 induction of IL-10. Here, we examined the effect of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> on IL-10 induced by simultaneous signaling through TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;R, a combined stimulus that triggers histone H3 covalent modification at the IL-10 promoter resulting in high level IL-10 cytokine production. We show that the parasite inhibits high level IL-10 production and prevents histone H3 Ser<sup>10</sup> phosphorylation and Lys<sup>9/14</sup> acetylation at the IL-10 promoter. These results provide compelling evidence that <italic>T. gondii</italic> targets the host cell chromatin remodeling machinery to down-regulate cytokine responses in infected macrophages.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The protozoan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an opportunistic apicomplexan parasite with worldwide distribution in humans and animals.

We found that transcription factors associated with the TNF-&#x003b1; promoter, such as NF&#x003ba;B, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and c-Jun, were activated and translocated into the nucleus normally during LPS stimulation of infected cells. Nevertheless, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we obtained evidence that these factors were unable to bind to their target sequences on the native TNF-&#x003b1; promoter after parasite infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Leng2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. TLR4 triggering of BMM&#x000d8; resulted in Ser<sup>10</sup> phosphorylation and Lys<sup>9/14</sup> acetylation on histone H3 at the TNF-&#x003b1; promoter, epigenetic changes associated with increased transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Berger1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection prevented these covalent modifications. When we examined the IL-10 promoter, we found that the relatively low level of cytokine produced during LPS stimulation occurred in the absence of histone H3 modification, providing a possible explanation for the lack of suppressive effect of the parasite on this particular cytokine.</p><p>Other studies have also indicated that LPS activation of macrophages induces only low amounts of IL-10 and no significant modification of histone H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Lucas1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Zhang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, combining Fc&#x003b3;R ligation with TLR4 stimulation triggers high level IL-10 production, and this is associated with ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent Ser<sup>10</sup> phosphorylation and Lys<sup>9/14</sup> acetylation of histone H3 on the IL-10 promoter. Based upon our findings at the TNF-&#x003b1; promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Leng2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, it was our prediction that high level IL-10 synthesis stimulated by LPS and immune complex (IC) would be suppressed by the parasite, even though low level LPS-induced IL-10 was not affected. Here, we tested this prediction. We found that, as with the TNF-&#x003b1; promoter during LPS stimulation, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> blocked histone H3 covalent modification at the IL-10 promoter during stimulation with LPS and IC. These combined data provide strong support for a new model in which <italic>T. gondii</italic> targets histone modification rather than the activity of specific transcription factors, and in this way the parasite silences multiple host genes using a common mechanism of suppression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Toxoplasma</italic> blocks high level IL-10 production stimulated by combined LPS and immune complex stimulation</title><p>We previously reported that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-infected BMM&#x000d8; were suppressed in their ability to produce TNF-&#x003b1; after LPS/TLR4 stimulation, but that low level IL-10 production was not affected by the parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Leng2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

The results of this study suggest that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> inhibits the superinduction response by interfering with the chromatin remodeling pathway. These data reinforce recent findings from our laboratory indicating that <italic>T. gondii</italic> has a similar inhibitory effect on LPS-initiated histone H3 modification at the TNF-&#x003b1; promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Leng2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In that case, we found that although transcription factors were activated normally during LPS stimulation, histone H3 phosphorylation and acetylation were blocked by <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Recent studies have found that histone H3 phosphorylation, but not acetylation, is the proximal event to IL-10 gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Zhang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Our finding that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> possesses inhibitory effects on total levels of histone H3 Ser<sup>10</sup> phosphorylation suggests that this may be the relevant target of suppression.</p><p>The IL-10 molecule is an anti-inflammatory mediator that is important in down-modulating proinflammatory responses to avoid pathology. Its relevance during <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection was shown in studies employing IL-10 gene deficient mice, because animals infected with this parasite succumb during acute infection in the absence of IL-10. Death is associated with a runaway proinflammatory cytokine response that, despite controlling the parasite, leads to lethal immunopathology during systemic and oral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Gazzinelli1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, IL-10 has an important role in limiting inflammation during toxoplasmic encephalitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Wilson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. From the perspective of the parasite, IL-10 production is important to keep the host alive to maximize chances of transmission. Nevertheless, the ability of IL-10 to down-modulate activation of innate immune effector cells such as macrophages suggests that overproduction of this cytokine must be avoided. In this case, uncontrolled parasite replication would rapidly lead to host death, minimizing the chances of transmission to a new host. We previously reported that low-level IL-10 induction triggered by TLR4 was not inhibited by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Here, we now demonstrate that macrophages triggered through TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;R produce much higher amounts of IL-10, and that <italic>T. gondii</italic> blocks this superinduction response to levels achieved by LPS stimulation alone. We hypothesize that inhibition of high but not low level IL-10 is a reflection of the parasite's need to ensure appropriate amounts of IL-10 that avoid immunopathology and permit cyst formation, favoring long-term persistence in the host.</p><p>In addition to TNF-&#x003b1; and high level IL-10, many other LPS-responsive cytokines and chemokines are down regulated by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection of macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Lee1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar effects occur in LPS-stimulated dendritic cells, where infection blocks upregulation of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules in addition to TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-McKee1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. It is also known that the parasite inhibits the ability of macrophages and fibroblasts to respond to IFN-&#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Luder1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Luder2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. For the case of fibroblasts, a large family of IFN-&#x003b3;-responsive genes is inhibited during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Kim2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability of the parasite to simultaneously down-regulate large subsets of genes during activation with stimuli such as LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; suggests that targeting chromatin remodeling may be the mechanism that mediates these profound effects.</p><p>The mechanism used by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> to interfere with host chromatin remodeling is presently unclear. The parasite is known to inject rhoptry kinases and phosphatases into the host cytoplasm during infection, and although these molecules relocate to the host cell nucleus, whether they are involved in the effects reported here is not presently known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Gilbert1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Saeij1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Saeij2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Taylor1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, it is possible that such molecules interfere with host histone kinases and acetylases. Alternatively, it is possible that parasite-derived effector molecules directly dephosphorylate and deacetylate histone H3.</p><p>The findings reported in the present manuscript in combination with other recent results from our laboratory together provide strong evidence for a new view of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> as an intracellular pathogen that targets chromatin modification rather than (or in addition to) targeting specific transcription factors. The finding that proinflammatory TNF-&#x003b1; and anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokines are both subject to the same type of regulation by <italic>T. gondii</italic> reinforces the concept that interference with inducible histone modification is a common strategy used by the parasite to influence host gene transcription. These combined studies are the first to demonstrate these effects during protozoan infection, but recent data suggest that some bacterial pathogens, such as <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> adopt similar strategies during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Arbibe1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Hamon1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Hamon2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007589-Wang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Parasite cultures were tested every 6&#x02013;8 wk using a PCR-based ELISA (Roche Diagnostics).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Bone marrow cells were flushed from femur and tibia of C57BL/6 mice and cultured in macrophage medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10&#x00025; BGS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 20&#x00025; supernatant from L929 cells, 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were supplemented with fresh macrophage medium on Day 3 after culture initiation. After 5 days of culture, nonadherent cells were removed, adherent monolayers were washed with PBS and cells were harvested by gentle pipeting with ice-cold PBS. Macrophage infection was accomplished by adding tachyzoites to cell cultures followed by brief centrifugation (200 x g, 3 min) to initiate contact between cells and parasites. Immune complex and LPS were added 18 hr after infection. Cells were recovered at varying times depending upon the assay performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Immune complex preparation</title><p>IgG-opsonized erythrocytes (E-IgG) were generated by incubating sheep red blood cells (SRBC, Lampire Biological Laboratories) with anti-SRBC IgG (MP Biomedicals) at nonagglutinating titers for 30 min at room temperature while rotating. Opsonized cells were washed once in Hank's Buffered Saline Solution (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and resuspended in macrophage medium. E-IgG were added to cells at a ratio of 10 E-IgG to 1 macrophage.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Semiquantitative real-time PCR</title><p>RNA was isolated from cells using a commercial kit (RNeasy Mini-kit; Qiagen) and cDNA synthesized according to standard protocols.

Cells (2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>/sample) were lysed in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and DNA was sheared by forcing samples 3 times through a 27-guage needle. After 3 min at 100&#x000b0;C, samples were separated by 10&#x00025; SDS-PAGE and proteins were subsequently electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.

After washing blots in TBST, Ab binding was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit Ab (Jackson Immunoresearch) in TBST containing 5&#x00025; nonfat dry milk.

Briefly, cells (1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>/sample) were fixed in 1&#x00025; paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Fixation was quenched by adding glycine to the mixture. The cells were then collected by scraping in buffer containing PMSF (100 mM). After brief centrifugation, the macrophages were resuspended in cell digestion buffer (Active Motif) and subjected to enzymatic digestion for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.5 M EDTA. Ab were added to the sheared chromatin preparations and the mixture was incubated with Protein G magnetic beads (Active Motif) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The precipitated DNA-protein-Ab complexes were then washed and the cross linking was reversed by incubation at 65&#x000b0;C for 4 hr. Proteinase K was added to digest protein and DNA was subsequently purified using ethanol extraction, air dried, and redissolved in 100 &#x000b5;l H<sub>2</sub>0. The retrieved DNA was then subjected to real-time RT-PCR using promoter-specific primers.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank B. A.
