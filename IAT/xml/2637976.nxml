Mutations in human NHEJ genes can lead to immunodeficiency due to its role in V(D)J recombination in the immune system. In addition, most patients carrying mutations in NHEJ genes display developmental anomalies which are likely the result of a general defect in repair of endogenously induced DSBs such as those arising during normal DNA replication. Cernunnos/XLF is a recently identified NHEJ gene which is mutated in immunodeficiency with microcephaly patients. Here we aimed to investigate whether Cernunnos/XLF mutations disrupt the ability of patient cells to respond to replication stress conditions. Our results demonstrate that Cernunnos/XLF mutated cells and cells downregulated for Cernunnos/XLF have increased sensitivity to conditions which perturb DNA replication. In addition, under replication stress, these cells exhibit impaired DSB repair and increased accumulation of cells in G2/M. Moreover Cernunnos/XLF mutated and down regulated cells display greater chromosomal instability, particularly at fragile sites, under replication stress conditions. These results provide evidence for the role of Cernunnos/XLF in repair of DSBs and maintenance of genomic stability under replication stress conditions. This is the first study of a NHEJ syndrome showing association with impaired cellular response to replication stress conditions. These findings may be related to the clinical features in these patients which are not due to the V(D)J recombination defect. Additionally, in light of the emerging important role of replication stress in the early stages of cancer development, our findings may provide a mechanism for the role of NHEJ in preventing tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) are one of the most hazardous forms of DNA damage to the integrity of the genome.

This is followed by processing of the DNA ends which involves Artemis and/or other DNA processing enzymes.

These results demonstrate that Cernunnos/XLF mutations disrupt not only V(D)J recombination but also the repair of IR- induced DSBs. Patients carrying Cernnunos/XLF mutations also display clinical features which are not related to the immune system such as growth retardation, microcephaly, various dysmorphic features and malformations. In addition these patients show chromosomal rearrangements, indicating difficulty in maintaining genomic stability. All these phenotypes might indicate a defect in repair of DSBs resulting from intrinsic sources such as DNA replication. However, the role of Cernnunos/XLF in the repair of replication&#x02013;induced DSBs has not been studied, nor the effect of Cernnunos/XLF mutations on the response to replication stress conditions.</p><p>Replication-induced DSBs are thought to be repaired primarily through the HR pathway which uses a homologous chromatid or chromosome for the repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Jackson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and therefore can readily repair DSBs during DNA replication as the two sister chromatids are localized in close proximity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Sonoda1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, the NHEJ repair pathway also takes part in the repair of replication-induced DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Saintigny1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Lundin1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, we recently determined that the DNA-PKcs and Ligase IV NHEJ factors are important for maintenance of common fragile site stability under replication stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Common fragile sites are the loci in the genome that are prone to DSB formation under conditions of replication stress and are involved in chromosomal rearrangements in tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Richards1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Arlt1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that since Cernunnos/XLF has a role in NHEJ which is not confined to V(D)J recombination, Cernunnos/XLF mutations can lead to sensitivity to replication stress and to increased fragile site instability</p><p>We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the cellular response to replication stress conditions of cells from patients with immunodeficiency and microcephaly, caused by nonsense or framshift mutations in the Cernnunos/XLF gene and in cells down regulated for cells downregulated for Cernunnos/XLF by siRNA. We demonstrate that the mutated and down regulated cells are sensitive to replication stress conditions. Under mild replication stress, the mutated as well as the downregulated Cernunnos/XLF cells exhibit impaired DSB repair. We further show that under replication stress conditions Cernnunos/XLF mutated cells display increased chromosomal instability at common fragile sites. This effect is most likely due to defective repair of replication-induced DSBs and not due to perturbed replication since we found that the replication rate in Cernunnos/XLF mutated cells is normal. These results provide evidence for the importance of Cernunnos/XLF in DSB repair, maintenance of genomic stability and survival under replication stress conditions. Hence, we conclude that Cernunnos/XLF mutations in immunodeficiency patients disrupt the ability of cells to respond appropriately to replication stress conditions and therefore may jeopardize the cells when they are hyperproliferating during embryonic development or in early stages of tumor development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cernunnos/XLF deficiency causes increased sensitivity to replication stress</title><p>In order to test our hypothesis that Cernunnos/XLF mutations disrupt the cellular response to replication stress we used a cell line derived from a patient carrying a homozygous nonsense mutation in the Cernunnos/XLF gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Buck1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, which leads to complete absence of the full length Cernunnos/XLF protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004516-g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

After 2 and 4 hours of recovery in Cernunnos/XLF complemented cells &#x003b3;H2AX levels were significantly reduced (p&#x0003c;0.05) while in the Cernunnos/XLF mutated cells &#x003b3;H2AX level was still high, indicating an impaired repair of replication- induced DSBs in the absence of Cernunnos/XLF.

Aphidicolin can cause a change in cell cycle progression either directly through the inhibition of DNA polymerases or indirectly through activation of checkpoints in response to induced DNA damage. The direct effect could cause lengthening of S-phase in low concentrations, or arrest of cells along S-phase in high concentrations. The indirect effect would lead to accumulation of cells in S or G2/M due to activation of checkpoints. The cell cycle distribution of Cernunnos/XLF mutated and complemented cell lines was very similar in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004516-g003">Fig 3A, B</xref>) despite complete lack of NHEJ in the mutated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Buck1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

We found that cells harboring a nonsense mutation in the Cernunnos/XLF gene from human patients with immunodeficiency with microcephaly, exhibit decreased survival following aphidicolin treatment, indicating increased sensitivity to replication stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004516-g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Since Cernunnos/XLF is a NHEJ factor, we speculated that the increased cell death seen under replication stress conditions is probably due to a defect in repair of replication-induced DSBs. Indeed our results show that Cernunnos/XLF mutated cells exhibit impaired DSB repair process and increased accumulation of cells in G2/M following aphidicolin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004516-g003">Fig 3</xref>). Moreover, Cernunnos/XLF mutated cells display increased chromosomal instability at common fragile sites following mild replication stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004516-g005">Fig 5</xref>). This effect of Cernunnos/XLF mutation on the stability of fragile sites was not the result of perturbed replication progression as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004516-g006">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>Several patients have been described in the literature harboring mutations in the NHEJ factors Ligase IV, Artemis or Cernunnos/XLF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Buck1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Moshous1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Riballo2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. In the majority of the patients, mutations in any of these genes leads to immunodeficiency, indicating the immediate effect of mutations in NHEJ on V(D)J recombination. In many of the cases, including those harboring mutations in Cernunnos/XLF, patients are born with developmental anomalies, such as microcephaly and growth retardation, and show chromosomal instability. These phenotypes are probably not related to the V(D)J recombination defect in the immune system, but rather likely result from a general inability to repair spontaneous DSBs occurring during embryonic development throughout the body. One major source of spontaneous DSBs is the DNA replication process. Indeed cells carrying mutations in DNA-PK were shown to be deficient in repair of replication-induced DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Shimura1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results provide the first evidence that a disease caused by mutations in NHEJ genes is associated with defective response to conditions which perturb DNA replication. The developmental anomalies seen in patients carrying mutations in NHEJ genes may result from inappropriate DSB repair and increased chromosomal instability at times of replicative stress which may occur when cells are hyperproliferating during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Becker1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Studies in humans and mice raised the possibility that decreased NHEJ activity plays a role in carcinogenesis.

In addition, genotypic polymorphisms in NHEJ genes (XRCC4, Ligase IV and Ku 70) have been associated with increased risk to develop breast cancer or glioma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Liu1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Bau1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Since Cernunnos/XLF was only recently identified, its association with cancer risk, in humans or mice, was not yet studied. Moreover, cancer has not been reported in patients carrying Cernunnos/XLF mutations but only few patients were as of yet reported, of whom several already died from fatal infections and the others are still young.</p><p>Recent studies demonstrated that the immediate event following oncogene overexpression is hyperproliferation, associated with replication perturbation and formation of replication-induced DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-DiMicco1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Bartkova1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore damage response factors, involved in the cellular response to replication-induced DSBs, are likely to act as caretakers of the genome during tumor development. Here we show that cells from patients carrying mutations in the NHEJ gene Cernunnos/XLF exhibit sensitivity to replication stress and impaired repair of replication-induced DSBs. In light of the crucial role of replication stress at the early stages of cancer development, our results suggest that the impaired response to replication stress could be the mechanism by which defective NHEJ contributes to human carcinogenesis. Furthermore, our results imply that Cernunnos/XLF acts as a caretaker of genome stability and can be a potential factor in the prevention of tumorigenesis.</p><p>The results from our fragile site analysis indicate that Cernunnos/XLF is crucial for the maintenance of fragile site stability under conditions which perturb DNA replication but not under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004516-g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This is in agreement with our previous results showing that down-regulation of DNA-PKcs or Ligase IV by RNAi increased fragile site instability only under replication stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. It is interesting to note that under normal growth conditions Cernunnos/XLF mutated cells exhibit higher H2AX phosphorylation level compared to the complemented cells, indicating unrepaired spontaneous DSBs in Cernunnos/XLF mutated cells. Nevertheless, these DSBs are probably repaired eventually, perhaps due to increased activity of other repair pathways or prolonged arrest in cell cycle checkpoints allowing maintenance of fragile site stability. Importantly, Rad51, a component of HR, has a role in maintaining fragile site stability under both replication stress and normal growth conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. These results can suggest that the defect in repair of replication-induced DSBs caused by NHEJ deficiency could be compensated by HR, but not vice versa. Indeed, DNA-PKcs deficiency was shown to result in increased repair of DSBs by HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Allen1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Another possibility is that HR has a role during normal progression of DNA replication while NHEJ is important only when DNA replication is perturbed. In support of the latter, a recent study shows that defects in several HR factors (Rad51, BRCA2 or XRCC2) affect replication fork progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Daboussi1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, while we found that Cernunnos/XLF deficiency has no effect on DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004516-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Our results suggest that the negative effect of Cernunnos/XLF mutations on genome stability in immunodeficiency and microcephaly patients would probably be prominent in hyperproliferating cells when DNA replication could be occasionally perturbed.</p><p>In summary, the results presented in this study demonstrate that cells from patients carrying mutations in the Cernunnos/XLF NHEJ gene have impaired ability to respond to replication stress. This might explain the developmental anomalies which are not related to V(D)J recombination in patients carrying mutations in NHEJ genes. Moreover, our data suggest that the impaired response to replication stress could be the mechanism by which defective NHEJ contributes to human carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells, growth conditions and treatment</title><p>Cernunnos/XLF mutated cells are SV40T-transformed, telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts from patient P2 as published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004516-Buck1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.
