The CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR exhibited cross resistance to cisplatin and methotrexate but not to doxorubicin. Human Affymetrix Gene Chip arrays were used to examine relative gene expression in these cell lines. We found that a large number of genes have altered expression levels in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR when compared to the parental cell line. 595 CS-1/ER and 498 CS-1/PR genes were identified as overexpressing; 856 CS-1/ER and 874 CS-1/PR transcripts were identified as underexpressing. Three zinc finger protein (ZNF) genes were on the top 10 overexpressed genes list. These genes have not been previously associated with drug resistance in tumor cells. Differential expressions of ZNF93 and ZNF43 genes were confirmed in both CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR resistant cell lines by real-time RT-PCR. ZNF93 was overexpressed in two ET-743 resistant Ewing sarcoma cell lines as well as in a cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cell line, but was not overexpressed in paclitaxel resistant cell lines. ZNF93 knockdown by siRNA in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR caused increased sensitivity for ET-743, PM00104, and cisplatin. Furthermore, ZNF93 transfected CS-1 cells are relatively resistant to ET-743, PM00104 and cisplatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This study suggests that zinc finger proteins, and ZNF93 in particular, are involved in resistance to ET-743 and PM00104.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>ET-743 (Yondelis&#x000ae;; Trabectedin) is marine alkaloid derivative isolated from the Caribbean sea squirt <italic>Ecteinascidia turbinate</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Rinehart1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Amador1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

ET-743 is composed of three tetrahydroisoquinoline subunits containing a central carbinolamine moiety enabling it to covalently bind to DNA. ET-743 binds to the minor groove of the DNA helix with sequence-specific binding preference for GC-rich triplets and subsequently forms covalent adducts with the N2-position of guanine. As a result, the minor groove is exposed and turned toward the major groove. When such binding occurs, DNA strands become cross-linked and cannot be replicated, resulting in cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Herrero1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Soares1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The direction of DNA turning is a novel feature among DNA minor groove-interactive agents, thus making ET-743 unique.</p><p>PM00104 (Zalypsis&#x000ae;), derived from mollusks, is a novel chemical entity related to Jorumycin, a marine natural compound belonging to the family of <italic>Renieramycins</italic>, obtained from sponges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Yin1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Faircloth1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. PM00104 has <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumor activity towards a wide variety of solid and hematological tumors. As with ET-743, PM00104 also binds to DNA and is cytotoxic; however, unlike ET-743, PM00104 does not activate the &#x0201c;DNA damage checkpoint&#x0201d; response. Thus, the cytotoxic effects of PM00104, although dependent on DNA binding, are not triggered by DNA damage response mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Faircloth1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As with other chemotherapeutic drugs, ET-743 and PM00104 exposure over sustained periods of treatment will result in the development of drug resistance, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Different studies have reported conflicting descriptions of the relationship between ABCB1 expression and ET-743 resistance in human cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Kanzaki1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Duan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Sensitivity could be restored by the addition of the Pgp1 inhibitor PSC-833, suggesting that ET-743 may be a Pgp1 substrate. Another study however, observed that two Pgp over-expressing human epidermoid cancer cell lines (KB-8-5 and KB-C-2) were not resistant to ET-743 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Kanzaki1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, sub-lethal concentrations of ET-743 could reverse resistance to doxorubicin and vincristine in these cell lines. There are no reports describing the mechanism of PM00104 resistance in tumor cells.</p><p>Chondrosarcomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors of mesenchymal origin that develop in bone or cartilage and display chondrocytic characteristics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Riedel1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These tumors respond poorly to conventional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, and prognosis is related to tumor grade and differentiation status. The sensitivity of sarcoma cells to ET-743 and PM00104 has led us and others to consider these compounds as interesting candidates for future treatment of chondrosarcoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Marchini1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Shao1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Morioka1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as with other chemotherapeutic agents, the propensity of tumor cells to develop resistance to ET-743 or PM00104 poses a significant challenge for using this drug over an extended period of time. The goal of this study is to explore the mechanisms of ET-743 or PM00104 resistance in chondrosarcoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Chemotherapy drugs</title><p>ET-743 (Yondelis&#x000ae;; Trabectedin) and PM00104 (Zalypsis&#x000ae;) were supplied by PharmaMar (Spain).

If the CS-1 cells demonstrated cytotoxicities after exposure to a given concentration of ET-743 or PM00104, they were washed and cultured in drug-free medium for 7 days.

When the viable cells had recovered, they were seeded in medium containing the most recently exposed concentration of drug again for 3 days. After repeated several cycles and when the cells grew up to 70% confluence in the culture medium containing drugs, the concentration of drugs will increased to the next level. After one year, the ET-743 resistant cell line CS-1/ER and PM00104 resistant cell line CS-1/PR were established as determined by MTT assay. These cells represent populations of drug resistant cells rather than a selected cloned population.

The IC<sub>50</sub>-value of ET-743 in CS-1 cells was 0. 0008 &#x000b5;M as compared to 0. 01 &#x000b5;M in CS-1/ER cells (12.5-fold resistance).

The expression profiles of these three chondrosarcoma cell lines were evaluated by Genesifter. In addition, we have submitted our microarray data to <bold>G</bold>ene <bold>E</bold>xpression <bold>O</bold>mnibus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>) and these array data have been assigned a GEO accession number as GSE16748. We found a large number of genes had significantly different levels of expression in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR as compared to CS-1. To focus on genes with only significant changes in expression levels, we identified genes with a ten-fold or greater change in expression levels. Using this criteria, 595 (CS-1/ER), 498 (CS-1/PR) genes exhibited more than ten-fold overexpression in the ET-743 and PM00104 resistant lines relative to their expression in the sensitive parental lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006967-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, 856 (CS-1/ER), 874 (CS-1/PR) transcripts were more than ten-fold decreased in the resistant cell lines as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006967-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Changes in expression levels ranged from 10- to 536- fold. The genes identified were largely non-overlapping between cell lines and encoded for proteins with a wide variety of biochemical functions. The genes identified encode for proteins that bind DNA have catalytic activities, molecular transducer activities, regulate transcription, transport proteins and molecules, regulate enzymes and there are many other genes that have limited characterization. The top 20 most highly overexpressed and underexpressed genes in each of the resistant cell lines are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006967-t001">Table 1</xref>. There were seven genes overexpressed in both CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR and one gene that underexpressed in both cell lines. In these two resistant cell lines, there are more over-lapping gene in the top 20 over expressed genes list as compared to the under expressed genes list. We also noticed the degree of change in gene expression was more dramatic in the set of under expressed genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006967-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig

These results suggest that the ZNF93 protein may be critically involved in the development of resistance to these drugs.

Patients with advanced ovarian and breast cancer as well as bone or soft tissue sarcomas typically undergo several lines of anti-cancer regimens before ultimately succumbing to their disease. Multidrug resistance is thought to play an important role in the inevitable failure of tumors to respond to each successive line of chemotherapy. Therefore, understanding the patterns and mechanisms of cross-resistance and finding ways to overcome it is an important goal. Several studies have studied the mechanisms of ET-743 drug resistance with different approaches. However, contradictory results have been published from various groups attempting to correlate resistance to different expression levels of RNAs and proteins in resistant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Kanzaki1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Duan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Marchini1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Shao1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Manara1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Further resolution of the differences among these results might be best facilitated by genome-wide transcriptional array analysis.</p><p>In this study, we report successful establishment of two chondrosarcoma cell lines resistant to ET-743 or PM00104. We then asked how the gene expression levels related to differences in drug resistance in these two cell lines. We used Affymetrix Gene Chip U133 Plus 2 to examine genome-wide expression of RNA transcripts. As compared with several studies using smaller scale gene array, this array completely covers the entire human genome with over 47,000 transcripts. We validated the gene array results for the genes with the most significant changes with real-time RT-PCR. As expected, there are a large number of transcriptional changes associated with <italic>in vitro</italic> acquired resistance to ET-743 and PM00104. Indeed, about 5% to 10% (with cut off value of 2 fold) of transcripts are over-expressed or under-expressed in the resistant cell lines CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR as compared to the sensitive parental cell line.</p><p>In the list of top 20 over expressing genes for both CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR, the same three zinc finger protein genes, ZNF93, ZNF43 and ZNF568 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006967-t002">Table 2</xref>) were all identified. These genes have not been previously associated with drug resistance. Real-time PCR confirmed ZNF93 and ZNF43 are consistently over expressed in these resistant cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006967-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Preliminary evaluation of ZNF93 confirms that its expression is associated with the multidrug-resistant phenotype in additional cell lines. ZNF93 gene expression was also shown to be increased in ET-743 resistant Ewing's sarcoma cell line (TC-ET) and in the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line (A2780cp) but not in the paclitaxel resistant cell lines (SKOV-3<sub>TR</sub>) nor in the paclitaxel resistant breast cancer cell line (MCF-7<sub>TR</sub>), suggesting a fundamentally different mechanism for paclitaxel resistance from ET-743 or PM00104 resistance.</p><p>Functional analysis of ZNF93 provides some insight into the epigenetics of ET-743 and PM00104 resistance and might be of use in revealing targets for overcoming drug resistance. Inhibition of ZNF93 using siRNA could partially reverse PM00104, ET-743 and cisplatin resistance in CS-1/PR and A2780cp cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006967-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Importantly, overexpression of the ZNF93 protein in a PM00104 and ET-743 sensitive chondrosarcoma cell line CS-1 led to a modest level of PM00104, ET-743 and cisplatin resistance implying an important role for ZNF93 in the development of the drug-resistant phenotype. Other zinc finger proteins such as ZNF143 have been shown to be associated with cisplatin resistance, and ZNF143 depletion using siRNA confers cell sensitivity to cisplatin, but not to oxaliplatin, etoposide and vincristine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Wakasugi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Torigoe1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. ZNF143 has been found associated with tumor suppressor gene p73 but not with p53 expression. Interestingly, p73 could stimulate the binding of ZNF143 to cisplatin-modified DNA. Both Rad51 and flap endonuclease-1 are overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells and are target genes of ZNF143<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Wakasugi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Torigoe1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Ishiguchi1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. These results suggest ZNF93, ZNF143 as well as other zinc finger proteins may be involved uniquely in DNA repair pathway following DNA damage by ET-743, PM00104, and cisplatin. Future studies on identification of potential ZNF93 target genes for DNA repair pathways are needed to fully understand the molecular mechanism of ZNF93 overexpressin in multidrug resistant cells. Despite its potential role in the transcriptional regulation and DNA repair, ZNF93 may have a potential as an novel target for anticancer therapeutic development. There were reports that defects in the DNA mismatch repair pathway, usually associated with increased resistance to methylating agents and cisplatin, did not affect the cytotoxic activity of ET-743. However, ET-743 did show decreased activity (from 2- to 8-fold) in nucleotide excision repair (NER)-deficient cell lines compared to NER-proficient cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Damia1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006967-Lin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is obvious that cell lines are not fully representative of tumors from patients, but they do have the advantages of reproducibility, availability, and homogeneity in cell lineage. Further studies on tumor samples to correlate the levels of zinc finger protein such as ZNF93 and DNA repair genes with clinical data will further clarify the biochemical roles of these proteins and their potential as therapeutic targets. The observations described here on gene expression in ET-743 and PM00104 resistant chondrosarcoma cell lines may provide the basis for such future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge Dr. Carlos Galmarini and Dr. Carmen Cuevas, at PharmaMar USA, Inc. for providing useful advice during the drafting of this manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0006967-Rinehart1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rinehart</surname><given-names>KL</given-names></name></person-group><year>2000</year><article-title>Antitumor compounds from tunicates.</article-title><source>Med Res Rev</source><volume>20</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>27</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10608919</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0006967-Amador1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amador</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Jimeno</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Paz-Ares</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Cortes-Funes</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Hidalgo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year>2003</year><article-title>Progress in the development and acquisition of anticancer agents from marine sources.</article-title><source>Ann Oncol</source><volume>14</volume><fpage>1607</fpage><lpage>1615</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14581267</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0006967-Valoti1"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Valoti</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicoletti</surname><given-names>MI</given-names></name><name><surname>Pellegrino</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Jimeno</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Hendriks</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>1998</year><article-title>Ecteinascidin-743, a new marine natural product with potent antitumor activity on human ovarian carcinoma xenografts.</article-title><source>Clin Cancer Res</source><volume>4</volume><fpage>1977</fpage><lpage>1983</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9717828</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0006967-Cuevas1"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cuevas</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Francesch</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><year>2009</year><article-title>Development of Yondelis((R)) (trabectedin, ET-743).
