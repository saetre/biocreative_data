Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells are responsible for myelinating the central and the peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS), respectively. Quakingviable (qk<sup>v</sup>) is a well-known spontaneous mutation in mice that causes remarkable hypomyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c3">3</xref>). The CNS of homozygous qk<sup>v</sup> mice is severely hypomyelinated whereas the PNS is only mildly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c4">4</xref>). The homozygous qk<sup>v</sup> mice develop vigorous tremors from postnatal day 10 (P10). In contrast, the heterozygous littermates are non-phenotypic. The qk<sup>v</sup> hypomyelination is not due to reduced myelin-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c5">5</xref>), but more likely due to deficits in cell development and myelin production. The genetic lesion is mapped 5&#x02032; to the qkI gene on chromosome 17, which encodes a selective RNA-binding protein QKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c6">6</xref>). Several QKI protein isoforms are derived from the qkI primary transcript via extensive alternative splicing of the C-terminal coding exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c7">7</xref>). The major QKI isoforms include QKI-5, QKI-6 and QKI-7; each harbors a single hnRNP K-homology (KH) RNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c6">6</xref>). In the normal adult brain, QKI proteins are expressed in several types of glia but are absent in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c8">8</xref>). In the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice, immunostaining of QKI is diminished specifically in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c8">8</xref>). Thus, the role of QKI has been implicated in controlling mRNA homeostasis during myelinogenesis, and the deficiency of QKI results in misregulation of its RNA targets, which in turn leads to hypomyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c9">9</xref>). Indeed, QKI interacts with several mRNAs encoding major structural myelin proteins, and QKI deficiency is associated with post-transcriptional abnormalities at the levels of stability, localization and splicing of QKI-binding mRNAs in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c12">12</xref>). These abnormalities suggest that QKI isoforms may play distinct roles at various steps of post-transcriptinal regulation.</p><p>Among the QKI isoforms, QKI-5 is expressed in many cell types during embryonic and neonatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c8">8</xref>), shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c13">13</xref>). QKI-6 and QKI-7 are predominantly cytoplasmic, expressed at high levels in the brain during active myelinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c8">8</xref>). In the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain, QKI-6 and QKI-7 are undetectable in all oligodendrocytes, whereas the level of QKI-5 reduction geographically correlates with the severity of hypomyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c8">8</xref>). How the qk<sup>v</sup> deletion leads to such a phenomenon remains unknown. In fact, the expression of qkI mRNA isoforms has not been adequately characterized in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice.</p><p>We have quantitatively analyzed the qkI mRNA isoforms and the QKI protein isoforms in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice and the wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> non-phenotypic littermates. We found that all major qkI mRNA isoforms were significantly reduced in the developing brain, in the optic nerve and in the sciatic nerve of the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice during the period of active myelinogenesis without detectable post-transcriptional deficits. Quantitative analysis further suggested that the reduction of qkI mRNA isoforms was responsible for the reduction of the corresponding QKI protein isoforms. In contrast, a normal level of qkI expression was observed in tissues outside of the nervous system and in the non-myelinating astroglia derived from the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice. These results support the hypothesis that qk<sup>v</sup> may affect an enhancer required for elevated qkI transcription in myelin-producing cells during the period of active myelin production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals and RNA preparation</title><p>Animals were treated according to NIH regulations under the approval of the Emory University IACUC. The qk<sup>v</sup> colony and the jp<sup>msd</sup> colony (generously provided by Dr S.

Various brain regions and nerves were dissected at ages indicated in the corresponding figure for total RNA extraction using Trizol&#x02122; according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (Invitrogen). The quantity of RNA from each sample was determined by OD260 reading and further confirmed by ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary astrocyte cultures were derived from individual brain stems of qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> and the wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> non-phenotypic littermates at P2 following the well-established procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c15">15</xref>). After 1 week in culture, the confluent glial cultures were shaken overnight at 300 r.p.m. in an incubator shaker (innova 4300, New Brunswick) at 37&#x000b0;C to remove oligodendrocytes. The astrocytes that remained attached were cultured for an additional day in fresh media before being subjected to RNA isolation. The genotype of each culture was determined by PCR of genomic DNA isolated from the cerebrum of each animal using the following primers: (i) gf1, the common 5&#x02032; primer detecting both wild-type and qk<sup>v</sup> allele: GGACTTCATTGCTGCAATTCGG; (ii) gr1, the common 3&#x02032; primer detecting both alleles: CGTTAATCCTCACCGCAGGTTC; (iii) df1, the 5&#x02032; primer detecting only the wild-type allele: GAACTACTATAGCCATTGTTGG. PCR was performed in the standard reaction buffer (Invitrogen) plus 4&#x00025; DMSO for 35 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 20 s, 62&#x000b0;C for 30 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min followed by ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot analysis and antibodies</title><p>Whole tissue lysate was prepared by sonication in 1&#x000d7; Laemmli buffer.

The cDNA fragment derived from RT&#x02013;PCR was cloned into the TA-Cloning Vector (Invitrogen).

Antisense riboprobes were generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription in the presence of T7 polymerase (Stratagene) and <sup>32</sup>P-UTP (Amersham) using linearized plasmids as DNA templates. The glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) RPA probe was generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c10">10</xref>).

QKI-5 is encoded by qk-5kb-A, QKI-6 is encoded by qk-6kb and qk-5kb-B, whereas QKI-7 is encoded by qk-7kb-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c7">7</xref>). These isoforms migrated on SDS&#x02013;PAGE as a tight triplet (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f1">1</xref>B, left). All three isoforms can be immunoprecipitated by our polyclonal antibody against recombinant QKI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f1">1</xref>B). In contrast, the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), another KH domain-containing RNA-binding protein, was not recognized by the anti-QKI antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f1">1</xref>B, right). Using this antibody, we analyzed the nuclear and the cytoplasmic extracts derived from the C6 glioma cell line by SDS&#x02013;PAGE immunoblot. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f1">1</xref>C, a major nuclear isoform of QKI was detected at the predicted position for QKI-5, which was diminished in the cytoplasmic fraction. Two major QKI isoforms were predominantly detected in the cytoplasmic extracts that correspond to QKI-6 and QKI-7.</p><p>We then examined QKI protein expression in the whole tissue lysate prepared from the P10 brain stem of a qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mouse as well as that of the wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> non-phenotypic littermate. All three major QKI isoforms were detected, among which QKI-6 was most abundant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f1">1</xref>D). QKI-7 and QKI-5 migrated closely on SDS&#x02013;PAGE and were difficult to separate in lysates derived from animals older than P20. All three QKI isoforms were reduced in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain stem. Noticeably, the reduction of QKI-5 was relatively less severe in comparison with that of QKI-6 and QKI-7.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that QKI deficiency results in destabilization, mislocalization and abnormal splicing of the mRNA encoding the MBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c12">12</xref>), suggesting that MBP mRNA is a candidate target for QKI during myelin development. To examine whether all QKI isoforms can bind the MBP mRNA, we employed an <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA-binding assay that has been used to evaluate selective activity of a variety of RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c19">19</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f2">2</xref>, all three QKI isoforms bind MBP mRNA in a MBP 3&#x02032;UTR-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f2">2</xref>). This result suggests that despite the differential subcellullar localization and developmental expression, all QKI isoforms may contribute to modulate the cellular fate of MBP mRNA, perhaps at different steps of post-transcriptional regulation and&#x0002f;or at different stages during myelin development.</p></sec><sec><title>qkI mRNA isoforms are reduced in both the CNS and the PNS, which is responsible for the diminished expression of QKI proteins</title><p>To determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for the reduction of QKI proteins in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain, we developed an RPA which allowed us to evaluate the quantitative level of each qkI mRNA isoform encoding the major QKI protein isoforms. RT&#x02013;PCR was carried out using primers corresponding to the C-terminal coding region of QKI-5, QKI-6 and QKI-7, respectively, as illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f3">3</xref>A. Full-length antisense riboprobes were synthesized by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription using cloned RT&#x02013;PCR fragments as templates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f3">3</xref>A, right) and subjected to RPA. Each probe is expected to protect the full-length fragment of the corresponding isoform. The predicted sizes of the full-length RPA fragment specific for qkI-5, qkI-6 and qkI-7 are 365, 302 and 323 nt, respectively. Each probe is also expected to protect a 275 nt common fragment derived from the rest of the qkI isoforms. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f3">3</xref>B, the predicted RPA products for all qkI isoforms (marked by arrowheads) were detected in the wild-type mouse brain. Furthermore, low levels of additional RPA products were detected for qkI-5 and qkI-7 (marked by arrows), suggesting the existence of unidentified minor alternative splicing sites for these isoforms. No protected probe fragment was detected in the absence of input mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f3">3</xref>B) or in the presence of yeast tRNA (data not shown).</p><p>Using the RPA, we analyzed qkI mRNA isoforms in various regions of the nervous system of qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> and wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> littermates during myelin development. Our previous studies show that QKI is most abundant during active myelination and rapidly declines thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c18">18</xref>). Therefore, the active period of myelinogenesis may be the most critical developmental window for the functional requirement of QKI. We first examined qkI mRNA expression in the brain stem, in which reduction of the QKI-5 protein isoform was less severe at the early stage of myelination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f1">1</xref>D). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>A, all qkI mRNA isoforms were reduced in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain stem at P14, P18 and P20. However, in either wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> or qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice, the quantity of each qkI mRNA isoform, when normalized to the house-keeping GAPDH mRNA, did not show obvious temporal changes during this developmental window for active myelin sheath production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>A, bottom). Phosphorimager quantification of several RPAs indicated that the reduction of qkI-5 mRNA in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain was less severe (37&#x00025; reduction) than that of qkI-7 (59&#x00025; reduction) at P14 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>B). However, by the age of P20, the reductions of all qkI mRNA isoforms, including qkI-5, were not significantly different from each other (53, 57 and 54&#x00025; reduction for qkI-5, qkI-6 and qkI-7, respectively). This result suggests that the less severe reduction of qkI-5 at P14 was a transient phenomenon in the young qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mutant. A similar level of reduction of qkI mRNAs was also detected in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> cerebrum (data not shown). Since nuclear retention of specific mRNA has been found in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c12">12</xref>), we examined qkI mRNA levels in the nuclei isolated from the brain stem of qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> and wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> littermates. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>C, a comparable level of reduction of qkI mRNAs was observed in the nuclei and in the whole tissue derived from the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>C). This result discounted the possibility that diminished QKI protein in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain was due to nuclear retention of the qkI mRNA. We also examined qkI mRNAs in the optic nerve and sciatic nerve derived from qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice and wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>D). Interestingly, qkI transcripts were markedly reduced in both nerves. Reduced qkI expression was observed in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> sciatic nerve at P16 and P20. Interestingly, the reduction of qkI mRNA in the sciatic nerve was even more severe than that in the brain, despite the fact that hypomyelination is much less profound in PNS than in the CNS of the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>qkI mRNA isoforms are reduced specifically in myelin-producing cells in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mutant</title><p>To determine whether qk<sup>v</sup> also affects qkI expression in tissues outside the nervous system, we analyzed qkI expression in the testis and heart of qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> and wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> littermates. In contrast to the nervous tissues, no significant reduction of qkI expression was observed in heart or testis of the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f5">5</xref>A), suggesting that qk<sup>v</sup> affects qkI expression specifically in the nervous system. In the CNS, QKI expression is found not only in the myelinating oligodendrocytes, but also in astrocytes that are not involved in myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c8">8</xref>). Whether qkI expression is quantitatively reduced in astrocytes has not been determined. To address this question, we analyzed qkI mRNA expression in primary cultures of astrocytes derived from wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> and qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> littermates. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f5">5</xref>B, in contrast to the marked reduction of qkI in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain, a comparable level of qkI expression was observed in astrocytes derived from wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> and qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> littermates. This result suggests that reduced expression of qkI occurs specifically in oligodendrocytes of the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain.</p><p>To test whether qkI expression is also reduced in other dysmyelination diseases, we analyzed qkI mRNA and protein isoforms in the jp<sup>msd</sup> mutant mice that display more severe hypomyelination than the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c5">5</xref>). In the jp<sup>msd</sup> mutant mice, apoptosis of mature oligodendrocytes was increased compared with normal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c20">20</xref>). As a result, the level of MBP was markedly reduced because MBP is expressed at low levels in young oligodendrocytes but is rapidly accumulated during oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin sheath production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c18">18</xref>). In contrast, in the jp<sup>msd</sup> mutant brain, qkI mRNA and QKI proteins were only slightly reduced when compared with the wild-type littermate without statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f6">6</xref>A&#x02013;C). This is likely due to the fact that qkI expression is not vigorously elevated in mature oligodendrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c18">18</xref>) and therefore it is only mildly affected in the jp<sup>msd</sup> mutant. This result clearly indicates that marked reduction of qkI expression observed in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain is not a general phenomenon resulting from hypomyelination. Instead, it must represent a specific consequence of the qk<sup>v</sup> genetic lesion.</p></sec><sec><title>qkI mRNA isoforms display normal translation profiles in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain</title><p>To determine whether deficits in translation may contribute to the diminished expression of QKI proteins, we examined the profile for polyribosome association of qkI mRNAs in the brain of qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> and wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> littermates, which is a commonly used assay in evaluating translation activity of mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f7">7</xref>, the polyribosome profiles in the brain lysates derived from qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> and wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> littermates were almost identical, indicating normal translation of qkI mRNA in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mutant brain. In fact, the majority of qkI transcripts co-fractionated with polyribsomes (fractions 6&#x02013;12), with the most intense qkI signal detected in fractions containing actively translating ribosomes (fractions 9 and 10). EDTA treatment resulted in dissociation of polyribosomes into ribosomal subunits and released the qkI mRNAs into messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. As a consequence, qkI mRNAs were shifted to fractions toward the top of the gradient (fraction 5), confirming the engagement of qkI mRNAs in translation. This result discounts the possibility that diminished QKI is due to a deficiency in QKI protein synthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The above observations provide the first evidence that qk<sup>v</sup> directly affects the expression level of qkI mRNA isoforms in the nervous system of the qk<sup>v</sup> hypomyelination mutant. The deficient qkI expression is not a general consequence of hypomyelination, since the jp<sup>msd</sup> mutant that harbors more severe hypomyelination than qk<sup>v</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c5">5</xref>) did not show significant reduction of qkI expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f6">6</xref>). At the moment, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the stability of QKI proteins may also be affected in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain, perhaps as an indirect effect of abnormal myelin development. However, the fact that the quantitative reduction of qkI mRNA isoforms in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain matches with that of the corresponding QKI protein isoforms (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f1">1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>B) argues that reduced expression of qkI mRNA isoforms is responsible for the QKI protein deficiency to a large extent. In addition, no abnormalities were detected in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mutant at several post-transcriptional steps. These include: (i) an identical RPA pattern for qkI mRNA isoforms in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mutant and the wild-type control (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>), suggesting normal splicing of the qkI transcript; (ii) comparable reduction of the qkI mRNAs in the nuclei and in the whole tissue derived from the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain, suggesting normal nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution; (iii) a normal polyribosome association profile of qkI mRNAs in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f7">7</xref>), suggesting no translation deficits. Although the above studies did not rule out destabilization of the qkI mRNAs in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain, the fact that the qk<sup>v</sup> lesion is located 5&#x02032; to the qkI transcription start site suggests the loss of an enhancer and the deficiency of QKI proteins most likely results from reduced qkI transcription.</p><p>In the postnatal mouse brain, QKI proteins are expressed abundantly in the myelinating oligodendrocytes as well as in the non-myelinating astroglia, but not in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c8">8</xref>). The normal level of qkI mRNAs in astrocytes derived from the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f5">5</xref>) suggests that the reduction of qkI mRNAs during active myelination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>) occurs specifically in oligodendrocytes, responsible for the diminished immunostaining of QKI proteins in oligodendrocytes reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c8">8</xref>). The level of qkI mRNA in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain is approximately half that in the wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>B). Since oligodendrocytes account for about half of the glia cells in the brain, the observed reduction must represent severely diminished qkI expression in oligodendrocytes, and the qkI mRNAs detected in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain most likely represent qkI expression in non-myelinating glia. The levels of qkI mRNAs are also markedly reduced in the sciatic nerve at P16 and P20 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>D), indicating that qk<sup>v</sup> affects qkI expression not only in oligodendrocytes of the CNS, but also in Schwann cells of the PNS. However, despite the more profound hypomyelination in the CNS than the PNS of the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c4">4</xref>), qkI expression was not more severely reduced in the brain than in the sciatic nerve (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>D). The lack of correlation between the severity of qkI deficiency and that of hypomyelination in CNS and PNS suggests the possible existence of different mechanisms that regulate myelination at various regions of the nervous system. In fact, a regional difference of hypomyelination in the nervous system is not unique in qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice. Deficiency of Fyn kinase affects myelination in the forebrain, but not in the spinal cord and PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c21">21</xref>). In contrast, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A knockout mice display myelin deficits more profoundly in the spinal cord and cerebellum as compared with the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c22">22</xref>). Despite the variation of hypomyelination severity, deficient qkI mRNA expression in myelin-producing cells of both CNS and PNS, without detectable post-transcriptional abnormalities of qkI mRNA in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> mice, suggest that the qk<sup>v</sup> deletion most likely affects an enhancer for qkI transcription in myelin-producing cells.</p><p>The possible existence of a cell type-specific enhancer for qkI transcription during active myelination is also supported by the fact that qkI-6 and qkI-7 mRNAs in the normal brain are expressed at high levels during the most active period of myelinogenesis (P14&#x02013;P20) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c8">8</xref>). These two isoforms account for &#x0223c;70&#x00025; of the brain qkI mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>). In fact, abundant expression of qkI-6 and qkI-7 mRNAs is found only in the nervous system (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f5">5</xref>). In the heart and testis, qkI-5 is the predominant isoform while qkI-6 and qkI-7 are negligible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f5">5</xref>A). The developmental regulation of qkI-5 mRNA expression is distinct from that of qkI-6 and qkI-7. qkI-5 is expressed at higher levels during embryonic and neonatal development, and gradually declines until it reaches the lowest level at P14 before the peak of myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c8">8</xref>). Whether the declined expression of qkI-5 mRNA during development is controlled by alternative splicing of the qkI transcript, or alternatively due to transcriptional regulation by an embryonic enhancer, or even by regulation at the level of mRNA stability, is an intriguing question the answer to which still remains elusive.</p><p>Although all three major QKI protein isoforms are able to interact with certain mRNA targets such as that encoding MBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f2">2</xref>), distinct roles of QKI isoforms in regulating myelination have been reported. The nuclear isoform QKI-5 is implicated in regulating splicing and nuclear export of its mRNA target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c12">12</xref>), whereas the cytoplasmic QKI-6 and QKI-7 may regulate mRNA stability and localization of mRNA to the myelin sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c18">18</xref>). We observed less severe reduction of the qkI-5 isoform as compared with other qkI isoforms in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain stem at the level of both mRNA and protein (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>). However, this phenomenon appeared to be transient and only occurred at the early stage of myelination (P10&#x02013;P14). At the peak of myelination (P20), reduction of qkI-5 mRNA was at a similar level to that observed for qkI-6 and qkI-7 in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg635f4">4</xref>B). The severity of QKI-5 reduction at the early stage of myelination geographically correlates with the severity of hypomyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c8">8</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that QKI-5 also exerts positive roles in myelination. Although over-expression of QKI-5 causes nuclear retention of the MBP mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg635c12">12</xref>), the overall downstream consequence as a result of less severe reduction of QKI-5 in oligodendrocyte development, due to misregulation of multiple oligodendrocyte genes, remains to be determined by future studies. Identification of mRNA targets for each QKI isoform at various developmental stages may ultimately elucidate the roles of QKI in controlling myelin development.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg635f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Expression of QKI protein isoforms in the qk<sup>v</sup>&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> and the wt&#x0002f;qk<sup>v</sup> littermates.
