In this report, we show that Megator (Mtor), the <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> counterpart of the human nuclear pore complex protein translocated promoter region (Tpr), and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein Mad2 form a conserved complex that localizes to a nuclear derived spindle matrix in living cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments supports that Mtor is retained around spindle microtubules, where it shows distinct dynamic properties. Mtor/Tpr promotes the recruitment of Mad2 and Mps1 but not Mad1 to unattached kinetochores (KTs), mediating normal mitotic duration and SAC response. At anaphase, Mtor plays a role in spindle elongation, thereby affecting normal chromosome movement. We propose that Mtor/Tpr functions as a spatial regulator of the SAC, which ensures the efficient recruitment of Mad2 to unattached KTs at the onset of mitosis and proper spindle maturation, whereas enrichment of Mad2 in a spindle matrix helps confine the action of a diffusible &#x0201c;wait anaphase&#x0201d; signal to the vicinity of the spindle.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitotic spindle is composed of dynamic microtubules (MTs) and associated proteins that mediate chromosome segregation during mitosis. The requirement of an additional stationary or elastic structure forming a spindle matrix where molecular motors slide MTs has long been proposed to power chromosome motion and account for incompletely understood features of mitotic spindle dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pickett-Heaps et al., 1984</xref>). However, definitive evidence for its existence in living cells or on its biochemical nature and whether it plays a direct role during mitosis has been missing.</p><p>A functional spindle matrix would be expected to (a) form a fusiform structure coalescent with spindle MTs, (b) persist in the absence of MTs, (c) be resilient in response to changes of spindle shape and length, and (d) affect spindle assembly and/or function if one or more of its components are perturbed. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a complex of at least four nuclear proteins, Skeletor, Megator (Mtor), Chromator, and EAST (enhanced adult sensory threshold), form a putative spindle matrix that persists in the absence of MTs in fixed preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Johansen and Johansen, 2007</xref>). From this complex, Mtor is the only protein that shows clear sequence conservation with proteins in other organisms, such as the nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein translocated promoter region (Tpr) in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cordes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zimowska et al., 1997</xref>), its respective counterparts Mlp1 and Mlp2 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Strambio-de-Castillia et al., 1999</xref>), and nuclear pore anchor in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). NPC proteins, including Mtor/Tpr orthologues in yeast, were shown to functionally interact with spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Iouk et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Scott et al., 2005</xref>). The SAC ensures correct chromosome segregation by providing time for proper kinetochore (KT) attachments to spindle MTs while inhibiting the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Assuming that any critical function by the spindle matrix is widely conserved, we focus on understanding the mitotic role of Mtor in living <italic>Drosophila</italic> somatic cells. Our results provide a new conceptual view of a spindle matrix not as a rigid structural scaffold but as a spatial determinant of key mitotic regulators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results and discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Mtor localizes to a dynamic nuclear derived spindle matrix in living cells</title><p>To investigate the localization of Mtor in living cells, we generated a <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell line stably coexpressing Mtor-mCherry and GFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin. Mtor-mCherry is nuclear in interphase and at nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) reorganizes into a fusiform structure coalescent with spindle MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; and Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811012/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811012/DC1</ext-link>). Mtor-mCherry shows a highly adaptable morphology in response to changes in spindle shape and dynamics throughout mitosis, which is inconsistent with a static structure. Similar to endogenous Mtor, Mtor-mCherry retracts and loses the fusiform shape upon MT depolymerization but is retained in a conspicuous milieu around chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B&#x02013;D and F</xref>; and Video 2), suggesting that MTs exert a pushing force on the Mtor-defined matrix.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Mtor is part of a dynamic nuclear derived spindle matrix distinct from MTs.</bold> (A) An S2 cell stably expressing Mtor-mCherry (red) and GFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin (green).

In this study, we used immunofluorescence to show that lamin B is not fully disintegrated at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Similar results have recently been reported in living <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and neuroblasts, where a spindle envelope was proposed to limit the diffusion of nuclear derived Nup107 before anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Katsani et al., 2008</xref>). To test whether this membranous network works as a diffusion barrier around the spindle, we compared the dynamic behavior of Mtor-mCherry relative to GFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin and a known MT-associated protein, Jupiter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Karpova et al., 2006</xref>), upon colchicine addition. GFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin or Jupiter-GFP fluorescence is gradually lost from the spindle region with an equivalent gain in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and E</xref>). In contrast, Mtor-mCherry remains confined to the spindle region with no detectable fluorescence gain in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). These results argue against the existence of a diffusion barrier around the metaphase spindle in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and suggest that Mtor is being selectively retained in this region.</p><p>To shed light on the dynamic properties of Mtor, we used FRAP. In interphase nuclei, there is &#x0223c;50% recovery of fluorescence in the bleached region with an equivalent loss from a similar unbleached region and undetectable cytoplasmic exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and A&#x02032;</xref>), suggesting that Mtor in the nucleoplasm is mobile. In mitosis, FRAP of Mtor-mCherry in one half-spindle is mirrored by an equivalent loss of fluorescence from the unbleached half-spindle as if Mtor exchanges between half-spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and B&#x02032;</xref>). However, this recovery was slower (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 18.7 &#x000b1; 4.3 s, <italic>n</italic> = 9 cells) than in interphase nuclei (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 9.0 &#x000b1; 5.1 s, <italic>n</italic> = 3 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A&#x02032; and B&#x02032;</xref>) and had a minor contribution from a cytoplasmic pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B&#x02032;&#x02013;C&#x02032;</xref>). In both interphase and mitosis, the recovery curves of Mtor-mCherry fitted a single exponential, suggesting affinity to a yet unidentified substrate, whereas GFP&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin in the spindle displayed biphasic recovery kinetics and best fit the sum of two exponentials as result of a rapid diffusion phase (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 0.42 &#x000b1; 0.39 s, <italic>n</italic> = 3 cells) followed by a slower recovery phase (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 28.6 &#x000b1; 6.7 s) associated with MT turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D&#x02013;D&#x02033;</xref>). Finally, in S2 cells that sporadically form two spindles in the same cytoplasm, we found fluorescence exchange within the same spindle and from surrounding cytoplasm with no apparent loss from the neighboring unbleached spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and E&#x02032;</xref>), supporting that Mtor is unable to exchange between two spindles located &#x0003c;10 &#x000b5;m apart. Collectively, these data indicate that Mtor is part of a dynamic, nuclear derived spindle matrix surrounded by a fenestrated membranous system containing lamin B and shows mobility properties that are distinct from MTs and associated proteins.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of Mtor-mCherry dynamics by FRAP.</bold> (A and A&#x02032;) FRAP of Mtor-mCherry in interphase nuclei.

Like Mtor, the retention of Mad2 in the spindle matrix is resistant to MT depolymerization (Fig. S1 C and Video 4), suggesting that spindle-associated Mad2 is not freely diffusible. mRFP-Mad2 remains associated with the spindle matrix in the absence of Mtor, but it is unable to accumulate at KTs even after MT depolymerization with colchicine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>; Fig. S1, D&#x02013;E; and Videos 5 and 6). Stable expression of Mtor-mCherry (which is RNAi insensitive) rescues normal Mad2 localization at KTs after Mtor RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref> and Fig. S1 F), indicating that the observed phenotype is specific and supporting that Mtor-mCherry is a functional protein. Lastly, Mtor depletion does not affect normal Mad2 expression levels and vice versa (Fig. S2 A), which rules out unspecific effects of Mtor over Mad2 mRNA transport to the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec><title>Mtor/Tpr forms a conserved complex with Mad2</title><p>The colocalization of Mtor and Mad2 in the spindle matrix suggests that these proteins may interact. Indeed, Mad2 was found to coimmunoprecipitate with Mtor in lysates obtained from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos harvested between 0&#x02013;3 h after egg laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Given that Mtor does not specifically accumulate at KTs, this interaction might represent an important regulatory step for the subsequent recruitment of Mad2 to unattached KTs. Several proteins such as Mad1, Rod, Ndc80, or Mps1 are involved in recruiting Mad2 to unattached KTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). We found that although Mad1, Rod, and Ndc80 are effectively targeted to unattached KTs after Mtor depletion (Fig. S2, B&#x02013;G&#x02032;), Mps1 accumulation is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, G&#x02013;I</xref>). Mps1 kinase activity was recently shown to be required to specifically target Mad2 but not Mad1 to unattached KTs in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tighe et al., 2008</xref>). To investigate whether the same regulatory role upon Mad2 is true in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we generated an <italic>mps1</italic> kinase-dead (<italic>mps1<sup>KD</sup></italic>) allele by homologous recombination in flies (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811012/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811012/DC1</ext-link>). In agreement with the results in human cells, neuroblasts from <italic>mps1<sup>KD</sup></italic> third instar larvae show reduced or undetectable Mad2 accumulation at KTs upon colchicine treatment (Fig. S3). Collectively, these results support that the regulatory role of Mtor upon Mad2 is indirect and may be catalyzed by Mps1.</p><p>Like Tpr, Mad1, Mad2, and Mps1 localize at the NPC during interphase in human cells. During mitosis, Tpr remains associated with the nuclear envelope until prometaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> and Fig. S2 H). Moreover, a fraction of Tpr is associated with the mitotic spindle from late prometaphase until anaphase and is recruited to the reforming nuclear envelope during telophase. This confirms the previous identification of Tpr in isolated human mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sauer et al., 2005</xref>), but we failed to detect any enriched fraction of Tpr that resists MT depolymerization with nocodazole, including KTs (our unpublished observations). To see whether Tpr has a conserved regulatory role in the recruitment of Mad2 to unattached KTs in human cells, we used RNAi to deplete Tpr in HeLa cells (Fig. S2 I). Like in S2 cells, Tpr RNAi leads to reduced accumulation of Mad2 but not Mad1 to unattached KTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B&#x02013;D</xref>; and Fig. S2, J and J&#x02032;) accompanied by a decrease in the normal mitotic index and a weakened SAC response in the presence of nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Tpr knockdown does not enrich for cells in G2 and slightly increases the number of cells in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Loiodice et al., 2004</xref>), supporting that the lower mitotic index is not caused by the inability of cells to enter mitosis but rather reflects a faster exit. Moreover, Tpr, Mad1, Mad2, and Mps1 coimmunoprecipitate in mitotic enriched HeLa cell extracts prepared in the presence of nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, F&#x02013;H</xref>), extending the results obtained in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and reinforcing that this complex forms independently of MTs and an intact nuclear envelope. While this paper was under revision, Tpr was independently found to interact with Mad1 and Mad2 in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). In agreement with our results, the authors propose that Tpr is important for controlling the SAC but reject the possibility that Tpr is playing a role in mitotic timing. However, quantification of the NEB to anaphase duration in Tpr-depleted cells does show a 25% acceleration of mitosis during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, our results are not consistent with a model in which KT-associated Tpr serves as a docking place for Mad1 because we were unable to detect Tpr (or Mtor) at KTs, including those that were positive for Mad1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 I</xref>), and found no impairment in Mad1 KT recruitment in Tpr- or Mtor-depleted cells.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Human Tpr shares functional conservation with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mtor.</bold> (A) Immunodetection of endogenous Tpr with a mouse mAb (red), ACA (green), and MTs (blue) in HeLa cells.

In budding yeast, Mps1 phosphorylates Mad1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hardwick et al., 1996</xref>), which is continuously recycled to KTs from Mlps at NPCs, but N-terminal deletion mutants of Mad1 lacking the Mlp-binding domain have a functional SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Scott et al., 2005</xref>). In humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Mps1 regulates Mad2 but not Mad1 accumulation at KTs. Because Mad1 localization at KTs does not depend on Mlps/Mtor/Tpr and Mps1 kinase activity, the residual Mad2 at KTs after Mtor/Tpr RNAi possibly corresponds to the Mad1-bound fraction. One possibility is that Mps1 phosphorylation of Mad1 regulates the recruitment of a fast-exchanging pool of Mad2 to KTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chung and Chen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). Parallelly, Mtor/Tpr may spatially regulate Mps1 autophosphorylation, which is important for its normal KT accumulation, together with Mad2 (Xu et al., 2008). The presence of Mad2 in the complex may work as a positive feedback mechanism to ensure continuous Mps1 kinase activity upon SAC activation.</p><p>SAC proteins evolved from systems with a closed mitosis like budding yeast, where the spindle assembles inside an intact nuclear envelope into more complex systems like animals and plants, where the nuclear envelope is thought to fully or partially disintegrate during spindle formation, justifying the requirement of a nuclear derived spindle matrix for an effective SAC response. What retains matrix components around the spindle in systems where mitosis is thought to be open remains an intriguing question. In this regard, lamin B was proposed to tether several factors that mediate spindle assembly in <italic>Xenopus</italic><italic>laevis</italic> egg extracts and possibly in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tsai et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, a continuous endoplasmic reticulum surrounding the mitotic spindle is thought to be recycled from the nuclear envelope after its disassembly and has been observed in many systems undergoing an open mitosis, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ellenberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McCullough and Lucocq, 2005</xref>). Although such fenestrated membranous systems cannot work as diffusion barriers, it is possible that they indirectly help to generate local gradients or concentrate matrix-affine substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 J</xref>). The enrichment of Mad2 in the spindle matrix provides an explanation for an unsolved SAC paradigm in which the &#x0201c;wait anaphase&#x0201d; signal emanating from unattached KTs must be diffusible to prevent premature anaphase onset of already bioriented chromosomes but at the same time is known to be restricted to the vicinity of the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rieder et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The proposed role of Mtor/Tpr further supports the necessity of spindle maturation for proper KT&#x02013;MT attachments and anaphase spindle elongation in which the spindle matrix may help extend the duration of mitosis for the assembly of a competent chromosome segregation machinery. Mtor/Tpr-depleted cells have a weakened SAC response that, as opposed to complete checkpoint loss, may be compatible with cell viability and lead to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Michel et al., 2001</xref>).
