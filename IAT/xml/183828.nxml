Even after successful transplantation, allograft vasculopathy affects as many as 60% of cardiac grafts within one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and is the principal cause of late graft loss. While their natural histories differ, CAD and allograft vasculopathy share certain features of their pathogenesis and histopathology. Prominent among these features is the recruitment and retention of peripheral blood monocytes in the vascular wall, an event that is thought to trigger the formation of vascular lesions.</p><p>Monocyte-derived macrophages play a central role in the pathogenesis of both native atherosclerosis and allograft vasculopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Macrophages are an integral cellular component of the atherosclerotic plaque where they function to sequester lipids, giving rise to "foam cells". The release of extracellular matrix-degrading proteases by these cells, combined with their pro-apoptotic effect on adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], are thought to destabilise the plaque, progressively leading to rupture. Furthermore, atherosclerotic plaque macrophages promote local coagulation by releasing prothrombotic mediators such as tissue factor. Similarly, though their precise role remains poorly defined, macrophages abound in the neointimal lesions associated with allograft vasculopathy and formation of these lesions is defective in macrophage-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Moreover, treatments that have proven effective in reducing neointimal lesion formation also reduced the macrophage burden of the lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It seems likely, therefore, that macrophage turnover in the vascular wall may influence the rate of progression of both native atherosclerosis and allograft vasculopathy.</p><p>Statins are highly efficacious in controlling hyperlipidaemia and reducing the risk of acute coronary events and cardiovascular death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The biological activity of statins stems from their chemical structure, which resembles that of mevalonic acid. Statins suppress <italic>de novo </italic>cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Amazingly, statin therapy is well tolerated with few major adverse effects, usually attributable to metabolic interactions with other drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Early animal studies suggested that, in addition to its anti-atherosclerotic effect, statin treatment might also attenuate the development of allograft vasculopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The first evidence for an association of post-transplant statin treatment with reduced incidence and progression of allograft vasculopathy in human cardiac allograft recipients came from a prospective study by Kobashigawa <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This finding was subsequently corroborated by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and spurred interest in characterising the vasculoprotective effects of statins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Statins are now known to have multiple effects on native cellular components of the vascular wall as well as on monocytes / macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Given the involvement of macrophages in CAD and allograft vasculopathy, one plausible mechanism through which statins exert their vasculoprotective actions could be the induction of macrophage apoptosis. When grown <italic>in vitro </italic>monocytes differentiate into macrophages, a phenotypic transition heralded by down-regulation of the IL-1&#x003b2; response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Thus, native atherosclerosis is thought to occur mainly as a result of chronic oxidative stress, while mechanical endothelial trauma initiates restenosis after angioplasty or stenting. Lastly, allograft vasculopathy is thought to arise chiefly as a result of endothelial dysfunction precipitated by both immune and non-immune injury. Monocyte recruitment and retention in the vascular wall is a unifying feature of these diverse outcomes and correlates strongly with the timing and severity of vascular lesion formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Peripheral blood monocytes represent a heterogeneous population of immature cells that differentiate upon exiting the circulation. The tissue microenvironment plays a crucial role in initiating and guiding monocyte differentiation: arrest on a solid matrix is generally sufficient to initiate this process, while the presence of particular cytokines and growth factors functions to steer it towards a variety of phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This process can be faithfully reproduced <italic>in vitro </italic>where, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, approximately 80% of peripheral blood monocytes spontaneously develop into macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. One of the earliest functional indices of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, is a markedly attenuated IL-1&#x003b2; release in response to LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Here we have demonstrated that mevastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, abolishes the profound down-regulation of IL-1&#x003b2; release associated with monocyte differentiation; and that this effect coincides temporally with the induction of monocyte-specific apoptosis in human PBMC cultures. While monocyte differentiation proceeds spontaneously <italic>in vitro</italic>, lymphocytes differentiate only in response to signals via the T/B cell receptor complexes, which are lacking in pure PBMC cultures from single individuals; notably, these cells remained viable throughout the observation period. Therefore, unlike previous observations with murine J744 myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the susceptibility of primary monocytes to statin-induced apoptosis appears to be tightly linked to the process of cell differentiation.</p><p>The precise molecular mechanisms underlying these findings are currently under investigation; depletion of downstream products of the mevalonate pathway such as the phosphorylated geranylgeranyl and farnesyl isoprenoids, which would compromise G-protein function, is likely to be involved. Shortage of such intermediates may be exacerbated in the face of increased utilization of the mevalonate pathway that occurs during monocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], explaining the failure of mevalonolactone supplementation to completely prevent apoptosis in our experimental set-up. Conversely, mevalonolactone appeared to accelerate the suppression of LPS-induced IL-1&#x003b2; release in differentiating monocytes, hinting that the mevalonate pathway regulates this process both dynamically and bi-directionally. Hence this metabolic pathway may represent a promising therapeutic target for diseases involving dysregulated macrophage function.</p><p>Monocyte turnover in solid tissue is determined by the balance between recruitment and clearance. Overproduction of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) by native vascular cells and macrophages is a major mechanism promoting macrophage accumulation in atherosclerotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and neointimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] lesions. Statin treatment was recently shown to down-regulate MCP-1 production <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]; and to suppress the release of various other atherothrombotic mediators by plaque macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, in most cases, the potential contribution of cell death to these findings was not concurrently investigated. Here we show that HMG-CoA reductase inhibition suppressed the release of IL-1Ra from LPS-stimulated monocytes; but that this suppression was largely accounted for by apoptotic cell death. Unlike IL-1&#x003b2;, the release of which occurs <italic>via </italic>stimulation of the P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>7 </sub>receptor at the level of the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and is thus refractory to apoptosis, secretion of IL-1Ra follows the classical pathway, which is effectively shut down during apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. While suppression of endothelial MCP-1 synthesis might genuinely contribute to the benefits of statin therapy, we suggest that induction of monocyte apoptosis may underlie many downstream statin actions, including the reduction in plaque macrophage counts and inhibition of <italic>in situ </italic>MMP and TF production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It is noteworthy that, since osteoclasts are also developmentally derived from peripheral blood monocytes, this hypothesis fits well with the recently proposed role of statins as modulators of bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Statin-mediated monocyte apoptosis in the context of atherosclerosis. During formation of the atherosclerotic plaque monocytes are recruited and retained in the vascular wall, where they differentiate into macrophages.

Libby and colleagues have postulated that foam cell apoptosis might perpetuate vascular lipid accumulation, contributing to atherosclerotic plaque growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, in a recent, very elegant study these authors concluded that apoptosis is not involved in the reduction of plaque macrophage counts by cerivastatin and, instead, attributed these effects to suppression of cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The data presented here clearly challenge this conclusion and we feel that rejecting apoptosis as a possible mechanism of statin vasculoprotection may be premature on several counts. Firstly, it is well known that apoptotic cells are rapidly cleared <italic>in vivo </italic>and, in their paper, Aikawa and colleagues acknowledged that very few apoptotic cells were actually observed in both the control and statin-treated groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In view of this, it is unfortunate that these authors did not assess the role of apoptosis in their <italic>in vitro </italic>studies of monocyte differentiation. Moreover, several reports have cautioned that the TUNEL assay, used by Aikawa <italic>et al</italic>, may not allow accurate quantification of apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. It might be argued that cerivastatin doses investigated in the aforementioned study (0.01&#x02013;0.05 &#x003bc;M) reflect therapeutic plasma levels of that drug, which may not be pro-apoptotic. However, in support of our own findings, a recent study by Kaneider <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] showed significant monocyte pro-apoptotic activity of low-dose (0.01 &#x003bc;M) cerivastatin, in terms of caspase-3 activation. It should be noted that cerivastatin is relatively hydrophilic and a more potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase than mevastatin; thus our findings with mevastatin at relatively high doses may still be therapeutically relevant. Further <italic>in vitro </italic>studies with clinically used statins are currently in progress to address this issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>HMG-CoA reductase inhibition in human peripheral blood monocytes appears to maintain them in a functionally immature state and to render them susceptible to apoptosis. We suggest that this may represent one mechanism whereby statins decrease macrophage load and the release of prothrombotic mediators in vascular lesions, potentially leading to their prevention or regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JEV conceived and led the design of this study; carried out all experimental work and statistical analysis; and drafted the manuscript.
