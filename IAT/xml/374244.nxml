The mechanism by which histone H2A is replaced by H2A.Z in the nucleosome is unknown. We identified a complex containing 13 different polypeptides associated with a soluble pool of H2A.Z in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>. This complex was designated SWR1-Com in reference to the Swr1p subunit, a Swi2/Snf2-paralog.

Strikingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of cells lacking Swr1p, the presumed ATPase of the complex, revealed a profound defect in the deposition of H2A.Z at euchromatic regions that flank the silent mating type cassette <italic>HMR</italic> and at 12 other chromosomal sites tested.

The functional state of chromatin is regulated, in part, by histone modifying enzymes and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes. Members of the latter enzyme class alter the structure of nucleosomes or slide them along DNA in vitro (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Becker1">Becker and Horz 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Peterson1">Peterson 2002</xref>). These enzymes have a catalytic DNA-dependent ATPase subunit, which is similar in sequence to those of the DEAD/DEAH-box class of RNA-dependent ATPases. The prototype for this family is the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> Swi2/Snf2 protein, originally identified for its role in promoting transcription.</p><p>In addition to histone modification and nucleosome remodeling/sliding, there is a third form of chromatin regulation that involves the replacement of canonical histones with histone variants. For example, replacement of histone H3 by a conserved H3 variant (called Cse4p in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> Cid in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> or CENP-A in humans) is essential for the assembly of the kinetochore (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Smith1">Smith 2002</xref>). The other histone variant that is conserved between yeast and humans is H2A.Z, which replaces H2A in about one in ten nucleosomes. By convention, the gene encoding H2A.Z in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> is referred to as <italic>HTZ1</italic> and mutant forms of the gene are referred to as <italic>htz1.</italic> We have shown previously that an important function of H2A.Z in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> is to prevent the spreading of silent chromatin, also termed heterochromatin, into adjacent euchromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Meneghini1">Meneghini et al. 2003</xref>). Silencing in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> occurs at the <italic>HMR</italic> and <italic>HML</italic> silent mating type cassettes, near telomeres, and in the rDNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Rusche1">Rusche et al. 2003</xref>). All three types of silencing require the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2p. Telomeric and <italic>HM</italic> silencing also require the histone H3/H4 tail binding proteins, Sir3p and Sir4p. In yeast cells lacking H2A.Z, the Sir complex spreads beyond its normal boundaries at <italic>HMR</italic> and into neighboring euchromatin, resulting in the repression of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Meneghini1">Meneghini et al. 2003</xref>). This repression is reversed by a deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic> or a deletion of the nucleation sites for silencing at <italic>HMR</italic>. Likewise, the silencing of genes near telomeres in <italic>htz1</italic>&#x00394; cells is reversed by a deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic>. In yeast, H2A.Z itself is enriched in the euchromatic region flanking <italic>HMR</italic> and is depleted in silent regions. Genetic analysis indicates that H2A.Z acts independently of a characterized chromatin boundary element that occurs on the right border of the <italic>HMR</italic> silent cassette. Thus, H2A.Z is a euchromatin-specific factor that antagonizes the spread of silencing through a mechanism that is independent of at least one characterized boundary element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Meneghini1">Meneghini et al. 2003</xref>). However, the creation of a boundary for the spread of silenced chromatin likely involves additional protein factors, such as the double bromodomain protein, Bdf1p, whose function is similar to that of H2A.Z and which binds preferably to acetylated histones that are found in euchromatin outside of silenced regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Ladurner1">Ladurner et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Matangkasombut1">Matangkasombut and Buratowski 2003</xref>).</p><p>Despite its critical role in preventing the spread of heterochromatin, the mechanism by which H2A.Z is deposited in euchromatin is unknown. The canonical histones can be deposited by both replication-coupled and replication-independent deposition mechanisms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Haushalter1">Haushalter and Kadonaga 2003</xref>). In human cells, the replication-coupled deposition pathway is essential for progression through S-phase and for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Hoek1">Hoek and Stillman 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Ye1">Ye et al. 2003</xref>). In contrast, in budding yeast, no single deposition pathway is essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Kaufman1">Kaufman et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Formosa1">Formosa et al. 2002</xref>). For example, the histone H3/H4 chaperones CAF-I and Asf1p function synergistically during replication-coupled histone deposition in vitro and cooperate to form heterochromatin in vivo. However, neither CAF-I nor Asf1p is essential for cell viability in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> and mutants lacking both proteins are also viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Tyler1">Tyler et al. 1999</xref>). Nap1p, a yeast homolog of a mammalian histone chaperone purified on the basis of a replication-independent assembly assay, is also dispensable for viability in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Ishimi1">Ishimi and Kikuchi 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Kellogg1">Kellogg and Murray 1995</xref>). Thus, other mechanisms must operate to deposit chromatin in living cells. One candidate is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> factor ACF and the orthologous human complex RSF, which each contain a ISWI-type Swi2/Snf2 ATPase subunit (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Haushalter1">Haushalter and Kadonaga 2003</xref>). These factors promote the ATP-dependent assembly of ordered nucleosome arrays in vitro, but their precise in vivo roles have not been firmly established.</p><p>Even less is known about the mechanisms of deposition of variant histones. Understanding the mechanism by which euchromatin that contains H2A.Z is formed requires the identification of the machinery that catalyzes its deposition. The results of this study identify a multisubunit protein complex, SWR1-Complex (SWR1-Com), which contains a Swi2/Snf2 paralog and is required for H2A.Z deposition and function in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content>. We link this complex structurally and genetically to the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and the Ino80-C chromatin remodeling complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Protein Complex (SWR1-Com) Associated with the Histone Variant H2A.Z</title><p>H2A.Z is important for specifying euchromatic regions in the genome of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Meneghini1">Meneghini et al. 2003</xref>). To determine which other proteins contribute to directing H2A.Z to its chromosomal locations, we purified proteins associated with a soluble pool of H2A.Z from whole cell extracts of a yeast strain harboring an allele of <italic>HTZ1</italic> that encodes a carboxyl-terminal fusion to the tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Rigaut1">Rigaut et al. 1999</xref>). These initial purifications were performed under low salt conditions and with limited wash steps to maximize protein complex recovery, with more stringent conditions used subsequently to distinguish strong from weak and potentially artifactual interactions (see below). The protein compositions of the samples were determined using Direct Analysis of Large Protein Complexes methodology, which consists of tryptic digestion of the mixture, multidimensional microcapillary chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry, and genome-assisted analysis of the acquired spectral data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Link1">Link et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Sanders1">Sanders et al. 2002</xref>). A protein was judged to be associated with H2A.Z if the number of corresponding peptides in the H2A.Z-TAP purified material was higher than in the material purified from strains lacking a tagged H2A.Z protein and if the protein passed additional criteria described below. Proteins established to nonspecifically copurify with TAP-tagged proteins were excluded from the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Shevchenko1">Shevchenko et al. 2002</xref>). Using these criteria and additional purifications (described below), we identified 15 proteins associated with H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020131-t001">Table 1</xref>), of which 13 form a complex designated SWR1-Com (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g001">Figure 1</xref> and see below). The largest subunit corresponded to Swr1p (Swi2/Snf2-related), an uncharacterized member of the Swi2/Snf2 family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Pollard1">Pollard and Peterson 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>SWR1-Com Shared Subunits with the Essential HAT NuA4 and the Ino80-C Chromatin Remodeling Complex</title><p>Four SWR1-Com subunits that are also found in the Ino80-C chromatin remodeling complex are Rvb1p, Rvb2p, Arp4, and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Shen1">Shen et al. 2000</xref>). Similarly, Yaf9p, as shown below and by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Le1">Le Masson et al. 2003</xref>), as well as Arp4p and actin, are also components of the NuA4 HAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Galarneau1">Galarneau et al. 2000</xref>). To determine whether the proteins that associated with H2A.Z formed one discrete complex, multiple complexes, or were copurifying contaminants, three of these proteins were themselves tagged with the TAP domain. Complexes from the soluble fraction of whole cell extracts were purified in conditions similar to those used for the H2A.Z-TAP purification, and the composition of the purified material was evaluated by the same procedure used for the H2A.Z-TAP (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020131-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g001">Figure 1</xref>). With the exception of the histone chaperone Nap1p and the import protein Kap114p, the proteins that copurified with TAP-tagged Swr1p were similar to the set found with H2A.Z, except that two additional proteins, designated here as Swc3p and Swc7p, were identified. Similarly, purifications from strains with TAP-tagged Swc4p and Yaf9p yielded nearly all the proteins associated with Swr1p and H2A.Z and lacked Nap1p and Kap114p. Like the Swr1-TAP material, the Swc4-TAP-associated material contained Swc3p and Swc7p, supporting the assignment of these two proteins to SWR1-Com. TAP-tagged Swc4p and Yaf9p also associated with most of the subunits of the NuA4 complex (including Tra1p, Epl1p, Eaf3p, Yng2p, and the catalytic subunit Esa1p). These data suggested that SWR1-Com and NuA4 shared the Yaf9p, Swc4p, Arp4, and actin subunits.</p><p>Representative complex purifications under high stringency conditions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) from strains with either the Swr1-TAP, Yaf9-TAP, or an untagged control strain are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. Proteins that copurified with both Swr1-TAP and Yaf9-TAP represented subunits of SWR1-Com (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, arrows), whereas proteins that only copurified with Yaf9-TAP represented specific NuA4 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, stars). A schematic representation of the domain structures of SWR1-Com subunits is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g002">Figure 2</xref>B. Several of the proteins in the complex contained motifs (SANT, Bromo, YEATS, and HIT) found in proteins associated with chromatin, suggesting that SWR1-Com acts directly on chromatin.</p><p>Since the histone chaperone Nap1p and the import factor Kap114p copurified with H2A.Z but not other members of the complex, they were likely to be part of an H2A.Z-containing protein complex distinct from SWR1-Com. Affinity purification of TAP-tagged Rvb2p, an established component of the Ino80-C chromatin remodeling complex, yielded peptides corresponding to the other known subunits of the Ino80-C complex as well as six members of SWR1-Com, three of which (Swc4p, Arp4p, and actin) are also subunits of NuA4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). Consistent with the assignment of SWR1-Com subunits, a percentage of the cellular pool of these proteins cosedimented with each other upon glycerol gradient centrifugations of whole cell extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>The initial purifications suggested that Swc4p and Bdf1p, both of which have domains that are involved in recognition of histone tails, copurified with H2A.Z-TAP and might be part of SWR1-Com. Independent assessment of the composition of the complexes deduced by mass spectrometry was obtained by analytical-scale affinity purifications of Yaf9-TAP, Esa1-TAP, Rvb2-TAP, Swr1-TAP, and Ino80-TAP from cells containing a version of Swc4p that was fused at its carboxyl-terminus to a triple hemagglutinin (HA) tag. These analytical-scale affinity purifications were more stringent than the initial TAP purifications and therefore served to eliminate false-positive results and to provide independent tests of interactions. Anti-HA epitope antibodies and antibodies against Tra1p, the largest subunit of NuA4, were used to analyze the copurified material. Both Yaf9-TAP and Esa1-TAP associated with comparable amounts of Tra1p and Swc4p, supporting the assignment of Yaf9p and Swc4p as new subunits of NuA4. Likewise, Rvb2-TAP and Swr1-TAP copurified with a substantial amount of Swc4-HA, but Ino80-TAP did not. Rvb2-TAP, Swr1-TAP, and Ino80-TAP were not associated with Tra1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). These data were consistent with Swr1p and Rvb2p being components of SWR1-Com and not of NuA4. Further supporting the assignment of Swc4p as a subunit of NuA4, significant amounts of the NuA4 subunits Tra1p and Esa1p were present in material from Swc4-TAP analytical-scale purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>The number of peptides corresponding to Bdf1p in the TAP purifications was low, and Bdf1p was found only in the H2A.Z-TAP and the Yaf9-TAP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020131-t001">Table 1</xref>). Bdf1p's potential presence was tested further by additional analytical-scale affinity purifications from strains carrying Yaf9-TAP, Swr1-TAP, Swc4-TAP, and Esa1-TAP and immunoblotting with an antibody against Bdf1p. Bdf1p associated with Swr1-TAP, Yaf9-TAP, and Swc4-TAP but not with Esa1-TAP or untagged control material, supporting the assignment of Bdf1p as a subunit of SWR1-Com (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>SWR1-Com Selectively Associated with Histone H2A.Z Versus H2A</title><p>To determine whether subunits of SWR1-com associated specifically with H2A.Z or both H2A.Z and H2A, TAP-tagged versions of H2A.Z and H2A were purified from cells containing HA-tagged versions of the five different SWR1-Com components Swr1p, Swc2p, Swc3p, Swc4p, and Swc7p, and the nuclear import factor Kap114p. The composition of the copurifying material was then evaluated by immunoblotting with antibodies against the HA tag, Bdf1p, and Tra1p. Yaf9-TAP served as a positive control for recovery of SWR1-Com and NuA4.</p><p>H2A.Z associated with a substantial fraction of the SWR1-Com as judged by the comparable intensity of the signal for SWR1-Com subunits in the material copurified with H2A.Z-TAP and Yaf9-TAP, whereas no NuA4 copurified with H2A.Z-TAP based upon the absence of Tra1p in the H2A.Z-TAP sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, histone H2A copurified with only trace amounts of Swc2-HA, Swc3-HA, Swc4-HA, Swc7-HA, and Bdf1p and with virtually no Swr1-HA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Kap114-HA associated with both H2A.Z-TAP and H2A-TAP but not Yaf9-TAP, suggesting that it did not discriminate canonical and variant H2A. Hence, based on the apparent relative strength of the interactions, SWR1-Com (in contrast to Kap114-HA) associated primarily with H2A.Z, although weak affinity of SWR1-Com to H2A was possible. Furthermore, these experiments also supported the assignment of Swc3p and Swc7p to SWR1-Com despite peptides for these two proteins being present only in the initial Swr1-TAP and Swc4-TAP purifications.</p><p>Canonical H2A that is not bound to chromatin is usually found in a H2A/H2B dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Jackson1">Jackson 1987</xref>). The presence of H2B in the SWR1-Com was investigated by purifying SWR1-Com from strains containing H2A.Z-HA and H2B-HA. SWR1-Com contained H2A.Z-HA and also H2B-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). These data raised the possibility that this complex used H2A.Z/H2B dimers as a substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Similar Gene Expression Profiles of <italic>htz1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>swr1</italic>&#x00394; Cells</title><p>To determine the extent to which the role of H2A.Z depends upon SWR1-Com function, genome-wide transcription profiles of <italic>swr1</italic>&#x00394; cells were compared to the profiles of <italic>htz1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Meneghini1">Meneghini et al. 2003</xref>).

We first examined HA3-H2A.Z levels at two chromosomal regions where H2A.Z prevents the spread of Sir-dependent silencing: one flanking the silent mating locus <italic>HMR</italic> and another near the telomere on the right arm of chromosome XIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). In wild type, H2A.Z was present at levels similar to those described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g007">Figure 7</xref>B); HA3-H2A.Z was depleted from the silenced <italic>HMR</italic> locus and enriched in the flanking euchromatic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).

These data were consistent with Swr1p being essential for the deposition of H2A.Z in the <italic>HMR</italic> region and near the right telomere of chromosome XIV. However, because the ChIP measurements were normalized to the <italic>PRP8</italic> locus, we considered the possibility that a uniform amount of HA3-H2A.Z remained at all chromosomal loci examined in the mutant, for instance if there was a specific increase in the association of HA3-H2A.Z with the <italic>PRP8</italic> locus rather than a decrease at all other loci. This possibility was discounted by the approximately 13-fold mean decrease in the ratio of DNA obtained from the pellet versus whole cell fractions in <italic>swr1</italic>&#x00394; cells relative to wild type, indicating a substantial defect in the absolute chromatin association of HA3-H2A.Z in cells lacking Swr1p.</p><p>H2A.Z is also deposited at several loci that are not near silenced regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Meneghini1">Meneghini et al. 2003</xref>). The function of H2A.Z at these regions is unknown. To determine if Swr1p was also required for H2A.Z deposition at such loci, we examined H2A.Z levels at 12 euchromatic regions on chromosome III that each displayed some level of deposition of HA3-H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). These loci were identified in a comprehensive study of H2A.Z deposition on chromosome III (M.D.M., M. Bao, H.D.M., unpublished data). As with the regions examined above, the relative ChIP enrichment of HA3-H2A.Z approached one at each of these loci in the absence of Swr1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g008">Figure 8</xref>B), and the absolute amount of DNA precipitated from these loci showed a large decrease in the <italic>swr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant (data not shown). Thus, Swr1p was broadly required for the deposition of HA3-H2A.Z, even in regions distant from silenced domains. It is worth noting that for several of the loci examined in the <italic>swr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, the ChIP enrichment was significantly less than one, suggesting that there may exist some residual deposition of HA3-H2A.Z at the <italic>PRP8</italic> locus in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>NuA4 Function Was Required for SWR1-Com to Support Cell Growth</title><p>The sharing of four proteins between the SWR1-Com and NuA4 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g001">Figure 1</xref>) raised the possibility that SWR1-Com was functionally linked to NuA4, which is the major HAT for histones H4 and H2A. Initial purifications from Yaf9-TAP and Swc4-TAP strains suggested that the protein encoded by the nonessential gene <italic>YDR359C</italic> was a subunit of NuA4, consistent with some earlier results from high-throughput studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Gavin1">Gavin et al. 2002</xref>). Initial efforts to fuse a triple HA-tag to the carboxy-terminus of <italic>YDR359C</italic> were unsuccessful, but we noticed that all proteins encoded by <italic>YDR359C</italic> orthologs from the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> sensu strictu strains had a carboxy-terminal extension of approximately 22 amino acids, suggesting a possible error in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> sequence. Therefore, we chose to integrate a triple HA-tag at the chromosomal location that corresponded to the second-to-last codon of the sensu strictu strains and found that this version was now successfully tagged. Recently, a revised copy of <italic>YDR359C</italic> with the stop codon at the location we chose was deposited in GenBank and named <italic>EAF1</italic>. Therefore, we used this name here rather than a previously assigned name for the shorter version of <italic>YDR359C.</italic> Eaf1p contained a SANT domain as well as an HSA domain that is associated with SANT domains and found in helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Letunic1">Letunic et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>Analytical-scale affinity purifications showed that Eaf1-HA, similar to Tra1p, copurified with Yaf9-TAP, Swc4-Tap, and Esa1-TAP but not with H2A.Z-TAP and Swr1-TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g009">Figure 9</xref>A).

This was based on the reduced signal in immunoblot experiments obtained with an antibody directed against tetra-acetylated H4. Similar experiments with antibodies directed against individual acetylated residues revealed that the H4 acetylation defect of strains lacking <italic>EAF1</italic> was most profound on K8 and K12 of H4, whereas K5 and K16 of H4 were less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). Similarly, K9 of H2A did not have a strong acetylation defect in any of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). The physical association and the H4 acetylation defects provided independent evidence that Eaf1p was a subunit of NuA4.</p><p>To explore genetic links between SWR1-Com and NuA4, phenotypic and double mutant analyses were performed.

The <italic>eaf1</italic>&#x00394; strains were also slow growing whereas the other strains were not. All mutant strains tested were sensitive to the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) and the microtubule poison benomyl and to caffeine and formamide, reagents that elicit a number of cellular responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g010">Figure 10</xref>A). Strains lacking <italic>HTZ1</italic> and <italic>YAF9</italic> were comparably sensitive to HU and formamide, but <italic>htz1</italic>&#x00394; strains were more sensitive to benomyl and caffeine.

In contrast, the studies described here identified a novel complex, referred to as SWR1-Com, whose putative ATPase, Swr1p, promoted the deposition of the histone H2A variant, H2A.Z, into chromatin in vivo.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>SWR1-Com, a Multisubunit Complex, Associated Specifically with H2A.Z</title><p>SWR1-Com was identified by its specific association with H2A.Z. SWR1-Com consisted of 13 subunits: six were only found in SWR1-Com, four were shared between SWR1-Com and NuA4, and four were shared between SWR1-Com and the Ino80 complex. Two subunits, Arp4 and actin, were in all three complexes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020131-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Several of the subunits of SWR1-Com contained motifs highly suggestive of a role for this complex in affecting chromatin structure.

The weak interactions between SWR1-Com subunits and H2A relative to those between SWR1-Com subunits and H2A.Z suggested that the role of SWR1-Com was dedicated to those chromatin structures enriched for H2A.Z. This was further supported by the association of H2B-HA along with H2A.Z-HA with highly purified SWR1-Com, suggesting that this histone dimer was the physiological substrate for activity of SWR1-Com.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Genome-Wide Expression Profiles and Phenotypic Analysis Identified Functional Links between H2A.Z and SWR1-Com</title><p>Similarities between the consequences of disruptions of SWR1-Com function and loss of H2A.Z protein implied that SWR1-Com was required for H2A.Z function.

Comparison of the genome-wide expression profiles of <italic>swr1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>htz1</italic>&#x00394; strains also revealed similar responses to loss of either function at many loci.

Because the majority of gene expression defects seen in <italic>swr1</italic>&#x00394; cells also occurred in <italic>htz1</italic>&#x00394; cells, the role of Swr1p, and presumably SWR1-Com, was predominantly in promoting the function of H2A.Z.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>H2A.Z Deposition into Chromatin was Promoted by SWR1-Com</title><p>SWR1-Com promoted the deposition of H2A.Z into chromatin.

Therefore, Swr1p was required for enrichment of H2A.Z at a wide variety of loci, including those distal to silent regions.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggested that Swr1p and presumably SWR1-Com play direct roles in H2A.Z deposition into chromatin. Foremost in favor of this view is the tight physical association of H2A.Z with SWR1-Com in whole cell extracts. Additionally, Swr1p, and other members of SWR1-Com, had sequence motifs found in proteins acting in chromatin and were localized in the nucleus. In particular, the Bdf1 protein via its bromodomains might be responsible for the recruitment of SWR1-Com to deposit H2A.Z to euchromatic regions, which are generally characterized by acetylation of the H4 tail. Lastly, the profound defect of <italic>swr1</italic>&#x00394; cells in H2A.Z deposition, and the established actions of the Swi2/Snf2 family members directly on nucleosomes, provided further support for a direct role of Swr1p and SWR1-Com in H2A.Z deposition.</p><p>Several observations were consistent with a small amount of H2A.Z deposition in chromatin in cells lacking Swr1p function.

Perhaps in the absence of SWR1-Com, some H2A.Z is deposited by the same mechanisms responsible for the bulk deposition of H2A.

While the sharing of subunits between different protein complexes is not unprecedented, it may reflect highly related functions, rather than vagaries of chance and circumstance in evolution. This was supported by the functional overlap and genetic interactions between SWR1-Com and NuA4. The shared subunits may act as a core scaffold, upon which the unique subunits can be assembled and exchanged during a cycle of chromatin modification. This notion finds some support in the existence of a mini-NuA4 complex, known as piccolo NuA4, which contains only some of those subunits that are unique to NuA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Boudreault1">Boudreault et al. 2003</xref>). Shared subunits of SWR1-Com could coordinate the recruitment of an analogous mini-SWR1-Com to achieve histone subunit replacement, with the replacement of mini-SWR1-Com by piccolo NuA4 to achieve the acetylation of the newly reconstituted nucleosome. This model could explain why two subunits of NuA4 (Tra1 and Epl1p) were detected in the H2A.Z-associated material under low stringency conditions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020131-t001">Table 1</xref>). Alternatively, the acetylation of H2A by NuA4 may facilitate its replacement by H2A.Z. Other orders of action involving the SWR1-Com, NuA4, and Ino80-C complex are also possible, such as acetylation of H2A.Z by NuA4 being a prerequisite for its exchange by SWR1-Com. Other potential roles for the sharing of subunits include targeting complexes to common locations or promoting their biogenesis or assembly. Our data may resolve an interesting paradox concerning the localization of Bdf1p on chromatin. Earlier work showed that Bdf1p is a subunit of TFIID, yet Bdf1p was found in regions where TATA box binding protein, the core subunit of TFIID, was not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020131-Matangkasombut1">Matangkasombut and Buratowski 2003</xref>).

Not all proteins identified by mass spectrometry were clearly visible on the gel. Arrows point to proteins that were common to the Swr1-TAP and Yaf9-TAP purifications, whereas stars point to proteins that were found only in the Yaf9-TAP purifications as judged by visual inspection and comparison of protein sizes with the data deduced from mass spectrometry. The vertical bar indicates that proteins in that area of the gel could not be clearly resolved.</p><p>(B) Domain structure of SWR1-Com.
