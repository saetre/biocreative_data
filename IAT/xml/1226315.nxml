For activity, Cdks require association with a cyclin and phosphorylation by a Cdk activating kinase (CAK) at a conserved threonine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Each phase of the cell cycle is characterized by the expression of different Cdk/cyclin complexes that phosphorylate and regulate downstream substrates. In vertebrates, Cdk4/6/cyclin D complexes are active throughout the G1 phase, Cdk2/cyclin E at the G1/S boundary, Cdk2/cyclin A during S phase and Cdk1/cyclin A and Cdk1/cyclin B during the G2/M transition. Studies using knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) revealed that neither Cdk2 nor cyclin E is essential for mitotic cell division. Cyclin E seems to be important for the control of endoreplication and for quiescent cells which re-enter in cell cycle. Furthermore, Cdk2 is essential in the regulation of the meiotic cell cycle, suggesting a novel tissue-specific function for cyclins and Cdks.</p><p>Human DNA polymerase (Pol) &#x003bb; belongs to the Pol X family based on sequence homology with Pol &#x003b2;, Pol &#x003bc; and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Pol &#x003bb; contains a nuclear localization signal (residues 1&#x02013;35), a BRCA1 C-terminal domain (BRCT, residue 36&#x02013;132), a proline-serine-rich region (residues 133&#x02013;243) and a Pol &#x003b2;-like core region (residues 244&#x02013;575). Pol &#x003bb; has been well characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> and it possesses four different enzymatic activities: DNA polymerase, terminal transferase, deoxyribose phosphate lyase and polynucleotide synthetase, all localized in its C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). On the basis of its biochemical properties, Pol &#x003bb; has been proposed to be involved in various DNA repair pathways, such as abasic site translesion DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), repair of oxidative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and non-homologous end joining of double strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). In addition, Pol &#x003bb; has been shown to interact with the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and with the DNA repair protein ligase IV/XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Mapping of Pol &#x003bb; interaction with PCNA identified a helix&#x02013;hairpin&#x02013;helix motif localized in its Pol &#x003b2;-like core region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The major sites of interaction between PCNA and many of its partners are the interdomain connecting loop (ID-loop) (amino acids 121&#x02013;132) and the facing hydrophobic pocket (amino acids 42&#x02013;46) of PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). We have recently shown that residues 43&#x02013;45 of the hydrophobic pocket are also essential for the interaction with Pol &#x003bb; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In addition, residues 125&#x02013;128 of the ID-loop also play an important role in stabilizing this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Furthermore, interaction of Pol &#x003bb; with PCNA has also been demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). On the other hand, the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of Pol &#x003bb; is so far poorly understood. To better understand the Pol &#x003bb; function, we searched by affinity chromatography for novel partners. We identified the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 as novel partner of Pol &#x003bb;. Pol &#x003bb; is a substrate for phosphorylation by several Cdk/cyclin complexes <italic>in vitro</italic> and its proline-serine-rich domain is the target of phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Pol &#x003bb; by Cdk2/cyclin A is decreased upon interaction of Pol &#x003bb; with PCNA. Finally, we demonstrated that Pol &#x003bb; is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and this phosphorylation is regulated during the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>[<sup>&#x003b3;-32</sup>P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol) and unlabeled ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, DNA oligonucleotides from Microsynth Gmbh (Balgach, Switzerland).

His-Pol &#x003bb; or BSA were covalently bound on HiTrap NHS-activated Sepharose HP columns. Total extracts of HeLa cells were prepared as described in Materials and Methods and loaded in parallel onto the two affinity columns. Bound proteins were eluted successively by 150, 350 and 750 mM NaCl. The purification was carried out essentially by following the PCNA elution, a protein known to interact with Pol &#x003bb; <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The elution profiles of BSA and Pol &#x003bb; are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Proteins binding unspecifically were eluted in peak 1 at low NaCl concentrations from the Pol &#x003bb; and the BSA columns. Two additional peaks were exclusively present in the Pol &#x003bb; column elution. They contained proteins eluted at higher NaCl concentration, suggesting that they interact specifically with Pol &#x003bb;. The eluted fractions were tested by western blot by using different antibodies. We first confirmed that, as expected, PCNA specifically bound to the Pol &#x003bb; column (data not shown). Next, we found that the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 was eluted in peak 2 (fractions 24&#x02013;28) from the Pol &#x003bb; column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas it bound only unspecifically to the BSA column (peak 1). We further confirmed this interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> by a His pull-down experiment. For this, GST-Cdk2 was incubated with His-Pol &#x003bb; bound to Ni-beads or with Ni-beads alone as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Western blot analysis against Cdk2 showed a specific co-precipitation of Pol &#x003bb; with Cdk2, suggesting a direct interaction of these two proteins. Finally, the interaction was tested <italic>in vivo</italic> by immunoprecipitation. Anti-Cdk2 or control IgG bound to protein G-Sepharose was incubated with HeLa cells total extracts. After immunoprecipitation, western blot against Pol &#x003bb; showed that Pol &#x003bb; was co-immunoprecipitated with Cdk2 only when the anti-Cdk2 antibody was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In summary, these results indicate that Cdk2 can physically interact with Pol &#x003bb; <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA polymerase &#x003bb; is phosphorylated by the Cdk2/cyclin E, Cdk2/cyclin A and Cdk1/cyclin A complexes <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Next, we searched for potential Cdk phosphorylation sites in the amino acid sequence of Pol &#x003bb;. We found three serines (amino acids 167, 177 and 230, respectively) which could be part of consensus sites for Cdk phosphorylation. They are all located in the proline-serine-rich domain of Pol &#x003bb;. These sites are specific to Pol &#x003bb;, since they do not occur in the sequence of any of the other Pol X family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In order to verify whether Pol &#x003bb; could be a substrate for Cdk-dependent phosphorylation, kinase assays with different Cdk/cyclin complexes were performed in the presence of recombinant Pol &#x003bb; and [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, a [<sup>32</sup>P]labeled band of the expected molecular weight for Pol &#x003bb; appeared after incubation with the Cdk2/cyclin E, Cdk2/cyclin A and Cdk1/cyclin A complexes. Histone H1 was used as a positive control. The identity of the phosphorylated band with Pol &#x003bb; was confirmed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and immunoblot analysis (data not shown, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>, left panel). In summary, these results suggest that Pol &#x003bb; is a target for phosphorylation by these three Cdk/cyclin complexes <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>The proline-serine-rich domain of DNA polymerase &#x003bb; is the target of phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A</title><p>In order to map the phosphorylation domains of Pol &#x003bb;, kinase assays were performed by using deletion mutants of Pol &#x003bb; (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> (left panel) shows a Coomassie staining of the samples after the phosphorylation reaction separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. The same gel was then exposed to an X-ray film to reveal the phosphorylated products.

This result supported our findings that the three potential sites of phosphorylation are located in the proline-serine-rich domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and suggested that this domain of Pol &#x003bb; is the target for Cdk2/cyclin A.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation of DNA polymerase &#x003bb; does not affect its polymerase activity and is regulated by its interaction with PCNA</title><p>Furthermore, the effect of Pol &#x003bb; phosphorylation on its polymerase activity was tested. For this, His-Pol &#x003bb; was phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by Cdk2/cyclin A in the presence of ATP. Preliminary experiments showed that the degree of Pol &#x003bb; phosphorylation was between 56 and 84% considering that it can be phosphorylated on one to three sites (see Materials and Methods). This suggested that any effect due to phosphorylation of Pol &#x003bb; could be visualized by the sensitive method of product analysis. As negative controls, His-Pol &#x003bb; was either incubated in the presence of Cdk2/cyclin A without ATP, or in the presence of ATP without Cdk2/cyclin A. The Pol &#x003bb; polymerase activity was then tested on a 5&#x02032;-labeled d17:d73mer primer-template and the elongation products were visualized on a polyacrylamide denaturating gel. DNA synthesis by Pol &#x003bb; was stimulated when it was incubated with ATP, either alone (lanes 7&#x02013;9) or in combination with Cdk2/cyclin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3), compared with the reactions where ATP was omitted (lanes 4&#x02013;6, lanes 10&#x02013;12). Stimulation was greater when Pol &#x003bb; was incubated in the presence of ATP alone (lanes 7&#x02013;9), suggesting that the observed stimulation was rather due to the presence of ATP than to phosphorylation. This effect could be explained by the fact that Pol &#x003bb;, similarly to Pol &#x000b5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), is able to incorporate ribonucleotides opposite a DNA template (K. Ramadan and U. H&#x000fc;bscher, unpublished data). In this case, ATP could be used as a nucleotide substrate by Pol &#x003bb;, thus explaining the increased product elongation observed upon addition of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;9). Moreover, the slight decrease in the effect of ATP in the presence of Cdk2/cyclin A may be due to its consumption occurring upon Pol &#x003bb; phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). From these results, we concluded that phosphorylation of Pol &#x003bb; by Cdk2/cyclin A does not directly affect its polymerase activity. In addition, by testing the effect of phosphorylation on Pol &#x003bb; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity, we showed that phosphorylation did not affect this activity (data not shown).</p><p>Since Pol &#x003bb; and PCNA have been shown to interact <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), and PCNA is known to interact with Cdk/cyclin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), we next tested the effect of PCNA on phosphorylation of Pol &#x003bb;. Incubation of Pol &#x003bb; with PCNA during phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A <italic>in vitro</italic> resulted in a decrease in Pol &#x003bb; phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, upper panel). However, when the same experiment was performed by using the SHV43 PCNA mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), no decrease of the Pol &#x003bb; phosphorylation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lower panel). In both cases, Pol &#x003bb; phosphorylation was abolished by addition of the specific Cdk inhibitor p21, confirming that phosphorylation was due to Cdk2/cyclin A. It has been shown that the PCNA mutant SHV43, in which the residues S43, H44 and V45 in the hydrophobic pocket on the C-side of the trimer were changed to A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), is no more able to interact with Pol &#x003bb; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) but can still bind Cdk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Thus, this result suggested that the physical interaction of PCNA with Pol &#x003bb; prevented phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin A, suggesting a possible regulation of the Pol &#x003bb; phosphorylation status via its interaction with PCNA.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA polymerase &#x003bb; is phosphorylated during the cell cycle</title><p>Having shown that Pol &#x003bb; can be phosphorylated by Cdk/cyclin complexes <italic>in vitro</italic>, the next step was to test whether Pol &#x003bb; is phosphorylated during the cell cycle. For this, HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S transition by double thymidine block, and subsequently released in normal medium. Samples were collected at four different time points: 3 h (corresponding to mid-S phase), 6 h (late S phase), 9 h (G2 phase) and 12 h (G2/M phase). Synchronization in M phase was performed by treatment of the cells with nocodazole. Cells released in normal medium progressed in G1 phase and were collected after 4 h. Synchronization was confirmed on total extracts by western blot using antibodies against cyclin A, a specific marker of S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lower panel). A western blot against Pol &#x003bb; using cell extracts from synchronized cells revealed the presence of two forms of Pol &#x003bb;, represented by a faster and a slower migrating band, throughout the cell cycle. In S phase, the faster migrating band was more abundant, whereas in late G2 and M phases, only the slower migrating band could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, upper panel). To verify that these two different forms of Pol &#x003bb; were due to phosphorylation, we treated a total extract of S phase HeLa cells with bacteriophage &#x003bb;-phosphatase. In the presence of the phosphatase only one form of Pol &#x003bb; was visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 1), corresponding to the faster migrating form, as revealed by comparison with reaction without phosphatase (lane 2) or in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (lane 3), suggesting that Pol &#x003bb; is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and that its phosphorylation status is modulated during cell cycle.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In our efforts to better understand the Pol &#x003bb; function, we searched for partners by affinity chromatography and we found Cdk2 as a novel interacting partner of Pol &#x003bb;. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of Pol &#x003bb; revealed the presence of three potential phosphorylation sites (S167, S177 and S230) for Cdk in its proline-serine-rich domain and we showed that this domain is the target of phosphorylation of Pol &#x003bb; by the Cdk2/cyclin A complex. This finding is not unexpected, since in other proteins proline-rich domains have been shown to be targets of post-translational modifications and to be involved in the regulation of protein function. Moreover, we found that Pol &#x003bb; is phosphorylated during the cell cycle and exists in two forms in S phase with a majority of hypophosphorylated form, whereas it is present exclusively in its hyperphosphorylated form from G2 to M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The different phosphorylation status of Pol &#x003bb; could be linked with different Pol &#x003bb; functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, Pol &#x003bb; is mainly present in the hypophosphorylated form in the S phase of the cell cycle when PCNA is also abundant. This is in agreement with our findings that the presence of PCNA reduces Pol &#x003bb; phosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic> and suggests that this regulation may also happen <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In terms of physiological role, it has been shown that PCNA stimulated translesion synthesis of Pol &#x003bb; past an abasic site as it did for Pol &#x003b9;, Pol &#x003ba; and Pol &#x003b7; but by a different mechanism of interaction. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the interplay among Cdk2/cyclin A, PCNA and Pol &#x003bb;, revealed by our study, might act in regulating the &#x02018;switch&#x02019; between the replicative Pol &#x003b4; an the translesion Pol &#x003bb; through direct competition for PCNA, yielding to elongation of the nascent DNA strand past abasic sites. This model was supported by the finding that Pol &#x003bb; interacts with PCNA at the same site as Pol &#x003b4; and many other partners and that PCNA could promote bypass of abasic sites during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Moreover, we showed that phosphorylation of Pol &#x003bb; does not influence its polymerase activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of Pol &#x003bb; rather regulates its interaction with cellular factors (e.g. PCNA) than its intrinsic activity.</p><p>In summary, our results allow to hypothesize that regulation of Pol &#x003bb; phosphorylation by PCNA during the cell cycle may be important in modulating the interaction of Pol &#x003bb; with other protein partners, or its recruitment to specific sites on chromatin. The effect of Cdk/cyclin phosphorylation on several replication proteins has been studied and seems to be specific for each protein [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>)]. For example, phosphorylation has an inhibitory or stimulatory effect on the activity on Pol &#x003b1; depending on which Cdk/cyclin complexes phosphorylate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). In other cases, phosphorylation has been shown to regulate interaction between proteins, such as Fen 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) or DNA ligase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), with PCNA. In addition, phosphorylation of replication protein A (RP-A) by Cdk1/cyclin A and Cdk1/cyclin B in late S phase leads to the dissociation of the RP-A trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p><p>The interaction between Cdk2 and Pol &#x003bb; also fits with the proposed role of Pol &#x003bb; in non-homologous end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). In fact, Cdk2 has been recently shown to regulate DNA DSB repair when associated to cyclin A1. Cyclin A1 is a second A-type cyclin abundantly expressed in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Since Pol &#x003bb; is also known to be abundant in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) one could propose a role of Pol &#x003bb; in DSB repair in germ cells. Additional observations of Cdk2 localization at the telomeric ends of chromosome from leptotene to diplotene stage of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) could support a role of Pol &#x003bb; by its terminal transferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) in germ cells. In addition, our data are supported by the recent findings that Pol &#x003bb; is selectively involved in NHEJ processing DNA with complementary overhangs, which occur upon DNA damage, whereas Pol &#x000b5; seems to be mainly involved in NHEJ of DNA with non-complementary ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). In this context, phosphorylation of Pol &#x003bb; may be one of the factors influencing selectively the recruitment of Pol &#x003bb; on places where its activity is needed.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed for the first time that Pol &#x003bb; is post-translationally modified in human cells, and that this modification is regulated during the cell cycle, opening a way for a better understanding of the Pol &#x003bb; function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank L.

The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer and the samples were loaded on a 7.5% SDS&#x02013;PAGE and analyzed by western blot with antibodies against Pol &#x003bb; and tubulin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki845f5"/></fig></sec></back></article>
