Its genome is composed of two circular DNA elements, one of 2,006,217 bp (referred to as the chromosome) and one of 919,596 bp (referred to as the megaplasmid). Strikingly, though few standard housekeeping genes are found on the megaplasmid, it does encode a complete system for chemotaxis including both chemosensory components and an entire flagellar apparatus. This is the first known example of a complete flagellar system being encoded on a plasmid and suggests a straightforward means for lateral transfer of flagellum-based motility. Phylogenomic analyses support the recent rRNA-based analyses that led to <italic>T. roseum</italic> being removed from the phylum <italic>Thermomicrobia</italic> and assigned to the phylum <italic>Chloroflexi</italic>. Because <italic>T. roseum</italic> is a deep-branching member of this phylum, analysis of its genome provides insights into the evolution of the <italic>Chloroflexi</italic>. In addition, even though this species is not photosynthetic, analysis of the genome provides some insight into the origins of photosynthesis in the <italic>Chloroflexi</italic>. Metabolic pathway reconstructions and experimental studies revealed new aspects of the biology of this species. For example, we present evidence that <italic>T. roseum</italic> oxidizes CO aerobically, making it the first thermophile known to do so. In addition, we propose that glycosylation of its carotenoids plays a crucial role in the adaptation of the cell membrane to this bacterium's thermophilic lifestyle. Analyses of published metagenomic sequences from two hot springs similar to the one from which this strain was isolated, show that close relatives of <italic>T. roseum</italic> DSM 5159 are present but have some key differences from the strain sequenced.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the publication of the first complete genome sequence of a free-living organism in 1995 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004207-Fleischmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, genome sequence databases have grown at a staggering rate. However, despite the abundance of complete genome data currently available, a lack of phylogenetic diversity is evident.

In particular, although both elements contain one rRNA operon, the megaplasmid contains only three of the 46 tRNAs and encodes few standard &#x0201c;housekeeping&#x0201d; proteins (e.g., ribosomal proteins, subunits of the RNA and DNA polymerases). Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of the few homologs of housekeeping proteins encoded on the megaplasmid indicate that, unlike those encoded in the chromosome, they tend to not group with genes from other members of the <italic>Chloroflexi</italic> (see section on megaplasmid evolution below). Nevertheless, some important functions are encoded on the megaplasmid (see the section on flagella, below).</p><p>The nucleotide composition of the chromosome was analyzed by both a chi square test of trinucleotides and the CompostBin principal component-based method (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). These analyses revealed three regions that are markedly different in composition compared to the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004207-g001">Figures 1</xref>&#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004207-g002">2</xref>). Two of these are relatively short segments (18 kb and 11 kb) of very high G&#x0002b;C content (73&#x00025;) that are separated by a run of approximately 50 kb of relatively normal composition. These high G&#x0002b;C regions contain homologs of numerous genes that likely are either derived from phage such as phage domain protein trd_1586 and phage structural protein trd_1644, or encode phage-related activities (e.g., a peptidase trd_1587 and an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase trd_1647 thought to be used by phage to break links in bacterial cell walls). Therefore, we propose that these two regions of anomalous composition represent prophage relics. The third anomalous region was identified by the low complexity of its base sequence and by its relatively low G&#x0002b;C content (55&#x00025;). It was found to contain clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) which are implicated as a phage-resistance system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004207-Makarova1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004207-Barrangou1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The megaplasmid also contains a 7.5 kb region of highly anomalous composition (71&#x00025; G&#x0002b;C), but efforts to pinpoint its origin were inconclusive.</p><fig id="pone-0004207-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004207.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Analysis of nucleotide composition variations within the <italic>T. roseum</italic> chromosome and megaplasmid.</title><p>Hexamer frequencies were extracted from 20,000 random 4 kb fragments from the whole genome and analyzed using CompostBin, a PCA-based method.

Of course, it is possible that genes were co-opted from other functions and then that all of these genes were lost from non-photosynthetic species like <italic>T. roseum</italic>. However, it seems more likely that some other theory must explain the presence of photosynthesis in the FAPs. The two main possibilities that remain are acquisition of all the genes required for photosynthesis from other lineages after the <italic>Chloroflexi</italic> branch separated from <italic>T. roseum</italic> or the presence of photosynthesis in the ancestor of the whole phyla and then the loss of this process and all of the genes involved from non photosynthetic species.</p><p>We note that we also do not find any relics of the carbon fixation pathways of photosynthetic <italic>Chloroflexi</italic> in the non-photosynthetic ones.

In addition, the genome helps serve as a reference for environmental studies of communities where relatives of this strain are present.</p><p>However, this organism was selected for genome sequencing more because of its phylogenetic novelty and not its biology <italic>per se</italic>. Thus, it is important to consider whether such phylogenetically driven genome sequencing is as we expected of value beyond just in aiding studies of a particular organism. On the one hand and in retrospect, this organism was not as phylogenetically novel as we had hoped. This indicates that future phylogenetically driven sequencing projects should probably use the rRNA tree of life directly rather than assignment of organisms to taxonomic groups. Nevertheless, this organism is still distantly related from other organisms for which genomes are available. This distance is important for two reasons. Firstly, it allows the genome to be used to address questions about large-scale evolutionary patterns such as the origin and evolution of the phylum <italic>Chloroflexi</italic> and the evolution of photosynthesis within this group. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, there are some novel features, which are consistent with phylogenetic uniqueness, present in the genome of this organism. For example, this is the first species known to encode all the genes for chemotaxis (including those for motility) on a plasmid. If one's goal is to discover novel features in organisms, certainly sequencing organisms from branches of the tree of life that have not yet been sampled seems to be a good approach. Of course, one cannot always find novelty simply by scanning a genome sequence. However, having a genome sequence from a novel organism is a good way to launch experimental studies of that organism and its relatives which in turn will help identify what novel features they possess.</p><p>As of now, there are still hundreds of major branches in the bacterial tree of life that have no genome sequences available for any member. The same is generally true for archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. We believe that obtaining such genomes is a critical need in order to broaden our understanding of the diversity and evolution of life on this planet.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The annotated genome data reported here is available in Genbank under accession IDs CP001275 (the chromosome) and CP001276 (the megaplasmid).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Genome sequencing and annotation</title><p>Genomic DNA was isolated from exponential-phase cultures of <italic>T. roseum</italic> strain DSM5159.
