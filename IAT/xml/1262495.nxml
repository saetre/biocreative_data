Arch Biochem Biophys 338: 90-96). Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase catalyses the sulfation of a variety of secretory and membrane proteins and is believed to be present only in the cell. In the present study, this enzyme was identified for the first time in human saliva. Analysis of human saliva and parotid saliva for the presence of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase revealed tyrosine sulfating activity displayed by both whole saliva and parotid saliva at pH optimum of 6.8. In contrast to tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase isolated from submandibular salivary glands, salivary enzyme does not require the presence of Triton X-100, NaF and 5'AMP for maximal activity. Similar to the submandibular TPST, the enzyme from saliva also required MnCl<sub>2</sub> for its activity. Maximum TPST activity was observed at 20mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>. The enzyme from saliva was immunoprecipitated and purified by immunoaffinity column using anti-TPST antibody. Affinity purified salivary TPST showed a single band of 50-54 kDa. This study is the first report characterizing a tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase in a secretory fluid.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase</kwd><kwd>human saliva</kwd><kwd>Purification</kwd><kwd>Affinity Chromatography</kwd><kwd>Anti- tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase antibody</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Tyrosine sulfation, a posttranslational modification involved in the processing of secretory proteins, is the covalent attachment of sulfate to the hydroxyl group of the tyrosyl residues in peptides and proteins. O-sulfation of the tyrosine residues has been the subject of several studies on the posttranslational modification of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>. This modification occurs in the trans-Golgi, the compartment involved in the maturation and sorting of secretory proteins and peptides including cholecystokinin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, fibrinopeptide B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, gastrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> phyllokinin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, leucosulfakinin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, C4 complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, hirudin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> and chemokine receptor CCR5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>. Tyrosine sulfation in these proteins has been suggested to be essential for their biological activity, half-life, and secretion. Sulfation of tyrosyl residues in cholecystokinin is required for its optimal biological activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref> and in the case of hirudin, tyrosine sulfation increases the binding efficiency to thrombin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. In M31 hybridoma cell line, tyrosine sulfation has been shown to serve as a signal for the secretion of IgG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. In PSGL-1, tyrosine sulfation is required for its binding to p-selectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> and the tyrosine sulfation of CCR5 facilitates HIV-1 entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>. Although the significance of tyrosine sulfation in these and several other proteins has been studied in detail, its role in salivary protein is yet to be investigated.</p><p>Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase has been identified in numerous tissues including bovine adrenal medulla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, rat liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, gastric mucosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, submandibular salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> and platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>.

Parotid salivary flow was stimulated by means of confectionary which contained citric acid and tartaric acid. The saliva sample of about 10 ml was collected from parotid salivary glands by means of special devices. Protein concentration was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce chemical Co). Optimally diluted saliva samples were used for the tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase activity. </p></sec></sec><sec><title>Assay of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase</title><p>The tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase assay mixture contained the following components: acceptor, unsulfated EAY at concentrations indicated in text, 5 &#x000b5;M [<sup>35</sup>S]PAPS (400,000 cpm), 20 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM MES buffer pH 6.8 and saliva (50 &#x003bc;g protein) in a final volume of 50 &#x000b5;l. Assays were initiated by the addition of the enzyme and incubated for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. The reactions were stopped by spotting 35 &#x000b5;l aliquot of the reaction mixture on a 2.4 x 2.4 cm Whatman No. 3MM filter paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. The papers were washed three times for 15 min in 10% trichloroacetic acid/10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and rinsed 5 min in 95% ethanol. The dried papers were placed in vials containing scintillation solution and counted in a TriCarb-1500 scintillation counter.</p></sec><sec><title>SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis</title><p>Proteins were separated by electrophoresis by the method of Laemml <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>.

The stacking gel contained 3% acrylamide, bis(acrylamide) in the same ratio as before, 0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% ammonium persulfate, and 0.4% TEMED. Electrophoresis was performed in a Mighty Small gel apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA) at 4&#x000b0;C at a constant current of 20 mA per gel for approximately 1 h. Protein bands on the gels were visualized by silver staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot Procedure</title><p>Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred (20 V for 20 min) to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) by means of a Bio-Rad Semi Dry Transblot apparatus according to the procedure supplied by the Bio-Rad. The section of the nitrocellulose membrane containing the molecular weight standards was cut off and stained with Ponceau S in 45% methanol and 10% acetic acid and destained in water. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with bovine serum albumin (3% w/v). The blot was washed with Tris buffered saline (25 mM, pH 8.0) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA and incubated with IgG fraction of rabbit anti TPST antibody for an hour at room temperature. After washing the blot with wash buffer, the membrane was further incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:5000) for an hour. The substrate for alkaline phosphatase was consisted of the p-nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation</title><p>Immunoprecipitation of the TPST present in saliva was carried out in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes using TPST antibody, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. Briefly, different concentrations of immune and preimmune sera (1:1000 dilution) were added to 100 &#x000b5;l of saliva and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 4 h. After incubation, 30 &#x000b5;l of Protein A sepharose (25%) was added. Following overnight agitation at 4&#x000b0;C, Protein A sepharose beads bound to antigen-antibody complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was used for TPST assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of tyrosylprotein Sulfotransferase from saliva by Immuno affinity Chromatography</title><p>The IgG fraction of rabbit anti-TPST was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads. About 75 mg of IgG fraction was coupled to 7.5 ml CNBr-Sepharose 4B as described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref> and the beads were stored at 4<sup>o</sup>C with addition of preservative. The amount of protein coupled to beads was measured by estimating protein in the supernatant before and after coupling. Two ml beads were packed in a mini column and equilibrated with 20 mM MES pH 6.8. Five ml volumes of saliva was applied to the affinity column and equilibrated for 30 min. The column was washed with 10 volumes of equilibration buffer. The bound enzyme was eluted with Gly-HCl buffer pH 2.7 and pH was raised immediately with 1.0 M Tris. The fractions were further tested for the presence of enzyme by dot blotting. The enzyme activity was assayed and the purity of the enzyme was examined staining the polyacrylamide gels with silver.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>3. Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of TPST</title><p>The presence of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase activity was observed in human saliva using EAY as sulfate acceptor and [<sup>35</sup>S] PAPS as sulfate donor. The clear supernatant of normal and parotid saliva showed TPST activity. The tyrosine sulfation increased proportionately with increasing concentrations of saliva protein up to 25 &#x000b5;g (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The enzyme activity increased with increased incubation time up to 30 min and reached its maximum at 60 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The effect of pH on the EAY sulfation by human whole saliva and parotid saliva are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. Using the MES buffer, the pH optimum for the sulfation of EAY by the two enzymes was found to be 6.8 and significant activity was also observed in parotid saliva at pH 5.5. In the absence of MnCl<sub>2</sub>, minimal sulfation of EAY was detected. Optimum enzyme activity was detected at 20 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>)</p><p>The direct effect of increasing concentrations (0.025%-0.25%) of Triton X-100 concentrations on the activity of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase was studied. No change in the enzyme activity was observed at various concentrations of Triton X-100 (data not shown). Since the enzyme present in saliva was not membrane bound, tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase sulfation of EAY was not altered in the presence of detergent. Requirements of metal ions for tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase of human whole saliva is given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Of the metals examined at 20 mM, Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2</sup> were able to stimulate tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase activity, where as Mg<sup>2+</sup> exhibited around 50% of the stimulation attained with Mn<sup>2+</sup> and EDTA inhibited the enzyme activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation</title><p>The polyclonal TPST antibodies were also tested for their ability to immunoprecipitate the TPST in the saliva. Antibodies were incubated with the saliva and coupled to protein A Sepharose beads. After centrifugation, presence of the TPST activity was determined in the supernatant by enzyme assay. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, with increasing concentration of TPST antiserum in the immunoprecipitated sample, the supernatant showed decreased TPST activity. Almost 80% of the activity was immunoprecipitated with 50 &#x000b5;l of a 1:1000 dilution of antiserum, when compared with the preimmune serum.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of TPST from Human saliva</title><p>Purification of TPST to homogeneity from saliva was achieved by immunoaffinity column chromatography. This method resulted in a 25, 071-fold increase in tyrosine sulfating activity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The purified enzyme exhibited protein band of 50-54 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A) and on immunoblots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B) similar to the enzyme obtained from submandibular salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. The 3, 389-fold purification of tyrosine sulfating activity from human saliva to near homogeneity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) differs from the 140, 000 and 25, 358-fold purification required for adrenal and rat submandibular salivary gland enzyme, respectively, suggesting that saliva represent a better enriched source of this enzyme.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Sulfation represents an important mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic> for the biotransformation and excretion of a variety of proteins. Upon sulfation some proteins undergo changes in their biological activities to fulfill particular biochemical and physiological needs. Since the first description of a TPST activity, the enzyme has been reported in various tissues in bovine adrenal medulla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, and PC12 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>. However, there are no reports of its presence in secretion. In this paper, the existence of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase activity was demonstrated in human whole saliva and parotid saliva using <sup>35</sup>S-PAPS as co-substrate for sulfation. Using the acidic, synthetic polymer, poly Glu<sub>6</sub>, Ala<sub>3</sub>, Tyr<sub>1</sub> (EAY), Domiano and Roth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> demonstrated a fairly wide-tissue distribution of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase in the rat. Later, Sundaram <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> have characterized the enzyme present in the rat submandibular salivary glands. Some of the properties of human salivary tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase described here appear to be similar to those reported earlier for this enzyme in other rat tissues. As shown in the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the human salivary tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase exhibited optimum pH at 6.8, which is similar to sulfotransferase reported in rat submandibular salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> and other rat tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>. However, the enzyme isolated from rat submandibular salivary glands displayed pH optimum of 6.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> and the pH optimum observed for rat brain was 5.8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. The solubilized enzyme from adrenal medulla has a pH optimum between 6.0 and 6.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>. Human salivary tyrosylprotein sulfotranferase activity was stimulated by the divalent cations Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and partially by Mg<sup>2+</sup> and was inhibited by EDTA. The enzymatic activity mediating the sulfation of proteins in PC12 cell was stimulated by the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> and inhibited by EDTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>. Both Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> were equally effective in activating EAY sulfation by bovine adrenal medulla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> and rat cerebral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, where as Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup> stimulated rat liver tyrosylprotein sulfotrasferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. In contrast, sulfation of an endogenous membrane protein in A431 cell was not inhibited by EDTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>.</p><p>Antibodies raised against the tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase from rat submandibular salivary glands recognized the enzyme present in the saliva and the antibody was also capable of immunoprecipitating the enzyme activity in saliva. SDS-PAGE analysis of salivary tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase isolated from antibody column revealed a protein of 50-54 kDa in silver stained gels. A similar 50-54 kDa protein was observed for TPST purified from bovine adrenal medulla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, rat liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref> and submandibular salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>5. Summary</title><p>We have identified TPST in human saliva in addition to our earlier reports on its presence in submandibular salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. Although the enzyme activity responsible for tyrosine sulfation was demonstrated several decades ago, very little is known about the function of tyrosine sulfation, particularly, in salivary metabolism. The better understanding of this process needs further studies involving the identification of salivary proteins that are candidates for tyrosine sulfation. In naturally occurring substrates of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase, the sulfated tyrosyl residues are predominantly surrounded by acidic amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. These studies suggest that acidic environments are the important determinants for tyrosine sulfation. Salivary statherin is a 43-residue polypeptide which is tyrosine-rich and contains 7 tyrosine residues. The peptide also contains a sequence E-Q-P-L-Y (residues 26-30) suggested for tyrosine sulfation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>. The availability of TPST and antibody will facilitate well-defined studies on the role of this important function in saliva in physiological and pathological conditions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grant #AA09191 from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.</p></ack><ref-list><ref
