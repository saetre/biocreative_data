We show also that C/EBPs and Trks are required for cortical dendrite differentiation, consistent with Trks regulating dendritic differentiation via a C/EBP-dependent mechanism. Finally, this study indicates that BDNF induction of IE genes important for neuronal function depends on transcription factors (C/EBP, NeuroD) up-regulated during neuronal development, thereby coupling the functional competence of the neuronal cells to their differentiation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The influence of growth factors, as well as transcription factors, on cell fate determination and differentiation is well established. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) affects neuronal cortical development by signaling through its cognate tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkB. Together they regulate many cellular functions during and after the development of the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In particular, we have reported that TrkB, via the activation of the Ras/Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/cellular homolog of the viral oncogene v-Akt (PI3K/AKT) pathways, regulates functions throughout the formation of the cerebral cortex, including neuronal dendritic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. While several transcription factors have been found to respond to activation of TrkB and other Trk family receptors, it is not well understood how Trk signaling interacts with the transcription factors regulating neuronal differentiation to activate specific target genes required during the different phases of neuronal development and, subsequently, in neuronal function.</p><p>The neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors have been shown to be important intrinsic regulators of neural fate determination and differentiation. There are at least two categories of bHLH transcription factors that mediate neurogenesis: proneural bHLHs (Neurogenins and Mash family proteins), which are involved in initiating neurogenesis, and neuronal differentiation factors (members of the NeuroD/Nex family), which are important for terminal differentiation. Studies in mice lacking NeuroD/Nex family members indicate that they are required not only for the survival of early differentiating granule neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum, but also for their terminal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Specifically, NeuroD selectively promotes dendrite, but not axonal, morphogenesis in granule neurons through its phosphorylation at distinct sites by CamKII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These factors form heterodimers with ubiquitously expressed bHLH proteins, such as E12 and E47, and activate gene expression programs through interaction, via their basic domain, with DNA sequences containing the core hexanucleotide motif CANNTG, known as the Ebox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It is still unknown which extracellular signals or intracellular mechanisms are involved in the regulation of bHLH factor function.</p><p>The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors couples growth factor signal transduction with numerous cellular responses, including cellular differentiation in a variety of non-neuronal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The expression of C/EBPs has also been found to change during a number of physiological and pathophysiological conditions in response to extracellular signals, such as hormones, mitogens, and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recently, a Mitogen and extracellular signal regulated kinase (MEK)-C/EBP signaling cascade has been implicated in the commitment of progenitor cells toward a neuronal fate <italic>in vitro </italic>through the inhibition of either MEK or C/EBPs using dominant negative forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Paquin <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], using <italic>in utero </italic>electroporation to manipulate cortical precursors, have suggested that MEK-mediated phosphorylation of C/EBPs is essential for neuronal fate determination. Thus far, however, no genetic model has demonstrated an effect for MEK1/2 or C/EBPs on neuronal lineage commitment or differentiation.</p><p>We here identify <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Egr1 </italic>and <italic>Egr2 </italic>as genes that are regulated by BDNF/TrkB in a C/EBP-dependent manner. We identify a novel complex between C/EBP&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and NeuroD, and find that <italic>in vivo</italic>, these factors are recruited to the <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Egr1 </italic>and <italic>Egr2 </italic>promoters in a Trk-dependent manner. Genetic C/EBP depletion leads to a cortical dendritic neuronal differentiation defect, reminiscent of that seen in the absence of multiple TrkB/C alleles, consistent with the idea that Trk signaling through C/EBP-NeuroD complexes mediates terminal cortical neuronal differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>BDNF induces <italic>Egr1</italic>, <italic>Egr2 </italic>and <italic>Fos </italic>expression in primary cortical neurons</title><p>To identify genes regulated by BDNF signaling through TrkB in neuronal cells, primary cortical neurons derived from E15.5 embryonic forebrain (when neurogenesis is at its peak) were stimulated with BDNF and their gene expression compared to that of untreated control cultures by microarray analysis.

For all three it was found that BDNF induction was reduced when the binding site for the Shc adaptor on the TrkB receptor was mutated (for this mouse strain see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and Materials and methods), consistent with a common regulatory mechanism underlying their upregulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>).

We next analyzed the role of the area of the <italic>Fos </italic>promoter surrounding the serum response element (SRE), as this is the most highly conserved part of the proximal <italic>Fos </italic>promoter. The SRE area contains overlapping binding sites for serum response factor (SRF), C/EBP, E-proteins and activating protein-1 (AP-1)/activating transcription factor (ATF). By transient transfection analysis, the simultaneous mutation of the Ebox and C/EBP site (see supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> in Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and Supplemental materials and methods in Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> for analysis) was found to significantly decrease promoter induction by BDNF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).

This, along with the observed correlation between C/EBP and NeuroD promoter recruitment, suggests that the two factors are recruited as a complex through a cognate binding site for one of the two (most likely a C/EBP). To determine whether C/EBP&#x003b1; and NeuroD were able to associate we co-transfected Q2bn cells with expression vectors for FLAG-tagged C/EBP&#x003b1; and Myc-tagged NeuroD and performed co-immopreciptiation analysis. This showed that Myc-NeuroD was efficiently co-precipitated with FLAG-C/EBP&#x003b1;, demonstrating that the two factors are able to form a complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). To address the issue of whether such a complex exists under physiological conditions in neuronal cells we used a mouse strain in which a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] has been fused to the carboxyl terminus of C/EBP&#x003b1;. The TAP-tag contains an immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding domain from <italic>S. aureus </italic>protein A, which allows tagged proteins to selectively bind to a rabbit IgG-agarose matrix. Thus, nuclear extracts from E16.5 forebrain (a time point when the forebrain is enriched in neuronal cells) of mice heterozygous for the <italic>Cebpa </italic>TAP allele (<italic>Cebpa</italic><sup>T/+ </sup>mice) and wild-type controls were subjected to IgG-agarose pull-down and retained protein was analyzed for the presence of NeuroD by western blotting. As expected, the TAP-tagged C/EBP&#x003b1; isoforms were present in the pull-down of <italic>Cebpa</italic><sup>T/+ </sup>lysates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>, lower panel). We observed that NeuroD was also selectively retained by IgG-agarose in <italic>Cebpa</italic><sup>T/+ </sup>lysates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>, upper panel), indicating a complex formation with C/EBP&#x003b1; <italic>in vivo</italic>. While these results are fully consistent with the existence of C/EBP&#x003b1;-NeuroD complexes in forebrain neurons, we could not rule out that such complexes formed post-lysis. We therefore transfected Q2bn cells separately with FLAG-C/EBP&#x003b1; and Myc-NeuroD expression vectors and mixed lysates from these cells prior to co-immunoprecipitation. This did not lead to detectable complex formation, whereas C/EBP&#x003b1;-NeuroD complexes were readily detectable in lysates of Q2bn cells cotransfected with the two expression vectors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7c</xref>). Finally, to address the issue of whether the C/EBP&#x003b1;-NeuroD interaction was direct we performed glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-downs using C/EBP&#x003b1;-GST fusions of the conserved carboxy-terminal bZIP or amino-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) and <italic>in vitro </italic>translated NeuroD. Of these, NeuroD associated strongly with the C/EBP&#x003b1; bZIP and only weakly with the TAD. Consistent with the high conservation of the bZIP domain between C/EBP isoforms, a GST fusion of the C/EBP&#x003b2; bZIP region was also able to pull down NeuroD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7d</xref>). Together, these results show that NeuroD can interact with C/EBPs through their conserved bZIP region. Since C/EBP&#x003b1;-NeuroD complexes can be isolated from both transfected cells and forebrain suggests that these molecules are co-expressed and interact in neurons.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>The bHLH transcription factor NeuroD co-immunoprecipitates and physically interacts with C/EBP&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;. <bold>(a) </bold>Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assay and western blot analysis.

Moreover, as the co-expression of <italic>Cebpa</italic>/<italic>b </italic>in neurons suggested that they could function in a redundant manner, we also combined the two mutations. In this case the double mutant (<italic>Cebpa</italic><sup>lx/lx</sup><italic>;Cebpb</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>NesCre</italic><sup>tg/+</sup>) died at birth, whereas mutants carrying up to three <italic>Cebpa </italic>and <italic>Cebpb </italic>deleted alleles (<italic>Cebpa</italic><sup>lx/lx</sup><italic>;Cebpb</italic><sup>-/+</sup>;<italic>NesCre</italic><sup>tg/+</sup>, and <italic>Cebpa</italic><sup>lx/l+</sup><italic>;Cebpb</italic><sup>-/-</sup>;<italic>NesCre</italic><sup>tg/+</sup>) were viable and used in this analysis.

Likewise, expression of the general neuronal markers NeuN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8g, h</xref>) and &#x003b2;III-tubulin (Tju1; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8i, j</xref>) was not decreased even in <italic>Cebpa</italic><sup>lx/lx</sup><italic>;Cebpb</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>NesCre</italic><sup>tg/+ </sup>cortices, nor was any difference seen in expression of the glial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8k, l</xref>). No imbalance in neuronal versus glial lineage differentiation was therefore detected. When markers specific for neuronal dendrites (microtubule-associated protein 2, MAP2) and axons (68 kDa neurofilament protein, NF68) were analyzed, MAP2 staining of cortical dendrites was not diminished upon deletion of two <italic>Cebpa </italic>or <italic>Cebpb </italic>alleles, but was severely disrupted in the absence of three alleles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8m&#x02013;r</xref>). Quantification showed that loss of three alleles additionally led to a significant decrease in the amount of MAP2 present in the forebrain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8s, t</xref>); no difference in axonal NF68 staining (data not shown) or total amount of NF68 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8u, v</xref>) was observed, indicating intact axonal differentiation. Given the previously reported regulation of MAP2 by NeuroD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], NeuroD protein expression in <italic>Cebpa/b </italic>deficient brains was investigated and found to be normal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a, b</xref>).

We therefore propose that the observed reduction in MAP2 protein is due to loss of MAP2-containing dendritic structures.

NeuroD is highly expressed in different tissues, including the developing neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and CNS, reaching its highest expression during differentiation in the cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

It is, however, equally possible that some of the NeuroD-C/EBP targets are involved in neuronal function, since <italic>Egr1 </italic>has been reported to be required in the CNS for long-term synaptic plasticity (LTP) in the dentate gyrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The known functions of the affected genes are, therefore, consistent with the observed differentiation phenotype, and suggest a role for C/EBPs in the generation of LTP. However, given the possibility of functional redundancies, further genetic analysis will be required to resolve this issue.</p><p>We did not observe any effects of C/EBP depletion on gross CNS morphology or the distribution or number of neurons and glial cells, as determined by histological analysis and quantification of NeuN and GFAP. Previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have shown that high levels of dominant-negative C/EBP were able to inhibit neurogenesis. Our genetic data do not, at this point, confirm a role for C/EBPs in neuronal-glial lineage decisions. However, in addition to C/EBP&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, C/EBP&#x003b4; and &#x003b5; are also expressed in the CNS and may be able to compensate for loss of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; isoforms. In addition, due to the early embryonic lethality of mice lacking all <italic>Cebpa </italic>and <italic>Cebpb </italic>alleles, one wild-type allele was intact in our analysis, which may be sufficient for any commitment step. It should be noted that the use of high levels of dominant negative C/EBPs may affect other related transcription factors (such as C/ATF and CREB/CREM), and confirmation of the proposed C/EBP function in neuronal lineage commitment by genetic means will still be important to finally resolve this issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment of C/EBP-NeuroD complexes to target promoters</title><p>The promoter elements in the <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Egr1 </italic>and <italic>Egr2 </italic>promoters that recruit C/EBP&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and NeuroD have significant homology, but in the case of <italic>Egr1 </italic>and <italic>Egr2 </italic>do not contain a consensus Ebox. This raises the possibility that the C/EBP-NeuroD complexes that form <italic>in vivo </italic>in neuronal cells expressing these factors (as determined by TAP-mediated pull down from mouse forebrain tissue) are recruited through a single binding site for C/EBP, with little or no interaction between NeuroD and DNA. This notion is supported by the observation that mutation of the <italic>Fos </italic>promoter Ebox had no effect on <italic>Fos </italic>promoter activity in transient transfection assays, whereas simultaneous mutation of both the C/EBP site and the Ebox significantly decreased promoter induction by BDNF.</p><p>The recruitment of NeuroD and C/EBP&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; to IE gene promoters was impaired <italic>in vivo </italic>when the levels of Trk signaling were decreased by inactivation of <italic>Ntrk2</italic>/<italic>Ntrk3</italic>. This result demonstrates that Trk-mediated signaling regulates the association of these factors with chromatin, and the observation that NeuroD and C/EBP recruitment were highly correlated is consistent with these factors being recruited as a complex, as discussed above. Importantly, lowering the level of C/EBP through <italic>Cebpa</italic>/<italic>Cebpb </italic>inactivation decreased the inducibility of all three IE gene promoters in response to BDNF, providing a direct link between the level of C/EBP (and by inference C/EBP-NeuroD complexes) available and neurotrophin-mediated gene activation. While C/EBPs, therefore, are an essential component of TrkB/TrkC mediated IE gene activation, the events linking Trk signaling to C/EBP and/or NeuroD remain to be fully understood at this point. Both C/EBPs and NeuroD are known to be phosphorylated in response to extracellular signaling; however, the physiological relevance of these phosphorylation events are yet to be addressed genetically. Perhaps most relevantly, from <italic>in vitro </italic>studies, phosphorylation of C/EBP&#x003b2; Thr188 by ERK, and Thr217 by ribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk), both of which are kinases downstream of MEK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], have been proposed to be required for their role in neuronal lineage commitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We find that Trk-mediated IE gene induction depends on the Shc adaptor-binding site, a principal function of which is to mediate high-level sustained ERK activation in cultured neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is therefore possible that, also in the context of a NeuroD-C/EBP complex, this pathway regulates C/EBP activity. Experiments to address this question genetically are currently underway.</p><p>In summary, we have shown here that C/EBP&#x003b1; and NeuroD form complexes <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vit</italic>ro. These may define a novel class of C/EBP-bHLH transcription factor complexes of widespread importance, as we have recently shown that a similar interaction occurs between C/EBP&#x003b1; and SREBP-1 in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. ChIP analysis and genetic depletion demonstrated that recruitment of C/EBP and NeuroD to IE gene promoter chromatin occurred concurrently in a Trk-dependent manner, and was required for IE gene induction by neurotrophins. The physiological result of C/EBP depletion was reduced MAP2 expression and impaired cortical dendritic differentiation. We have, therefore, identified C/EBP-NeuroD complexes as novel mediators of Trk signaling, and provide evidence that such complexes function in late stages of neuronal development to promote terminal neuronal differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>RNA preparation for microarray analysis and RT-PCR</title><p>RNA was isolated from E15.5 cortical neurons of +/+ and <italic>trkB</italic><sup><italic>SHC</italic>/<italic>SHC </italic></sup>mice with TRIzol according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (GIBCO Life Technologies (now Invitrogen), Milan, Italy), and labeled according to the one-cycle eukaryotic target labeling protocol from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA).

The antibodies anti-PLC&#x003b3;-1 (1:2,000, mixed monoclonal, Upstate), anti-Erk1 (1:3,000, monoclonal, Zymed, Milan, Italy), and anti-&#x003b1;-tubulin (1:20,000, clone DM1A, Sigma) were used to control for protein loading. For the analysis of NeuroD protein expression, P0 cortices from <italic>Cebpa/b </italic>and <italic>trkB/C </italic>mutants and controls were lysed in (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) on ice for 15 minutes, and then incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with 0.25 u/&#x003bc;l of benzonase (Sigma). Western blot analysis was performed using an anti-NeuroD antibody (1:500, D-20, SantaCruz) in 5% BSA. Stripped membranes were re-probed with an anti-SP3 antibody (D-20X; 1:1,000, polyclonal, SantaCruz). Densitometric analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] of imaged blots was used to compare the expression levels of proteins in mutant and control brains, and was performed on three different blots for each antibody. The ratios obtained for mutant and control samples were compared statistically using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec><title>Golgi method and analysis of dendritic thickness</title><p>Mice were perfused with 4% PFA in phosphate buffer. Brains were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA. Golgi staining was performed according to the Golgi-Kopsch method, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Briefly, blocks of brain tissue (approximately 2.5 mm thickness) were prepared and soaked in a solution containing 2.5% potassium-dichromate for 1 day at room temperature in the dark. The solution was then replaced with fresh of 2.5% potassium-dichromate solution, and tissues were incubated for another 6 days. Tissues were then washed and transferred to a solution containing 0.75% AgNO<sub>3</sub>. After 5 to 6 days, brain pieces were removed, washed in 40% and 20% ethanol, and cut into 80 &#x003bc;m coronal sections using a vibratom (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). Sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and coverslipped with Merkoglas (Merk, Darmstadt, Germany). Analysis of dendritic thickness was performed on Golgi-impregnated sections that were uniformly dark throughout the section. Only dendrites that displayed no breaks in their staining, and were not masked by other neurons or artifacts, were evaluated. Quantitative three-dimensional analyses were performed using a combined hardware-software system (NeuroLucida, Microbrightfields Inc., Colchester, VT, USA) controlling the x-y-z axis of the microscope (Axioscop Imaging, Zeiss, Rehlingen, Germany), and a microscope-mounted video camera (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The three-dimensional reconstruction was done using a 100&#x000d7; objective (NA: 1.4; oil immersion) and the NeuroLucida system. Mean dendritic thickness was calculated from the reconstructed dendrites with the help of NeuroExplorer (Microbrightfields Inc.). The mean, standard deviation (SD), and standard error of the mean (SEM) were calculated. ANOVA followed by a Newman-Keuls test were used for statistical analysis, and were performed using Prism 4.0 (Graph Pad, San Diego, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Authorization for the use of experimental animals</title><p>The EMBL-Monterotondo Animal Ethics Committee approved all animal procedures.
