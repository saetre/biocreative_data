We studied the explanted heart of a proband carrying the <italic>DSG2</italic>-N266S mutation as well as transgenic mice (Tg-NS) with cardiac overexpression of the mouse equivalent of this mutation, N271S-<italic>dsg2</italic>, with the aim of investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms involved. Transgenic mice recapitulated the clinical features of ARVC, including sudden death at young age, spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, and biventricular dilatation and aneurysms. Investigation of transgenic lines with different levels of transgene expression attested to a dose-dependent dominant-negative effect of the mutation. We demonstrate for the first time that myocyte necrosis is the key initiator of myocardial injury, triggering progressive myocardial damage, including an inflammatory response and massive calcification within the myocardium, followed by injury repair with fibrous tissue replacement, and myocardial atrophy. These observations were supported by findings in the explanted heart from the patient. Insight into mechanisms initiating myocardial damage in ARVC is a prerequisite to the future development of new therapies aimed at delaying onset or progression of the disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="107970">107970</ext-link>) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous cardiac inherited disorder estimated to affect &#x0223c;1:2,000&#x02013;5,000 individuals and is associated with increased risk of sudden death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marcus et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thiene et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marcus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basso et al., 2009</xref>). The pathological hallmark of ARVC consists of progressive, diffuse or segmental loss of cardiac myocytes. These are replaced by fibro-fatty tissue predominantly in the right ventricle (RV), with aneurysm formation, chamber dilatation, and impaired cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thiene et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basso et al., 1996</xref>). Clinical characteristics of the disease comprise left bundle branch block morphology ventricular arrhythmias, frequently associated with syncope or sudden cardiac death. Disease onset typically occurs in teenage years or young adulthood. It particularly affects athletes, in whom it is believed to be responsible for up to 20% of sudden cardiac death cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corrado et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Nearly half of ARVC probands harbor one or more mutations in genes encoding major components of cardiac desmosomes, including plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, desmoglein-2 (<italic>DSG2</italic>), and desmocollin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rampazzo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerull et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pilichou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Syrris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asimaki et al., 2007</xref>). Inheritance is mainly autosomal dominant with variable penetrance and expressivity. Homozygous mutation in the plakoglobin gene causes Naxos disease, whereas homozygous mutation in the desmoplakin gene underlies Carvajal syndrome, both characterized by ARVC associated with hair and skin abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McKoy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Norgett et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Despite recent discoveries on the genetic basis of ARVC, the etiopathogenesis of the disease remains poorly understood. Different mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the ARVC phenotype. In earlier years, the disontogenetic (dysplastic), the degenerative (dystrophic), and the inflammatory theories have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thiene et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basso et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, cardiomyocyte apoptosis has been associated with ARVC, but the contribution of programmed cell death in disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mallat et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valente et al., 1998</xref>) and progression remains unclear. In 2006, three animal models were generated in an attempt to define pathogenetic mechanisms of ARVC. These genetically engineered mice supported the transdifferentiation theory, the impairment of desmosomal function theory, and the role of environmental contribution to disease expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Gras et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kirchhof et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). However, the sequence of cellular events characterizing disease onset and progression remains unexplored.</p><p>We have previously identified the <italic>DSG2</italic>-N266S mutation in a small kindred with ARVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pilichou et al., 2006</xref>). The N266 residue, located between the second and third extracellular cadherin domains of <italic>DSG2</italic>, has been shown to be critical for coordination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, a phenomenon essential to the adhesive intercellular interactions of junctional cadherins. In the present study, we have analyzed a mouse model with overexpression of the mouse homologue of this mutation, N271S-<italic>dsg2</italic>, and investigated the explanted heart of the proband with the N266S mutation, enabling comparison of clinicopathological findings with the animal model. We demonstrate for the first time that myocyte necrosis is a key initiator of myocardial injury in ARVC, triggering progressive myocardial damage.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Clinical features in the proband carrying the <italic>DSG2</italic>-N266S mutation</title><p>The proband, a 55-yr-old female at diagnosis, was hospitalized for an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) with left bundle branch block morphology that was hemodynamically well tolerated. 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block and negative T waves in V1&#x02013;V3. Signal-averaged ECG demonstrated late potentials at all filter settings (25, 40, and 80 Hz). Two-dimensional echocardiography and ventricular angiography displayed severe RV dilatation with a mildly depressed function (RV ejection fraction [RVEF]: 48%), whereas left ventricle (LV) parameters were within normal limits. Normal, patent coronary arteries were observed at coronary angiography. The patient received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator a year later. During follow-up, she had progression of the disease with T wave inversion up to V5 and low QRS voltages on 12-lead ECG, and decreasing RV function (RVEF: 35%) in addition to signs of LV involvement on echocardiography (LVEF: 47%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Moreover, the patient experienced several episodes of sustained VT and developed signs and symptoms of heart failure at the age of 63. Renal function remained normal until the last follow-up. Because of refractory heart failure, she eventually underwent successful heart transplantation at the age of 65.

In this model, which is the first <italic>dsg2</italic>-related mouse model of ARVC, we provide evidence that the ARVC phenotype, although genetically determined, develops postnatally and is progressive with age. We demonstrate for the first time that it is initiated by necrotic cell death, which subsequently triggers an inflammatory response and massive calcification within the myocardium, followed later by injury repair with fibrous tissue replacement. Our data bring to the fore hitherto underexposed aspects in the pathogenesis of ARVC. Insight into the mechanism of disease enables research into new therapies aimed at delaying onset and progression of ARVC.</p><sec><title>Cardiac desmosomes and <italic>DSG2</italic></title><p>Cardiac desmosomes are intercellular junctions at the intercalated discs of cardiomyocytes, closely apposed to gap junction plaques, which confer mechanical coupling of the myocytes in the heart through families of proteins including the desmosomal cadherins, armadillo, and plakins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stokes, 2007</xref>). The desmosomal cadherins (desmogleins and democollins) are single transmembrane glycoproteins, which mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent homophilic interactions between the extracellular regions of these proteins emanating from opposing cell surfaces. The intracellular domain of desmosomal cadherins binds to two proteins of the armadillo family, namely plakoglobin and plakophilin, forming an indirect link to desmoplakin and the intermediate filaments (desmin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Troyanovsky et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chitaev and Troyanovsky, 1997</xref>). Adhesion of cadherins originating from adjacent cells occurs through interaction of extracellular cadherin domains (ectodomains) that form the rodlike extracellular portion of the protein. Successive ectodomains are interconnected by sequences that dock three Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nagar et al., 1996</xref>). Structural and biochemical interaction studies of cadherin ectodomains have demonstrated the importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding at these sites in adhesive intercellular interactions of these domains, providing structural rigidity necessary for recognition and assembly of trans (adhesive) cadherin junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chitaev and Troyanovsky, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sotomayor and Schulten, 2008</xref>). It has been previously shown that point mutation of amino acid residues directly involved in coordinating Ca<sup>2+</sup> at successive sites between individual ectodomains results in loss of adhesive (trans) intercellular interaction of dimers and favors lateral interaction of ectodomains stemming from the same cell (cis-interaction; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klingelh&#x000f6;fer et al., 2002</xref>). Residue N266 (N271 in mouse) of <italic>DSG2</italic>, located between the second and third cadherin ectodomains, represents one of these critical Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordinating residues (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090641/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). We observed, however, structurally normal desmosomes both in the human ARVC patient and in Tg-NS/H mice, similar to those observed in WT and Tg-WT mice, without any evidence of gap widening. This is in line with a dominant-negative effect of mutant <italic>DSG2</italic> on desmosome function rather than structure.</p><p>An interesting observation from the engineering of mutant mice for desmosomal proteins is that a single nucleotide change associated with amino acid substitution in a key protein function domain is alone able to reproduce the main clinical and pathological features of ARVC, whereas heterozygous gene knockout does not result in disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ruiz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grossmann et al., 2004</xref>). These data are consistent with a dose-dependent dominant-negative effect of the N271S-<italic>dsg2</italic> mutation on cell integrity and ARVC phenotype in transgenic mice, whereas haploinsufficiency alone may not be sufficient to cause disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Myocyte necrosis is a key initiator of myocardial dystrophy</title><p>Our experimental model for the first time provides evidence that necrotic myocyte death is the initiating event in the myocardial injury and repair process. Necrosis always preceded other pathological signs of disease, such as inflammation and calcification, and later on, fibrosis, ventricular dilation, and aneurysm formation. Furthermore, myocyte necrosis originated in the subepicardial myocardium, followed by a wave-front extension toward the endocardium. This wave-front phenomenon of myocardial atrophy is well documented in human ARVC, both by histopathologic examinations and cardiac magnetic resonance studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sen-Chowdhry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basso et al., 2009</xref>). The underlying mechanism for this remains unknown, although heterogeneity in transmural distribution of myocardial fiber architecture and/or of wall mechanics may play a role. Apoptosis was also observed in hearts from Tg-NS mice of different ages, but to a smaller extent and usually confined to areas of necrosis or fibrosis, indicating that, although apoptosis can contribute to progressive cardiomyocyte atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valente et al., 1998</xref>), necrosis appears to be the leading mechanism in disease onset and exacerbation.</p><p>Different from previously reported ARVC animal models, in which only the characteristic features of advanced ARVC were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Gras et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2006</xref>), in our <italic>dsg2</italic> model we have performed, for the first time, a &#x0201c;step-by-step&#x0201d; investigation of histopathological changes occurring over time in the myocardium, starting from the stage in which the myocardium appeared normal, through the early stages of myocardial disease, and extending toward the late ARVC phenotype. Overall, this <italic>dsg2</italic> animal model highlights hitherto underexposed aspects of ARVC. However, mutations in the <italic>DSG2</italic> gene account for only a minority of ARVC patients, and the results of the present study may not necessarily be transferable to mutations in other ARVC genes that are much more frequent in the ARVC population (i.e., desmoplakin or plakophilin-2). Further studies are needed to assess whether our findings also hold true for other genetic forms of ARVC.</p><p>Necrosis has been rarely observed at postmortem analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basso et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bauce et al., 2005</xref>). The fact that necrosis is not often reported in both autopsy and endomyocardial biopsy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basso et al., 2008</xref>) of human ARVC likely relates to its focal distribution and possibly episodic nature, typically during disease onset or acute phases of disease progression. In the clinical setting, environmental factors such as exercise or inflammation have been advocated in facilitating disease onset and progression by worsening cell adhesion. In fact, human disease onset and progression is sometimes characterized by the onset of chest pain with electrocardiographic changes and myocardial enzyme release, mimicking acute myocardial infarction so as to suggest underlying cardiomyocyte necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bauce et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sen-Chowdhry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basso et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Dystrophic myocardial calcification was detected both in Tg-NS mice and in the explanted human ARVC heart, and has been previously reported both in spontaneous animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Protonotarios and Tsatsopoulou, 2004</xref>) and in human ARVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basso et al., 2001</xref>). Although these observations may signify previous episodes of accelerated necrosis, we cannot exclude that dystrophic calcification in the failing heart of the N266S proband resulted from other potential causes beyond those that are integral to the underlying ARVC disease process. In addition, the magnitude of calcification observed in the mouse may reflect an increased susceptibility to calcification caused by active bone mineralization mechanisms in these young rapidly growing animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fatkin et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Topaz, 1991</xref>).</p><p>So far, myocyte necrosis and dystrophy have been related to mutation in structural proteins linking the underlying contractile proteins to the sarcolemma and the extracellular matrix or those that stabilize or repair the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lapidos et al., 2004</xref>). Our findings in Tg-NS mice, together with the presence of pronounced calcification as a sequela of previous necrosis in the explanted heart of the N266S proband, provide the first evidence that myocyte necrosis and dystrophy also stem from intercellular junction proteins. Although the mechanism by which mutant <italic>dsg2</italic> produces myocyte necrosis remains to be elucidated, one could hypothesize that desmosomal protein dysfunction affects sarcolemma integrity and/or mithocondrial permeability with abnormal calcium homeostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrical instability, conduction disturbances, and biventricular involvement</title><p>Extensive investigation of the electrophysiological consequences of overexpression of <italic>dsg2</italic>-N271S shows a highly arrhythmogenic phenotype, with a high prevalence of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. Crucially, arrhythmia inducibility was greatly increased in both the RV and LV, in line with the observed biventricular disease involvement on echocardiography, gross morphology, and histology. The biventricular involvement is not an unexpected finding. The proband with the N266S mutation had left ventricular abnormalities, and genotype&#x02013;phenotype correlations in ARVC mutation carriers have shown a higher occurrence of LV involvement than previously thought, supporting the adoption of the broader term &#x0201c;arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basso et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Sudden death occurred in 30% of mice with high expression of N271S-<italic>dsg2</italic> by the age of 3.6 wk, and only 20% of Tg-NS/H mice survived by the age of 20 wk. Thus, premature death occurs not only in the advanced stages of the disease but also at young age, when there is as yet no morphological evidence of the chronic fibrous repair with aneurysm formation but only of the acute&#x02013;subacute damage, with myocyte necrosis and inflammation. This again reproduces accurately the clinical course of human ARVC, where cardiac arrest can manifest at every stage along the natural history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nava et al., 2000</xref>). VT/fibrillation is usually the mechanism of instantaneous sudden death in the &#x0201c;hot phase&#x0201d; of disease progression, likely because of acute myocyte death and reactive inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basso et al., 2009</xref>). On the contrary, older patients with a long-lasting ARVC more often experience scar-related VT.</p><p>Conduction through the ventricles was clearly affected in Tg-NS mice, whereas sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction were unaltered. The last finding also reproduces the human disease, in which conduction slowing has been proven to be typically parietal and not septal, because of fibro-fatty replacement of the working myocardium of the ventricular free wall, not affecting the specialized conducting tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Fatty tissue and ARVC mouse models</title><p>Clear-cut evidence of adipocytes was never observed neither in routine histology nor in ultrastructural investigation of the myocardium in Tg-NS mice both at early stages of disease onset and in later stages.
