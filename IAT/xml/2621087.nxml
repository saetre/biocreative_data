To study the function of <italic>Dicer1</italic> in the maintenance of homeostasis in adult tissues, we analyzed the adult tissues histologically and found abnormalities only in the pancreas. The phenotypes detected in the pancreas of <italic>Dicer1</italic>-hypomorphic mice might resemble the differentiation of endocrine precursor cells in adult pancreas.</p><p>The pancreas consists of three main tissue cell types: the endocrine cells (islet of Langerhans) which produce hormones such as insulin and glucagon; the exocrine acinar tissues which secrete digestive enzymes; and the branched duct. Numerous mechanisms that control the differentiation of endocrine and exocrine cells in the embryonic pancreas have been revealed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004212-Habener1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, but how endocrine cells (especially insulin-producing &#x003b2; cells) are maintained in postnatal life has been controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004212-Ackermann1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. At E9.5, the endocrine cells of the pancreas arise from endocrine precursor cells, which express both glucagon and insulin and divide into distinct lineages such as glucagon or insulin-expressing cells. On the other hand, in the adult pancreas, it had been considered that there are no endocrine progenitor cells and that &#x003b2; cells are generated only by the replication of existing &#x003b2; cells, not from the differentiation of endocrine precursor cells (neogenesis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004212-Dor1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004212-Teta1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, several studies suggested that &#x003b2; cell differentiation from endocrine precursor cells can occur in adults in the regenerating pancreas after a partial pancreatectomy or duct ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004212-BonnerWeir1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004212-Bertelli1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004212-BonnerWeir2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004212-Xu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In the regenerating pancreas, vigorous expansion of the &#x003b2; cell population was observed, and partial pancreatectomy and duct ligation has been a good model for regenerating endocrine cells. The phenotypes observed in <italic>Dicer1</italic>-hypomorphic mice suggested that <italic>Dicer1</italic> regulates the endocrinal neogenesis in the adult pancreas.
