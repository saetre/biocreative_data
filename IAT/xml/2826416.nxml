Expression of MS4A genes is variable in tissues throughout the body; however, several are limited to cells in the hematopoietic system where they have known roles in immune cell functions. Genes in the small TMEM176 group share significant sequence similarity with MS4A genes and there is evidence of immune function of at least one of the encoded proteins. In this study, we examined the evolutionary history of the MS4A/TMEM176 families as well as tissue expression of the phylogenetically earliest members, in order to investigate their possible origins in immune cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Orthologs of human MS4A genes were found only in mammals; however, MS4A gene homologs were found in most jawed vertebrates.

The evolutionary history of these genes has not been examined and their first appearance during phylogeny is unknown. In this study, we identified all genes in currently available databases from species selected to cover large evolutionary distances. MS4A genes were found among most vertebrate groups, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and jawed fish. TMEM176 genes are fewer than MS4A genes and were found in mammals and bony fish.

We found no evidence of MS4A or TMEM176 genes in jawless vertebrates, protists, bacteria, fungi or plants. A group of potentially related genes was identified in several invertebrate species, however, regions of similarity were limited to very short sequences that upon further examination were also found in numerous unrelated membrane proteins.</p><p>The adaptive immune system, as defined by the central importance of immunoglobulin domain containing antigen receptors, has been identified only in jawed vertebrates and first appeared in cartilaginous fish such as sharks and rays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009369-Cooper1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009369-Kasahara1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. As mentioned above, several MS4A and TMEM176 proteins in mammals have roles in adaptive immune functions. This, together with identification of a cartilaginous fish as the earliest species with MS4A genes, suggested the possibility of their functional coevolution with adaptive immunity. However, transcriptional analysis of MS4A genes in tissues from S. <italic>acanthias</italic> indicated that the emergence of both adaptive immunity and MS4A genes in cartilaginous jawed fish was coincidental.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequence Information Retrieval</title><p>Reference Sequence and nucleotide databases were searched by tBLASTn using protein sequences corresponding to each of the human MS4A genes; this retrieved a large number of mammalian sequences as well as sequences from avian (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic> and <italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic>) and bony fish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic> and <italic>Osmerus mordax</italic>) species.

In order to test the hypothesis that MS4A genes coevolved with the adaptive immune system, we examined MS4A mRNA expression by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in tissues and organs of spiny dogfish. We reasoned that, if the first appearance of MS4A genes and adaptive immunity in cartilaginous fish was purposeful, we should find at least one gene with expression restricted to blood cells. In addition to the full length sequence included in the phylogenetic analysis, fragments of 2 other distinct MS4A genes were identified. Each of the 3 spiny dogfish MS4A genes was found to have a unique expression profile among the tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009369-g005"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>). MS4Ax1 was found in all tissues except the intestine, whereas MS4Ax2 expression was found only in the intestine. MS4Ax3 was found in all tissues except the intestine and the gill. To determine the extent to which the tissues examined were infiltrated by blood cells, we analyzed expression of CD79a mRNA (a B lymphocyte marker) in each of the tissues. We found that CD79a was expressed in most tissue samples, but was completely absent in white muscle and only trace amounts were detected in the brain. Since MS4Ax1 and MS4Ax3 were detected in muscle and brain tissues, but CD79a was not, their expression is clearly not restricted to blood cells of the spiny dogfish. Furthermore, since CD79a was detected in intestinal tissue but MS4Ax1 and MS4Ax3 were not, these MS4A genes are unlikely to be expressed in the blood. The lack of expression of MS4Ax2 in several tissues with strong CD79a expression indicates that this MS4A gene is not expressed in blood cells. Based on these data, the known MS4A genes in the spiny dogfish are highly unlikely to be involved in adaptive immune functions.</p><fig id="pone-0009369-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009369.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Tissue expression of MS4A genes in <italic>S. acanthus</italic>.</title><p>Reverse transcriptase PCR was performed on RNA isolated from the tissues indicated, using primers to amplify each of the 3 distinct MS4A genes identified in the <italic>S. acanthus</italic> EST database.

MS4A genes were found in all classes of jawed vertebrates but not in jawless vertebrates or phylogenetically earlier species, suggesting the possibility of their functional coevolution with adaptive immunity. However, tissue expression of MS4A genes in <italic>S. acanthias</italic>, the earliest vertebrate with MS4A genes, showed no evidence of expression in the hematopoietic system, leading to our conclusion that the appearance of MS4A genes and adaptive immunity in early vertebrate phylogeny was coincidental.</p><p>Several distinct MS4A genes were found in all mammalian genomes. Orthologs of human MS4A genes were found only in other mammals (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009369.s001">Table S1</xref></bold>). Representatives of marsupials and monotremes, the earliest mammals, were found to have fewer MS4A genes than placental mammals, but these MS4A genes were clear orthologs of human genes. In contrast, MS4A genes in lower vertebrates are generally fewer, less diverse, and highly divergent from mammalian MS4A genes. A large number of MS4A genes were found in the zebrafish, but these were highly related to one another and grouped separately from MS4A genes in other vertebrate classes, as did the MS4A genes identified in other bony and cartilaginous fish. In addition to the sequences shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009369.s003">Figure S1</xref></bold>, EST databases of other Cypriniformes fish (carp, goldfish, and loaches) also contain evidence of MS4A genes highly conserved with those of zebrafish (not shown). Sequencing of the spiny dogfish genome is incomplete, but evidence of 3 distinct MS4A genes was obtained from the EST database. The lack of MS4A genes in elephant shark, a member of a sister-group related to modern sharks, could be due to insufficient genomic sequence coverage, gene loss, extreme divergence of the gene sequences, or because the MS4A genes first appeared in modern sharks. We found no evidence of MS4A genes in jawless fish. A group of potentially related genes was identified in several invertebrate species; however, regions of similarity were limited to very short sequences that upon further examination were also found in numerous unrelated membrane proteins in diverse species including plants and microorganisms. The apparent lack of MS4A or MS4A like genes in the earliest vertebrates suggests that the invertebrate genes may be examples of convergent evolution rather than evidence of a common ancestral gene that gave rise to vertebrate MS4A genes and the identified invertebrate genes. Combined, the data suggest that chondrichthyes are the class where MS4A genes first appeared in their modern form, however, limited genomic and cDNA derived sequence data for agnathans (jawless fish) leaves open the possibility that MS4A genes may exist in these early vertebrates.</p><p>In the course of this investigation we identified a new MS4A gene in the human genome (MS4A18) and a new MS4A4 gene in the mouse (MS4A4x). Blast searches against EST databases revealed that expression of MS4A18 is limited to testis and that MS4A4x is expressed in osteoclast like cells (not shown). Previously, TMEM176 genes were identified and proposed to be related to MS4A genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009369-Louvet1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We confirmed this relationship by phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparison. TMEM176 sequences have regions of highly conserved sequence with MS4A. However, several points suggest that TMEM176 genes are a separate group: 1) TMEM176 genes were found on a different chromosome than MS4A genes in all species examined; 2) sequence conservation between MS4A genes and TMEM176 genes in all species is relatively low; 3) phylogenetic analysis suggests that all TMEM176 genes are more related to each other than to any MS4A gene examined. Therefore, the TMEM176 genes presumably share a common ancestral gene with the MS4A gene family but diverged and underwent independent expansion.</p><p>Our identification of a few exceptionally long MS4A genes with tandem sequences was unexpected. These genes were found in the chicken and primitive mammals, but not in placental mammals or in fish or amphibian species. Homo-oligomerization of human CD20 (MS4A1) and hetero-oligomerization of mouse MS4A4B and MS4A6B have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009369-Polyak1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009369-Howie1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Discovery of tandem MS4A genes in chicken, opossum and platypus supports the concept that oligomerization may be a general feature of MS4A proteins. With the exception of MD_3, which contains 6 repetitive subunits, all of the long MS4A proteins we identified have a predicted structure of 2 tandem MS4A proteins suggesting that MS4A proteins may function as dimers or multiples of dimers. Indeed, CD20 assembles into tetramers that are probably organized as dimer of dimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009369-Bubien1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009369-Polyak1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In the chicken and early mammals it appears that gene duplication/fusion events may have diversified the MS4A genes and their functional protein products while conserving genomic DNA.</p><p>In this study, we initially set out to determine the evolutionary origin of the MS4A and TMEM176 families, which include several genes encoding proteins with restricted expression in the immune system. In light of evidence that MS4A genes first appeared in cartilaginous fish (chondrichthyes), the earliest vertebrates with a modern form of adaptive immunity, we tested the hypothesis that MS4A genes evolved with the immune system by examining tissue expression of the 3 identified MS4A genes in the spiny dogfish. The results demonstrated that expression of all 3 genes is not restricted to blood cells. Furthermore, based on data that showed lack of expression of MS4A genes in tissues with strong evidence of blood cell infiltration, it appears that these genes may not be expressed in blood cells at all. However, it is possible that other, unidentified MS4A genes in the spiny dogfish are expressed in blood cells, or that any of these genes may be expressed in non-circulating lymphocytes in peripheral lymphoid tissues. With these caveats in mind, our findings suggest that MS4A genes first appeared in cartilaginous fish with expression in nonimmune cells, and have expanded and diversified in mammalian species into their modern forms with diverse functions in both immune and nonimmune cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009369.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>MS4A and TMEM176 homolog and ortholog distribution throughout phylogeny.</p><p>(0.03 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009369.s001.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009369.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>MS4A and TMEM176 genes in species used for phylogenetic analysis.</p><p>(0.03 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009369.s002.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009369.s003"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Multiple sequence alignment of MS4A and TMEM176 proteins corresponding to genes listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009369.s002">Table S2</xref>.</p><p>(1.17 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009369.s003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009369.s004"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic tree of vertebrate MS4A and TMEM176 sequences.
