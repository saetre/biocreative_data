The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is an essential signaling molecule that modulates most of the physiological functions of the larval gland. At the end of larval development, it is known that 20E&#x02014;signaling through a nuclear receptor heterodimer consisting of EcR and USP&#x02014;induces the early and late puffing cascade of the polytene chromosomes and causes the exocytosis of stored glue granules into the lumen of the gland. It has also been reported that an earlier pulse of hormone induces the temporally and spatially specific transcriptional activation of the glue genes; however, the receptor responsible for triggering this response has not been characterized. Here we show that the coordinated expression of the glue genes midway through the third instar is mediated by 20E acting to induce genes of the <italic>Broad Complex (BRC)</italic> through a receptor that is not an EcR/USP heterodimer. This result is novel because it demonstrates for the first time that at least some 20E-mediated, mid-larval, developmental responses are controlled by an uncharacterized receptor that does not contain an RXR-like component.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>During animal development the physiological response of individual tissues is often &#x0201c;reprogrammed&#x0201d; in response to signaling molecules. One important example is the activity of nuclear-hormone receptors that are controlled by small lipid compounds such as steroids and retinoids. Thus, understanding how tissue-specific developmental and physiological responses are regulated by these systemic ligands is a fundamental question of cell biology. <italic>Drosophila</italic> is an important model system in which to investigate this question because of its 100-year history of analyzing mutants that affect complex biological processes, and because researchers possess a powerful &#x0201c;toolkit&#x0201d; that allows for precise tissue- and temporal-specific expression and silencing of almost any gene in the genome. Furthermore, during the metamorphosis of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the body plan is completely reorganized from that of a larva (specialized for growth and feeding) to that of an imago (specialized for reproduction and dispersal) by a single steroid hormone. Here we examine the molecular events that control different physiological responses within a single target tissue to different pulses of 20E. We show for the first time that these temporally specific events within the same tissue are controlled in part by different 20E receptors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During metamorphosis in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, pulses of the 20E steroid hormone, stimulate diverse tissue-specific responses such as the histolysis of many larval tissues and the simultaneous differentiation of adult structures from imaginal discs &#x0005b;reviewed in 1&#x0005d;. In addition, multiple pulses of 20E that occur during the last larval instar (L3) trigger different responses within the same target tissue, raising the interesting question of how a generalized developmental signal is manifested into distinct physiological responses that are separated by time. The larval/prepupal salivary gland is an ideal assay system in which to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for such temporally specific developmental specifications. In a 36-hour period, the gland responds to three distinct pulses of 20E in three fundamentally different ways.</p><p>During most of larval life, the salivary gland is engaged in the synthesis of non-digestive enzymes that most likely aid in the lubrication of the food through the gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Zhimulev1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Furia1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However, about midway through the L3 stage, the pattern of gene expression is altered dramatically by the synchronous activation of a small number of genes (&#x0223c;8) that are abundantly expressed in the salivary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Andres1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These are known to encode components of the glue mix that cements animals to a solid surface during metamorphosis, and they were first identified because their induction is responsible for the &#x0201c;intermolt&#x0201d; puffs formed on the giant polytene chromosomes of the gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Korge1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Kress1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Approximately 18 hours later, in response to the pulse of 20E that occurs at the end of L3, glue synthesis abruptly ceases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Andres1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Huet1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> because the hormone represses transcription from these genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Crowley1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Hansson1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. At this time, the salivary gland begins to express another set of genes, many of which were originally described because they formed &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; puffs on the polytene chromosomes &#x0005b;reviewed in 11&#x0005d;.

The hormone is known to bind to a receptor consisting of a heterodimer of EcR (FBgn0000546) and USP (FBgn0003964) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Koelle1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Yao1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Both receptor components are members of the nuclear-hormone receptor superfamily, both contain well conserved DNA- and ligand-binding domains, and both are needed for the physiological responses of target tissues to 20E at these times &#x0005b;reviewed in 19&#x0005d;. However, little is known concerning the mechanism of receptor mediation during the middle of L3 when glue genes are coordinately activated. Although it is generally assumed that these events are also mediated by a receptor consisting of EcR and USP, other explanations can be invoked including the use of a different 20E receptor.</p><p>Here we examine the requirements of EcR and USP for the induction of the glue genes at mid L3. By employing the GAL4/UAS binary expression system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Brand1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> with transgenic inducible dominant-negative and RNAi constructs, we are able to limit perturbations of 20E signaling specifically to the salivary gland at defined developmental stages. We show that 20E is responsible for inducing a tagged glue transgene as a secondary response to the hormone, and that the 20E-inducible primary-response genes of the <italic>Broad Complex (BRC)</italic> (FBgn0000210) are sufficient to initiate this programmed developmental response. However, we clearly demonstrate that the mid-instar hormone response requires a receptor that has not yet been characterized. The receptor consists of EcR but not USP. These results challenge the traditional model that most developmental events triggered by 20E must signal through a heterodimer of EcR and USP, and they support an alternative explanation in which either EcR homodimers or other members of the nuclear-hormone receptor superfamily play an active role in the diversity of responses to 20E during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>An <italic>Sgs3</italic> Transgene Is Induced by 20E</title><p>It is generally assumed that the glue genes &#x0005b;<italic>Sgs1</italic> (FBgn0003372), <italic>Sgs3</italic> (FBgn0003373), <italic>Sgs4</italic> (FBgn0003374), <italic>Sgs5</italic> (FBgn0003375), <italic>Sgs6</italic> (FBgn0003376), <italic>Sgs7</italic> (FBgn0003377), <italic>Sgs8</italic> (FBgn0003378), and <italic>I71-7</italic> (FBgn0004592)&#x0005d; are induced by a pulse of 20E that occurs midway through the third instar. This inference is based on the dramatically coordinated developmental induction at mid L3 of most of these genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Andres1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, and on studies in which <italic>Sgs</italic> expression is examined in backgrounds mutant for genes thought to be involved in 20E production or transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Hansson2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Furia2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, we began this analysis with an <italic>in-vitro</italic> culture of salivary glands dissected from mid L3 because we are not aware of any published reports that directly test if glue-gene transcription can be induced by 20E in glands cultured from wildtype animals. To simplify the analysis, we dissected salivary glands from a line of flies in which the coding information for <italic>Sgs3</italic> had been tagged with <italic>GFP</italic> (<italic>glueGRN</italic>) (FBst0005884). This stock (previously called <italic>SgsGFP</italic>) contains adequate regulatory information for the proper temporal, spatial, and high-level expression of the <italic>Sgs3</italic> gene. It has also been extensively characterized and shown to be an accurate reporter for the secretion and expectoration of endogenous SGS3 glue protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Biyasheva1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Larvae were synchronized at hatching and raised to the early-L3 stage approximately 4&#x02013;5 hours prior to the normal transcriptional induction of the glue genes. Salivary glands were then dissected and exposed to media containing different concentrations of 20E (ranging 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M) or in medium without hormone. Under these circumstances glueGRN accumulation was detected 4&#x02013;6 hours later in cultures incubated with low 20E concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000102-g001">Figure 1</xref>), but not in untreated cultures or those incubated with higher concentrations of the hormone. It should be noted that this response is not robust because only &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of the dissected glands produce glueGRN when treated. Presumably the results are variable because the culture conditions have not been optimized and/or the animals are not staged in a precise enough manner. However, it is significant to note that the only cultures in which glueGRN was detected were those incubated in either 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M (8 out of 20) or 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> M (4 out of 20). Thus, the concentration needed for production of glueGRN is 2&#x02013;3 orders of magnitude lower than the titer (&#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M) reported to trigger &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; polytene puff formation, imaginal disc eversion, and glue secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Biyasheva1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Ashburner1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Fristrom1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02014;all developmental events that occur near puparium formation in response to a much better characterized pulse of 20E.

Following this logic, the protein turn over might take 4 days to reach a critical threshold level. Thus, there would be enough USP protein for glueRED synthesis in 3-day old larvae (the age when glue genes are induced by 20E), but not enough in 4-day old larvae (the age when 20E causes glue secretion). To test the ability of the <italic>USPi</italic> construct to silence <italic>USP</italic> effectively in a short time frame, we used the <italic>glueGal4</italic> driver (FBst0006870) to express transgenes in the salivary gland from mid-L3 until puparium formation.

To test this hypothesis, we crossed the <italic>USP&#x0002b;</italic> line to <italic>sgGal4</italic>; <italic>GFP.nls</italic>; <italic>glueRED</italic> and raised the larvae derived from the cross at two different temperatures (25&#x000b0;C and 29&#x000b0;C). Because temperatures closer to 30&#x000b0;C are reported to produce higher GAL4 activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Morimura1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> (probably because GAL4 is a yeast transcription factor), we predicted that larvae raised at 29&#x000b0;C would produce less glueRED (due to the overproduction of more USP that should antagonize 20E receptor formation). As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000102-t001">Table 1</xref>, these differences were observed when animals were raised at the two different temperatures (53&#x00025; of the glands failed to produce any glue when raised at 29&#x000b0;C compared to 34&#x00025; that failed to produce any glue when raised at 25&#x000b0;C). In addition, we confirmed that raising control animals at 29&#x000b0;C did not perturb glueRED production, and raising experimental animals at the elevated temperature did not cause a non-specific induction of the heat shock promoter in other tissues because GFP.nls was only detected in the nuclei of salivary glands (data not shown).</p><p>Finally, to ascertain the role of USP in the production of other glue proteins, we compared the overall pattern of protein synthesis using Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000102-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, the appearance of most of the glue proteins can be identified when whole salivary-gland-protein extracts are stained because the <italic>Sgs</italic> genes are abundantly expressed in this tissue.

Here we demonstrate that a glue-gene reporter derived from the <italic>Sgs3</italic> gene can be induced by 20E in cultured glands dissected from wildtype animals at mid L3. Furthermore, unlike the 20E mediated events that occur at the end of the larval period, the induction of <italic>Sgs3</italic> and other glue genes is mediated by a lower titer of hormone (10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M). This result is consistent with a report of a small titer of 20E that has been detected in a population of synchronized animals two hours prior to the induction of the glue genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Warren1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, because the <italic>ecd1<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutation probably reduces the concentration of 20E in the hemolymph, mutant animals shifted to the non-permissive temperature might still be exposed to enough 20E to induce the <italic>Sgs</italic> genes. We have also shown that the induction of the glue genes occurs as a secondary response to the hormone because the requirement for EcR can be bypassed if <italic>BRC</italic> isoforms are ectopically expressed. This finding is supported by published evidence that some 20E-regulated transcription factors (BRC, E74B) can be induced in cultured organs by a pulse of hormone that is much lower than that produced at the end of the third instar, &#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M versus &#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Karim2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The Induction of the Glue Genes Requires a Different 20E Receptor</title><p>The dogma for the action of 20E during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development is that EcR and USP are associated as a heterodimer and often bound to the EcREs of target genes. When not bound by ligand, the heterodimer associates with a repressor complex to prevent transcription from those genes. Hormone binding (to the ligand-binding domain of EcR) leads to a conformational change in the complex, the dissociation of the repressor complex, and the recruitment of co-activators for high-level transcriptional activation &#x0005b;reviewed in 19&#x0005d;. Although this model is well supported by evidence that both EcR and USP are required to initiate events during the late-larval and prepupal periods, our study presents compelling evidence for the existence of another <italic>bona fide</italic> receptor for 20E that consists of EcR but does not use USP as its heterodimeric partner.</p><p>We have provided evidence that SGS3 production (and probably glue synthesis in general) is a 20E-mediated event. We have also demonstrated that EcR is required for the induction of the glue genes, and that any isoform of EcR can be involved in the activation of <italic>Sgs3</italic>. This result is interesting because EcR-B1 is reported to be the predominant form that is normally expressed in the larval salivary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Talbot1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, because expression of <italic>BRC</italic> is necessary and sufficient for the induction of <italic>Sgs3</italic>, these experiments suggest that the A/B domain of EcR does not participate in the expression of <italic>BRC</italic> by the smaller pulse of 20E that occurs midway through the L3 stage.</p><p>In contrast to the results for EcR, we have provided convincing evidence that USP is not the other half of the heterodimer needed for the 20E-mediated initiation of glue synthesis. In a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Biyasheva1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> we confirmed that <italic>USP</italic> mutants can be rescued from embryonic lethality by providing exogenous USP from a heat-shock driven transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Hall1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, if these animals are not provided with a source of USP during the L2 and L3 stages (by being deprived of subsequent heat pulses that would induce the transgenic cDNA), they will not pupariate, but they will grow, molt, and express an <italic>Sgs3</italic> derived reporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Biyasheva1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the current study we have used strong tissue-specific drivers that are exclusively expressed in the salivary gland at two different time points. We have demonstrated that the <italic>USPi</italic> stock is an effective reagent for silencing endogenous <italic>USP</italic> in the salivary gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000102-g006">Figures 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000102-g007">7</xref>), even if it is only produced for 24 hours before the assay (i. e. inducing it with <italic>glueGal4</italic> blocks glue secretion). Thus, when it is driven during all larval stages (3 days before glue synthesis) no USP protein can be detected by immunostaining, and this absence of USP protein has no effect on the production of glue. To further confirm that USP is not needed for glue synthesis, we demonstrated that when wildtype USP is overexpressed in the salivary gland during the larval stages, glue protein production is drastically reduced. Because USP is known to heterodimerize with EcR at a later developmental stage, the simplest explanation for this observation is that extra USP protein is preventing EcR from forming the functional 20E receptor needed for glue synthesis in mid L3. Such a result is not expected if only a small amount of functional EcR/USP is needed to induce the glue genes.</p><p>Interestingly, other researchers have observed similar effects. One report generated clones of <italic>usp-/usp-</italic> mutant tissue in the salivary gland, and although they do not discuss the effects of glue production in mutant tissue, the presence of glue granules is apparent in the clones from late-L3 glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Ghbeish1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, others have noted that the 20E dependent differentiation of chemosensory neurons in the wing margin occurs precociously in the absence of USP function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Schubiger3">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, when target-gene expression is examined, transcripts from the <italic>BRC</italic> (<italic>BRC-Z1</italic>) accumulate earlier in development in mutant clones within the eye and wing discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Ghbeish1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Schubiger3">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations led to the hypothesis that in the absence of ligand, the EcR/USP heterodimer can act as a repressor in some tissues by binding to the response elements of a select group of target genes. The function of the hormone is to de-repress the target genes by removing the EcR/USP complex from the promoter region allowing other bound transcription factors to activate transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Schubiger2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus in a <italic>usp-</italic> clone, genes controlled by this mechanism should be precociously activated. We do not think that the induction of the glue genes is controlled by a de-repression of <italic>BRC</italic> through EcR/USP for two reasons. First, the glue genes are not induced (de-repressed) if <italic>EcR</italic> is silenced with an <italic>EcRi</italic> construct. Second, we do not see precocious activation of glue genes when a <italic>USPi</italic> construct is expressed.</p><p>Our model proposes that USP is acting as a repressor by heterodimerizing with EcR to prevent the association of EcR with another nuclear-hormone receptor (NR-X). Our hypothesis may also explain some of the data generated with the use of <italic>usp-</italic> clones in imaginal discs. For example, if we assume that movement of the morphogenetic furrow is induced by an earlier and lower pulse of 20E (as has been reported for <italic>Manduca</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Champlin1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, we would speculate that furrow movement is controlled by EcR/NR-X regulating downstream genes including <italic>BRC-Z1</italic>. The normal presence of USP in this tissue at that time might serve to control the amount of functional EcR/NR-X available for high-affinity hormone binding. Thus in a <italic>usp-</italic> clone, we would expect the morphogenetic furrow to move faster over the patch and the induction of <italic>BRC-Z1</italic> to be premature.

In any case, the induction of a 20E regulated pathway that does not require USP as part of the receptor has no precedence in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> literature. Thus, a better characterization of this response at the molecular level is critical for our understanding of normal insect development.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Transcriptional Regulation of the Glue Genes</title><p>In this report we demonstrate that EcR is necessary for the expression of most of the glue genes at mid L3, and that USP is not needed for this expression.

First, the active receptor may be a homodimer of EcR proteins. Homodimers are known to function as receptors for steroid hormones in vertebrates using a different mechanism of ligand activation than that observed with RXR heterodimeric receptors (USP is the insect homolog of RXR), but to our knowledge no biological activity has been ascribed to EcR homodimers during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Our analysis does not rule out the possibility that EcR homodimers are responsible for the induction of the glue genes.</p><p>The second possibility is that another member of the superfamily may be able to complex with EcR to transmit the hormone signal. Many of these receptors have pre-existing mutations and many more have <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> lines that are now available from the RNAi Stock Centers in Vienna (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vdrc.at">http://www.vdrc.at</ext-link>) and Japan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/fly/nigfly/index.jsp">http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/fly/nigfly/index.jsp</ext-link>).

To ascertain which of these was best for tissue-specific expression studies, we crossed them to a stock in which the <italic>hid/Wrinkled</italic> cell-death gene (FBgn0003997) was expressed under <italic>UAS</italic> control. Because the major function of the salivary gland in the larval stages is the reported synthesis of mucin-like proteins that help lubricate the food as it moves through the gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Zhimulev1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000102-Thomopoulos1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, we reasoned that animals could survive without a salivary gland only if they were provided a diet of freshly produced moist yeast paste. Thus, by using <italic>UAS-hid</italic> we could ablate the salivary gland and test if such animals were viable when raised on soft food.</p><p>The initial analysis using the above listed drivers indicated that no larvae were able to survive, probably due to expression of the <italic>hid</italic> gene in other vital tissues. But because these are derived from the <italic>GawB</italic> vector, we used a <italic>heat shock 70-Gal4</italic> driver that is also <italic>GawB</italic> derived. These animals were able to survive to puparium formation when crossed to <italic>UAS-hid</italic> and raised on a diet of freshly prepared yeast paste. Crossing <italic>hsGal4</italic> to a stock containing both <italic>UAS-hid</italic> and <italic>UAS-GFP.nls</italic> confirmed that larval salivary glands could not be detected and were ablated. Great care was exercised to raise the animals crossed to <italic>sgGal4</italic> at temperatures below 30&#x000b0;C to prevent exposing them to a stress that might induce <italic>Gal4</italic> in all cells. Because the <italic>GFP.nls</italic> transgene was used in most of the experiments, a non-specific response could easily be detected by the presence of green nuclei in other tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Salivary Gland Organ Culture</title><p>20E (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) was prepared as a stock solution of 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> M in 100&#x00025; ethanol and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. The stock solution was diluted to the proper working concentration in Schneider's medium (Sigma).</p><p>Flies of the appropriate genotype were crossed and reared in a small population cage containing approximately 500 females and 500 males. The cage was presented with hard-agar plates (10&#x00025; molasses, 3.5&#x00025; agar) containing a dab of fresh yeast paste (prepared as a 1&#x02236;1 mixture of dry baker's yeast with water) 2&#x02013;3 times per day to collect fertilized eggs. Collection plates were aged at 25&#x000b0;C and first-instar larvae were collected in 1-hour intervals as they hatched. The first-instar larvae were added in groups of 100 to vials containing standard cornmeal-molasses-yeast medium and aged at 25&#x000b0;C for approximately 68 hours (a developmental stage that precedes glue induction by approximately 4 hours) before being washed from the food with Schneider's medium. Animals were torn in half lengthwise using small dissecting forceps (Fine Scientific Tools, Foster City, California, United States). Larvae prepared in this manner were transferred to clean microscope slides containing 25 &#x000b5;l of Schneider's medium with or without 20E.

Small strips of Number 1 Whatman filter paper (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, United States) were placed around the culture as spacers before adding a 22 mm<sup>2</sup> coverslip. The culture was placed on a platform shaker in a box into which O<sub>2</sub> was continuously infused during the culture period.
