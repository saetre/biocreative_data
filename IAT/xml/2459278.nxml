This is exemplified in the cardiovascular system where sGC governs smooth muscle tone and growth, vascular permeability, leukocyte flux, and platelet aggregation. As a consequence, aberrant NO-sGC signaling has been linked to diseases including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and stroke. Despite these key (patho)physiological roles, little is known about the expressional regulation of sGC. To address this deficit, we have characterized the promoter activity of human &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC genes in a cell type relevant to cardiovascular (patho)physiology, primary human aortic smooth muscle cells. Luciferase reporter constructs revealed that the 0.3- and 0.5-kb regions upstream of the transcription start sites were optimal for &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter activity, respectively. Deletion of consensus sites for c-Myb, GAGA, NFAT, NF-&#x003ba;B(p50), and CCAAT-binding factor(s) (CCAAT-BF) revealed that these are the principal transcription factors regulating basal sGC expression. In addition, under pro-inflammatory conditions, the effects of the strongest &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC repressors were enhanced, and enzyme expression and activity were reduced; in particular, NF-&#x003ba;B(p50) is pivotal in regulating enzyme expression under such conditions. NO itself also elicited a cGMP-independent negative feedback effect on sGC promoter activity that is mediated, in part, via CCAAT-BF activity. In sum, these data provide a systematic characterization of the promoter activity of human sGC &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits and identify key transcription factors that govern subunit expression under basal and pro-inflammatory (<italic>i.e.</italic> atherogenic) conditions and in the presence of ligand NO.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by the <grant-sponsor>Wellcome Trust</grant-sponsor>.

Pivotal to NO-mediated modification of cell function is activation of the hemoprotein soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref> and consequent production of the second messenger cGMP, which in turn activates specific cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, ion channels, and phosphodiesterases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). This fundamental role for sGC as the principal intracellular receptor for NO is exemplified in the cardiovascular system, where the enzyme governs smooth muscle tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), vascular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), platelet reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), and leukocyte extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).</p><p>Soluble GC functions as an obligate heterodimer composed of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Within the last decade, the localization and structure of the genes encoding for sGC subunits have been elucidated in several mammalian species, nonvertebrates, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). In mammals, two isoforms of each subunit, called &#x003b1;<sub>1,2</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1,2</sub>, have been cloned and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). However, to date only &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>/&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>/&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> heterodimers have been identified at the protein level. The chromosomal localization of sGC genes has been determined in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>); in both cases the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits are co-localized on the same locus, whereas &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> lie on separate chromosomes.</p><p>Previous reports have provided evidence that expressional regulation of the enzyme is a key means of modulating NO-sGC signaling. For instance, different tissues possess distinct levels of mRNA for sGC isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), intimating tissue-specific expression of individual sGC subunits. Furthermore, splice variants of the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC subunit mRNA have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). In contrast, the human &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit is encoded by a single transcript (&#x0223c;3.5kb), suggesting the translation of a single protein. Such observations suggest that the expression of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit is somewhat invariant, whereas alterations in the expression of the &#x003b1; subunit(s) may be an important physiological control mechanism.</p><p>Changes in the expression of sGC have also been linked with disease states, intimating that expressional regulation of the enzyme is likely to have (patho)physiological significance. For instance, in aged and spontaneously hypertensive rats, expression of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit is diminished and correlates with elevations in systemic blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Moreover, salt-sensitive hypertension in Dahl rats is associated with decreased and increased expression of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> subunits, respectively, suggesting that exchange of &#x003b2; subunits may be critical to blood pressure regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). In animal models of pulmonary hypertension, sGC expression is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>), and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells exposed to hypoxia lose their ability to express sGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Reduced &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC expression also correlates with intimal thickening following balloon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Exposure of cells and/or tissues to pro-inflammatory cytokines, or NO itself, also induces changes in sGC expression. For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin 1&#x003b2;, and NO donors cause reduced sGC &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> mRNA expression in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), and in atherogenic lesions reduced sGC expression is linked to diminished cGMP-dependent signaling and neointimal proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). In contrast, augmented &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit expression has been linked to increased nitrovasodilator potency in animals with endothelial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) and increased vasodilator response in aortic rings from rats after myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>).</p><p>These observations intimate that expressional regulation of sGC plays a key role in the cardiovascular system, both in terms of physiological homeostasis and pathogenesis. Despite these reports, however, there is a paucity of information regarding the regulation of sGC promoter activity, particularly in the human vasculature where the enzyme performs such an important physiological function. Previous studies have examined the promoter activity of individual sGC subunits in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>), yet only a single study has focused on the human &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Here, a key role for a CCAAT-binding factor (CCAAT-BF) was revealed, although this analysis was conducted in a neuronal, rather than cardiovascular, cell line. Thus, there is a key requirement to understand the factors regulating human &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter activity in the human vasculature to more fully appreciate the physiological roles and regulation of the NO receptor and how aberrant expression may underlie cardiovascular pathogenesis. To address this need, herein we investigated the transcriptional regulation of human &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC genes in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p><italic>Cell Culture</italic>&#x02014;HASMCs (PromoCell) were cultured in smooth muscle cell growth medium 2 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor, 2 ng/ml recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor, 5 mg/ml recombinant human insulin, and 0.62 ng/ml phenol red (PromoCell).

Bacterial artificial chromosome DNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. The full promoters of human &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC were isolated from the bacterial artificial chromosome clones by PCR using Accuprime&#x02122; Taq high fidelity DNA polymerase, using primers based on the 5<sup>&#x02032;</sup>-flanking regions of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> (AY034777) and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> (AY034778) sGC genes including the first exon.

This kit was also used to repair errors during the construction of luciferase deletion constructs. All of the constructs were verified by direct sequencing.</p><p><italic>Transient Transfections</italic>&#x02014;3,500 HASMCs/well and 15,000 COS-7 cells/well were seeded in 96-well clear plates 1 day before transfection. The cells were transfected with 50 ng of plasmid DNA/well using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) with a 3:1 ratio (&#x003bc;l reagent:&#x003bc;g DNA). pGL3 control vector (Promega) was used as a transfection control. In each case, the cells were co-transfected with a pRL-TK vector expressing <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (Promega) at a 10:1 ratio (test vector:pRL-TK vector). Twenty-four hours later, where indicated cells were treated with either (<italic>a</italic>) &#x0201c;pro-inflammatory mixture&#x0201d; (100 mg/ml LPS (<italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>; Sigma), 200 units/ml IFN-&#x003b3;, 400 units/ml interleukin-1&#x003b2;, and 2000 units/ml tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (all Preprotech) in cell culture medium) or (<italic>b</italic>) the NO donor DETA-NONOate (DETA-NO; 0&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>).</p><p><italic>Luciferase Assays</italic>&#x02014;Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min at room temperature using the passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) on the Wallac Victor 2 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase derived from pRL-TK vector, and the data are expressed as relative luciferase light units.</p><p><italic>Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)</italic>&#x02014;HASMC plated in 6-cm tissue culture dishes were stimulated for 2 h with the pro-inflammatory mixture or DETA-NO (100 or 200 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), nuclear extracts were prepared, and samples were subjected to EMSA, as we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). The primers used to generate the double-stranded probes are shown in supplemental Fig. S2.</p><p><italic>Western Blot Analysis</italic>&#x02014;Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce, distributed by Perbio Sciences Ltd., Northumberland, UK). Equal concentrations of protein were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using the mini Trans-blot electrophoresis transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The membranes were stained with Ponceau S stain to confirm equal transfer and incubated in 5% milk in wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C with gentle shaking. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibody (anti-sGC &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>) or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam, Coventry, UK) diluted 1:2000 (&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>) or 1:1000 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) in 5% milk in wash buffer for 3 h at room temperature with constant agitation followed by five washes (5 min/wash). The membranes were then incubated with shaking for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, Cambridgeshire, UK) diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk in wash buffer. The membranes were washed as described above, and the proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were quantified by densitometry using AlphaImager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA).</p><p><italic>Cyclic GMP Measurements</italic>&#x02014;HASMC (10<sup>6</sup> cells) were plated in 10-cm dishes and 24 h later exposed to the pro-inflammatory mixture for a further 24 h. At this time, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and centrifuged at 200 &#x000d7; g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in assay buffer (2.36 mg/100 ml Tris-HCl, 760 mg/100 ml NaCl, 22.2 mg/100 ml KCl, 29.6 mg/100 ml MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 16.6 mg/100 ml Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.01 mg/100 ml CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) and treated with 1 m<sc>m</sc> 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma).

The cyclic GMP content was then measured using a commercially available assay (Amersham Biosciences).</p><p><italic>Bioinformatics and Statistical Analysis</italic>&#x02014;BLAST was used to identify and retrieve orthologous &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoters from mouse, rat, and human genomes from project <italic>Ensembl</italic> at The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. The &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC upstream sequence was analyzed for the presence of repeat regions and transposable elements, using Repeat Masker version open-3.1.5. Confirmation of Pol II promoter was conducted with Promoter Scan II and Novel Neural Network Promoter Prediction. Identification of CpG islands was performed using CpGProD (CpG Island Promoter Detection) software. In silico analysis for transcription factor-binding sites was performed with MatInspector Suite, release 7.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>).

Scanning both &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC sequences with the Novel Neural Network Algorithms for Improved Eukaryotic Promoter Site Recognition did not reveal any TATA box in close proximity to the transcription start site of both &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoters. Analysis of promoter core elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>) showed the presence of consensus Inr (initiator) and DPE (downstream core promoter) elements but not TFIIB recognition (BRE) or the newly discovered motif 10 (MTE) elements in the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter (supplemental Fig. S3). For the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter, only DPE elements were found (supplemental Fig. S3). GC and CCAAT-BF boxes were detected in both proximal promoters. Furthermore, using Repeat Masker, we were able to identify three repeats in the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter but only one in the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> promoter region (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

In both A0.3-kb and B0.5-kb constructs, putative TF-binding sites for several transcription factors located at the optimal regulatory distance from the transcription start site were investigated. To functionally determine the importance of these TFs for &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter activity, the cores of each TF-binding site were deleted individually in both the A0.3-kb and B0.5-kb basal constructs via site-directed mutagenesis.

Pilot studies revealed that for the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> subunit, the promoter activity was inhibited to the greatest extent in the A0.3 construct, suggesting that key NO-dependent repressors are located in this region of the promoter. For &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC, maximal inhibition was observed in the B0.5 construct, suggesting that this area of the promoter contains the critical NO-responsive repressor element(s). Subsequent studies were therefore conducted using these constructs. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> shows that NO exerted a concentration-dependent inhibition of both &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter activity.

Moreover, the inhibition of promoter activity by NO followed a time course very similar to that observed under pro-inflammatory conditions with maximal effect observed at 24&#x02013;48 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the repressor activity of NO was cGMP-dependent or independent, further experiments were conducted using the A0.3 and B0.5 constructs as models of promoter function. Here, the NO-dependent inhibition of both the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter was not reversed in the presence of the sGC blocker ODQ (5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) nor mimicked by the cGMP analogue 8-Br-cGMP (300 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). Thus, it appears that the inhibitory effect of NO on sGC promoter activity and expression is mediated directly, rather than via activation of the enzyme (and cGMP production).</p><p>In an attempt to identify putative transcription factors that might mediate the repressor effects of NO, A0.3, and B0.5 constructs with targeted mutations in specific TF-binding sites were analyzed for their responsiveness to NO. Interestingly, the activity of the A0.3 fragment with a deleted CCAAT-BF site was no longer sensitive to inhibition by DETA-NO (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>), intimating that this response element is involved in mediating the negative feedback effect of NO on sGC expression.

As such, under physiological circumstances activation of sGC is fundamental to cardiovascular homeostasis and maintains an important cytoprotective/anti-thrombotic influence. Moreover, because inappropriate sGC activity may be responsible for several features of cardiovascular pathologies including blood pressure dysregulation (<italic>i.e.</italic> smooth muscle reactivity), capillary edema, and cellular recruitment, dysfunction of sGC is likely to have at least an equivalent impact on (patho)physiology as inappropriate NO production; changes in the expressional regulation (and activity) of this enzyme are therefore likely to exert considerable influence on the progression of disease. Despite this obvious importance, there exists scant information concerning the physiological regulation and pathological alterations of sGC expression. To address this deficit, we have characterized the human &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter regions in human aortic smooth muscle cells.</p><p>Analysis of the human &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC gene promoters revealed some intriguing aspects of transcriptional regulation of these genes and differences in the promoter consensus core elements. Both sGC genes have a TATA-less promoter and show CCAAT-BF sites in direct (&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC) or reverse (&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC) orientation &#x0223c;80 bp upstream from the putative transcription start site, in agreement with the canonical position for eukaryotic promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). Classically, the following three-way combinations are highly favorable in human promoter regions to facilitate gene transcription: BRE-Inr-MTE and/or TATA-Inr-MTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>); yet, neither combination was detected in either the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> or &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter. However, because the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter exhibits two potential initiation modules, an alternative transcription start site 51 bp downstream given by the Inr-DPE module (and characteristic of TATA-less promoters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>) cannot be ruled out. Surprisingly, an Inr element is not present in the human &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter.</p><p>Functional analysis of constructs containing different size fragments of the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC 5&#x02032;-flanking regions showed a slightly different profile of activity between both subunit promoters in HASMCs. Despite &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC showing the highest promoter activity in the A0.3-kb construct, suggesting repressor elements localized further upstream, the situation was different for &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC. Here, the B0.5-kb construct showed the highest promoter activity, and the presence of several enhancers and repressors functioning at a distance from this regulatory region was detected. The fact that B0.5-kb activity was comparable with B0.8kb activity in HASMCs but has been shown to be over 3-fold lower than B0.8 kb in BE2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>), suggests a cell-specific regulation of the crucial promoter region necessary to achieve the maximum &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter activity in HASMCs. This cell-specific effect is also highlighted by the fact that B0.4-kb activity is almost the same as B0.5 kb and 2-fold higher than B0.3 kb in HASMCs, intimating strong activator elements located in the &#x02013;253 to &#x02013;354 region, not observed in BE2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Thus, A0.3-kb and B0.5-kb constructs demonstrated the highest promoter activity in HASMCs, indicating that the regulatory promoter of sGC has all the necessary elements for maximum promoter activity in the 300&#x02013;500-bp region upstream of the transcription start site.</p><p>We also focused on the identification of principal TFs responsible for the transcriptional regulation of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC in HASMCs. A multiplicity of putative transcription factor-binding sites predicted by MatInspector software are clustered in both A0.3-kb (&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC) and B0.5-kb (&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC) promoter fragments, all of which have been shown to play an important role in the transcription of a wide variety of eukaryotic genes. GATA (GATA-binding factor, typical of the cardiovascular system), GFI1 (growth factor independence I; typical of the hematopoietic system), NFY (ubiquitous), and PBX (homeodomain factor; typical of the hematopoietic system) have consensus sequences in both promoters, and some of these factors may have a regulatory role in the co-expression of both &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC genes; this is particularly pertinent for the GFI1 (both &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC) and PBX (&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC) sites, which are positioned between the CCAAT-BF site and the transcription start site and therefore are likely to play key roles in expressional regulation of sGC in hematopoiesis. Indeed, the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter regions contain no less than 20 consensus sequences for TFs reported to play a role in regulating hematopoiesis, supporting a key role for sGC in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>).</p><p>Functional analysis with a luciferase &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC reporter construct containing a c-Myb, GAGA, NFAT, or CCAAT-BF core deletion in the A0.3-kb promoter fragment demonstrated that the integrity of these sites is very important for transcription repression in HASMCs. The c-Myb and to a lesser extent the GAGA and NFAT repressor effects were not observed in COS-7 cells, intimating a vascular smooth muscle cell-specific effect. In fact, c-Myb plays a crucial role in arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation (associated with G<sub>1</sub>/S cell cycle transition), as occurs in many vasculopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>) and NFAT is associated with cardiac morphogenesis, vasculogenesis, and vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>); the physiological importance of NO-sGC signaling in curbing these proliferative processes fits with the ability of such TFs to suppress sGC promoter activity and thereby promote pathogenesis. However, it is noteworthy that when two other NFAT sites located at &#x02013;174 and &#x02013;161 in &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC were mutated, they did not significantly alter &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter activity.</p><p>Functional analysis with a luciferase &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC reporter construct containing a NFY core deletion in the B0.5-kb promoter fragment revealed that this site is critical for transcription activation in HASMCs, although this effect was less evident than in COS-7 cells (this study) and BE2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Similar analysis also showed that the integrity of an NF-&#x003ba;B(p50) site is very important for transcription repression control, in both HASMCs and COS-7 cells, suggesting that this TF is globally important in constitutive gene expression.</p><p>To corroborate the importance of these TFs in regulation of sGC promoter activity, we conducted EMSAs to confirm the interaction of CCAAT-BF and NF-&#x003ba;B with the sGC promoter region. It is clear from these data that both CCAAT-BF and NF-&#x003ba;B(p50) bind strongly to the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter constructs, respectively, and that the effects of these TFs on sGC promoter activity are specific. A CCAAT-BF site has been found to be prevalent in the promoters of cell cycle-regulated eukaryotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>) and is known to be essential for cell cycle-dependent activation and repression of several mammalian genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>). In addition to the NFY site reported by Sharina <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>), a second upstream site was also shown to have an important role, highlighting the role NFY plays in &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC transcription. Moreover, the presence of the two closely situated NFY sites in the immediate promoter is in agreement with the idea that expression of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC gene could be regulated during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>).</p><p>Many cardiovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis, are now recognized to constitute a chronic inflammation of the blood vessel wall. Because NO-sGC-cGMP signaling exerts an important vasoprotective, anti-atherogenic effect, elucidation of the expressional regulation of sGC in a pro-inflammatory environment is likely to provide further insight into the pathogenesis of vascular disease. To mimic such a pathological scenario in the vasculature, we examined the effect of pro-inflammatory conditions on sGC promoter activity in HASMCs. A0.3-kb and B0.5-kb fragments were analyzed in the presence of a pro-inflammatory mixture. Under such conditions, sGC A0.3-kb and B0.5-kb promoter activity at 24 h was significantly reduced, demonstrating a coordinated regulation of both &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC gene expression. The fact that the strongest repressors for &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> ad &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC (CCAAT-BF and NF-&#x003ba;B, respectively) exhibit enhanced DNA binding under pro-inflammatory conditions might explain, at least in part, the reduction in &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter activity observed under this &#x0201c;pathogenic&#x0201d; environment. Moreover, analysis of protein expression confirmed that the decreased promoter activity in the presence of pro-inflammatory mixture was mirrored by reductions in both sGC &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> protein expression and activity, providing a key link between NF-&#x003ba;B and regulation of sGC bioactivity.</p><p>We also examined the effect of NO <italic>per se</italic> to mediate a feedback loop and prevent sGC promoter activity/expression. Using the NO donor DETA-NO, we demonstrated that NO exerts a concentration-dependent reduction in &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> sGC promoter activity. In these studies, the inhibitory effect of NO peaked at 200 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> DETA-NO, which results in an ambient NO concentration of &#x0223c;200 n<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>), more akin to those associated with inducible NO synthase activity and pathological conditions (rather than generated by constitutive NO synthase). Moreover, the effects of NO in this respect appear to be cGMP-independent, implying direct effects on TF activity (as has been shown for NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>) and HIF-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>)). These studies also revealed that a CCAAT-BF site is pivotal to the inhibitory effects of NO, at least in terms of the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> subunit, because deletion of this site leads to insensitivity to NO. Because several TFs bind this site, it is difficult to pinpoint which might be responsible; despite attempts to use EMSA-based supershifts to derive information concerning the identity of this TF, we were unable to elucidate the mechanism further (although we did obtain negative results for CBF-B and MAZ, suggesting that it is not either of these factors).</p><p>The inflammation- and NO-based reduction in sGC promoter activity and protein expression might be likely to represent a common negative feedback regulation of sGC expression in cardiovascular disorders associated with high output NO production, such as septic shock. Here, it would be appropriate for sGC expression to be down-regulated to offset the excessive NO levels and thereby reverse the associated, life-threatening hypotension. These data also suggest that the reduction in sGC mRNA levels reported in vascular smooth muscle cells in response to LPS/interleukin-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;/LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>), and NO donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>) is likely to be due, at least in part, to a direct down-regulation in sGC promoter activity via NF-&#x003ba;B(p50)- and CCAAT-BF-dependent pathways.</p><p>In sum, these data provide a systematic, comparative analysis of human sGC promoter regulation in HASMCs and has identified potentially important factors regulating human sGC expression within a cell system relevant to cardiovascular physiology and (patho)physiology. These observations suggest that expressional regulation of human sGC &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit expression, both coordinated and individually, is likely to play an important role in the (patho)physiological regulation of enzyme activity. As such, these findings represent a significant advance in the understanding of expressional regulation of the genes encoding sGC subunits and provide insight into potential pathogenic mechanisms that result in aberrant NO-sGC signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M801223200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M801223200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Hobbs, A.
