Oxidative lesions in mtDNA are removed by a base excision repair (BER) pathway. All mtDNA repair proteins are nuclear encoded and imported. Most mtDNA repair proteins so far discovered are either identical to nuclear DNA repair proteins or isoforms of nuclear proteins arising from differential splicing. Regulation of mitochondrial BER is therefore not expected to be independent of nuclear BER, though the extent to which mitochondrial BER is regulated with respect to mtDNA amount or damage is largely unknown. Here we have measured DNA BER activities in lysates of mitochondria isolated from human 143B TK<sup>&#x02013;</sup> osteosarcoma cells that had been depleted of mtDNA (&#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>) or not (wt). Despite the total absence of mtDNA in the &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, a complete mitochondrial BER pathway was present, as demonstrated using an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay with synthetic oligonucleotides. Measurement of individual BER protein activities in mitochondrial lysates indicated that some BER activities are insensitive to the lack of mtDNA. Uracil and 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase activities were relatively insensitive to the absence of mtDNA, only about 25&#x00025; reduced in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> relative to wt cells. Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease and polymerase &#x003b3; activities were more affected, 65 and 45&#x00025; lower, respectively, in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria. Overall BER activity in lysates was also about 65&#x00025; reduced in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria. To identify the limiting deficiencies in BER of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria we supplemented the BER assay of mitochondrial lysates with pure uracil DNA glycosylase, AP endonuclease and/or the catalytic subunit of polymerase &#x003b3;. BER activity was stimulated by addition of uracil DNA glycosylase and polymerase &#x003b3;. However, no addition or combination of additions stimulated BER activity to wt levels. This suggests that an unknown activity, factor or interaction important in BER is deficient in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria. While nuclear BER protein levels and activities were generally not altered in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, AP endonuclease activity was substantially reduced in nuclear and in whole cell extracts. This appeared to be due to reduced endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, and not a general dysfunction of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, as exposure of cells to ROS rapidly stimulated increases in AP endonuclease activities and APE1 protein levels.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Oxidative attack of DNA results in a wide range of chemical modifications, many of which are highly mutagenic. Genomic stability is maintained, in part, by reversing and/or repairing these lesions before mutations can occur. In the nucleus this task is accomplished primarily by the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which first recognizes and cleaves specific base lesions from DNA, followed by abasic site processing, gap-filling and ligation of the DNA strand. Mammalian mitochondria, which contain their own (16.5 kb) DNA molecule, have their own DNA repair systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c1">1</xref>). The mitochondrial BER proteins that have been identified are virtually all either identical to those found in the nucleus or are isoforms of nuclear BER proteins arising from variant RNA splicing. Little is known about the molecular organization of BER in mammalian mitochondria. Similarly, limited information is available regarding the regulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) repair, including the extent to which it is regulated independently of nuclear BER. Mitochondrial genomic stability is adversely affected in numerous human pathologies, including cancers, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c2">2</xref>), yet the mechanisms by which cells repair mtDNA damage and maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial genome remain incompletely understood.</p><p>Cultured cells lacking mtDNA have provided useful models for studying human mitochondrial diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c3">3</xref>) and the regulation of proteins involved in mtDNA transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c5">5</xref>). Many human cell lines can be rendered mtDNA-less (&#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>) in culture by growth in the presence of low concentrations of the intercalating agent ethidium bromide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c6">6</xref>). These cells lose their ability to respire, but meet their energy needs via anaerobic glycolysis, even though cultured at atmospheric oxygen concentrations. The mitochondria of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells maintain a membrane potential sufficient for import of nuclear-encoded proteins by coordinated action of the F<sub>1</sub> ATPase and adenine nucleotide translocator, which together maintain the electrogenic exchange of ATP/ADP across the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c8">8</xref>). The gross morphology of mitochondria in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells is similar to that of wild-type cells, though swelling is often apparent in the former. &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells maintain their responsiveness to many apoptotic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c9">9</xref>), and divide at an only marginally slower rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c10">10</xref>). Thus, &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells are a viable model for studying the impact of mtDNA-deficiency on cell biology.</p><p>Interestingly, some proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance and replication are apparently insensitive to the absence of mtDNA. Polymerase &#x003b3;, the sole mtDNA polymerase, continues to be expressed and localizes to mitochondria in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c9">9</xref>). In contrast, expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA), involved in mtDNA packaging and transcriptional activation, is profoundly depressed in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells. Levels of this protein strongly correlate with mtDNA amount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c5">5</xref>).</p><p>It is not known to what extent the proteins involved in maintaining mtDNA integrity are sensitive to mtDNA levels, damage, or indeed to the absence of mtDNA. Here, we have developed the use of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells as an experimental model with which to study aspects of the organization and regulation of mitochondrial BER. Through these investigations, we have identified possible key regulatory steps in the BER pathway for repair of mtDNA, as well as aspects of mitochondrial BER regulation. We have also investigated the effect of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> status on nuclear BER activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Purified proteins</title><p>Human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease 1 (APE1) was made as in Erzberger <italic>et al</italic>.

To assess the comparative enrichment of wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondrial fractions for mitochondrial proteins (i.e. the proportional abundance of mitochondrial proteins versus cellular contaminants), we measured the activity of CS, a tricarboxylic acid cycle protein present in the mitochondrial matrix. The specific activity of CS was marginally higher in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondrial fractions relative to wt (not shown), indicating that enrichment of the fraction for mitochondria was at least as great in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> preparations as in wt. CS activity measured in WCEs was also similar in wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells (not shown), which validates this use of CS activity to gauge mitochondrial enrichment.</p></sec><sec><title>Mitochondrial BER in wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells</title><p>mtDNA repair protein activities were determined individually using <italic>in vitro</italic> assays in which mitochondrial lysates were incubated with oligonucleotide substrates containing specific lesions at defined positions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh533tb1">1</xref>).

All mtDNA repair proteins and activities examined were present in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, although generally at reduced levels (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f3">3</xref>). The magnitudes of differences in BER protein levels between wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> were highly dependent upon the individual protein. DNA glycosylase activities (UDG, OGG1) were only slightly reduced in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria. UDG activity, measured as incision of ssU, was about 25&#x00025; lower in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria relative to wt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f2">2</xref>a and b). OGG1 activity, measured as incision of an 8-oxodG-containing oligonucleotide (OG), was also about 25&#x00025; lower in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f2">2</xref>c).</p><p>In contrast, mitochondrial AP endonuclease activity and APE1 protein levels were much more affected by the absence of mtDNA. Mitochondrial AP endonuclease activity was assayed as incision of an oligonucleotide containing a THF abasic site analog (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh533tb1">1</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f3">3</xref>a shows a representative gel with the migration of substrates and products as indicated by the arrows. Incision activity in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria was approximately 65&#x00025; lower than in wt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f3">3</xref>b). Though it has not been clearly established that APE1 is the major mitochondrial AP endonuclease, a reduction in APE1 protein levels was seen in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f3">3</xref>c), indicating good agreement between AP endonuclease activity and APE1 protein.</p><p>mtDNA polymerase &#x003b3;, as the only mtDNA polymerase in human cells, is an essential component of the BER pathway. Polymerase &#x003b3; gap-filling activity was measured using an assay that monitored &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCTP incorporation into an oligonucleotide containing a single nucleotide gap with processed 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; termini (GAP oligo, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh533tb1">1</xref>). To ensure that a possible deficiency in mtDNA ligase activity would not limit the nucleotide incorporation activity of polymerase &#x003b3;, exogenous pure T4 DNA ligase was added as indicated. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f3">3</xref>d shows a representative gel in which the 21mer unligated intermediate and the ligated full-length 39mer can be discerned. Polymerase &#x003b3; activity was quantified both by measuring signal intensity of the 21mer and 39mer (&#x02013;T4 ligase), and by measuring only the signal intensity of the 39mer (&#x0002b;T4 ligase). The graph in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f3">3</xref>e shows the mean signal intensities using the latter method. Polymerase &#x003b3; activity was approximately 45&#x00025; lower in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria, compared to wt. Comparison of the sum of 21mer and 39mer bands between wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria produced a similar result (not shown).</p><p>The mitochondrial BER pathway requires the coordinated activities of at least four proteins, a glycosylase, an AP endonuclease, polymerase &#x003b3; and DNA ligase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c16">16</xref>). We assessed the overall activity of the BER pathway in mitochondrial lysates using a uracil-initiated BER assay where &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCTP incorporation into a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a single uracil at position 12 in the sense strand (dsU; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh533tb1">1</xref>) was monitored. In this assay, following uracil removal, processing of the abasic site and &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCTP incorporation, ligation of the incised strand occurs at a relatively slow rate <italic>in vitro</italic>, with almost all &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCTP signal being detected in the 12mer polymerase product, and virtually no detectable ligated 30mer. The representative gel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f4">4</xref>a shows the 12-nucleotide intermediate of &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCTP incorporation without ligation. Comparisons of nucleotide incorporation were made by quantifying the &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCTP signal in the 12mer. The uracil-initiated BER activity of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria was approximately 60&#x00025; less than that of wt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f4">4</xref>b).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of sites of BER activity reduction in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria</title><p>The activities of AP endonuclease and uracil-initiated BER were reduced by similar amounts in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria relative to wt, which suggested that AP endonuclease may play a central role in reducing BER flux. This hypothesis was tested by complementing &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> uracil BER assays with exogenous recombinant APE1. If AP endonuclease catalyzed the rate-limiting step in mitochondrial BER, restoration of this activity by addition of pure APE1 should have restored wt BER activity. However, additions of 0.1&#x02013;5.0 pmol APE1 failed to stimulate uracil-initiated BER activity in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f5">5</xref>), though the protein was highly active in this range in other assays (for example, see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f3">3</xref>). Thus, reduced AP endonuclease activity did not appear to limit BER pathway activity in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria.</p><p>We used a similar approach to assess other possible site(s) of BER pathway flux reduction in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria. Supplementation of the uracil-initiated BER assay with 0.2 or 1.0 U of pure UDG stimulated BER activity, though only by approximately 20&#x00025;, and in both wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f5">5</xref>). However, uracil-initiated BER activity of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria remained well below wt levels. When pure polymerase &#x003b3; catalytic subunit was added to the BER assay, we observed considerable extension activity, in both wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria, complicating the interpretation of results. We therefore used a different uracil-containing oligonucleotide (34U; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh533tb1">1</xref>), and eliminated dNTPs other than dCTP from this assay. Complementation with polymerase &#x003b3; increased the amount of full-length product in both wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f6">6</xref>). Indeed, the amounts of ligated product were approximately equal in wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria. However, the levels of 16mer, representing incorporation without ligation, remained much lower in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria, relative to wt. Quantification of both bands in wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria showed that polymerase &#x003b3; complementation did stimulate uracil-initiated BER activity in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria, by about 100&#x00025;, though this activity still remained well below wt levels.</p><p>Finally, we compared uracil-initiated BER activity in wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria supplemented with UDG, APE1 and polymerase &#x003b3; catalytic subunit. Even with this simultaneous complementation of the first three steps in uracil-initiated BER, &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> activity remained lower than wt (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear BER in wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells</title><p>To confirm that differences in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> and wt mitochondrial BER were not simply due to general perturbations of nuclear BER in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, we measured BER activities in WCEs. Mitochondrial volume density of cultured cells is very low (typically &#x0223c;3&#x02013;5&#x00025;), and mitochondria therefore make a negligible contribution to measurements of BER protein activities made in whole cells. We found that whole cell DNA glycosylase (OGG1 and UDG) activities were largely unaffected by the absence of mtDNA. OGG1 incision activity was approximately the same in wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, and UDG activity was only 13&#x00025; lower (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f7">7</xref>). Similarly, OGG1 protein levels, measured by immunoblot of &#x003b1;OGG1 and &#x003b2;OGG1 proteins did not appear to be different in WCEs of wt versus &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f7">7</xref>a). The levels of other BER proteins, PCNA and polymerase &#x003b2; were also not lower in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>, relative to wt, cells. Indeed, DNA polymerase &#x003b2; levels appeared to be slightly elevated in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells. Thus, there was no evidence of a general impairment of DNA repair in the &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells.</p><p>In contrast, AP endonuclease protein levels and activities were significantly lower in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells. APE1 protein levels were visibly decreased, as determined by western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f8">8</xref>a), and AP endonuclease activity was approximately 25&#x00025; (data taken at 30 min incubation time) lower (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f8">8</xref>b and c). Interestingly, a more pronounced decrease in APE1 protein and AP endonuclease activities was found in nuclear extracts from &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, in which the reduction of AP endonuclease activity was about 65&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f8">8</xref>d&#x02013;f).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of oxidative stress on mitochondrial BER in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells</title><p>Some mtDNA repair protein activities were generally reduced in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> WCEs, but their presence indicates that they continue to be synthesized and translocated into the mitochondrial compartment in the absence of mtDNA. This provides an opportunity to investigate the nature of BER protein regulation by oxidative stress. Specifically, APE1 has been reported to translocate to mitochondria in human cells after oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c17">17</xref>). We investigated whether this could be elicited in the absence of mtDNA, directly by reactive oxygen species (ROS), or whether mtDNA damage was necessary for the response. We addressed this issue by focusing on the mitochondrial activities of two proteins: APE1, which translocates to mitochondria following hydrogen peroxide exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c17">17</xref>), and UDG, for which there is no evidence of an oxidative stress response. Cells were exposed to 250 &#x000b5;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 h, then either harvested immediately or allowed to recover in complete medium for 6 h before harvesting. Control cells were handled identically, but with no H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Mitochondrial UDG activity showed an initial decline following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in both wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f9">9</xref>a and b). At 6 h post-exposure, UDG activity in wt had recovered to control levels, but remained lower in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria. On the other hand, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced a substantial increase in mitochondrial AP endonuclease activity in both wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f9">9</xref>c and d). At 6 h post-exposure, mitochondrial AP endonuclease activity in wt cells was approximately 40&#x00025; higher than in controls. AP endonuclease activity in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria increased 3-fold at 0 h post-exposure, when &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> AP endonuclease activity was approximately equal to that of wt. However, at 6 h post-exposure, &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> AP endonuclease activity had declined and was approximately 50&#x00025; lower than in wt mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of oxidative stress on BER in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> WCEs</title><p>The effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure on BER proteins was examined in WCEs under the same experimental conditions. Whole cell levels of APE1 in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells were lower in control (untreated) cells and at 0 h following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f10">10</xref>a). However, at 6 h following exposure, APE1 protein in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells was approximately equal to wt levels. This was paralleled by an increase to wt levels of AP endonuclease activity in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells at 6 h post-exposure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f10">10</xref>b and c). Interestingly, UDG activity was also slightly increased in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh533f10">10</xref>d and e).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The continued localization of DNA BER proteins to the mitochondria of cells lacking mtDNA indicates that the signals involved in maintaining basal constitutive levels of some of these proteins are independent of actual mtDNA. In this respect, the regulation of mtDNA BER proteins differs from that of some other proteins involved in mtDNA transactions. The expression and/or protein levels of mtTFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c5">5</xref>), mtRNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c5">5</xref>) and mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein (mtSSB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c18">18</xref>) are all tightly regulated with respect to mtDNA levels. Indeed, in the absence of mtDNA, we were unable to detect mtTFA in mitochondria of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells by western blot.</p><p>mtDNA glycosylase activities were particularly insensitive to the absence of mtDNA, with UDG and OGG1 activities only about 25&#x00025; lower in the mitochondria of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, relative to wt. This apparent unresponsiveness to mtDNA status is consistent with the regulatory features of the <italic>OGG1</italic> gene. The <italic>hOGG1</italic> gene promoter lacks TATA or CAAT boxes, consistent with a housekeeping function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c19">19</xref>). Indeed, OGG1 expression and enzyme activity are invariant during the cell cycle and not altered in response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c20">20</xref>). Mitochondrial UDG, on the other hand, has a dedicated promoter distinct from that used to express the nuclear isoform and the expression of both UDG isoforms is cell-cycle regulated, and highest in S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c21">21</xref>). It is therefore possible that the lower mitochondrial UDG activity of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells is related to their slower replication rate. Nonetheless, taken together, our results suggest that both DNA glycosylase activities in mitochondria are expressed largely constitutively and not tightly regulated with respect to either mtDNA amount or oxidative stress.</p><p>In contrast to the DNA glycosylase activities, other steps in the mitochondrial BER pathway were more significantly altered in the absence of mtDNA. The most substantial reductions observed were in AP endonuclease activity, APE1 protein levels and polymerase &#x003b3; activity in mitochondria of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells. This latter observation is particularly interesting in light of reports that polymerase &#x003b3; protein levels are unchanged in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> relative to wt mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c4">4</xref>), and suggests a lower specific activity of polymerase &#x003b3; in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria. This result may indicate that polymerase &#x003b3; gap-filling activity is not regulated exclusively by the amount of the catalytic subunit. Indeed, other factors including the polymerase &#x003b3; accessory subunit affect polymerase &#x003b3;&#x02019;s interaction with oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c23">23</xref>). It is possible that, though the catalytic subunit is apparently present in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c24">24</xref>), it is in a non-optimal conformation that decreases its specific activity. The reason for this apparent discordance between polymerase &#x003b3; protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c4">4</xref>) and its measured gap-filling activity is not known, but may be interesting to investigate further.</p><p>While overall BER activity was substantially lower in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria relative to wt, some individual activities were little affected. To identify those activities which contributed most significantly to the reduced BER pathway activity, we supplemented the <italic>in vitro</italic> BER assay with exogenous proteins. While supplementation with UDG or APE1 elicited marginal or no increases in BER activity, addition of the polymerase &#x003b3; catalytic subunit stimulated activity appreciably. Importantly, however, the amount of the fully ligated product, but not the 16 nucleotide incorporation product, was increased. This interesting result suggests that an activity associated with polymerase &#x003b3; limits the rate of the ligation step both in wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria. It is likely that the dRp lyase activity of polymerase &#x003b3;, which immediately succeeds nucleotide incorporation and has a notably low <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c25">25</xref>), is a limiting step in mitochondrial BER. The <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for polymerase &#x003b3; dRp lyase is approximately 40-fold lower than that of DNA polymerase &#x003b2;, which is similarly thought to be rate-limiting in nuclear BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c26">26</xref>). The fact that the amount of full-length, ligated product was equal in polymerase &#x003b3;-complemented wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria further suggests that, under these conditions, DNA ligase activity becomes limiting and that the ligase activity is approximately equal in wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria. Taken together, these data suggest a rate-limiting role for the polymerase &#x003b3; dRp lyase step in mitochondrial BER. These results support the hypothesis outlined above, that despite sufficient levels of the polymerase &#x003b3; catalytic subunit, its gap-filling activity in BER is reduced. Even a large excess of the catalytic subunit was unable to stimulate wt levels of BER activity.</p><p>Large differences in APE1 protein levels and activities were found between wt and &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, both in mitochondrial and in nuclear compartments. Our data suggest that low endogenous ROS production was the underlying cause. Regulation of APE1 by oxidative stress is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c27">27</xref>), and ROS affects both cellular APE1 protein levels and translocation of APE1 to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c28">28</xref>). &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, which lack mitochondrial respiration, the major endogenous source of ROS, have reduced levels of endogenous ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c31">31</xref>). Here we have shown that they also have lower cellular, nuclear and mitochondrial levels of APE1. When we introduced oxidative stress to &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, APE1 levels and AP endonuclease activity increased rapidly (within 6 h) to wt levels, indicating that &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells retain the ability to modulate APE1 in response to oxidative stress. While we did not study cellular APE1 regulation exhaustively in the present work, our data do suggest that &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells may be a useful model with which to further investigate interactions between ROS and APE1.</p><p>AP endonuclease activity was the single most altered BER activity in the mitochondria of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells. APE1 protein levels appeared to be concomitantly reduced. However, it remains unknown whether APE1 is the major mitochondrial AP endonuclease, although our data favors this idea. Nonetheless, we used measurements of AP endonuclease activity to investigate ROS affects on mitochondrial AP endonuclease. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment increased mitochondrial AP endonuclease activity in wt cells by 40&#x00025; relative to untreated cells, at 6 h following hydrogen peroxide treatment. This result is similar to that of Frossi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh533c17">17</xref>), who demonstrated ROS-induced translocation of APE1 into mitochondria in a human B lymphocyte cell line. Taken together, the data suggest that ROS-induced regulation of mitochondrial AP endonuclease is a general feature of mitochondrial BER in human cells. The significance of this phenomenon, especially given the failure of exogenous APE1 to stimulate uracil-initiated mitochondrial BER <italic>in vitro</italic>, is unclear.</p><p>In summary, mtDNA glycosylase activities were relatively insensitive to the complete absence of mtDNA, consistent with a constitutive and not tightly regulated expression of these proteins in mitochondria. Nonetheless, mitochondrial BER activity was substantially reduced in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, although the reasons for this reduction are not completely clear. Moreover, while the addition of polymerase &#x003b3; catalytic subunit, and to a lesser extent UDG, stimulated BER activity, net BER activity in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria could not be increased to wt levels. &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells also had dramatically lower AP endonuclease protein levels and activities than wt cells, and our data are consistent with the interpretation that this phenomenon is due to lower endogenous oxidative stress in the absence of mitochondrial respiration in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells. The &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells appear to be an interesting and useful model for identifying details of how mitochondrial respiration and mtDNA affect both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage and repair.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh533f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Verification of the absence of mtDNA and purity of isolated mitochondrial fractions.
