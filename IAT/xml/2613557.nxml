At present, there is no cure for the disease and as of now there are no early diagnostic tests for AD. There is an urgency to develop a novel promising biomarker for early diagnosis of AD. Using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry SELDI-(MS) proteomic technology, we identified and purified a novel 11.7-kDa metal- binding protein biomarker whose content is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the brain of AD dementia subjects as a function of clinical dementia. Following purification and protein-sequence analysis, we identified and classified this biomarker as S100A7, a protein known to be involved in immune responses. Using an adenoviral-S100A7 expression system, we continued to examine the potential role of S100A7 in AD amyloid neuropathology in <italic>in vitro</italic> model of AD. We found that the expression of exogenous S100A7 in primary cortico-hippocampal neuron cultures derived from Tg2576 transgenic embryos inhibits the generation of &#x003b2;-amyloid (A&#x003b2;)<sub>1&#x02013;42</sub> and A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40</sub> peptides, coincidental with a selective promotion of &#x0201c;non- amyloidogenic&#x0201d; &#x003b1;-secretase activity via promotion of ADAM (<underline>a d</underline>isintegrin <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>m</underline>etalloproteinase)-10. Finally, a selective expression of human S100A7 in the brain of transgenic mice results in significant promotion of &#x003b1;-secretase activity. Our study for the first time suggests that S100A7 may be a novel biomarker of AD dementia and supports the hypothesis that promotion of S100A7 expression in the brain may selectively promote &#x003b1;-secretase activity in the brain of AD precluding the generation of amyloidogenic peptides. If in the future we find that S1000A7 protein content in CSF is sensitive to drug intervention experimentally and eventually in the clinical setting, S100A7 might be developed as novel surrogate index (biomarker) of therapeutic efficacy in the characterization of novel drug agents for the treatment of AD.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among people age 65 and older. AD affects approximately 4 million Americans, of which nearly half are in health care institutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-National1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Both neuritic senile plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the pathological hallmarks of the disease, with progressive loss of neurons in the brain. In some vulnerable brain regions, such as certain cortical areas, more than 50&#x00025; or even up to 70&#x00025;&#x02013;90&#x00025; of neurons are lost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Bussiere1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result, a diseased brain may show overall shrinkage, severe cortical atrophy, and ventricular enlargement in late stages of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Thompson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>At present, there is no cure for the disease and early diagnosis is all but impossible. The onset of disease is not manifested clinically and little is known regarding the cause of non-familiar AD. There is also no definite clinical method to determine in which patients with mild cognitive impairment progresses to AD with dementia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Takeuchi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Ward1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, there is an urgency to develop a novel promising biomarker for early diagnosis of AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Takeuchi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>AD often goes unrecognized or is misdiagnosed in its early stages, often because its symptoms are mistaken for inevitable consequences of aging. Even as the disease progresses, clinical diagnosis can be made with only 65&#x00025;&#x02013;90&#x00025; accuracy. A definitive diagnosis of AD can only be made after death, when autopsy can reveal senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue. The plaques result from aggregation of &#x003b2;-amyloid peptides and were thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD; however, their presence does not always correlate with neurologic symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Keating1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Identification of an AD biomarker for early clinical AD diagnosis is a critical first step in the development of methodologies for early disease intervention, and would have several advantages. It would be able to identify AD at a very early stage of the disease, before the cognitive symptoms are found in neuropsychologic tests, and before brain-imaging studies could reveal degeneration. Differential diagnosis of AD is difficult, and a biomarker reflecting neuropathologic changes at the molecular level in the brain could distinguish AD patients not only from those individuals with mild cognitive impairment who do not develop AD but also from patients with depression. A biomarker would also greatly help screening new therapies, especially those directed to prevent neuropathological changes. Until now, AD cannot be diagnosed by a valid clinical method or a biomarker before the disease has progressed so far that dementia is present. Furthermore, no valid method is available to determine which patient with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to AD. Therefore, a correct diagnosis in the early stage of AD is not only of importance considering that early drug treatment is more effective but also that the psychological burden of the patients and relatives could be decreased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Leuner1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.Many ante-mortem biochemical markers for AD have been investigated. Plasma, erythrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Bosman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Pirttil1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, urine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Ghanbari1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, hair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Bonaf1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Heinonen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, have all been analyzed.</p><p>Clinical trials of novel therapeutic strategies in AD are disadvantaged by our lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Because AD cannot be diagnosed until well into the disease cycle, clinical trials with potential novel disease-modifying drugs are conducted in advanced AD dementia cases, which often mean that the disease is too far along for the agents to have much effect. In addition, there is the lack of understanding in the mechanism that supports application of specific drugs and the lack of a rational dose and clinical stage of AD for application of novel drugs to treatment populations. Further characterization of novel indexes of AD clinical progression and pathophysiology may provide insight that might facilitate the development of &#x0201c;customized&#x0201d; therapeutic intervention for specific stages of the disease. Because AD is sometimes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, it is extremely important to identify robust and easily measured biological markers for the disease, especially markers that detect early or impending disease. Such a panel of markers could allow for early therapeutic treatment intervention to potentially restore memory formation, stop the deposition of insoluble amyloid-beta plaques and prevent neurodegeneration. Biomarkers may also allow real-time testing to monitor whether disease progression has been changed by therapeutic interventions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Selkoe1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study using proteomic approaches we report for the first time the identification and characterized of a protein S100A7 previously implicated in inflammatory responses and cell differentiation among other functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Watson1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> in the CSF and brain of AD.

Control subjects had no signs or symptoms of cognitive decline or neurologic disease including epilepsy; all subjects had a MMSE score between 28 and 30; a CDR score of 0; and NYU paragraph recall scores (immediate and delayed) &#x0003e;6. Lumbar puncture (LP) was performed with a 24G spinal needle. Individuals remained at bed rest for one hour following LP. Only AD patients with pathological confirmation of AD according to NIA-Reagan criteria (high), to the exclusion of Lewy body disease or vascular disease were included in this study. All CSF for proteomic analysis was taken from the 15<sup>th</sup> to 25<sup>th</sup> ml collected to limit variations arising from rostral-caudal gradient. In addition, all LP was performed in the morning to limit potential circadian fluctuation of CSF proteins and metabolites. Clear CSF specimens were collected and immediately frozen and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. The protein concentration in CSF is relatively low compared to plasma (CSF:plasma&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1/20&#x02013;100), and in addition, the protein profiles in CSF are similar to those in plasma, suggesting that even a minor contamination of CSF with blood could significantly confound the interpretation of quantitative proteomic analysis of CSF. To minimize blood contamination in our CSF samples, only CSF samples with &#x0003c;10 RBCs/ml and a serum: CSF ApoB (a protein not generated in CNS) CSF protein expression profiles were analyzed using high-throughput SELDI mass spectrometry. Control samples were always run in parallel with the experimental samples and the signals in the resulting profiles of each chip were simultaneously normalized and represented individually, via integrated software, allowing for direct comparison of individual protein expression profiles. All samples for the proposed study were obtained from Dr. Elaine Peskind at University of Washington (UW). In order to provide protection to research subjects, it is policy at UW to obtain &#x0201c;double consent&#x0201d; from both the subject and their legally authorized representative when the subject is a member of a cognitively impaired group. The standard procedure at UW is that all subjects with cognitive impairment have a legally authorized representative (using Washington statutory definition) co-sign all consents. We attempt to protect each subject's rights and welfare by explaining to both the subject and the person with signing authority that this study is voluntary, they will not lose any other benefits to which they are otherwise entitled by not participating, that there are risks associated with this research, and that if they are not currently taking one of the FDA-approved drugs for treatment of dementia that they may want to consider trying one of these prior to getting involved with this study.</p><p>In all cases, we make sure that a subject with cognitive impairment is manifesting assent before beginning or continuing any study procedure (whether it be as minor as taking vital signs or as major as performing an LP). If at any time, a subject with cognitive impairment expresses desire to skip or discontinue a study procedure, we respect that subject's wishes. Because people with cognitive impairment sometimes have difficulty verbally expressing themselves, if there is any indication at any time during the study, verbally or physically, that they do not want to participate, we will discontinue them. The only exception would be that if a subject with cognitive impairment wishes to leave the Clinical Research Unit before it is appropriate (i.e., after the LP, we prefer to have the subject lie in bed for one hour to minimize any potential for side effects). In such a case, we would do our best to have the subject continue study protocol as much as possible.</p><p>The Institutional Review Board of the University of Washington approved the use of human subjects for this study.</p><p>In this study, human CSF samples were analyzed using two types of ProteinChips: Immobilized Metal Affinity Capture (IMAC) chips and Strong Anion Exchange (SAX) chips, which, respectively, selectively capture divalent metal-binding proteins and anionic (basic) proteins for analysis by &#x0201c;time of flight&#x0201d; mass spectrometry. For SELDI analysis using the IMAC chip, an eight-spot IMAC chip was first activated by incubating twice (15 min each) with copper sulfate (100 mM in water). The chip was then washed with water, followed by washing with sodium acetate (50 mM in water) and a final wash with water. The chip was then assembled with a &#x0201c;Bioprocessor&#x0201d; (Bio-Rad), which allows for applications of large volumes onto each of the ProteinChip spots, and individual CSF samples were immediately applied over each of the spots. In this study, independent CSF specimens containing 1 &#x000b5;g of total protein were adjusted to a final volume of 120 &#x000b5;l PBS/0.1&#x00025; Triton-X 100 for SELDI analysis. Samples were shaken (250 rpm) for 1 hour at room temperature. The ProteinChip was washed three times (5 min each) with PBS containing 0.1&#x00025; Triton-X 100 followed by a quick rinse with water. While the chip surface was still moist, 1 &#x000b5;l of saturated sinapinic acid (SPA) solution (in 50&#x00025; acetonitrile/0.5&#x00025; trifluoroacetic acid) was applied on each spot. After drying, the profile of divalent metal-binding proteins captured on each of the spot was analyzed by &#x0201c;time of flight&#x0201d; mass spectrometry using a PBS II ProteinChip reader system (Bio-Rad).</p><p>For selective capturing and expression-profile analysis of anionic protein species from CSF, 2 &#x000b5;g of total protein from individual specimen was adjusted to a final volume of 200 &#x000b5;l with binding buffer &#x0005b;20 &#x000b5;M Trisma base (pH 8) containing 0.1&#x00025; Triton-X 100&#x0005d;. A SAX ProteinChip was assembled with a &#x0201c;Bioprocessor&#x0201d; and each spot was prewashed (shaking at 250 rpm for 5 min at room temperature) with 350 ml of 20 mM Trisma base (pH 8) containing 5 M NaCl and 0.1&#x00025; Triton-X 100. Thereafter, the prewash solution is exchanged with CSF samples following by incubation (shaking at 250 rpm at room temperature) for 1 hour. The chip was washed 3 times (5 min each) with binding buffer followed by a brief rinse with water. SPA (1 &#x000b5;l) was applied to each spot and anionic proteins captured on to each of the spots were analyzed using the PBS II system. In all SELDI &#x0201c;time of flight&#x0201d; mass spectrometry analysis using either the IMAC or the SAX ProteinChip, individual protein-expression profile spectra were collected using an average of 80 laser shots (with the laser intensity set at 180, and detector sensitivity set at 6 on the PBS II system). Spectra collected were analyzed using the ProteinChip software version 2.1c, which highlights differences in expressions of specific protein species &#x0005b;defined by mass (Da)/charge&#x0005d; between treatment groups (e.g., CSF from animals treated with FCA vs. animals treated with FCA plus nimesulide).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>ELISA measurement of S100A7 protein in CSF</title><p>CSF samples were coated in Nunc-Immuno plates (Maxisorp, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in 100 &#x000b5;l of Buffer 42 (30 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 70 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 0.05&#x00025; NaN<sub>3</sub>, pH 9.6) at 4&#x000b0;C for O/N.

Since S100A7 content is elevated in the CSF of AD dementia cases compared to neurological control cases, and these elevated S100A7 levels in the CSF selectively identify AD clinical severity, S100A7 could be a biomarker that quickly diagnoses AD before clinical signs have developed, allowing for early symptomatic treatment and the ability to chart the course of the disease accurately.</p><p>Our results show that S100A7 mRNA expression increases in the brain as a function of AD dementia and selectively correlated with AD amyloid plaque, but not neurofibrillary tangle, in a highly selective manner. This opens the question of whether S100A7 might be involved in amyloidogenesis. Our investigations suggest that it is, through activation of alpha-secretase activity. This S100A7-mediated anti-amyloidogenic activity coincided with the accumulation of both ADAM-10 precursor protein and the processed mature form. There was no detectable change in ADAM-9 and ADAM-17 (TACE) expression.</p><p>A&#x003b2; is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD.

The &#x0201c;non-amyloidogenic&#x0201d; &#x003b1;-secretase pathway starts with APP cleavage by &#x003b1;-secretase, which cuts within the &#x003b2;-amyloid domain and thus precludes &#x003b2;-amyloid generation. Several studies have suggested that &#x003b1;-secretases ADAM-9, ADAM-10, and ADAM-17, which belong to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family of membrane-anchored cell-surface proteins, may be involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Asai1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We do not know the mechanism by which the levels of ADAM-10 in circulating blood platelet cells of AD patients are reduced. But since ADAM-10 is an &#x003b1;-secretase, it is conceivable that these lower levels of anti-amyloidogenic &#x003b1;-secretase activity in peripheral cells could be caused by these reduced levels of ADAM-10. This could be part of the amyloid neuropathology in AD. Our finding showing &#x0003e;two fold promotion in &#x0201c;non-amyloidogenic&#x0201d; &#x003b1;-secretase activity and elevated levels of ADAM-10, following expression of exogenous hS100A7 to platelet cells supports this hypothesis.</p><p>&#x003b2;- or &#x003b3; -secretase activity is not affected by human S100A7 expression in either CHO-APP<sub>swe</sub> cells or in primary cortico-hippocampal neurons derived from Tg 2576 embryos. This in vitro evidence strongly suggests that the elevation of S100A7 expression in the brain of patients with AD might reflect a novel protective anti-amyloidogenic compensatory mechanism in response to the rampant AD brain amyloidogenesis. The mechanism by which S100A7 influences &#x003b1;-secretase and A&#x003b2; levels could involve p42/44 MAPK (Erk1/2) and PKC signaling. Our studies indicate that S100A7 increased Erk1/2 or PKC phosphorylation. Also, inhibitors of p42/44 MAPK or PKC have the effect of preventing h-S100A7 from influencing &#x003b1;-secretase activity.</p><p>Thus, it may be feasible to use S100A7 to promote anti-amyloidogenic &#x003b1;-secretase activity in peripheral cells. We tested this potential of S100A7 in promoting anti-amyloidogenic activity in the periphery and in the brain, <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the potential therapeutic impact on mitigating AD- type amyloid neuropathology.

Thus, it might be possible that in the future changes in S100A7 content in AD might be also further explored to monitor oxidative stress changes associated to altered A&#x003b2; metabolism in AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004183-Gustaw1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Collectively, our experimental evidence tentatively suggests that S100A7 might be causally implicated in APP processing.
