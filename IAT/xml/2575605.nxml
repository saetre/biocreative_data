Patients with SLE exhibiting higher expression of IFIT4 had a higher prevalence of leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and C3/C4 decrease. IFIT4 protein was localized exclusively to the cytoplasm, and it was significantly upregulated by IFN-&#x003b1; in normal PBMCs. To determine the role played by IFIT4 in monocyte differentiation, the monocytic cell line THP-1 was transfected with pEGFP-IFIT4 expression plasmid and stimulated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/IL-4 to generate IFIT4-primed dendritic cell-like cells (DCLCs). IFIT4-primed DCLCs acquired morphological characteristics of dendritic cells more quickly, with greater resemblance to dendritic cells, as compared with DCLCs primed with pEGFP-C1 control plasmid trasfection. Furthermore, they exhibited higher expressions of CD40, CD86, CD80, HLA-DR and CD83, along with lower expression of CD14; increased IL-12 secretion; and an increased ability to stimulate T-cell proliferation. In addition, IFIT4-primed DCLCs enhanced IFN-&#x003b3; secretion (about 2.4-fold) by T cells compared with controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings suggest that IFIT4 might play roles in promoting monocyte differentiation into DCLCs and in directing DCLCs to modulate T-helper-1 cell differentiation; these actions might contribute to the autoimmunity and pathogenesis of SLE.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with multiple organ involvement, in which autoantibodies induce tissue damage. IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and IFN-inducible genes (IFIGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] are believed to play a major role in SLE.</p><p>IFN-&#x003b1; is a causative agent in the pathogenesis of SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Elevated levels of IFN-&#x003b1; were detected in the sera of lupus patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and IFN-&#x003b1; levels in sera correlate with disease severity and the generation of autoantibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Patients treated with IFN-&#x003b1; occasionally develop antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNAs) and autoimmune disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] similar to those characteristic of SLE, but the mechanism by which IFN-&#x003b1; expression is associated with the generation of autoantibodies <italic>in vivo </italic>requires clarification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Notably, IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; was found to upregulate major histocompatibility complex expression and to induce differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells (DCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], antigen-presenting cells that induce and regulate immune responses. An increased number of circulating plasma cells and the presence of autoreactive T and B cells in the sera of patients with SLE suggest that the disease might be driven by alterations in DCs. Moreover, Blanco and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] reported that IFN-&#x003b1; in the sera of SLE patients can induce normal monocytes to differentiate into DCs. Thus, IFN-&#x003b1; may enhance autoimmune responses in SLE by inducing DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which IFN-&#x003b1; induces monocytes to differentiate into DCs has not been elucidated.</p><p>Recently, a gene expression study using an oligonucleotide microarray showed that many IFIGs are highly expressed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of most SLE patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and IFIGs correlated with the production of autoantibodies and the clinical manifestations of SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The IFIGs were thought to be responsible for the immunomodulatory properties of IFN, such as monocyte differentiation and anti-proliferation. For example, Ifi204 favours macrophage differentiation in myeloid progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Among the IFIGs, IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 4 (IFIT4) is a novel gene whose function was unknown until recently, when it was shown to be a key mediator of antiproliferative activity by enhancing the p21 and p27 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Induction of IFIT4 transcription by IFN-&#x003b1; depends upon the sequential activation of protein kinase C&#x003b4;, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, and STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Because IFIT4 can be induced by IFN-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], which is involved in monocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], we were interested in testing whether IFIT4 was responsible for the effect of IFN-&#x003b1; on differentiation of monocytes into DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we found that increased expression of IFIT4 in the PBMCs of patients with SLE positively correlated with the presence of autoantibodies (ANA, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm), leucocytopenia and hypocomplementaemia. Compared with DC-like cells (DCLCs) primed with pEGFP-C1 transfection, IFIT4-primed DCLCs exhibited higher expression of CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR; lower expression of CD14; enhanced IL-12 secretion; and increased ability to stimulate T-cell proliferation. This indicates that IFIT4 may play a role in promoting monocyte differentiation into DCs. Moreover, IFIT4-primed DCLCs induced a differentiation bias of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells into T-helper-1 (Th1) cells. These findings suggest that IFIT4 might play a role in the pathogenesis of SLE by promoting monocyte differentiation into DCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 108 patients with SLE and 46 normal healthy donors were recruited from the Department of Rheumatology, RenJi Hospital, which is affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Moreover, activated IFIT4-primed DCLCs induced stronger MLR and produced more IL-12 than did control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these effects of IFIT4 on morphology, phenotype, antigen-presenting ability and IL-12 production of monocytes suggest that IFIT4 might play a role in promoting monocyte differentiation into DCs. This is because IFIT4-primed cells acquired more cytoplasmic protrusions or dendrites; more expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD86, HLA-DR and CD83; lower expression of CD14; stronger antigen-presenting ability; and more IL-12 production. All of these are among the key characteristics of immature or mature DCs. Moreover, IFIT4-primed DCLCs stimulated greater IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by T cells, which suggests that IFIT4 might direct DCs to modulate Th1 cell differentiation and favour the ability of DCs to skew the immune response toward Th1 development.</p><p>It was shown that monocytes from patients with SLE had severely altered phenotype and lineage flexibility, and might act as DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. For instance, they expressed significantly lower levels of CD14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and were able to induce strong MLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], although HLA-DR levels were similar to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] or lower than [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] those of controls. The effect of IFIT4 on monocyte differentiation into DCs was suggested to be partially responsible for this unbalanced function of monocytes and DCs in SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The function of IFIT4 on differentiation and anti-proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] indicated that IFIT4 might act as a regulator to balance proliferation and differentiation.</p><p>How might IFN-&#x003b1; and IFIT4 contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE? Our hypothesis is that IFN-&#x003b1; and IFIT4 may act as 'adjuvant'-like factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] to convert an immune system that ignores self-antigens into an immune system that actively recognizes these antigens by promoting DC differentiation, maturation and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The activated DCs may present ribonucleoprotein antigens in an immunogenic rather than tolerogenic manner, leading to the activation of autoreactive T cells that 'help' to drive autoantibody production in B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results indicate that IFIT4 might contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE by inducing monocytes to differentiate into DCs. This provides insight into the pathogenesis of SLE and might lead to novel treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANA = antinuclear antibody; anti-dsDNA = anti-double-stranded DNA antibody; DC = dendritic cell; DCLC = dendritic cell-like cell; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FACS = fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GAPDH = glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GM-CSF = granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IFIG = interferon-inducible gene; IFIT4 = interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 4; IFN = interferon; IL = interleukin; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; MLR = mixed leukocyte response; PBMC = peripheral blood mononuclear cell; RT-PCR = reverse trancription polymerase chain reaction; SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus; SLEDAI = Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index; Th1 = T-helper-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NS, LW, XYH, CDB, SLC and YY G designed the study.
