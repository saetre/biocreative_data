Abundant levels of these p73 variants in a variety of human cancers correlated with adverse clinical prognosis and response failure to conventional therapies, underscoring their relevance as marker for disease severity and target for cancer intervention. With respect to an equally important role for amino-truncated p73 splice forms (&#x00394;TAp73) and &#x00394;Np73 (summarized as DNp73) in the tumorigenic process, we designed locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmers against individual species that were complementary to &#x00394;Ex2 and &#x00394;Ex2/3 splice junctions and a region in exon 3B unique for &#x00394;N' and &#x00394;N.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Treatment of cancer cells with these ASOs resulted in a strong and specific reduction of tumorigenic p73 transcripts and proteins, importantly, without abolishing the wild-type p73 tumor suppressor form as observed with p73-shRNA. The specific antisense oligonucleotides rescued cells from apoptosis inhibition due to overexpression of their corresponding amino-truncated p73 isoform and decreased tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, ASO-116 against &#x00394;Ex2/3 coupled to magnetic nanobead polyethyleneimine (MNB/PEI) carriers significantly inhibited malignant melanoma growth, which correlated with a shift in the balance between endogenous TAp73 and &#x00394;Ex2/3 towards apoptotic full-length p73.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study demonstrates the successful development of LNA-ASOs that selectively differentiate between the closely related p73 oncoproteins, and provide new tools to further delineate their biological properties in different human malignancies and for therapeutic cancer targeting.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The human p73 is a member of the p53 tumor suppressor family, based on substantial structural and functional homologies. Unlike p53, p73 is rarely mutated in human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As an early-recognized feature, the <italic>TP73 </italic>gene produces multiple transcripts with opposing functions. A detailed analysis of p73 in tumor cells revealed the presence of multiple N-terminally truncated isoforms (&#x00394;N, &#x00394;N', &#x00394;Ex2, &#x00394;Ex2/3; collectively called DNp73), which lack all or most of the transactivation domain that accounts for the tumor suppressor function of the full-length TAp73 protein. While the &#x00394;Np73 transcript is generated from a cryptic promoter in intron 3, the majority of the amino-truncated p73 variants is produced by alternative exon splicing from the E2F1 responsive promoter in the 5'UTR upstream of the non-coding exon 1. All isoforms fail to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, they act as dominant-negative competitors for DNA binding and/or heteroduplex formation with p53 and wild-type TAp73, and confer drug resistance to tumor cells harbouring wild-type p53 and/or TAp73 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We also demonstrated that the &#x00394;Ex2/3 isoform inactivates functions of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein in cell cycle and differentiation control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. By inactivating both major tumor suppressor pathways in human cells they are functionally analogous to several viral oncoproteins. In this sense, overexpression of &#x00394;Ex2/3 and &#x00394;N has been shown to transform fibroblasts to tumorigenicity in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and drive carcinogenesis in transgenic mice <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>NH2-truncated p73 forms were found frequently elevated in various types of tumor cells and primary malignancies from patients, but not in the surrounding normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Beyond, increased DNp73 expression levels are strongly associated with a worse recurrence-free and overall survival of patients, and poor prognosis features such as lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Specifically, overexpression of &#x00394;Ex2/3p73 and &#x00394;Np73 was associated with advanced pathologic tumor stages. Likewise, alterations in the relative levels of TAp73 and the apparently tumor-specific aberrant expression of individual oncogenic p73 species, that might account for a shift in the net function of p73 from proapoptotic to prosurvival, have been shown to correlate with prognosis in some cancers. All this strongly underscores that the expression pattern of NH2-truncated p73 is an important determinant of tumor development and the cellular response to treatments, making it a biological relevant target for cancer prevention and therapy.</p><p>Although there is increasing evidence for an equally important role of individual amino-terminal p73 splice variants and &#x00394;Np73 in the tumorigenic process, we are currently unable to evaluate their oncogenic potency under physiological conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>. The aim of our study was to develop mono-specific inhibitors for the majority of NH2-truncated alternative-spliced p73 isoforms that allow differential knockdown of all closely related oncoproteins in growing human tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture, Viruses and Fluorescence Microscopy</title><p>Human H1299 lung cancer cells, human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells, and human WI-38 lung fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany).

Current evidence suggests an equally important role for individual p73 splice variants and &#x00394;Np73 in the tumorigenic process, but there is no attempt so far for their selective silencing without concomitant reduction of the apoptotic TAp73 form. In order to develop mono-specific inhibitors for each amino-terminal isoform, we used a modified antisense technology. According to previous reports indicating that ONs with locked nucleic acids (LNA) at their 3'- and 5'-ends efficiently recruit RNase H and promote degradation of target RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we designed 20-mer LNA-DNA gapmers with a central DNA region of 12 nucleotides and 3'-5' ends of four LNA monomers. LNA bases have been shown to confer resistance to nucleases when incorporated at the 5' and 3' ends of oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Antisense specificity for &#x00394;Ex2p73 and &#x00394;Ex2/3p73 was achieved by using the splice junction of each exon deletion variant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The ASO targeting &#x00394;N' and &#x00394;N was directed against a region in the intron-derived exon 3B, which is unique to both isoforms.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Site-directed targeting of NH2-truncated p73 mRNAs by LNA gapmers</bold>.

LNA bases are in bold.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-8-61-1"/></fig><p>The optimal target sequence was determined <italic>in silico </italic>by three parameters: (a) a probability profile for single-stranded regions in the mRNA, which serve as docking stations for initial oligo annealing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], (b) a minimum free energy model of the secondary structure of the mRNA with a more recent compilation of Turner's free energy parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and (c) the binding energies for a given ASO sequence on the mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The probability plot for &#x00394;Ex2p73 mRNAs indicates single-strands downstream of nucleotide (nt) position 120 and around position 130 [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1A</xref>]. This was confirmed by secondary structure prediction for &#x00394;Ex2p73 transcripts, where two bulges of more than 4 bases were present at positions 121 and 130, exposing the splice junction for oligo binding [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1E</xref>]. Since mRNA 3D-structure depends predominantly on nearest neighbour interactions, alterations in the C-terminus may affect folding of N-terminal domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, structure predictions were carried out for several C-terminal isoform configurations. Binding energies for ASO-115 (number indicates starting base of ASO position on the mRNA) targeting &#x00394;Ex2p73 mRNA reached values around -8 kcal/mol [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. According to the Soligo algorithm using &#x02264; -8 kcal/mol as default filter criteria for potent ASOs, the values for ASO-115 were considered sufficient. Similar results were obtained for ASO-116. Analysis for single-stranded sections revealed a high probability for unpaired mRNA at the splice junction of &#x00394;Ex2/3p73 transcripts, which was confirmed by the predicted structure model [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1B, F</xref>]. In the &#x00394;Np73 and &#x00394;N'p73 ASO, where the target region is of different location in each transcript owing to distinct transcriptional and mRNA maturation processes, ASO-185/451 denotes the starting positions for the ON in both isoforms. The probability plots and secondary structures of &#x00394;Np73 showed the minimum of 4 unpaired bases, which are sufficient for initial oligo annealing [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1C, G</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Likewise the predicted epitopes and probability plots for &#x00394;N'p73 transcripts suggest mRNA accessibility at the target region of ASO-185/451 [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1D, H</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>ASOs induce selective suppression of target RNAs</title><p>To ensure efficient internalization of the ASOs into target cells, we determined the amount of oligonucleotide uptake after 8, 16 and 24 h of transfection using a concentration range between 100&#x02013;250 nM fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled ASO. All LNA-DNA gapmers showed a similar high transfection efficiency in HEK293, H1299, and SK-Mel-29 cells overexpressing individual DNp73 isoforms, and similar intracellular distribution patterns with clear nuclear, perinuclear, and diffuse cytosolic staining (data not shown). The capacity and specificity of the designed antisense gapmers to reduce endogenous levels of &#x00394;Ex2, &#x00394;Ex2/3, &#x00394;N', and &#x00394;N transcripts was subsequently analyzed by qRT-PCR in HEK293 containing all N-terminally truncated isoforms at higher levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Based on previous results indicating that RNase H enzymatic activity is stimulated as early as 1 h after ASO treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], antisense molecules were transfected at a concentration of 250 nM into HEK293 cells and gene silencing efficiencies have been monitored over 2, 4, and 6 h after treatment. The effect of a non-sense control ON is shown for comparison. In these cells, ASO-115, 116, and 185/451 directed against the splice forms &#x00394;Ex2, &#x00394;Ex2/3 or &#x00394;N' induced the strongest antisense effect after 6 h compared to the nsc-gapmer. At this time point, we measured a 35- to 45-fold reduction of gene expression for both ASO-115 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and ASO-116 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), whereas ASO-185/451 promoted a weaker (5-fold) but still significant suppression of the &#x00394;N' mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Quantitative analysis of the silencing efficiency of the ASO-185/451 antisense gapmer against its second target transcript, revealed a substantially higher inhibitory effect with a more than 2000-fold reduction of the &#x00394;N mRNA level already 2 h following treatment relative to the nsc-ASO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Repeated experiments provided similar results with rendering the &#x00394;Np73 transcript barely detectable during the first 4 h post transfection. The following time points showed a constant 225- and 279-fold suppression, suggesting a prolonged duration of gene silencing upon amplified initial repression intensity.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Efficacy and specificity of ASOs for endogenously upregulated p73 transcripts</bold>.

As demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>, ASO-115 induced a complete decrease of &#x00394;Ex2p73 mRNA to 0.03% of the control, whereas expression of TAp73 and other non-targeted p73 variants remained largely unaffected. Similar data was obtained with the ASO-116 against &#x00394;Ex2/3p73 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). Interestingly, both ASOs targeting the splice junction of exon 1 have very little effect on &#x00394;Np73 transcripts, which lack exons 1 to 3 due to alternative promoter usage. Analogous to this, ASO-185/451 revealed no silencing impact on the &#x00394;Ex2 and &#x00394;Ex2/3 transcripts because of the absence of exon 3B in these variants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). These results indicate that all developed ASOs exhibit a selectively high inhibitory efficiency against their target, resulting in no or low knockdown of other p73 isoforms. Comparable high isoform-specific knockdown activities of these ASOs were also observed in H1299 tumor cells with amino-truncated p73 transcripts upregulated [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of site-directed targeting on DNp73 protein level</title><p>As endogenous levels of all amino-truncated p73 proteins are hardly detectable in a single cell line, expression plasmids containing the transcript-specific 5'UTRs for the distinct isoforms were cotransfected with 500 nM of the antisense molecules into H1299 cells and analyzed by Western blot. Due to the inherently high stability of the oncogenic proteins, we measured their level in specific LNA gapmer- and control ON-treated cells after 24 h. The levels of full-length TAp73 and DNp73 forms in H1299 cells treated with LNA-DNA are shown in histograms. Following a single transfection, ASO-115 strongly reduced the level of &#x00394;Ex2p73 protein up to 30% of control, but not TAp73 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). A nearly complete disruption of the &#x00394;Ex2/3p73&#x003b1; protein to less than 5% of the nsc-oligonucleotide was achieved by the treatment with ASO-116. ASO-185/451 but not the negative nsc-ASO significantly suppressed both targets on protein level, although protein derived from the &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; plasmid was reduced more efficiently than &#x00394;N'. These findings correlate with the obtained qPCR results, where ASO-185/451 targeting &#x00394;Np73 and ASO-116 directed against &#x00394;Ex2/3 showed the strongest suppression activity. In addition, we cotransfected the two different amino-terminal isoforms &#x00394;Ex2/3 and &#x00394;Np73 along with one of the antisense molecules. As demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, ASO-116 and vice versa ASO-185/451 inhibited their target in a highly specific manner, while protein expression of the second &#x00394;Np73 or &#x00394;Ex2/3p73 isoform in each case remained unchanged. Importantly, consistent with the PCR data, none of the designed LNA gapmers against the oncogenic variants of p73 has an obvious effect on the amount of TAp73 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Knockdown effect of NH2-isofom specific ASOs on protein level compared to p73-shRNA</bold>.

The use of RNAi is restricted to sequences that fullfill special criteria, such as the GC content, A at position 19 or absence of internal repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. According to these parameters, the target sequence of the p73-shRNA is located in exon 5 of the transcript. In contrast to the data observed with the NH2-truncated isoform-specific gapmers, transfection of HEK293 cells with a plasmid encoding shRNA against p73 resulted in a general silencing of TAp73 and oncogenic forms up to 80% of the scrambled-shRNA, with the strongest potency against the wildtype transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, upper panel). This unspecific inhibitory effect was also confirmed on protein level. In H1299 cells infected with an adenoviral vector expressing p73-shRNA, we found all N-terminal isoforms and TAp73 equally suppressed at 48 h after infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, bottom panel) compared to the control virus Ad-shGFP. From these results, we conclude that site-directed targeting of &#x00394;Ex2 and &#x00394;Ex2/3 splice junctions and a unique region in Exon3B for &#x00394;N' and &#x00394;N by antisense ON is a feasible technique for selective knockdown of individual p73 oncogenes.</p></sec><sec><title>Antitumorigenic activity of DNp73 ASOs</title><p>Previous studies have shown that NH2-truncated p73 species inhibit apoptosis by p53 and TAp73 in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Consequently, the proapoptotic function of these proteins could be restored by depleting the pool of antagonistic p73 proteins. After having shown that the designed ASOs specifically silence DNp73 forms, we determined whether they also influence cellular survival. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> shows that &#x00394;Ex2/3p73&#x003b1; and &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; overexpression markedly reduced the response of normal fibroblasts to genotoxic damage induced by doxorubicin compared to pcDNA3.1 + ASO-nsc treated cells with clear apoptotic features. In contrast, the apoptosis antagonizing effect of both oncogenic p73 forms significantly declined after cotransfection of their specific ASO resulting in increased cell killing over time. Accordingly, while the DNp73 isoforms partially rescued WI-38 cells from DNA damage, isoform-specific ASOs substantially enhanced caspase 3 activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Induction of apoptosis in WI-38 fibroblasts by ASO-specific inhibition of DNp73</bold>.

These rapidly growing tumors, exhibiting major defects in p53 related apoptosis pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], were selected for our studies due to their high level expression of endogenous &#x00394;Ex2/3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), which has so far been implicated in the induction of tumor growth when overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For efficient delivery of antisense molecules, ASO-116 was complexed to synthetic nanopolymer PEI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Analysis of the PEI/ASO-116 polyplexes in cultured SK-Mel-29 cells showed a strong 6-to 9-fold decrease of target mRNA level after transfection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This inhibitory effect on &#x00394;Ex2/3p73 expression was associated with a significantly reduced proliferation rate by PEI-ASO-116 over 5 days compared to untreated or PEI/ASO-sc treated cells as demonstrated by BrdU-ELISA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Our data confirm that p73 species-specific ASOs conjugated to PEI are biologically active. Using fluorescence-labeled PEI/ASO-116, signal intensity peaked at 1 h after intratumoral injection, indicating ASO distribution within the whole tumor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Although the complex decreased over time, a stabil fraction remained detectable in the tumor after 24 h, which is sufficient to ensure continuous availability of ASO over the treatment period at daily administration.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Activity of PEI/ASO-116 in SK-Mel-29 cells and effect on tumor xenografts <italic>in vivo</italic></bold>.

Consistent with the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, tumor growth curves revealed a robust decrease in growth rates when treated with ASO-116 independent of the mode of delivery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). However, with increasing treatment tumors injected with ASO-116 under magnetic force-guidance were significantly smaller than those treated with PEI/ASO-116 alone. This demonstrates that by keeping the ASO concentrated in the tumor, we could enhance its specific therapeutic efficacy. Quantification of p73 transcripts in the tumors after final injection revealed an equally strong suppression of &#x00394;Ex2/3p73 for the PEI- and MNB/PEI-delivered antisense oligonucleotide (8.5-fold and 7-fold) compared to the control groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). Of note, enforced antitumorigenic activity of ASO-116 directly correlated with the upregulation of the tumor suppressive TAp73 form, which showed a more than 2 times higher increase when tumors were subjected to magnetic force-guided ASO-116 treatment. These data suggest that inhibition of TAp73 in response to increased &#x00394;Ex2/3p73 expression in growing tumors is the mechanism responsible for &#x00394;Ex2/3p73-mediated tumor growth.</p><p>Based on present studies, NH2-truncated p73 isoforms are upregulated in the majority of tumors with a concomitant rise of TAp73 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], suggesting that the specific ratio between the apoptotic TAp73 form and different dominant-negative p73 variants determines the functional outcome of p73 and the cell fate. In fact, alterations in the relative levels of truncated p73 and TAp73 and/or p53 correlate with therapy failure and poor prognosis in many cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In this regard, downregulation of the &#x00394;Np73 species by antisense technique has been shown to alleviate its suppressive action and to enhance p53/TAp73-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells in response to chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In turn, mice harbouring a specific knockout of TAp73 are tumor-prone and sensitive to carcinogens. Tomasini et al. reported that 73% of TAp73<sup>-/- </sup>mice spontaneously develop malignancies, thereby establishing TAp73 isoforms as bona fide tumor suppressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, this group showed that TAp73 is regulating the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) complex, suggesting that SAC impairment leads to genomic instability and aneuploidity in TAp73-deficient cells. Hence, the ability to induce and maintain proper mitotic arrest could be a mechanism of TAp73-mediated anti-tumorigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Both studies emphasize the functional importance of an imbalanced TAp73:DNp73 ratio. Taking into account that the expression levels of individual DNp73 species might be tumor-specific and particularly alternative-spliced isoforms &#x00394;Ex2/3, &#x00394;Ex2, and &#x00394;N' that mimic the TAp73 knockout are predominantly expressed in many cancers including malignant melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] rather than &#x00394;Np73, specific inhibitors for these potential oncogenes are needed. In this study, we show that selective knockdown of a single p73 splice product leads to the inhibition of melanoma tumor growth, and at the same time to the induction of TAp73, underscoring that the ratio between TAp73 and &#x00394;Ex2/3p73 accounts for its oncogenic activity. Consistent with the induction of apoptosis after &#x00394;Np73 knockdown, ASO-mediated suppression of &#x00394;TAp73 isoforms was sufficient to abrogate apoptosis resistance to chemotherapy mediated by ectopically expressed &#x00394;TAp73. Enhanced chemosensitivity by inhibition of &#x00394;TAp73 spliced isoforms was recently demonstrated in neuroblastoma using the cyclooxygenase inhibitor celecoxib, which blocks both &#x00394;Ex2/3p73 and &#x00394;Ex2p73 without isoform selectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>One of the most required desirements for LNA-ASOs is their efficient delivery to target cell nuclei. Polymers of cationic polyethyleneimine are well-studied compounds that improve the <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>penetrance of ASOs to cells and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], yet PEI-mediated DNA transfer is not tumor directed. Thus, we aimed at constructing targeted non viral vectors based on magnetic force-guided polyplexes by coating PEI/ASO to nanoparticles that allow enforced cellular uptake by complex concentration at the tumor site. As a result, mice that received accumulating intratumoral injections of MNB/PEI-ASO complex against &#x00394;Ex2/3 showed a stronger degree of tumor growth inhibition than those treated only with PEI/ASO, indicating that increased antisense activity, substantiated by a marked induction of TAp73, correlates with higher transfection efficiency in tumor cells. Since the release of p73/p53 tumor suppressor function from &#x00394;TAp73-mediated inhibition has been linked to chemosensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], the use of oncogenic p73 ASOs as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment could be further improved by combination with other genotoxic agents.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have developed LNA-modified ASOs that downregulate individual aberrantly expressed &#x00394;Ex2, &#x00394;Ex2/3, &#x00394;N', and &#x00394;N p73 forms in neoplastic cells and growing tumors with high specificity.
