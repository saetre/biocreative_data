The formation of oedema and opening of the blood-brain barrier in stroke is associated with enhanced expression of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here, we found an infarct volume of 24.8 &#x000b1; 2% and a reduced neurological function after two hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), followed by 48 hours of recirculation in rat. Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy revealed enhanced expression of MMP-9, TIMP-1, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the smooth muscle cells of the ischemic MCA and associated intracerebral microvessels. The specific MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, given intraperitoneal zero or 6 hours after the ischemic event, reduced the infarct volume significantly (11.8 &#x000b1; 2% and 14.6 &#x000b1; 3%, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05), improved neurological function, normalized expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, and reduced expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the vessel walls. Administration of U0126 12 hours after MCAO did not alter the expression of MMP-9. Immunocytochemistry showed no overlap in expression between MMP-9/TIMP-1 and the astrocyte/glial cell marker GFAP in the vessel walls.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data are the first to show that the elevated vascular expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1, associated with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier following focal ischemia, are transcriptionally regulated via the MEK/ERK pathway.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Focal cerebral ischemia results from a reduction in cerebral blood flow to a discrete region of the brain, initiating a complex process that includes release of excitatory neurotransmitters and activation of apoptotic pathways. Even though regional cerebral blood flow is restored to near normal values after two hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], a cerebral infarct of about 25% of total brain volume occurs consistently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Some manifestations of the ischemic damage are break-down of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), activation of inflammatory cascades, and disruption of basement membranes and extracellular matrix via cytokine-induced alterations in the expression of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. MMPs are a family of zinc-binding proteolytic enzymes that can degrade structural proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cleave other non-ECM molecules ranging from growth factor precursors, cytokines, and binding proteins, to cell surface receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the central nervous system, MMP-9 is involved in disruption of the BBB by degrading tight junction proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The proteolytic activity of MMPs is tightly controlled by tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. By degrading the neurovascular matrix, MMPs promote BBB injury, causing brain oedema and haemorrhage. Inhibition of MMP-9 prevents tight junction protein degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], while excessive expression of MMPs contributes to the pathological processes. For example, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are upregulated during cerebral ischemia, however their temporal regulation differs. MMP-9 plays a pivotal role in the degradation of the BBB after focal cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and is also expressed in human brain tissue after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. There is an early increase in MMP-9 expression in the microvascular walls after cerebral ischemia and selective inhibition of MMP-9 reduces the brain injury after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. MMP-9 peaks at 48 hours while MMP-2 peaks at 5 days post stroke. It has been suggested that the balance between MMPs and TIMP-1 plays a significant role in experimental reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and in human stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In previous studies, we observed rapid transcriptional upregulation of contractile endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>and angiotensin AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors within the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells in the ischemic region in MCAO-induced focal cerebral ischemia and experimental subarachnoid haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is possible that this upregulation promotes the formation of the penumbral damage via enhanced contraction of the vasculature leading to and within the ischemic region, especially considering that the receptor ligands (angiotensin II and endothelin-1) are formed in the cerebrovascular endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, we examined the early changes in the expression of MMPs and TIMPs, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in particular. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the enhanced expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 after MCAO followed by reperfusion in cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. Detailed immunocytochemical analysis revealed that this enhanced expression was not associated with other elements of the vessel walls or with glial end-feet or neurons. We asked whether this enhanced expression was associated with activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), a family that includes extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), which transmit extracellular signals into the nucleus to modulate protein expression. Previously, we observed that ERK1/2 was activated early, resulting in cerebrovascular receptor upregulation, while p38 and JNK were activated only after 1&#x02013;2 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This observation was validated by the results of systemic administration of the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], which blunted the enhanced activity of the MEK/ERK pathway in the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. In addition, we found that MEK1/2 inhibition reduced the infarct size, improved neurological function, and normalized the enhanced expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 that follows ischemic injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we used the rat model of inducible cerebral ischemia: rats were subjected to reversible MCAO for 2 hours followed by reperfusion for 48 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The MCAO produced an occlusion visible by laser Doppler flowmetry as an abrupt 80&#x02013;90% reduction in local cortical blood flow that normalized after removal of the occluding thread (that was not different from before occlusion in the operated rats). There were no significant differences in physiological parameters between the different treatment groups for blood pressure, blood gases, temperature, plasma glucose, and body weight (data not shown). Following rapid sacrifice, we collected tissue for immunocytochemistry, western blot, and calculation of infarct volume (24.8 &#x000b1; 2% of total cerebrum in the MCAO group; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

Firstly, intravenous administration of the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 at 0 or 6 hours after the two-hour MCAO and initiation of reperfusion significantly reduced the infarct volume (11.8. &#x000b1; 2% and 14.6 &#x000b1; 3%, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and improved neurological assessment scores (2 &#x000b1; 0.7 and 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.7, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). When U0126 treatment was initiated 12 hours after the start of reperfusion, there was no significant reduction in infarct volume or neurological score as compared to control animals (21 &#x000b1; 2% and 3.8 &#x000b1; 0.8%, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Secondly, after MCAO, pERK1/2 activity in the vascular smooth muscle cells was upregulated in large cerebral arteries (218 &#x000b1; 11%; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) and in microvessels (130 &#x000b1; 10%; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) but not in adjacent brain tissue (103 &#x000b1; 4%; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003e; 0.05), as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

We found markedly enhanced expression of MMP-9 in the vascular smooth muscle cells from the ischemic region; the expression was localized to the cytoplasm, leaving the nuclear regions clear of MMP-9 immunoreactivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). TIMP-1 expression was observed in the media layer, but was located closer to the adventitia layer of the cerebral vessel walls and hence only to some degree in the smooth muscle cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Quantitative evaluation of the expression levels revealed significant upregulation of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 after MCAO in the MCA and in the microvessels, while only faint staining was seen in vehicle-treated animals (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Results from double immunostaining for MMP-9 or TIMP-1, and actin revealed that the expression of these proteins was localized to the smooth muscle cells in the MCA and cerebral microvasculature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>); however, their distributions varied slightly (see below). CD31 was used as a marker of endothelial cells; neither MMP-9 nor TIMP-1 revealed any major co-localization with CD31 (data not shown), hence the upregulation occurred in the media layer. The results from western blot experiments of MCAs (n = 4 in each group, with 3 animals pooled for each measurement) showed that the protein levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were significantly increased after MCAO as compared to vehicle-treated animals (224 &#x000b1; 13% and 181 &#x000b1; 25%, respectively; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Administration of the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 immediately after the initiation of reperfusion (0 hour) decreased the levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 proteins by 113 &#x000b1; 11% and 126 &#x000b1; 10%, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>(A) Confocal microscopy images of the ischemic middle cerebral artery (MCA), cerebral micro-vessels (Mic.V), and surrounding brain tissue (Brain) immunofluorescently labeled for MMP-9 (a-f) or TIMP-1 (g-l)</bold>.

There was a significant increase in the MMP-9 protein level in the smooth muscle cell layer of ischemic vessels (MCA and Mic.V) as compared with vessels from the vehicle control group. TIMP-1 expression was upregulated in smooth muscle cells and in the proximity of the adventitia layer of ischemic vessels as compared to control vessels. Treatment with U0126, starting at zero and 6 hours, but not at 12 hours, after occlusion prevented the increase in MMP-9 and TIMP-1 protein expression. There was a slight increase in MMP-9 protein expression in ischemic brain tissue and in astrocytes around the vessels as compared to control and U0126-treated brain tissue.

In this part of the vessel walls MMP-9 and TIMP-1 co-located (data not shown).

Furthermore, our data show that this upregulation is associated with upregulation of pERK1/2 and normalized by inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway.</p><p>To determine the cellular source of MMP-9 and TIMP-1, we performed confocal microscopy and co-localization studies using smooth muscle actin-specific antibodies. MMP-9 immunoreactivity was localized to the cytoplasm of the cerebral vessel smooth muscle cells, both in the MCA and in intracerebral microvessels. Although minor amounts of actin has been observed in endothelial cells we could easily dissociate microscopically the endothelium from the smooth muscle cells as they are separated by an inner elastic lamina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, some vessels were studied after mechanical removal of the endothelium. After this procedure the localization of the immunoreactions to the smooth muscle cells was still confirmed (data not shown). This increase in immunoreactivity agrees with a previously reported increase in MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression in the ischemic tissue at 24 hours after MCAO (without any change in MMP-2 mRNA), and this correlated with opening of the BBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These investigators observed that MMP-2 co-localized with GFAP-expressing astrocytes and with neurons in the lateral and piriform cortices, but not in the vessel walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It was also shown that increased MMP-9 activity was associated with a reduction in junction proteins in cerebrovascular endothelial cells and in BBB disruption after focal ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Detailed analysis revealed that these events were caused by MMP-9-mediated degradation of the junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin. In support of these data, the administration of an MMP-9 blocker prevented this degradation and abolished the BBB damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>There exist some data on the time-dependency of the elevation in expression of MMP-9 in the cerebral vessel walls. Thus, the direct comparison of MMP-9 expression in the present ischemic model with that seen in experimental subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and after organ culture of isolated MCA segments revealed enhanced levels of MMP-9 mRNA at 6 and 24 hrs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The time-course was studied in more detail after experimental SAH; the main expression of MMP-9 was seen at 48 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The specific MEK1 inhibitor U0126 does not affect phosphorylation of p38 or JNK in cultured neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] or in cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells <italic>in vivo </italic>using the present model of ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Detailed western blot experiments have confirmed the specificity of U0126 on the MEK/ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore, we can rule out that U0126 acts via non-specific inhibition of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory mechanisms since unknown non-MEK effects cannot be ruled out. U0126 has been found to increase MEK1/2 phosphorylation in cortical neurons, thus U0126 does not affect components upstream of MEK1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the neuroprotective effect of U0126 results from the inhibition of cerebrovascular MEK1/2 activity, which agrees with the observed reductions in the activity of the downstream MAPK, pERK1/2. In this study, we showed that MCAO resulted in enhanced expression of pERK1/2 in smooth muscle cells of the ischemic MCA and associated microvessels (shown by co-localization with actin) but not in the surrounding brain tissue; U0126 blunted this activation, reduced the infarct volume, and improved the neurological assessment scores of treated rats. Intriguingly, inhibiting this sequence of events correlated with the inhibition of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression in the same location. Quantitative real time-PCR demonstrated enhanced mRNA expression of MMP-9 24 hours after MCAO in cerebral blood vessels in focal ischemia, and at 24 and 48 hours after experimental SAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our data indicate, for the first time, that the expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in cerebral blood vessel smooth muscle cells is enhanced after cerebral ischemia and that this enhancement is a transcriptional event. While constitutively expressed MMP-2 is involved in an early brief loosening of tight junctions and the initial reversible opening of the BBB, MMP-9 expression increases with time, is more durable, and is possibly related to increased neuroinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Importantly, the opening of the BBB is associated with brain damage and our observations reveal a mechanism by which to modify the expression of MMP-9, thereby reducing the risk of brain damage: inhibiting MEK1/2.</p><p>Although MEK/ERK-pathway mechanisms play a crucial roles in mediating brain injury after ischemia and reperfusion, and inhibiting this pathway can reduce the infarct size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we provide direct evidence supporting an explanation for some of the events related to the focal pathology of cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. U0126 administration diminished pERK1/2 immunoreactivity in the ischemic brain of the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and in the MCA of the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In the mouse model, three hours of MCAO was followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Interestingly, the infarct volume was affected only if U0126 was given in conjunction with the MCAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, in a permanent MCAO model, pre-treatment with U0126 was necessary to inhibit pMEK1/2/pERK1/2 expression <italic>in vivo </italic>in the mouse brain in both the ischemic core and perifocal regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Also, the specificity of the antagonism revealed that U0126 does not inhibit the cellular synthesis of ERK1/2 but does block the ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activation of, for example, the transcription factor ELK-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In agreement with our observations, MEK1/2 inhibition does not alter cortical blood flow within the first few hours of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] or modify the contractility of isolated cerebral arteries (unpublished data). Hence, U0126 does not act on the cerebral circulation through a direct vasodilator mechanism. Instead, we suggest that U0126 blunts receptor upregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Here, we have demonstrated yet another positive effect of U0126: blocking the enhanced expression of MMP-9, which participates in the destruction of the BBB and subsequent brain oedema. More importantly, systemic administration of U0126 markedly reduced the infarct size and improved neurological function, even when the first dose was given as late as 6 hours after the initiation of reperfusion. Clearly, these data differ to some degree from those found in previous reports. While U0126 is a well-known inhibitor of MEK1/2, it has a questionable permeability of the BBB. In order to overcome this hurdle, we used a much higher dosage of U0126 (30 mg/kg) than that used by others, which still did not alter any physiological parameters and was well tolerated by the rats. This dosage is much higher than that necessary to inhibit the MEK/ERK pathway in cell culture but is necessary to allow a sufficient dosage to reach the abluminal side of the BBB; this was verified by protein expression using both immunohistochemistry and western blot. We verified the success of the antagonism by demonstrating that MCA and cerebral microvascular pERK1/2 activities were reduced to control levels and this reduction was associated with a significant reduction in infarct size and reduced expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1. If U0126 treatment was initiated 12 hours after the start of reperfusion, there was no significant effect on the above parameters. Therefore, at this dosage, the MEK1 inhibitor U0126 may have a therapeutic window.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We hypothesise that MEK/ERK inhibition might represent a way to prevent stroke-induced pathology because it targets several transcriptional mechanisms activated by cerebral ischemia, such as receptor upregulation, which causes enhanced contractility, and MMP-9 and TIMP1 activation, which affect the function of the BBB. Inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway applied as late as 6 hours after the start of reperfusion significantly reduced the infarct volume and the expression of BBB-associated proteins MMP-9 and TIMP1 in the cerebral vessel walls. Thus, the positive effects of MEK/ERK inhibition might involve several mechanisms in the MCA and in brain microvasculature associated with the cerebral ischemia. However, the dosage required to reach targets on the abluminal side of the BBB is a factor that warrants further study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Middle cerebral artery occlusion</title><p>A total of 56 Male Wistar-Hanover rats (M&#x000f8;llegaard Breeding Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) weighing approximately 300&#x02013;350 g were obtained from Harlan, Horst, Netherlands, and were used for the procedures.
