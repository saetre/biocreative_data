The pathophysiological functions of HO-1 have been associated with its enzymatic activities in heme catabolism. We have examined the immune functions of HO-1 by its conditional ablation in myeloid cells (HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice). We demonstrate that myeloid HO-1 is required for the activation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) 3 after Toll-like receptor 3 or 4 stimulation, or viral infection. HO-1&#x02013;deficient macrophages show reduced expression of IFN-&#x003b2; and of primary IRF3 target genes encoding RANTES, IP-10 and MCP-1. In the presence of polyI:C, myeloid HO-1 knockout mice infected with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, a model dependent on IFN-&#x003b2; production, showed enhanced bacterial clearance and survival, whereas control mice succumbed to infection. Moreover, after induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, mice with myeloid-specific HO-1 deficiency developed a higher incidence and an exacerbated, nonremitting clinical disease correlating with persistent activation of antigen-presenting cells, enhanced infiltration of Th17 cells, and a nonregressing myelin-specific T cell reactivity. Notably, these defects were rectified by exogenous administration of IFN-&#x003b2;, confirming that HO-1 functions directly upstream of this critical immune pathway. These results uncover a novel direct function for myeloid HO-1 in the regulation of IFN-&#x003b2; production, establishing HO-1 as a critical early mediator of the innate immune response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Recent advances have provided a clearer picture of the pathways by which the innate immune system senses bacterial and viral pathogens, and how this leads to the production of type I IFNs. This process is primarily mediated by the engagement of specific Toll-like receptors (TLRs) but also by TLR-independent pathways. The specific ligands recognized by IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;&#x02013;inducing TLRs include dsRNA for TLR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), LPS for TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), ssRNA for TLR7 and 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), and unmethylated CpG-DNA for TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Ligand binding leads to TLR dimerization and conformational changes in both the receptor ectodomains and the cytoplasmic TLR&#x02013;IL-1R (TIR) domains. TIR domains bind specific adaptors: TIR domain&#x02013;containing adaptor inducing IFN-&#x003b2; (TRIF) for TLR3; TRIF-related adaptor molecule, TRIF, TIR domain&#x02013;containing adaptor protein, and MyD88 for TLR4; and MyD88 for TLR7, 8, and 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). These adaptors propagate signaling by recruiting kinases that mediate activation of the transcription factors adaptor protein 1 (AP-1; heterodimer of activating transcription factor 2 and c-Jun), NF-&#x003ba;B, IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3, and IRF7, which are all required for IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; production. Two cytosolic RNA helicases, retinoic acid&#x02013;inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation&#x02013;associated gene 5 (MDA5), mediate TLR-independent IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; induction by actively replicating RNA viruses and synthetic RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). RIG-I and MDA5 bind through caspase recruitment domains to mitochondrial IFN-&#x003b2; promoter stimulator 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), initiating signaling cascades that lead to IRF3, IRF7, NF-kB, and AP-1 activation, and IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; expression. In addition to viral cytosolic RNA, bacterial cytosolic DNA also triggers TLR-independent type I IFN production through an as yet not fully defined pathway that requires IRF3, but not activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).</p><p>Heme oxygenase&#x02013;1 (HO-1) is a key cytoprotective, antioxidant, and antiinflammatory molecule. Most of the physiological functions of HO-1 have been associated with its enzymatic activity in heme catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In humans, HO-1 deficiency is associated with susceptibility to oxidative stress and an increased proinflammatory state with severe endothelial damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Mice lacking HO-1 develop progressive inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) and show enhanced sensitivity to LPS-induced toxemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). The protective properties of HO-1 have been studied in a variety of inflammatory models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>); however, the molecular mechanisms, timing, and mode of HO-1 function in disease remain largely unknown.</p><p>Earlier studies have shown that HO-1 expression or CO administration mediate potent antiinflammatory effects in monocytes and/or macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), probably restraining these cells from inducing tissue injury and possibly modulating their role in the initiation of immune responses. However, little is known about the signaling pathways that are regulated by HO-1 in macrophages, a cell type central to the initiation of immune and autoimmune responses. In this study, we sought to examine the function of HO-1 in immune responses by conditional ablation of HO-1 gene expression, specifically in macrophages. We demonstrate that HO-1 is not essential for TLR4/MyD88-induced NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK activation and subsequent proinflammatory cytokine production, but is required for TLR4/TLR3/IRF3-induced production of IFN-&#x003b2; and primary IRF3 target genes in macrophages. In addition, IRF3 activation and subsequent IFN-&#x003b2; production was severely impaired in HO-1 knockout macrophages infected with Sendai virus (SeV). In the presence of polyI:C, myeloid HO-1 knockout mice infected with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, an infectious model with enhanced severity that is dependent on IFN-&#x003b2; production, showed enhanced bacterial clearance, whereas control mice succumbed to infection. Furthermore, myeloid HO-1 deficiency exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice that was associated with defective IFN-&#x003b2; production and enhanced infiltration of activated macrophages and Th17 cells in the central nervous system (CNS).</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Ubiquitous and myeloid-specific inactivation of HO-1 in mice</title><p>To investigate the function of HO-1 in immune responses, we generated mice with conditional deletion of the <italic>Hmox1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).

Activation of IKK1, IKK2, I&#x003ba;B, ERK1/2, JNK2, and p38 occurred to the same extent and with similar kinetics in control and HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> macrophages in response to LPS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081582/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>) or polyI:C (Fig. S1 B). Moreover, no significant differences were observed in the production of TNF or IL-6 between control and HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> macrophages or BM macrophages (BMDMs) from HO-1<sup>KO</sup> mice in response to LPS or polyI:C (Fig. S1, C&#x02013;E). Collectively, these results suggest that HO-1 is not required for TLR3- and TLR4-mediated activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B or AP-1 pathways in macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>HO-1 deficiency impairs IFN-&#x003b2; production induced by TLR4 or TLR3 and is required for the induction of primary IRF3 target genes in macrophages</title><p>TLR3 and TLR4 signals induce gene transcription through DNA motifs, designated IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), found in promoters of genes that bind the IRF family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). These include early inflammatory genes, antiviral cytokines, and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). We therefore examined whether HO-1 is required for the induction of these genes in response to dsRNA or LPS. After being stimulated with polyI:C, HO-1&#x02013;deficient macrophages showed significantly attenuated IFN-&#x003b2; production as compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Similarly, the amount of IFN-&#x003b2; produced after LPS stimulation of HO-1&#x02013;deficient macrophages was severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We also examined whether HO-1 is required for the induction of chemokine genes encoding RANTES, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1a, and MIP-1b in macrophages. HO-1&#x02013;deficient and control TEPMs were stimulated with LPS for several time points and mRNA expression of all five chemokine genes was analyzed. Induction of genes encoding RANTES, IP-10, and MCP-1 was severely impaired in HO-1&#x02013;deficient TEPMs compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). To eliminate the possibility that the observed defects are caused by an intrinsic defect in the expression of LPS/dsRNA receptors, we also analyzed induction of all known LPS/dsRNA receptors in response to LPS or polyI:C stimulation. Induction of genes encoding TLR4, TLR3, RIG-I, MDA5, and protein kinase regulated by RNA (PKR) occurred to the same extent in LPS- or polyI:C-treated macrophages from control and HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081582/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). Finally, we questioned whether expression of IFN-&#x003b2; and HO-1 in macrophages trigger a &#x0201c;positive feedback loop&#x0201d; in which IFN-&#x003b2; (or TLR3 and/or TLR4 stimulation) up-regulates HO-1 and HO-1 mediates IFN-&#x003b2; expression. A similar phenomenon has been shown to mediate the antiinflammatory effect of IL-10 in macrophages in which IL-10 up-regulates HO-1 and HO-1 up-regulates IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). To address this, we stimulated macrophages with LPS, polyI:C, and rIFN-&#x003b2;, and we analyzed HO-1 protein expression by Western blotting. We found that LPS treatment led to a significant induction of HO-1 protein expression, whereas polyI:C or rIFN-&#x003b2; did not induce HO-1 at all time points tested (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081582/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Defective IRF3 signaling and IFN-&#x003b2; production in HO-1&#x02013;deficient macrophages.</bold> (A) ELISA of IFN-&#x003b2; production from BMDMs prepared from control (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and HO-1<sup>KO</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 3) mice; cells were left untreated or stimulated for 24 h with polyI:C or LPS.

For example, IFN-&#x003b2; gene expression requires the coordinate activation of the transcription factors IRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), NF-&#x003ba;B, and activating transcription factor 2/c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Various studies have established an essential role for IRF3 in LPS- and polyI:C-induced IFN-&#x003b2;, RANTES, and IP-10 gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). We therefore sought to examine whether HO-1 deficiency interferes with the activation of these transcription factors. To determine NF-&#x003ba;B activity in the absence of HO-1 in polyI:C-induced gene expression, we stimulated TEPMs from control and HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice with polyI:C for several time points, and nuclear extracts were analyzed for DNA binding activity by EMSA using a probe specific for the &#x003ba;B site. No significant difference was observed in the kinetics of NF-&#x003ba;B binding in HO-1&#x02013;deficient extracts as compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), a finding that is in agreement with the results described in Fig. S1 B. We next assayed IRF3 DNA binding by EMSA using the IFN- and virus-inducible ISREs of the <italic>Isg15</italic> gene. Stimulation of control macrophages with polyI:C led to the detection of two complexes. The faster migrating complex corresponded to IRF3, whereas the slower complexes corresponded to IRF3 associated with the p300/CBP coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). In the absence of HO-1, IRF3 binding was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). IRF3 primarily exists in two forms, a monomeric form that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus with a dominance of export versus import, and a dimeric form that results from its phosphorylation at the C terminus and is sequestered in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). To investigate whether HO-1 is involved in the phosphorylation of IRF3, we treated TEPMs from control and HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice with polyI:C, and phosphorylation of IRF3 was detected by Western blotting using an antibody that specifically detects the phosphorylated form of IRF3. We found that activation of IRF3 was reduced in HO-1&#x02013;deficient macrophages compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). In addition, IRF3 nuclear accumulation was detected by immunofluoresence. Consistent with the Western blotting and DNA-binding experiments, IRF3 nuclear accumulation was significantly reduced in macrophages lacking HO-1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081582/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). To investigate whether HO-1 interacts with IRF3, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using whole-cell extracts (WCEs) from control and HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> macrophages treated with hemin to induce endogenous HO-1 protein and/or polyI:C. HO-1 immunoblot analysis on cell lysates that were immunoprecipitated with an anti-IRF3 antibody revealed that HO-1 interacts with IRF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). To determine whether HO-1 is also required for IRF7 activation, a transcription factor that also regulates IFN-&#x003b2; production, we stimulated control and HO-1&#x02013;deficient macrophages with polyI:C and analyzed IRF7 mRNA induction. We found that IRF7 induction was similar in control and HO-1&#x02013;deficient macrophages in response to polyI:C stimulation (Fig. S2). In addition, to determine whether lack of HO-1 affects the kinase activity of TBK-1, we performed a TBK-1 assay using cytoplasmic extracts from control and HO-1&#x02013;deficient macrophages treated with polyI:C. We found that TBK-1 activity was similar in extracts derived from control and HO-1&#x02013;deficient macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). Collectively, these results show that HO-1 specifically interacts with IRF3 and affects its phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation without affecting TBK-1 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>HO-1 is required for in vivo innate immune responses to TLR3</title><p>Recent studies have shown that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> can induce IFN-&#x003b2; once inside the cytoplasm of infected macrophages through the TBK-1&#x02013;IRF3 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>).

More recent reports have also suggested a role for HO-1 in EAE, although the HO-1&#x02013;mediated protective effects and their cellular basis remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). When immunized with the encephalitogenic myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG<sub>35-55</sub>) peptide, HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice developed significantly more severe and chronic EAE with higher incidence compared with their control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Myeloid HO-1 deficiency did not affect the timing of disease onset but predominantly affected the severity and chronicity of EAE. Moreover, no differences in EAE severity between immunized <italic>LysM</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic>/+</sup> mice and WT littermates were observed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081582/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>), suggesting that expression of the Cre transgene in the <italic>LysM</italic> locus does not affect the course of EAE. To examine whether differences in EAE susceptibility and severity between HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> and control mice lies in the priming of encephalitogenic T cells, we examined antigen-specific T cell responses in popliteal lymph nodes 8&#x02013;10 d after infection. No differences were observed between HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> and control mice regarding the capacity of T cells to proliferate (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081582/DC1">Fig. S6 A</ext-link>) or to produce IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 (not depicted) in response to recall antigen. We next asked whether disease progression in HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice may be caused by sustained autoreactivity of antigen-specific T cells. To address this, we examined the activation and differentiation of myelin-specific T cells in immunized HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice during the late relapse and remission stages. Splenocytes from HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice showed a fourfold higher proliferation compared with control cells and produced much higher levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF (Fig. S6, B&#x02013;D) in response to MOG. Histological analysis of spinal cords of HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> and control mice 25 d after infection showed that HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice had significantly more cellular infiltration and demyelination throughout the spinal cord compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of the immune cell infiltrates showed that HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice had increased numbers of inflammatory cells, including CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages, and granulocytes, than did control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081582/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>).

In the CNS of HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice, we observed a fivefold increase in the numbers of IL-17&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and a twofold increase in the numbers of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>) with an IL-17/IFN-&#x003b3; ratio of &#x0003e;2:1. Recent studies show that a preferential activation of the MyD88-independent, type I IFN&#x02013;inducing TLR pathway has immunomodulatory potential in EAE and that disease suppression is associated with increased levels of IFN-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Touil et al. performed in vivo neutralization experiments and showed that EAE protection by polyI:C was reversed by an anti&#x02013;IFN-&#x003b2; antibody, indicating a role for IFN-&#x003b2; in mediating this effect of polyI:C. To test whether exacerbation of EAE in HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice was associated with defective IFN-&#x003b2; production from macrophages, immunized HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> and control mice were administered polyI:C (30 &#x000b5;g/mouse/day) or PBS during the induction phase of EAE (days 5 and 8 after infection). Clinical signs of disease were suppressed in control mice that received polyI:C as compared with PBS-treated control mice. On the contrary, polyI:C-treated HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice developed severe and chronic EAE that was similar to PBS-treated HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). We then asked whether treatment with rIFN-&#x003b2; can inhibit the clinical symptoms of EAE in myeloid HO-1&#x02013;deficient mice. For this, immunized HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice were administered polyI:C and were treated with PBS or rIFN-&#x003b2; (200,000 IU/day) starting from day 9 after infection and continuing over a period of 14 d.

HO-1 expression or CO administration mediate potent antiinflammatory effects in monocytes and/or macrophages, probably restraining these cells from inducing tissue injury and modulating their role in the initiation of immune responses. Several studies have shown the protective effects of the HO-1/CO system; CO suppresses the proinflammatory and promotes the antiinflammatory response of macrophages, a cell type that controls the balance of inflammation in many conditions. Macrophages stimulated with bacterial LPS produce several proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), as well as antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). If macrophages overexpress HO-1 or are exposed to CO in vitro before stimulation with LPS, the proinflammatory response is markedly inhibited, whereas the antiinflammatory response is enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). In addition, Lee and Chau identified a potential interplay between IL-10 and HO-1 in the inhibition of LPS-induced inflammatory responses and provided evidence that HO-1 mediates the antiinflammatory function of IL-10 both in vivo and in vitro, and that IL-10 and HO-1 activate a positive feedback circuit to amplify the antiinflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we have provided genetic evidence that identifies a novel function for myeloid HO-1 as an upstream mediator of the IRF3/IFN-&#x003b2; response, orchestrating many subsequent processes central to innate as well as adaptive immune responses. Our data indicate that HO-1 forms a complex with IRF3 and is essential for IRF3 activation and subsequent gene expression in response to TLR3/TLR4 stimulation. Although HO-1 can bind to its isoenzyme HO-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), no reports demonstrate binding of HO-1 to known transcriptions factors. A recent study by Lin et al. has shown that HO-1 is detected in the nucleus of cultured cells after exposure to hypoxia, and that HO-1 protein altered binding of transcription factors involved in oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). HO-1 is not a traditional transcription factor with DNA binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>); therefore, direct transcriptional activation is less likely to occur. However, HO-1 could bind to other proteins, serving as the non-DNA binding protein of a transcriptional factor complex, or could be a scaffold protein, acting as a chaperone for unstable client proteins and keeping them poised for activation. It remains to be determined how HO-1 modulates transcription factor activity and if modulation of these factors is mediated by HO-1 protein or its byproducts, such as CO. Recent reports have also suggested a role for CO in the regulation of TLR signaling pathways. CO treatment was shown to negatively control TLR signaling by inhibiting translocation of TLRs to lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In the same study, although CO inhibited TLR4 signaling and subsequent IFN-&#x003b2; production after LPS stimulation, it did not affect TLR3-dependent signaling in macrophages in response to polyI:C treatment. Therefore, it appears that the observed effects of CO on the TLR3 signaling pathway are independent of the HO-1 protein function. This is supported by the observation of Hegazi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) that CO inhibits the synergistic activation of IL-12 p40 and inducible nitric oxide synthase by LPS/IFN-&#x003b3; through selective inhibition of IRF8. The immunological effects of CO required HO-1, and in the absence of functional HO-1, the inhibitory action of CO on IRF8 and IL-12 p40 expression was lost. In agreement with this, we have not observed a defect in IRF8 activation in macrophages from HO-1<sup>M-KO</sup> mice in response to LPS/IFN-&#x003b3; (unpublished data). These results suggest that the products of the HO-1 pathway impart antiinflammatory effects via different modes of action and that HO-1 may have a cytoprotective role independent of its two major metabolic byproducts. Collectively, these findings reveal a multifaceted role for HO-1 in immune responses, presented schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>; in response to bacterial or viral stimuli, HO-1 is required for early activation of the type I IFN&#x02013;inducing pathway and subsequent development of antiviral or adaptive immunity.

In addition, we showed that HO-1 deficiency exacerbated an autoimmune condition that is dependant on endogenous IFN-&#x003b2; production. Absence of myeloid HO-1 exacerbated EAE in mice, and this was associated with enhanced leukocyte accumulation within the CNS, including Th17 cells and nonregressing myelin-specific T cell responses.
