To investigate such area differences in detail, we chose three genes for comparative analyses, namely, RORbeta, ER81 and Nurr1, mRNAs of which have been reported to be mainly expressed in layers 4, 5 and 6, respectively. To analyze their qualitative and quantitative coexpression profiles in the rat neocortex, we used double in situ hybridization (ISH) histochemistry and cortical box method which we previously developed to integrate the data of different staining and individuals in a standard three-dimensional space.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Our new approach resulted in three main observations. First, the three genes showed unique area distribution patterns that are mostly complementary to one another. The patterns revealed by cortical box method matched well with the cytoarchitectonic areas defined by Nissl staining. Second, at single cell level, RORbeta and ER81 mRNAs were coexpressed in a subpopulation of layer 5 neurons, whereas Nurr1 and ER81 mRNAs were not colocalized. Third, principal component analysis showed that the order of hierarchical processing in the cortex correlates well with the expression profiles of these three genes. Based on this analysis, the dysgranular zone (DZ) in the somatosensory area was considered to exhibit a profile of a higher order area, which is consistent with previous proposal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The tight relationship between the expression of the three layer specific genes and functional areas were revealed, demonstrating the usefulness of cortical box method in the study on the cerebral cortex. In particular, it allowed us to perform statistical evaluation and pattern matching, which would become important in interpreting the ever-increasing data of gene expression in the cortex.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian neocortex consists of many areas that are defined on the basis of unique connectional and functional properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Brodmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Felleman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

For the rodent cortex, it is now possible to examine the expression data of most of the known genes in public databases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Gray1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Lein1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Effective use of such information may enable us to reveal apparently hidden structures of neocortical areas, such as new sublayers and areas defined by expression of a unique set of genes.</p><p>In our previous study, we have shown that layer-specific gene expressions can reveal cortical structures across areas and species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Watakabe1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with the six-layer model originally proposed by Brodmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Brodmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, the lamina expressions of several genes were conserved across areas in monkey and mouse neocortices. At the same time, we observed various area differences in their expression patterns. For example, we observed that the width and intensity of gene expressions exhibit abrupt changes across the V1&#x02013;V2 border in the monkey cortex. We also found that a subtype of excitatory neurons that express 5-HT2C receptor mRNA are localized in layer 5 in most areas, but in layer 6 in monkey V1. These observations may reflect the conspicuous difference of monkey V1 compared with other areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Rockel1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Casagrande1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. While the differences between V1 and V2 are rather conspicuous, there are often more subtle differences in other areas. These subtle differences are more difficult to analyze, owing to many factors, including staining artifacts and sample-to-sample variabilities.</p><p>The simultaneous visualization of two different staining patterns may circumvent this problem to some extent by providing a reference to analyze the other. Accumulating samples for quantitative evaluation may also be helpful. Nevertheless, the latter method requires that data are obtained and accumulated from accurately identified cortical areas. This task is, in fact, quite difficult, especially for the rodent cortex, where there are no clear-cut borders for area demarcation. In an effort to analyze the spatial distribution of <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Hirokawa1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, we previously developed cortical box method. By this method, the gene expression in the rat neocortex can be mapped into a three-dimensional standardized cortical box from serially prepared sections. Importantly, this standardization process enables us to integrate data from different animals for statistical evaluation. Several methods have been proposed to reconstruct section data into a three-dimensional structure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Lein1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Bjaalie1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Gabbott1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>). In comparison with these previous methods, the advantage of our method is that the lamina information is preserved in one axis of the three-dimensional cortical map. The simplicity of the result is also a strength of our method, which helps in the intuitive understanding of the area distribution.</p><p>In the present study, we used the rat cortex as a model system to analyze the area-specific expression patterns of three &#x0201c;layer-specific&#x0201d; mRNAs, RORbeta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-SchaerenWiemers1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, ER81 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Weimann1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Yoneshima1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Watakabe1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and Nurr1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Xing1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Arimatsu2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Watakabe1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, which are expressed mainly in layers 4, 5 and 6 of the rodent neocortex, respectively. Although the heterogeneous expressions of these genes within neocortical areas have been reported in these previous studies, we think that more detailed analysis is necessary to understand their complex spatial distribution patterns. In this endeavor, we employed double ISH to examine the coexpression profiles of these genes at single cell level and cortical box method for a global view. Cortical box method enabled us to perform statistical evaluation of the data from different individual animals as well as multivariate analysis to extract common and differential patterns of expression for the three genes. Our study underscores the usefulness of quantitative approaches in analyzing gene expression data.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Heterogeneity of layer-specific gene expression revealed by double ISH</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows the double ISH of RORbeta and ER81 mRNAs and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> shows that of RORbeta and Nurr1 mRNAs in the middle and occipital coronal sections of rat brains.

As reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-SchaerenWiemers1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, RORbeta mRNA was most abundant in the barrel field of the parietal cortex area 1 (Par1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). RORbeta mRNA was generally expressed more abundantly in the sensory areas than in other areas. ER81 mRNA exhibited the opposite pattern, showing higher levels of expression in the areas where the RORbeta mRNA expression level was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, panels a, e and f).

At this magnification, we were able to identify individual neurons and examine how the positively stained neurons are distributed within and across layers in different areas. For example, although Nurr1-mRNA-positive cells were mostly confined to layers 6A and 6B of most areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, panels a'&#x02013;e'), its subpopulation was found scattered into layer 5 and even layer 4 in the lateral-most areas. In the laterocaudal area (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, Ect), Nurr1-mRNA-positive cells were found both in layers 5 and 6 to a similar extent and extensively intermingled with the RORbeta-mRNA-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, panel f'). Such area differences were also observed for ER81-mRNA-positive cells. In the barrel field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, panel b), we observed a sublayer with lower expression levels of both RORbeta and ER81 mRNAs (white arrows). Based on Hoechst nuclear staining, this cleft sublayer appears to be the upper part of layer 5 (data not shown), despite low number of ER81-mRNA-positive cells. Such a gap does not exist in other areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, panels e and f). In the laterocaudal area (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, Ect), neurons that expressed both ER81 and RORbeta mRNAs at moderately high level were located around the border between layers 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, panel f). These observations indicate heterogeneous lamina expression patterns of the &#x0201c;layer-specific&#x0201d; genes at the cellular level.</p><p>The overlapping mRNA expression profiles raised the possibility that the two mRNAs with different lamina specificities are coexpressed in the same cells. This was examined in high-magnification photos in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g003">Fig. 3</xref>. Although RORbeta is a marker for layer 4, it is also expressed in layer 5 throughout the rat neocortex. When we examined the coexpression of RORbeta and ER81 mRNAs by double ISH, these mRNAs were coexpressed within the same cells in layer 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g003">Fig. 3A&#x02013;3C</xref>). Layer 4 neurons generally expressed only RORbeta mRNA, while many layer 5 neurons expressed only ER81 mRNA. However, the layer 5 neurons expressing RORbeta mRNA mostly coexpressed ER81 mRNA. Such coexpression was observed in all the areas examined (data not shown). On the other hand, RORbeta and Nurr1 mRNAs were not coexpressed in the same neurons even in the areas with extensive intermingling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g003">Fig. 3D&#x02013;3F</xref>). Similarly, ER81 and Nurr1 mRNAs were not expressed within the same neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g003">Fig. 3G&#x02013;3I</xref>). This point has been shown previously for mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Watakabe1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, but our data now showed the same co-expression pattern in rats. Thus, we conclude that the coexpression preferences of the three genes are common across areas, although the relative abundance and distribution are quite divergent.</p><fig id="pone-0003266-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003266.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Coexpression of RORbeta, ER81 and Nurr1 genes.</title><p>(A)&#x02013;(C) Double ISH of RORbeta (red) and ER81 (green) mRNAs in a somatosensory area.

To circumvent this problem, we applied a standardization and reconstruction procedure for the ISH samples of the serially prepared coronal sections of the posterior part of the rat cortex as follows (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Hirokawa1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>). In the reconstruction, the shape of the cortex was transformed to fit into a rectangle, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>. The left and right borders of the rectangle correspond to the medial ends of the cortex and the rhinal fissure, respectively, both of which can be easily determined. We also normalized the level of ISH signals so that the relative strength of the ISH signals at a given location can be compared across different data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g004">Figure 4B</xref> illustrates the standardization process from the ISH data of the RORbeta gene. As shown in this figure, seventeen ISH coronal sections in total were used to cover the posterior part of one rat brain hemisphere (&#x02212;2.1 to &#x02212;6.3 mm from Bregma) with 280 &#x000b5;m intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>; original images). It was already evident from the original images that there are three distinct clusters of high RORbeta signals, which roughly corresponded to the somatosensory, auditory and visual areas (delineated by yellow, red and blue lines, respectively). The middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g004">Fig. 4B</xref> shows the images transformed into seventeen rows of cortical rectangles. In these rows of images, the three clusters of high RORbeta ISH signals were now more clearly visualized (&#x0201c;Representative&#x0201d;). Importantly, once the staining intensity was standardized, we could easily integrate multiple sets of data. In the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, the average of six sets of samples from three rats is shown. Note that the pattern of a single set of sample (&#x0201c;Representative&#x0201d;) was very similar to that of the average.

We performed the same processing for six series of such samples (right and left hemispheres from three rats) and averaged them. Note that the patterns of the representative and the average data are quite similar.

By this procedure, the expression data are now mapped onto a standardized cortical box, which can be easily manipulated for various analyses.

The maps of other layers also suggest the consistency of the area borders determined from the layer 4 map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). For example, the expression changes in the layer 2/3 map generally occurred at the same border as that in the layer 4 map. However, there were several important differences in the patterns. For example, the GLIs of the mediodorsal areas (agranular retrosplenial cortex (RSA) and frontal cortex, area 1 (Fr1)) were high in layer 2/3 but not in layer 4. Also, the GLI in area HL (hind limb), a subregion of the somatosensory areas, was low in layers 2/3 but high in layer 4. Despite such differences in the area distribution patterns between layers, the borders for the changes in the GLI were the same for layers 2/3 and 4. Similarly, the GLIs of layers 4 and 5 were mostly complementary and the same borders were observed. Thus, the Nissl-GLI is considered to faithfully reflect the cytoarchitectonic area map.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Analysis for area-specific distribution patterns of RORbeta, ER81 and Nurr1 mRNAs by cortical box method</title><p>Following the determination of the cytoarchitectonic lamina and area borders by Nissl staining, we analyzed the distribution patterns of RORbeta, ER81 and Nurr1 mRNAs by the cortical box method. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g006">Figure 6A</xref> shows the standardized maps of RORbeta, ER81 and Nurr1 mRNAs for layers 2/3, 4, 5 and 6.

These patterns coincided well with the borders determined by Nissl staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>; solid and dashed lines).

However, the area difference between RORbeta and ER81 mRNAs was much larger than that expected from the Nissl-GLI.

For example, the expression level of RORbeta mRNA was higher in layers 2/3 of the Par1 subfield of the somatosensory cortex and the auditory cortex, which is consistent with the findings described in a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-PalomeroGallagher1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the expression levels of Nurr1 in the temporal cortex ventral area (TeV) and ectorhinal cortex (Ect) (about 90&#x00025; of the mediodorsal distance at the bregma distance of &#x02212;6 mm) were higher in layer 5 rather than layer 6, which is consistent with results of the double ISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, panel f'). Although ER81 mRNA exhibited a shift of expression from layer 5 to layer 4 in the medial-most retrosplenial area (RSA), this may be due to the difference in the overall lamina position in this area.</p><p>An advantage of our method is that the variability of gene expression across different sets of samples can be quantitatively estimated. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, we mapped the coefficient of variance (CV) of each gene for each layer map. CV is the percentage of the standard deviation (SD) per average and a measure of the relative variability. By definition, CV becomes unreliable when the average is small. Thus, we excluded the areas with low gene expression values from the analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> (white areas). The map shows that the CVs were generally low (&#x0003c;50&#x00025;) in the central regions of a cluster with high average values and were high (&#x0003e;80&#x00025;) in the borders of those clusters. This result suggests that there is little sample-to-sample variance in the area distribution of these genes, and that the variability is concentrated at the borders. The CV showed a constantly low level in the transition regions from area Par1 to the temporal cortex, area1 (Te1), in the layer 4 map of RORbeta and from area Oc2MM to Oc2L in the layer 5 map of ER81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>; white dotted lines), despite large changes in the averages. In these regions, even the area borders are reproduced across different animals.

This observation suggests that the distribution patterns of these mRNAs may be governed by some common rules. In an attempt to discover such rules, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) using five layer maps of RORbeta (layer 4), ER81 (layers 4 and 5) and Nurr1 (layers 5 and 6). Other layer maps were excluded from the analysis, because there are very little signals, if any, in other maps, and not reliable. In this analysis, we first divided each map into 1000&#x000d7;340 blocks, so that the spatial maps as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> could be represented by rows of data having 34,000 data points. When five of such datasets are combined, it is considered as 34,000 points plotted in a five-dimensional space. The purpose of the PCA is to find new &#x0201c;axes&#x0201d; to explain the variability of the 34,000 data points with the least variables. In other words, we expected PCA to decompose the five maps of spatial distribution data into fewer maps that represent the common features of spatial variations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g007">Figure 7A</xref> shows the first two principal components (PCs) obtained by PCA. The eigenvector of each PC is graphed at the bottom. These bar graphs demonstrate the contribution of each layer map in determining the PC scores that are illustrated as the colored maps on top. At first glance, PC1 is similar to the layer 4 map of RORbeta, while PC2 is similar to the layer 6 map of Nurr1. However, as the bar graphs indicate, PC1 and PC2 have contributions from all the five layer maps in various degrees and directions. For example, in addition to RORbeta patterns, the ER81 patterns in layers 4 and 5 considerably contributed to PC1, but they were in the reverse direction. This means that PC1 represents a feature shared by RORbeta and ER81 (and Nurr1 to a lesser extent), which is shown as their complementary distribution patterns. Similarly, PC2 represents a feature shared by layer 5 of ER81 and Nurr1, but in a complementary manner. There are almost no contributions of RORbeta in this component.</p><fig id="pone-0003266-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003266.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Principal component analysis (PCA) of standardized cortical map.</title><p>Cortical areas were divided into 340&#x000d7;100 points so that the ISH signal values could be represented by a matrix of 34000 data points.

In this figure, the cortical areas were roughly classified into four categories. Somatosensory, auditory, and visual domains were colored in yellow, red and blue, respectively. The medial and lateral ends of the cortex, which are colored in grey, are motor, limbic and paralimbic areas and considered to be higher areas in the cortical hierarchy in terms of sensory inputs. In the plot, the areas with the same modalities are grouped by lines to aid in the visualization. Here, we observed two features. First, the primary sensory areas (Par1, Te1, Oc1) were clustered at the lowest value of PC1 with little contribution from PC2. The higher order multisensory areas tended to be located in the higher values of PC1. Second, the higher order association areas of different modalities were dispersed in the plot, because of the contribution of different PC2 values. Together, these observations suggest the similarity of the primary sensory areas and the diversion of association areas, as far as the expression of the three &#x0201c;layer-specific&#x0201d; genes are concerned.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We studied the area-specific expression patterns of three layer-specific genes, RORbeta, ER81 and Nurr1, using double ISH and the cortical box method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Hirokawa1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Double ISH showed that the coexpression profiles of these genes are the same across areas, whereas their relative abundance and the extent of intermingling differ considerably. The cortical box method allowed us to quantitatively and objectively analyze the three-dimensional pattern of gene expression using integrated ISH data sets. We first discuss the methodological aspects of our study and then the implications of our findings in terms of the area architecture of the rat cortex.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Cortical box method is a useful tool for gene expression analyses</title><p>For histological studies, it is critically important to accurately identify various anatomical structures. This is particularly true for the study of the neocortex that consists of many areas and subareas. Traditionally, the Nissl staining patterns have been used as criteria for discrimination of cytoarchitectonic areas (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Brodmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-vonBonin1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>). Nevertheless, the area differences determined by Nissl staining are often subtle and susceptible to various artifacts, such as inhomogeneous staining and sampling variances. Although quantitative methods of characterizing cortical areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Zilles2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Zilles3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Schleicher2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> enable observer-independent area demarcation, the area identification is still subtle and requires exact spatial information of the section of interest. In cats and monkeys, sulcal landmarks help in area identification. However, the rodent cortex offers no such landmarks. To circumvent this problem, we previously developed the cortical box method to analyze c-fos immunoreactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Hirokawa1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, which we now applied to the analysis of ISH data. This method uses a set of coronal sections that cover the entire posterior cortex of the rat. With sufficient numbers of sections, it is possible to accurately estimate the continuity of the areas that span several sections (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Because this method transforms expression data into a standardized form, many different sets of data can be compared quantitatively. Furthermore, although the selection of ROI (region of interest) for standardization is still determined manually, this process only requires the determination of the medial and lateral ends of the cortex, which have clear landmarks and are unambiguous. The effectiveness of these features is demonstrated by the reproducibility of cytoarchitectonic areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) and low CV of the gene expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) across different sets of samples. As we have shown in this study, this method is applicable to the sections stained by various methods including Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, ISH and possibly other methods, such as neural tracer dyes. This method will, thus, enable us to integrate different types of histological data in the same coordinate for quantitative analyses.</p><p>In the current study, we pooled the data from both right and left hemispheres of three different rats, to reduce experimental variability. Although there is a possibility that the two hemispheres show differences in gene expression, we were not able to find sign of lateralization, under the current number of dataset (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3). However, a study using larger number of datasets for cortical box analysis may clarify if any lateralization exists in rodent neocortex.</p><p>Many methods have been developed to standardize the rodent brain map (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Lein1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Bjaalie1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-MacKenzieGraham1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Gabbott1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Wada1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Schwarz1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>). In particular, Gabbott et al. (2005) reported a method similar to the cortical box method to investigate the cortical projections from the rat frontal areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Gabbott1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Our method is also conceptually similar to the surface-based atlases developed by Van Essen and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-VanEssen1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. The advantage of these methods is that by flattening the three-dimensional cortex, it becomes easy to understand intuitively the global picture of gene expression. It is also important that the cortical box method enables the quantitative analyses of the spatial distribution data. Even when there are sample-to-sample variances owing to various reasons, we can extract useful information by averaging the data. We can also estimate the significance of such variances (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). We noted that the variability of gene expression were concentrated at area borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), which could be attributable to individual difference of the area architecture, although it is possible that such variance was derived from experimental variance. One advantage of our method over other flattening techniques is the simplicity and ease of use, because it is optimized for the simple sulcus structure of the rodent posterior cortex. On the other hand, it would be difficult to directly apply it to the convoluted cortex of other mammalian species. For example, because the thickness of each lamina varies greatly in areas for primate brains (e.g., see Fig. S3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Watakabe1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>), it will become difficult to construct layer maps using the same layer borders for different areas. However, if we are to limit the analysis to a subregion of the cortex that can be defined by clear-cut landmarks (such as sulci), cortical box method may be used to analyze convoluted brains as well.</p><p>Despite the many useful features of the cortical box method as pointed above, caution is required when interpreting the data, because it does not offer information on the expression at the cellular resolution level. For example, in the layer 6 maps of ER81 and Nurr1, the maps of two genes overlapped in the laterocaudal areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g005">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g006">6</xref>, TeV and Ect), although the double ISH results demonstrated that they were not coexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g003">Fig. 3G&#x02013;I</xref>). It is also notable that, owing to normalization, the low expression levels tend to be ignored in a global view. For example, although RORbeta mRNA is clearly expressed by layer 5 neurons throughout areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), it does not show up in the layer 5 map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). In the case of ER81, the very high expression level in the medial areas obscures its widespread distribution across the entire neocortical areas in layer 5. The cortical box method needs to be coupled with careful analyses of expressions at the cellular level. It should also be noted that, by fitting the cortex into rectangle, the information of the cortical thickness is lost, although the relative expression value is preserved throughout layers. To examine the differential cortical thickness across areas, other analytical method needs to be used.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Identification of cortical areas by cortical box method</title><p>In previous studies, cortical areas were successfully delineated in an objective manner by Nissl-GLI analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-PalomeroGallagher1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Zilles2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Zilles3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

The consistency with the RORbeta gene expression supports this area delineation. In the auditory cortex, we distinguished Te1 and Te3V, on the basis of Nissl-GLI and RORbeta expression. Te3V in our map is considered to correspond to the belt region of the auditory cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-PalomeroGallagher1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Arnault1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our analysis also revealed tight correlation between gene expression and the cytoarchitectonic area. In particular, RORbeta and ER81 patterns were quite similar to those of Nissl-GLI in layers 4 and 5, respectively. This is anticipated to some extent, because both Nissl-GLI and gene expression intensity should positively correlate with the neuronal density. However, RORbeta and ER81 mRNAs were expressed by a subpopulation of cortical neurons and the variations in their densities appeared to be much greater than those expected from the neuronal density of the layer of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Besides, the perceived intensity of labeling per cell also varied across areas. Regarding Nurr1 gene expression, the positive cells represent only a minor population of the layer 6 neurons, and the area distribution pattern was completely different from that of the Nissl-GLI. These observations suggest that there may exist some rules that commonly affect their area-specific expression patterns other than neuronal density. By using PCA, we tried to find such rules and obtained two principal components (PC1 and PC2).</p><p>The PC1&#x02013;PC2 plot of different cortical areas shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g007">Fig. 7B</xref> indicates the features of these areas characterized by RORbeta, ER81 and Nurr1 gene expressions. This figure clearly shows that the primary sensory areas, Par1, Par1L, Te1, Oc1M and Oc1B, cluster together at lower PC1 values, while the higher sensory areas and multimodal areas are away from the &#x0201c;cluster&#x0201d; of primary sensory areas with higher PC1 values, but with various PC2 values. This pattern demonstrates the similarity of gene expression in the primary sensory areas, as well as the diversity of gene expression patterns in the higher sensory areas. There are several possible explanations for the similarity of the primary sensory areas. First, the primary sensory areas generally have &#x0201c;granular&#x0201d; layer 4, which contains a high density of thalamorecipient neurons. The PC1 score may be positively or negatively correlated with the neuronal density as we discussed earlier. Second, the primary sensory areas receive strong inputs from the primary sensory thalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Livingstone1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Ding1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, which can be visualized by cytochrome oxidase staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-WongRiley1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-WongRiley2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. It is well known that certain genes exhibit activity-dependent regulation during development or in the adult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Tochitani1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Dragunow1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Sur1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. The expressions of RORbeta, ER81 and/or Nurr1 genes may be affected, directly or indirectly, by the thalamocortical inputs and contribute to the low PC1 scores in the primary sensory areas. In this context, it is interesting that area DZ exhibits a high PC1 score despite its location within Par1. Previous studies suggest that the dysgranular zones in barrel cortex including our DZ defined here does not receive inputs from the primary somatosensory thalamic nucleus; instead it receives inputs from a higher order thalamic nucleus and adjacent primary somatosensory areas as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Chapin1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Killackey1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Lu1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Pierret1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.

Finally, PC1 has contributions from both RORbeta and ER81 layer maps, but in the reverse direction. These genes are enriched in layers 4 and 5, which are generally considered as the input and output layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Douglas1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. We speculate that the maturation of the structures of layers 4 and 5 is coordinated so that the primary sensory areas are specialized for input reception.</p><p>Compared with the interpretation of PC1, that of PC2 is more difficult. We could think of possible developmental causes for the conspicuous lateral-to-medial gradient of PC2: it may reflect cortical patterning by a gradient of regulatory genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Sur1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Bishop1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, or a cortical migratory stream <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Bayer1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the functional significance of such a gradient in the mature neocortex remains unclear. Arimatsu and coworkers report that Nurr1-positive neurons send corticocortical but not corticothalamic projections in the rat cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Arimatsu2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that this projection specificity is also conserved in monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Watakabe1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations suggest that PC2 may represent a special type of cortico-cortical connectivity.</p><p>It is quite intriguing that Nurr1 mRNA is expressed by a subtype of neurons distinct from those expressing RORbeta or ER81 mRNAs despite the extensive intermingling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The negative correlations of Nurr1 with RORbeta or ER81 contribution in PC1 and PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>) raise the possibility that the same organizing principle differentially affects different cell types. We predict that there may be some rules that coordinate the expression of thousands of genes in organizing the neocortical structure. How such coordination occurs is, at present, an open question. The double ISH and cortical box method are useful tools for analyzing such rules and for revealing the principles behind them.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals and tissue preparation</title><p>Four adult male Sprague Dawley rats (one for double ISH, three for cortical box method of single ISH) were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc.

To achieve objective and automatic procedures, we restricted the quantification of gene expression to the posterior half of the cortex, which has clear structural landmarks. We used 17 coronal sections in each animal, which were presumed to correspond to the Bregma of &#x02212;2.1 to &#x02212;6.3 mm, as determined from the order of serial sections and the shape of the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-Paxinos2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Sections that contain artifacts such as tearing or bubbles in the cortex were excluded from the analysis.

The medial end of the white matter and the valley of the rhinal fissure were chosen as structural landmarks of the mediodorsal (MD) and lateroventral (LV) ends of the cortical sections, respectively. The pial surface and the border between the cortex and the white matter were chosen as the outer (OC) and inner contours (IC), respectively. Then, the image of a large part of the cortex was manually cut out on the basis of these landmarks using Adobe Photoshop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The following steps were automatically carried out using a customized software program designed by LabVIEW 7.0 (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). The lengths of OC and IC were measured and equally divided into 100 points. Sectors that were defined by every two adjacent points on each contour were extracted and converted to standardized rectangles by linear interpolation. These rectangles from MD to LV were aligned from left to right to form a &#x0201c;standardized cortical section&#x0201d; (100&#x000d7;1000 pixels, depth and width, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The standardized cortical sections are distorted toward deeper layers, because the outer contour is always longer than inner contour. We evaluated the transformation rates of standardized sections from original sections. The average rates of transformation across areas were, 90&#x000b1;5&#x00025; in layer 2/3, 100&#x000b1;5&#x00025; in layer 4, 110&#x000b1;5&#x00025; in layer 5 and 120&#x000b1;5&#x00025; in layer 6, respectively. The transformation is performed so that the local density of staining is preserved. Therefore, distortion by the transformation does not affect the overall patterns of gene expression. Although our method introduces the transformation especially in deeper layers, the boundaries of the primary sensory areas were the same for both layers 4 (RORbeta) and 6 (Nurr1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that deviation in the deeper layer was only limited.</p><p>To normalize the staining intensity, the means and standard deviations (SD) of all the pixel values for the ISH images of one dataset were calculated.

To generate the standardized map of a particular layer (1000&#x000d7;340 pixels) (width and Bregma distances, respectively), the specific layer fraction (10&#x02013;30&#x00025; for layer 2/3; 30&#x02013;50&#x00025; for layer 4; 50&#x02013;75&#x00025; for layer 5; 75&#x02013;100&#x00025; for layer 6) was extracted from the standardized cortical box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) and compressed into a two-dimensional map by averaging. Post hoc smoothing (spatial averaging) was achieved using a moving window operator (41&#x000d7;41 pixels). To create average layer maps, the maps from both hemispheres of all the animals were averaged. To create the CV map, the CV (CV&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;SD/average&#x000d7;100 (&#x00025;)) was calculated for each pixel. When the average of a pixel was lower than 10&#x00025;, the corresponding pixel was covered with white in the CV map, because the average near zero diverges the CV value into infinite.

The components of the eigenvectors provide the coefficients that define the linear combination, while the resulting scores are the projected points. The first two primary components with SDs higher than those of standardized original images (eigenvalues: PC1, &#x003b3;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.87; PC2, &#x003b3;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.50) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003266-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Nomenclature</title><p>For cortical regions other than Ect, the nomenclature followed that of Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003266-PalomeroGallagher1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.
