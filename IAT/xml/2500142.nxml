Specific binding of AQP2 to G-actin in reconstituted liposomes is negatively regulated by PKA phosphorylation. Dual color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy reveals local AQP2 interaction with G-actin in live epithelial cells at single-molecule resolution. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling and AQP2 phosphorylation release AQP2 from G-actin. In turn, AQP2 phosphorylation increases its affinity to TM5b, resulting in reduction of TM5b bound to F-actin, subsequently inducing F-actin destabilization. RNA interference&#x02013;mediated knockdown and overexpression of TM5b confirm its inhibitory role in apical trafficking of AQP2. These findings indicate a novel mechanism of channel protein trafficking, in which the channel protein itself critically regulates local actin reorganization to initiate its movement.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: AQP2, aquaporin-2; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; FCCS, fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; m&#x003b2;CD, methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin; RT-qPCR, real time quantitative PCR; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TM5b, tropomyosin-5b; Trx, thioredoxin; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Body water homeostasis is essential for the survival of mammals and is regulated by the renal collecting duct. Key components in the regulation of collecting duct water permeability are the vasopressin receptor and water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fushimi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nielsen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Valenti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noda and Sasaki, 2006</xref>). The binding of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin to vasopressin V2 receptors on renal principal cells stimulates cAMP synthesis via activation of adenylate cyclase. The subsequent activation of PKA leads to phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256, and this phosphorylation event is required to increase the water permeability and water reabsorption of renal principal cells. In this process, subapical storage vesicles in principal cells containing AQP2 translocate to and fuse with the apical plasma membrane, rendering the cell water permeable. Upon removal of vasopressin, AQP2 is internalized by endocytosis into storage vesicles, and this restores the water-impermeable state of the cell. AQP2 mutations cause congenital NDI (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), a disease characterized by a massive loss of water through the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nielsen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Valenti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noda and Sasaki, 2006</xref>). Although many advances have been made in identifying the signal transduction pathway involved in AQP2 trafficking, the precise biophysical mechanisms that AQP2 phosphorylation provides the force driving AQP2 movement remain unclear. Recently, we have discovered an AQP2 binding protein complex, which includes actin and tropomyosin-5b (TM5b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noda et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noda and Sasaki, 2006</xref>). TM5b is expressed in high levels in the kidney and localized in the apical and basolateral cell cortices in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Temm-Grove et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perry, 2001</xref>). TM5b is the only isoform that binds to AQP2 and has the most effective actin-stabilizing ability among the TM family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kostyukova and Hitchcock-DeGregori, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noda et al., 2005</xref>). Because these findings raise the possibility of critical involvement of TM5b in AQP2 trafficking, there may be changes in the interactions among AQP2, actin, and TM5b that alter actin organization in a restricted area around AQP2 for initiating its trafficking. Therefore, we directly measured the real-time interaction dynamics at the single molecule level using dual color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) in live cells. In this paper, we show that AQP2 itself critically regulates local actin reorganization to initiate its movement by phosphorylation-dependent reciprocal interaction between G-actin and TM5b.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>AQP2 reconstituted in liposomes specifically binds to G-actin and PKA phosphorylation decreases the binding affinity</title><p>We examined whether AQP2 phosphorylation itself altered its binding properties to actin by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). For this purpose, we performed large-scale expression of full-length recombinant human AQP2 fused to thioredoxin (Trx), purification, and reconstitution in proteoliposomes and subjected it to in vitro PKA phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). AQP2 reconstituted in liposomes was used as an injected analyte in SPR experiments to maintain native conformation. Proteins that were not reconstituted in liposomes were removed by fractionating on a density step gradient (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), and the unilamellar proteoliposomes were obtained by extruding through filters with 100-nm pores. The binding of AQP2 liposomes to G-actin increased in a concentration-dependent manner and was significantly greater than that of the control substances, which were Trx liposomes (Trx-incorporated liposomes) and liposomes without protein incorporation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). These findings indicate that G-actin binds specifically to AQP2 liposomes. PKA phosphorylation of AQP2 significantly decreased the binding of AQP2 liposomes to G-actin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). In contrast, when F-actin was linked to a sensor chip, there were no significant differences between control liposomes and AQP2 liposomes with or without phosphorylation, indicating that the interaction of F-actin with AQP2 liposomes was not specific (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709177/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709177/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>AQP2 reconstituted in liposomes specifically binds to G-actin, and PKA phosphorylation decreases the binding affinity.</bold> (A) Reconstitution of full-length human AQP2 fused to Trx (AQP2/Trx; top) or Trx (bottom) in liposomes.

Under control conditions, AQP2 was predominantly localized in the subapical region, whereas treatment with forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase mimicking vasopressin action, induced the translocation of AQP2 to the apical membrane as observed in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noda and Sasaki, 2006</xref>). Within the resolution limit of the fluorescence microscope, forskolin did not induce significant changes in either the distribution of G-actin or F-actin, although there was a tendency for a decrease in F-actin in the subapical region and near the base of the cells. In the process of AQP2 translocation, the actin dynamics may change in a restricted narrow area around the AQP2 molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noda and Sasaki, 2006</xref>). To examine the spatial and temporal interactions of AQP2 with G-actin at the single molecule level in live cells, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and FCCS were performed in MDCK cells expressing DsRed-AQP2 and GFP-actin. In these cells, forskolin stimulation induced DsRed-AQP2 translocation from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane (Fig. S2 C). FCCS is an extended technique of FCS and enables the tracing of two spectrally distinct fluorophores, providing the kinetics of molecular interactions at a specific position in a live cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudendistel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bacia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kitamura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kogure et al., 2006</xref>). Because FCCS probes fluorescently labeled molecules at low concentrations, FCCS provides an advantage for studying molecular interactions with minimal disturbance of the natural state in living cells. Furthermore, FCS and FCCS are able to assess G-actin alone because these measurements are well suited for fast processes occurring in microseconds to milliseconds of transition in the observation area, and the much slower diffusion of large molecule and immobile molecule such as F-actin are not assessed by these methods. Therefore, to examine AQP2 interaction with G-actin, FCS and FCCS measurements were performed at successive time points and at different positions in the same live cell through the AQP2 trafficking pathway.</p><p>We positioned the FCS focus either in the subapical region or on the apical membrane in a cell because AQP2 trafficking occurs from the subapical storage vesicles to the apical membrane. FCS focus positioning was determined by laser scanning microscopy imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pack et al., 2006</xref>). The diffusion coefficient of AQP2 on the apical membrane was significantly decreased compared with that in the subapical region (Fig. S3 E, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709177/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709177/DC1</ext-link>), indicating that this protocol was able to discriminate the focus position on the apical membrane from that in the subapical region.</p><p>FCS and FCCS were performed at the position in the subapical region indicated by <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and at the position on the apical membrane indicated by <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref> in the same cell. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 (B and E)</xref>, the fluorescence fluctuations of DsRed-AQP2 and GFP-actin gave rise to cross-correlation signal at both positions. Relative cross-correlation amplitude ([<italic>Gc</italic>(0)-1]/[<italic>Gr</italic>(0)-1]) was 0.4 &#x000b1; 0.04 in the subapical region and 0.33 &#x000b1; 0.02 on the apical membrane. This finding indicates that AQP2 interacts with actin both in the subapical region and on the apical membrane in the live cell. The cell was then treated with forskolin and the FCCS measurement was continued at the same positions. Forskolin stimulation for 10 min significantly decreased the cross-correlation signal both in the subapical region and on the apical membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C, F, and G</xref>; and Fig. S3, C and D), indicating dissociation of AQP2 from actin. In addition, forskolin treatment slowed AQP2 mobility both in the subapical region and on the apical membrane; however, only the effect in the subapical region was significant (Fig. S3 E). In actin mobility, no significant changes were observed with forskolin treatment (Fig. S3 F). The reason may be that FCS assesses the mobility of G-actin alone and is not able to assess changes in the F-actin/G-actin ratio or actin polymerization.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>FCS and FCCS analyses in live cells expressing DsRed-AQP2 and GFP-actin.</bold> (A and D) The crosshair indicates the measurement position: A, subapical region; D, apical membrane.

The cross-correlation signal of cells pretreated with H89 was similar to that without H89 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). Forskolin stimulation did not significantly decrease the cross correlation signal in the H89-pretreated cells. This finding indicates that the dissociation of actin from AQP2 is mediated by cAMP-dependent signaling.</p><p>Phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256 is known to be essential for AQP2 trafficking to the apical membrane. In addition, H89 is reported to abolish the increase of AQP2 phosphorylation induced by forskolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valenti et al., 2000</xref>). To determine whether phosphorylation at serine 256 of AQP2 is required for the dissociation of actin from AQP2, the mutant S256A-AQP2, which mimics nonphosphorylated AQP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kamsteeg et al., 2000</xref>), was generated, fused with DsRed, and expressed in MDCK cells. Forskolin did not increase S256A-AQP2 on the cell surface (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709177/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709177/DC1</ext-link>). The amount of S256A-AQP2 on the apical membrane with or without forskolin was similar to wild-type (WT) AQP2 under baseline conditions. Consistent with the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2004</xref>), this finding indicates that the constitutive recycling pathway under baseline conditions is not dependent on phosphorylation at the serine 256 residue in AQP2. S256A-AQP2 mobility was similar to that of WT-AQP2 (Fig. S3 E). The cross-correlation signal of S256A-AQP2 and actin was similar to that of WT-AQP2 and actin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). However, unlike WT-AQP2, forskolin treatment did not significantly decrease the cross-correlation signal. These findings indicate that AQP2 phosphorylation at serine 256 is required for the dissociation of actin from AQP2.</p></sec><sec><title>AQP2 phosphorylation induces actin depolymerization by inhibiting TM5b function</title><p>From these results, we have speculated that AQP2 directly regulates actin organization to initiate AQP2 trafficking because many actin binding proteins exhibit the ability to regulate actin dynamics. To test whether AQP2 has actin-regulating functions, we performed fluorescence-based pyrene-actin assays using AQP2 reconstituted in liposomes added with the vesicle-free fraction of rat kidney papillae extracts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). There were no significant differences among nonphosphorylated AQP2 liposomes, Trx liposomes, and liposomes in the effects on actin disassembly. In contrast, phosphorylated AQP2 liposomes significantly increased depolymerization of F-actin compared with nonphosphorylated AQP2 liposomes and the controls. This finding indicates that PKA phosphorylation of AQP2 promotes actin depolymerization. We previously reported that AQP2 bound to TM5b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noda et al., 2005</xref>), which is known to regulate actin stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kostyukova and Hitchcock-DeGregori, 2004</xref>). We have speculated that AQP2 phosphorylation may regulate the effect of TM5b on actin organization. Because TM5b inhibits depolymerization at the pointed end of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kostyukova and Hitchcock-DeGregori, 2004</xref>), we performed pyrene-actin assays using barbed-end blocked actin filaments, recombinant TM5b, and AQP2 reconstituted in liposomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). In the absence of TM5b, AQP2 liposomes did not have effects on actin assembly. TM5b without liposomes inhibited the rate of pointed end depolymerization. TM5b with Trx liposomes and liposomes without protein incorporation also inhibited the depolymerization. When nonphosphorylated AQP2 liposomes were incubated, there was a tendency for a decrease in the inhibitory effect of TM5b on depolymerization, although the changes were not significant. When phosphorylated AQP2 liposomes were incubated, the inhibitory effect of TM5b on depolymerization was significantly decreased. The actin-depolymerizing effect of phosphorylated AQP2 liposomes was significantly greater than that of nonphosphorylated AQP2 liposomes. These findings indicate that AQP2 phosphorylation inhibits the actin-stabilizing effect of TM5b, resulting in actin depolymerization.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>AQP2 phosphorylation inhibits the actin-stabilizing effect of TM5b, resulting in actin depolymerization.</bold> (A and B) Pyrene-actin assay using the vesicle-free fraction of rat kidney papillae extracts.

Rho activation induces actin polymerization and inhibits AQP2 trafficking, whereas Rho inhibition induces actin depolymerization and promotes AQP2 trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klussmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tamma et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2005</xref>). These data indicate the facilitatory role of actin depolymerization in the AQP2 translocation to the cell surface. Our present study shows that inhibition of TM5b function by phosphorylated AQP2 induces actin depolymerization and TM5b knockdown promotes AQP2 trafficking to the apical membrane, which is consistent with the actin barrier model for the trafficking. TM5b overexpression inhibits the AQP2 trafficking. These findings also indicate the critical involvement of TM5b in the formation of the actin barrier that prevent AQP2 trafficking.</p><p>FCCS reveals AQP2 interaction with G-actin on the AQP2 trafficking pathway in live cells at the resolution of single molecule. cAMP signaling, an effector of vasopressin action, and phosphorylation at serine 256 of AQP2 release AQP2 from G-actin. Because this dissociation is observed both in the subapical region and on the apical membrane, not only exocytosis but also endocytosis may be promoted by vasopressin. In addition to modulating the ratio of the exocytic rate to the endocytic rate, vasopressin may increase the overall recycling rate.</p><p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al. (2007)</xref> have shown that hsc70 and hsp70 heat shock proteins interact with the AQP2 C terminus. Functional knockdown of hsc70 results in membrane accumulation of AQP2 and inhibits endocytosis. They suggest that AQP2 accumulated on the cell surface by vasopressin is subsequently dephosphorylated by local phosphatase activity and associates with hsc70, resulting in its reinternalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2007</xref>). G-actin also binds to the C terminus of nonphosphorylated AQP2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noda et al., 2004a</xref>). Together with these findings, it is speculated that there may be a competitive binding between G-actin and hsc70 for the nonphosphorylated AQP2 C terminus. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al. (2007)</xref> also show that S256A mutation inhibits AQP2 binding with hsc70 although S256A-AQP2 does not accumulate on the cell surface (Fig. S4). In this case, S256A-AQP2 binds to G-actin and decreases TM5b binding, in which F-actin is stabilized by TM5b, resulting in the mainly intracellular retention of S256A-AQP2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, and Fig. S4). In addition to the reciprocal interaction between G-actin and TM5b regulated by AQP2 phosphorylation, there may be a spatiotemporally regulated binding between hsc70 and G-actin for the nonphosphorylated AQP2 C terminus, which may distinguish between exocytosis and endocytosis of AQP2. Therefore, hsc70 may also be involved in the apical localization of AQP2 in our study. Further analyses may be necessary to examine these possibilities.</p><p>There are several proteins whose interactions with actin are regulated by their phosphorylation. Caldesmon phosphorylation at serine 759 decreases its affinity with actin by its conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patchell et al., 2002</xref>). ADF/cofilin is dissociated from actin by its phosphorylation at serine 3, which is caused by steric blocking of actin binding by the phosphate moiety and not by a conformational change at the ADF/cofilin-actin interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">dos Remedios et al., 2003</xref>). The present study shows that AQP2 interactions with G-actin and TM5b are regulated by phosphorylation at serine 256 in the C terminus of AQP2. Further analyses are required for clarifying the structural basis for the interactions controlled by the AQP2 phosphorylation.</p><p>In this paper, AQP2 trafficking was examined using MDCK cells, which were derived from dog kidney tubules and exhibit properties of cortical collecting duct epithelial cells and proximal tubular epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richardson et al., 1981</xref>). MDCK cells are widely used to study AQP2 trafficking. As in collecting ducts, AQP2 expressed in MDCK cells is localized in intracellular vesicles in nonstimulated cells and translocates to the apical membrane after stimulation by vasopressin or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (Fig. S2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 2003</xref>). Because AQP2 is primarily expressed in collecting duct principle cells, it would be more physiologically relevant to use cell lines originating from collecting duct cells. However, for FCS and FCCS experiments performed in this study, proteins of interest should be fused with fluorescent protein and its expression level should be kept low in a cell to obtain the appropriate fluctuating signals. Therefore, we used MDCK cells, in which the control of transfection efficiency was relatively easy and AQP2 trafficking to the apical membrane was observed as in renal collecting ducts (Fig. S2).</p><p>The present study shows that AQP2 itself possesses an actin-regulatory function to initiate its movement by phosphorylation-dependent reciprocal interaction with G-actin and TM5b. Recently, there were several studies indicating the direct interactions of channel proteins with actin. ClC2 chloride channel directly interacts with F-actin and is activated by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2000</xref>). Short ClC3 isoform binds to F-actin and inhibition of this binding leads to a reduced hypotonic activation of this channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCloskey et al., 2007</xref>). V-ATPase subunit C binds to both F- and G-actin and induces cross-linking of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vitavska et al., 2005</xref>). Voltage-dependent anion channel directly binds to G-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roman et al., 2006</xref>), which modulates voltage-dependent anion channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mazzochi et al. (2006a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">b</xref>) show that the &#x003b1; subunit of ENaC (epithelial sodium channel) directly interacts with F-actin and is colocalized with F-actin at both the apical membrane and the subapical cytoplasm. The authors suggest that the direct interactions with actin regulate not only the channel activity but also the intracellular trafficking of ENaC from a subapical pool to the plasma membrane. Although there are several studies showing the direct binding of channels with actin, the roles of the interactions in the regulation of each channel are not clarified. With regard to TM, a calcium-permeable nonselective cation channel polycystin-2 is shown to bind to TM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2003</xref>), although the roles of the interaction in polycystin-2 function are not clarified. This paper shows that AQP2 itself critically regulates actin reorganization to initiate its movement by phosphorylation-dependent reciprocal interaction between G-actin and TM5b. Because the trafficking of many channels is altered by their phosphorylation, the interactions of channels with the actin cytoskeleton may be regulated by posttranslational mechanisms, including phosphorylation, and this trafficking mechanism may be extended to other channel proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of recombinant proteins</title><p>Human AQP2 cDNA was subcloned into pET32 (EMD) to generate His-tagged Trx-fused AQP2 (AQP2/Trx).
