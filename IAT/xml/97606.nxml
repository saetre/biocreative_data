Uracil-DNA glycosylase, encoded by the <italic>UNG1</italic> gene in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, repairs uracil in DNA formed due to deamination of cytosine. Our study demonstrates that inactivation of the <italic>UNG1</italic> gene leads to at least a 3-fold increased frequency of mutations in mtDNA compared with the wild-type. Using a Ung1p&#x02013;green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct, we demonstrate that yeast yUng1&#x02013;GFP protein localizes to both mitochondria and the nucleus, indicating that Ung1p must contain both a mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) and a nuclear localization signal. Our study reveals that the first 16 amino acids at the N-terminus contain the yUng1p MLS. Deletion of 16 amino acids resulted in the yUng1p&#x02013;GFP fusion protein being transported to the nucleus. We also investigated the intracellular localization of human hUng1p&#x02013;GFP in yeast. Our data indicate that hUng1p&#x02013;GFP predominately localizes to the mitochondria. Further analysis identified the N-terminal 16 amino acids as important for localization of hUng1 protein into the mitochondria. Expression of both yeast and human <italic>UNG1</italic> cDNA suppressed the frequency of mitochondrial mutation in <italic>UNG1</italic>-deficient cells. However, expression of y<italic>UNG1</italic> in wild-type cells increased the frequency of mutations in mtDNA, suggesting that elevated expression of Ung1p is mutagenic. An increase in the frequency of mitochondrial mutants was also observed when h<italic>UNG1</italic> site-directed mutants (Y147C and Y147S) were expressed in mitochondria. Our study suggests that deamination of cytosine is a frequent event in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria and both yeast and human Ung1p repairs deaminated cytosine in mitochondria.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as an important cause of adult and childhood human pathology. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been found in adult diseases as diverse as cancer, migraine, infertility, diabetes, heart disease, blindness, deafness, kidney disease, liver disease, stroke and the toxicity of HIV drugs. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x02019;s and Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia. Thus mitochondria appear to be central players in many diseases that can affect any organ, at any age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c2">2</xref>). Many different mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been found to be pathogenic in humans. Individuals with childhood mitochondrial diseases either inherit their mutation from the mother or experience a mutation during oogenesis or early in embryogenesis. Several general classes of mutations in mtDNA have been reported. These include point mutations, deletions, duplications, insertions and rearrangements. To date over 100 pathogenic point mutations and 200 deletions, insertions and rearrangements have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c5">5</xref>).</p><p>Mutation in mtDNA can be produced by many cellular processes, such as replication and repair errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c20">20</xref>), spontaneous depurination or deamination and by endogenous and environmental mutagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c6">6</xref>). Spontaneous deamination of cytosine in DNA results in the formation of uracil. Uracil in DNA may also arise by misincorporation of dUMP opposite adenine during DNA replication. If uracil is not repaired, it can lead to a GC&#x02192;AT transition mutation during replication. The <italic>UNG1</italic> gene encodes the major uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) that excises uracil from DNA. Bacterial, yeast and mouse cells deficient in Ung1 protein (Ung1p) exhibit increased levels of spontaneous mutation frequencies in the nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c10">10</xref>). Human cells contain two isoforms of UDG protein; one localizes to the nucleus and the other to the mitochondria. These isoforms are generated by transcription from different promoters and alternative splicing of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c11">11</xref>). Interestingly, mouse cells also contain a nuclear and mitochondrial isoform of the Udg protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c12">12</xref>). These studies indicate that Udg present in mitochondria must repair uracil in mtDNA. Although a Udg-deficient mouse has been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c10">10</xref>), to date it is not clear whether the Ung1p-deficient mouse accumulates mutations in mtDNA. Furthermore, a previous study showed that the <italic>ung1</italic> yeast null mutant shows a mutator phenotype in nuclear DNA but not in mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c9">9</xref>).</p><p>In this paper we demonstrate that Ung1p localizes to yeast mitochondria (and to the nucleus) and that inactivation of the <italic>UNG1</italic> gene leads to an increased frequency of mutations in mtDNA. We also describe the functional role of human Ung1p in yeast mitochondria. Our study also reveals that mutant hUng1p causes mutations in mtDNA when expressed in yeast mitochondria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, media and reagents</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study were wild-type MKP-0 (<italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>can1-100</italic>, <italic>ade2-1</italic>, <italic>lys2-1</italic>, <italic>ura3-52</italic>, <italic>leu2-3</italic>, <italic>112his3-</italic>&#x00394;<italic>200</italic>, <italic>trp1-</italic>&#x00394;<italic>901</italic>), its isogenic derivative <italic>ung1</italic> null mutant PY32 (<italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>can1-100</italic>, <italic>ade2-1</italic>, <italic>lys2-1</italic>, <italic>ura3-52</italic>, <italic>leu2-3</italic>, <italic>112his3-</italic>&#x00394;<italic>200</italic>, <italic>trp1-</italic>&#x00394;<italic>901</italic>, <italic>UNG1</italic>::<italic>URA3</italic>), YF250 (<italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>ura3-52</italic>, <italic>his</italic>&#x00394;<italic>200</italic>, <italic>leu2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>1</italic>, <italic>trp1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>63</italic>) and YPH500 (<italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>his3-</italic>&#x00394;<italic>200</italic>, <italic>leu2-</italic>&#x00394;<italic>1</italic>, <italic>ura3-52</italic>, <italic>trp1-</italic>&#x00394;<italic>63</italic>, <italic>lys2-801</italic>, <italic>ade2-100</italic>).

The antibiotic erythromycin or chloramphenicol selectively inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis. However, cells can acquire resistance to erythromycin or chloramphenicol due to a mutation in the 21S rRNA gene encoded by the mtDNA. This phenotype of eukaryotic cells has frequently been used to determine the frequency of mutations in the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c20">20</xref>). In their study Burgers and Klein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c9">9</xref>) measured the frequency of mutation in the mitochondrial 21S rRNA gene. We also used this method to measure the frequency of mutation in the 21S rRNA gene and found no difference between the wild-type and the <italic>ung1</italic> null mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke661f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>We recently described a colony color assay that proved to be useful in analyzing mtDNA mutations because it provides a target size of the entire mitochondrial genome rather than of the 21S rRNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c14">14</xref>). Using the colony color assay, we compared mutation frequencies between the wild type and a mutant lacking the <italic>UNG1</italic> gene. Results of this analysis revealed at least 3-fold more mitochondrial mutants in <italic>ung1</italic> when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke661f1">1</xref>B). We conclude that inactivation of the <italic>UNG1</italic> gene leads to increased frequency of mitochondrial mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Ung1p localizes to mitochondria</title><p>Yeast Ung1p contains an N-terminus which appears to contain the typical features of a mitochondrial localization signal (MLS). MitoProt II (http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;psort.nibb.ac.jp&#x0002f;index.html) analysis of 24 amino acids from N-terminal sequences revealed a net charge of &#x0002b;9, with six basic and no acidic residues, and predicted a cleavage site at position 21. We therefore tested whether yUng1p localizes to mitochondria. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke661f2">2</xref>A shows that when the entire <italic>UNG1</italic> coding sequence was expressed in-frame with GFP, yUng1p&#x02013;GFP localized to both the nucleus and the mitochondria (panel 2). However, deletion of 16 amino acids containing the putative MLS led to Ung1p being localized exclusively in the nucleus (panel 3). DAPI was used as a control to determine the nuclear and mitochondrial compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke661f2">2</xref>, panels 1&#x02013;3). When the DAPI and Ung1p&#x02013;GFP expression images were merged a nuclear localization of the yUng1p&#x02013;GFP fusion protein is clearly apparent. These results demonstrate that Ung1p indeed localizes to mitochondria (and to the nucleus).</p><p>Two alternative spliced forms of human UDG protein exist in human cells; one resides in the nucleus and the other in the mitochondria. We cloned the h<italic>UNG1</italic> cDNA sequence containing the MLS in-frame with GFP and analyzed the subcellular localization in yeast. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke661f2">2</xref>B demonstrates that hUng1 when expressed in yeast predominantly localizes to mitochondria (panel 2). However, when 16 amino acids containing the hUng1p MLS were removed, the fusion protein was located in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke661f2">2</xref>B, panel 3). We conclude that yUng1p is a mitochondrial (as well as nuclear) protein. Furthermore, hUng1p when expressed in yeast localizes to the mitochondria, suggesting that the hUng1p MLS functions well in transport of the protein into yeast mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>ung1</italic> gene defect is suppressed by expression of yeast and human Ung1p</title><p>Analysis of DNA repair in the nucleus has revealed that the function of both yeast and human Ung1p protein is conserved. We therefore investigated whether Ung1p when expressed in yeast protects cells from the <italic>ung1</italic> mitochondrial phenotype. We cloned the h<italic>UNG1</italic> cDNA (encoding the MLS) under the control of a constitutively expressed ADH promoter. As a control, yeast cDNA was also cloned under the ADH promoter. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke661f3">3</xref> shows that expression of the h<italic>UNG1</italic> gene in yeast suppresses the <italic>ung1</italic> gene defect in mitochondria. The <italic>ung1</italic> null mutant and the null mutant containing the vector alone showed high frequencies of mitochondrial mutants. Interestingly, expression of either yeast or human Ung1p reduced the frequency of mitochondrial mutants to the wild-type level.</p></sec><sec><title>Constitutive expression of the yeast <italic>UNG1</italic> gene is mutagenic</title><p>We previously demonstrated that expression of the Ogg1 protein in wild-type yeast cells reduced the frequency of spontaneously arising mutations in mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c14">14</xref>). These studies indicated that Ogg1p expression was a limiting factor in the mitochondria and that 8-oxoguanine was a major contributor to mutation in mtDNA. To test whether Ung1p expression was a limiting factor and that deamination of cytosine plays a significant role in spontaneous mtDNA mutagenesis in wild-type cells, we transformed wild-type cells with a plasmid containing the y<italic>UNG1</italic> gene cloned under the control of the ADH promoter. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke661f4">4</xref> demonstrates that cells expressing the y<italic>UNG1</italic> gene constitutively induce a higher frequency of mitochondrial mutants than the vector alone control. We conclude that constitutive expression of y<italic>UNG1</italic> is mutagenic in mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutant h<italic>UNG1</italic> gene expression increases the frequency of mutations in mtDNA</title><p>Mutational analysis of hUng1p protein revealed that replacement of Asn204 by Asp or Tyr147 by Ala, Cys or Ser results in enzymes that have cytosine-DNA (CDG) and thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c13">13</xref>). Expression of CDG and TDG in <italic>E.coli</italic> caused 4&#x02013;100-fold increases in the frequency of rifampicin-resistant mutants. These results indicated that single amino acid substitutions in UDG confer a mutator phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c13">13</xref>). We sought to test the effect of hUng1p mutants in yeast mitochondria. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke661f5">5</xref> shows that expression of hUng1p mutants Y147C and Y147S in mitochondria leads to elevated levels of mitochondrial mutants compared to wild-type hUng1p or vector alone. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke661f5">5</xref> also indicates that expression of hUng1p mutants N204D and Y147A did not increase the frequency of mtDNA mutations. These results suggest that replacement of Tyr147 by Cys or Ser in hUng1p is mutagenic in mitochondria.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Mutation of mtDNA is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c5">5</xref>). Improvements in understanding the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms largely depend on perspective genetic models and molecular approaches. One such model is the yeast <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, whose entire genome has been sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c21">21</xref>). We are using <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> as a genetic model to identify proteins that repair DNA in mitochondria. The sequence of UDG is well conserved between bacteria, yeast, human and other eurkaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c10">10</xref>). A previous study to identify the role of Ung1p in yeast concluded that <italic>UNG1</italic> inactivation does not lead to a mitochondrial mutator phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c9">9</xref>). Using the colony color assay, our analysis revealed significant differences in the frequency of mitochondrial mutants between the wild-type and <italic>ung1</italic> mutant. The colony color assay is more sensitive than the antibiotic resistance assay used in the previous study, resulting in the detection of more mitochondrial mutants in the <italic>ung1</italic> null mutant. It is important to note that a change in colony color may arise due to random mutation (point mutation, insertion, deletion or loss of the entire mitochondrial genome) in the mitochondrial genome that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. In comparison, resistance to antibiotics arises due to specific point mutations in two particular genes, <italic>rib2</italic> and <italic>rib3</italic>, both encoded by the mitochondrial genome. In addition, the target size for a mutation resulting in antibiotic resistance (&#x0223c;4 kb) is very small compared to the mitochondrial genome (&#x0223c;85 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c14">14</xref>). We performed mutational analysis of several petite mutants arising due to <italic>UNG1</italic> deficiency. Our results demonstrate that <italic>UNG1</italic> deficiency does not lead to deletions in the mtDNA molecule or to complete loss of the mitochondrial genome (data not shown). Since the colony color assay also measures mitochondrial dysfunction arising due to point mutations, it is plausible that a point mutation in any of the multiple transcriptional control sites may render the cell deficient in mitochondrial function. It is also conceivable that a GC&#x02192;AT conversion in the mitochondrial genome results in a dominant mutation. Indeed, dominant mutations in the mitochondrial genome have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c23">23</xref>). However, further study is required to identify the exact nature of the mutation in the mitochondrial genome of the <italic>ung1</italic> mutant.</p><p>The studies described in this paper clearly establish an <italic>in vivo</italic> function of yeast and human Ung1p proteins in mitochondria. Using yUng1p&#x02013;GFP we have shown that full-length yeast Ung1p localizes to both the mitochondria and the nuclear compartment. Deletion analysis of the N-terminus revealed that the first 16 amino acids are important for mitochondrial import of Ung1p because this deletion abolished mitochondrial localization. Interestingly, deleted yUng1p was transported to the nucleus. Deleted Ung1p retained the nuclear localization signal (NLS) (located at amino acids 17&#x02013;20 and 38&#x02013;44) that is likely responsible for its nuclear transport. Strikingly, similar results were obtained with yOgg1p protein that lacked the MLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c14">14</xref>). Our results suggest that hUng1p primarily localizes in yeast mitochondria. These results are consistent with a previous report demonstrating preferential localization of hUng1p into human cell mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c24">24</xref>). The MLS in hUng1p is located within 28 amino acids of the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c24">24</xref>). When these 28 amino acids of hUng1p were deleted it reduced mitochondrial translocation but did not completely abolish it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c24">24</xref>). Consistently, removal of the N-terminal 16 amino acids from hUng1p led to a decreased level of hUng1p in yeast mitochondria. Since truncated hUngp1p contained the NLS (located at amino acids 17&#x02013;20 and 48&#x02013;51) it was localized to the nucleus. In spite of the similarities, differences clearly exist between the mechanisms for mitochondrial localization of the human and yeast Ung1p. The mitochondrial and nuclear isoforms of hUng1p are encoded by the same gene but differ in their N-terminal sequences because of alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c24">24</xref>). In contrast, our study suggests that <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> contains a single isoform of Ung1p that contains both a NLS and a MLS. Our study of localization of hUng1p in yeast mitochondria by its own MLS provides evidence that yeast can be used as a model for functional and genetic analyses of human DNA repair mechanisms in mitochondria. Our analysis also shows that expression of either the yeast or human <italic>UNG1</italic> gene rescues <italic>ung1</italic> cells from the mitochondrial mutator phenotype, confirming that yeast should aid in analysis of <italic>UNG1</italic> gene polymorphisms in mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c25">25</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis revealed that an elevated level of yUng1p in wild-type cells causes a mitochondrial mutator phenotype. This is likely due to an imbalance in the base excision repair pathway, as described for nuclear DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c26">26</xref>). Interestingly, expression of wild-type hUng1p does not lead to a mutator phenotype in yeast mitochondria. Both Ung1 proteins are capable of undergoing post-translational modifications. It is conceivable that yeast proteins that modify yUng1p are incapable of modifying hUng1p. Differences in levels of post-translational modification may also contribute to differences in the mutator phenotype. For example yUng1p contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site (<sub>317</sub>KMINDWLY<sub>324</sub>) but hUng1p does not (see expasy.ch&#x0002f;cgi-bin&#x0002f;scanprosite.scanprosite?1). Additionally, yUng1p contains seven potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, whereas hUng1p contains only four.</p><p>Uracil binds in a pocket at the base of the DNA-binding groove of hUng1p and the specificity for uracil over structurally related DNA bases is conferred by shape complemetarity as well as by main chain and Asn204 side chain hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c13">13</xref>). Asn204 is critical for substrate binding and Tyr147 lines the active site uracil-binding pocket and contributes to shape complementarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c13">13</xref>). Replacement of Asn204 by Asp or Tyr147 by Ala, Cys or Ser results in enzymes that have CDG and TDG activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke661c13">13</xref>). Expression of CDG or TDG in <italic>E.coli</italic> causes an increase in rifampicin-resistant mutants. Our study demonstrates that expression of a site-directed Tyr147 but not Asp204 catalytic hUng1p mutant leads to a mutator phenotype in yeast mitochondria. The Asp204 mutation converts hUng1p to CDG, excising cytosine from DNA. The yeast mtDNA is rich in T and extremely poor in C. Therefore, TDG activity is likely to play a significant role in yeast mtDNA mutagenesis. Studies are underway to identify the mechanisms of mtDNA mutagenesis by mutant hUng1 proteins in human cells.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke661f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Spontaneous mutation frequency in an <italic>ung1</italic> null mutant (erythromycin method).
