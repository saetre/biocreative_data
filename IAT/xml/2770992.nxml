Mutations in the genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a key Krebs cycle component, are associated with hereditary predisposition to pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, through mechanisms which are largely unknown. Recently, the jumonji-domain histone demethylases have emerged as a novel family of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent chromatin modifiers with credible functions in tumourigenesis. Using pharmacological and siRNA methodologies we show that increased methylation of histone H3 is a general consequence of SDH loss-of-function in cultured mammalian cells and can be reversed by overexpression of the JMJD3 histone demethylase. ChIP analysis revealed that the core promoter of <italic>IGFBP7</italic>, which encodes a secreted protein upregulated after loss of <italic>SDHB</italic>, showed decreased occupancy by H3K27me3 in the absence of <italic>SDH</italic>. Finally, we provide the first evidence that the chief (type I) cell is the major methylated histone-immunoreactive constituent of paraganglioma. These results support the notion that loss of mitochondrial function alters epigenetic processes and might provide a signature methylation mark for paraganglioma.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Forming part of complex II of the respiratory chain, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is situated at the intersection of the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. This combination of functions places SDH at the centre of two essential energy-producing metabolic processes of the cell. Recently, SDH genes have been considered as tumour suppressors since germ line inactivating mutations in the <italic>SDHB, C </italic>and <italic>D </italic>subunit genes can predispose individuals to hereditary paraganglioma (HPGL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and phaeochromocytoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. HPGL tumours can be found in the carotid body, a chemoreceptor organ consisting of several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The most predominant cell type in the carotid body is the chief (type I) cell; these cells, of neural crest origin, are arranged in rounded cell nests. The second prominent cell type is the type II glial-like (sustentacular) cell, which surrounds the nest of chief cells. Together, these cells form the striking cell ball of the paraganglion, traditionally referred to as "zellballen" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although the mechanism(s) linking SDH deficiency to tumour formation remain poorly understood, an activation of the hypoxia pathway is frequently associated with SDH loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This results in the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;), a broad-range transcription factor which coordinates cellular adaption to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We recently showed that HIF-1&#x003b1; stabilization occurs after chronic silencing of the <italic>SDHB </italic>gene in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and previous studies have demonstrated that increased cellular succinate, following <italic>SDHD </italic>silencing, inhibits the activity of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent prolyl hydroxylases, master regulators of HIF-1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Increasing intracellular succinate could, however, also inhibit other 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes, such as the recently identified histone demethylase family of chromatin modifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The human genome contains ~30 potential histone demethylases, which are defined by the catalytic jumonji (JmjC) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These JmjC histone demethylases (JHDMs) catalyse the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxidation of methyl groups in the side chains of the basic amino acids lysine and arginine of histones H3 and H4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Methylation influences both gene activation and repression, and the effect on chromatin structure depends on the degree of methylation and the specific lysine involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Histone demethylases are increasingly recognised as playing important roles in many biological processes including development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and constitute a level of epigenetic control over and above normal transcriptional processes. In this present study we determined whether histone modification was perturbed under conditions of SDH inactivation.</p><p>Cultured cells were exposed to pharmacological suppression of SDH activity with 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA). Using Western blot analysis with methylation-state-specific antibodies, we determined the steady-state levels of histone 3 methylated on residues K9, K27, and K36. Addition of TTFA resulted in a reproducible increase in global histone 3 methylation in Hep3B and HT1080 human cell lines and also in rat PC12 phaeochromocytoma cells, although the lysine affected and the degree of increase was cell line-dependent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We next silenced expression of the endogenous <italic>SDHD </italic>gene in cultured cells. Transient silencing of <italic>SDHD </italic>in HEK293 cells resulted in a significant reduction of <italic>SDHD </italic>mRNA in whole cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). At the same time, analysis of nuclear histones revealed an increase in steady-state levels of both H3K27me3 and H3K36me2 upon <italic>SDHD </italic>silencing, with H3K36me2 presenting the greatest increase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). To further validate this response we silenced a second SDH gene, <italic>SDHB</italic>. Transient silencing of <italic>SDHB </italic>in Hep3B cells resulted in a robust reduction of SDHB protein as measured by Western blot, and analysis of nuclear histones showed increased steady-state levels of both H3K27me3 and H3K36me2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Similar results were obtained after transient silencing of <italic>SDHB </italic>in the HEK293 cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), confirming the generality of this response. Moreover, analysis of cells in which <italic>SDHB </italic>was chronically silenced by integrated siRNA (cell lines D11 and D20) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] revealed a consistent increase in methylated histone residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Given that histone methylation is a dynamic phenomenon, we wanted to ensure that the SDH-dependent methylation could be reversed by increasing demethylase activity. We therefore forced overexpression of the H3K27me3-specific Jmjd3 histone demethylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] in cells. Transfection of an HA-tagged C-terminal region of Jmjd3, containing the JmjC domain, but not a mutated (non-active) C-terminal region was sufficient to downregulate H3K27me3 levels in Hep3B cells, as shown by double staining with an anti-HA antibody and the methylation-specific anti-H3K27me3 antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Consistently, when overexpressed in the D11 (<italic>SDHB</italic>-deficient) cell line, wild-type but not mutated Jmjd3 downregulated H3K27me3 levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Together, these data strongly suggest that SDH gene inactivation leads to a reversible dysregulation of chromatin remodelling by increasing the global level of histone H3 methylation.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Pharmacological SDH inhibition increases histone methylation</bold>.

As the full set of genes potentially regulated by this process is unknown, we chose three candidate genes, <italic>SNCA</italic>, <italic>PTGER </italic>and <italic>KRT17</italic>, whose core promoter regions are occupied by H3K27me3, and which have recently been shown to define an epigenetic signature of metastatic prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Additionaly, we examined binding at the gene promoter of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (<italic>IGFBP7</italic>), a tumour-related soluble factor whose transcript was highly upregulated in our microarray analysis of <italic>SDHB</italic>-deficient cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and which has been shown to be under epigenetic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out with anti-H3K27me3 or IgG control antibody on lysates from control pU6 or <italic>SDHB</italic>-silenced D11 cells. Consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], subsequent PCR analysis detected H3K27me3 occupancy of the promoters of <italic>SNCA</italic>, <italic>PTGER </italic>and <italic>KRT17</italic>; however, there were no apparent differences between control pU6 and the <italic>SDHB</italic>-deficient D11 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In contrast, H3K27me3 occupancy of the <italic>IGFPB7 </italic>promoter was reduced in D11 compared with pU6 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). This was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, giving a fold difference in site occupancy of 0.625 &#x000b1; 0.025 (n = 3). Decreased occupancy would equate to increased transcriptional expression, consistent with our previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and provides a positive control for future analysis.</p><p>Tumours of the carotid body and other paraganglia often retain the general histological pattern of normal paraganglia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). We selected five carotid body paragangliomas and assessed the expression and expected staining pattern of S100, a marker for sustentacular cells and of tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for chief cells. All tumours tested showed the expected positive (brown) staining pattern (exemplified in a sporadic tumour, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The tumours were then assessed for histone 3 lysine methylation. As shown in a sporadic paraganglioma tumour, the chief cell fraction showed strong nuclear staining for H3K27me3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, black arrow). Notably, sustentacular cells (red arrow) showed no nuclear or cytoplasmic staining. A striking feature of H3K27me3 staining in chief cells was its heterogeneity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, black arrow). In contrast, the staining pattern for H3K36me2 was more homogeneous: chief cells showed predominantly nuclear staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>, black arrow) with occasional cytoplasmic staining, while sustentacular cells showed no nuclear staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>, red arrow) and only light, possibly background, staining of the cytoplasm. The staining patterns of both antibodies highlight the "zellball" structure of the tissue. It should be noted that all tumours tested (three sporadic paragangliomas and two <italic>SDHD </italic>tumours) showed similar patterns of staining (not shown). The differential staining of chief cell nuclei would suggest that these cells represent the transcriptionally active component of the paraganglioma. The heterogeneous staining pattern for H3K27me3 in the chief cells is reminiscent of the ultrastructural studies of Grimely and Glenner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], in which they describe "light" and "dark" chief cells. No specific function has ever been attributed to these two forms, and they may indeed simply be transitory forms of the same cell.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Immunohistochemical staining for methylated histones in a sporadic carotid body paraganglioma</bold>.

This specific staining pattern again highlights the zellballen structures. In all cases a sporadic tumour is illustrated, chosen for clarity. SDHD tumours show similar patterns of staining.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-8-89-4"/></fig><p>In the present study we have shown that metabolic perturbations within the mitochondrial SDH complex result in a reversible dysregulation of post-translational histone methylation, leading to increased steady-state levels of methylated lysine on histone H3. Product inhibition of the demethylation reaction with succinate is the most likely cause of this dysregulation. The above scenario would predict a non-discriminatory decrease in total cellular demethylase activity following SDH inhibition, orchestrated perhaps by different succinate Ki values for individual demethylases. It is evident that further studies would benefit from genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-on-chip) to survey the underlying chromatin environment associated with SDH dysfunction. As an overture to this analysis, we used ChIP to measure H3K27me3 occupancy at four independent loci, detecting reduced occupancy at the <italic>IGFBP7 </italic>promoter in <italic>SDHB</italic>-deficient cells. Interestingly, recent studies have described the co-existence of H3K4 and H3K27 methylation marks, a so-called bivalent domain, on a subset of developmentally regulated loci in embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This difference in occupancy between methylated H3K4 and H3K27 could therefore direct increased or decreased transcriptional expression, and provides a plausible explanation for our observations. Of note this study highlights the type I chief cell as the principal immunoreactive cell type for both H3K27me3 and H3K36me2 in the carotid body tumours tested. It would be interesting to see whether all SDH-related tumours show similar staining patterns. Chief cells are the master chemosensory cells of the carotid body and are physiologically complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Conversely, type II cells lack most of these actions and are generally thought to provide a supporting role to chief cells. Consistent with this notion, multiparameter DNA flow cytometry analysis of <italic>SDHD</italic>-related tumours indicates that chief cells are the neoplastic component of paragangliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]: utilizing S-100 labelling as a selective marker for the sustentacular fraction, this study showed that S-100-labelled cells are diploid, and show retention of the wild-type allele, while loss of the wild-type allele was seen in the S-100-negative fraction. Therefore type II cells can be seen as a non-neoplastic cell population induced as a tumour-specific stromal component of the chief cells.</p><p>In summary our initial results demonstrate an epigenetic operation linked to SDH inhibition in mammalian cells, and could provide a paradigm for the investigation of epigenetic processes that may contribute to tumour predisposition in neuroendocrine neoplasia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Culture media, fetal bovine serum, and Lipofectamine&#x02122; 2000 were from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA).

The S100 antibody (Z0311, DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) was used o/n diluted 1:100 in PBS/1% BSA, followed by anti-rabbit HRP (P0217, Dako) for 30 min. An antibody against tri-methylated histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3: ab6002, Abcam) was used o/n diluted 1:50 in PBS/1% BSA, followed by anti-mouse HRP secondary antibody (P0260, Dako) for 30 min. Anti-H3K36me2 antibody (Q16695, Millipore, Amsterdam, Netherlands) was used o/n diluted 1:100 in PBS/1% BSA, followed by anti-rabbit HRP (P0217, Dako) for 30 min. The chromogenic substrate for all secondary antibodies was DAB (K3465, Dako). Sections were further processed by standard techniques.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AC and KJM conceived and planned the study with help from J-PB and PD.
