However, the factors driving recombination or promoting the selection of recombinants are still unclear. Here, we show that the small movement protein (2b) was able to promote selection of RNA 1/2&#x02013;RNA 3 recombinants within a chimeric virus having RNAs 1 and 2 from <italic>cucumber mosaic virus</italic>, and RNA 3 from the related <italic>tomato aspermy virus</italic>, along with heterologous 2b genes. The source of the 2b also determined the selection of the acceptor RNA and the crossover site, as well as affecting the rate of selection of the recombinant RNAs. The nature of the RNA 3 also influenced the selection of the recombinant RNAs. A 163-nt tandem repeat in RNA 3 significantly affected the rate of selection of the recombinant RNA, while a single nucleotide within the repeat affected the crossover site. The recombination occurred in a non-random manner, involved no intermediates and probably was generated via a copy-choice mechanism during (+) strand RNA synthesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA&#x02013;RNA recombination is one of the most important pathways in virus evolution. It was first discovered in the early 1960s in poliovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and has been documented in various genera of animal viruses, plant viruses and bacterial viruses group. Studies conducted on viruses during the last 40 years indicated that RNA&#x02013;RNA recombination could occur between RNAs of the same or different strains of one species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), of different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) or between viral and host cellular RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). RNA hairpins or mutations in a replicase domain have been implicated to play an important role in promoting RNA&#x02013;RNA recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>). While none of those studies demonstrated a role for non-replicase proteins in viral RNA&#x02013;RNA recombination or selection of recombinants, recombination without replication has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>RNA recombination has been studied extensively in the plant virus genus <italic>Cucumovirus</italic>. Those studies have involved two of the three recognized viral species in this genus, <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> (CMV) and <italic>Tomato aspermy virus</italic> (TAV). These viruses both contain a single-stranded and positive-sense RNA genome divided into three species designated RNAs 1, 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). RNA 1 encodes the 1a protein involved in virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). RNA 2 encodes two proteins: the 2a, also involved in virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and the 2b protein, involved in virus movement and the suppression of RNA silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21">18&#x02013;21</xref>). RNA 3 also encodes two proteins, the 3a movement protein and the capsid protein, both of which are also involved in virus movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>). Protein 2b is translated from a subgenomic RNA of RNA 2, RNA 4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), while the capsid protein is translated from a subgenomic RNA of RNA 3, RNA 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The 3&#x02032; terminal 305&#x02013;310-nt non-translated region (NTR) is nearly identical in each of the three genomic RNAs of each virus and represents promoters for (&#x02212;) viral RNA synthesis during viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The location of most of the recombinants described involving CMV and TAV is within these 3&#x02032; NTR sequences.</p><p>RNA&#x02013;RNA recombination was first described in cucumoviruses isolated from tobacco plants after multiple passage of a pseudorecombinant (reassortant) virus containing RNAs 1 and 2 from CMV, and RNA 3 from TAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The progeny RNA 3 consisted mostly of TAV RNA 3 but with the 3&#x02032; terminal sequence from CMV RNA 2. In addition, in an earlier passage, there was an intermediate RNA 3 present containing a duplicated 21-nt sequence at the crossover site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Subsequently, several other cucumoviral recombinant RNAs were also discovered in plants infected with a so-called quadripartite hybrid virus having RNAs 2 and 3 from CMV, and RNAs 1 and 2 from TAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), with a mixture of wild-type (wt) CMV and wt TAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), with mixed CMV isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36">34&#x02013;36</xref>), or within a single wt CMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). These characterized recombinant RNAs had non-template-derived nucleotides at the crossover site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and had CMV sequences at one end of the crossover site and TAV sequence at the other end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) or had the same 3&#x02032;-terminal NTR sequence for all three genomic RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Some of the recombinants had crossover sites localized within a short region of high sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Others were predicted to occur in regions of high secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). TAV RNA 3 itself has a direct repeat of 163 nt (differing by one nucleotide) in the 3&#x02032; NTR, which is not essential for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and in some cases, was deleted during long-term incubation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). While some of the above studies examined recombinants formed in the directly inoculated leaves and thus avoided detecting only those replicable recombinants that might be selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), other studies examined those recombinants detected after slow selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and found that some recombinants could co-exist in the same plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). However, what factors may have led to the selection of particular recombinants has not previously been examined.</p><p>Here we show that infection and passage of a chimeric virus having RNAs 1 and 2 from CMV, with RNA 3 and the 2b gene from TAV consistently resulted in the slow selection of recombinant viruses. We demonstrate that the 2b gene plays a key role in promoting this selection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Plasmid cDNA clones, with transcription <italic>in planta</italic> controlled by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and terminator, were used for plant inoculation.

However, the effects of the various viral genes on the selection of these recombinant viruses have not been examined. Previously, using interspecies hybrid viruses, we examined the roles of different 2b genes on virulence and virus accumulation and showed that while the nature of the 2b gene influenced virulence, the RNA 3 (and therefore the two genes encoded by RNA 3; the 3a movement protein and the capsid protein) did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Therefore, the hybrid viruses generated previously, C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>C3 and C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3, where C indicates Q-CMV, T indicates TAV, 1, 2 and 3 indicate RNAs 1, 2 and 3, and the subscript T2B indicates that the 2b gene of Q-CMV was replaced precisely with that of TAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), were subjected to long-term, multiple passages in <italic>N. glutinosa</italic> to determine whether the 2b gene had any effect on the selection of recombinant viruses. The progeny viral RNAs were examined by northern blot hybridization, with probes specific to the 3&#x02032; terminal NTR sequences of either the three Q-CMV RNAs or the three TAV RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This analysis indicated that in the multiple passage plants TAV RNA 3 derived from C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3 had recombined with CMV RNA, as the progeny RNA 3 was detected by both the Q-CMV-specific and TAV-specific probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B, compare lanes 9 and 20). By contrast, RNA 3 derived from the same virus maintained for several weeks in the plasmid-inoculated plants was not a recombinant RNA, as it was only detected by the TAV-specific probe, but not by the Q-CMV-specific probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B, compare lanes 5 and 16). The specificity of the CMV-specific and TAV-specific probes was demonstrated in that both probes only detected their own specific viral RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B, compare lanes 2 and 3, and lanes 13 and 14). The other RNAs of C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3 were still detected by their specific probes in both the inoculated plants and the multiple passage plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Northern hybridization of accumulated viral RNAs in <italic>N. glutinosa</italic>.

Only the primer pair C3&#x02032;/T3-1187 was able to generate a specific RT-PCR product (data not shown). T3-1187 corresponded to sequences ending with nucleotide position 1187 of TAV RNA 3, while C3&#x02032; was complementary to the 3&#x02032;-terminal sequence of Q-CMV.

The 3&#x02032; terminal 310 nt of the recombinant RNA 3 was not only the same as the 310 terminal nucleotides of Q-CMV RNA 1, but was also the same length as Q-CMV RNA 5. Q-CMV RNA 5 is a mixture of subgenomic RNAs derived from the 3&#x02032; terminal NTR of RNAs 1, 2 and 3 [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>); our unpublished data].

These recombinant RNAs were not detected by northern blot hybridization in the inoculated parental plants, even if the plasmid-inoculum was increased 5-fold (50 &#x003bc;g/10 &#x003bc;l) or decreased 20-fold (0.5 &#x003bc;g/10 &#x003bc;l), although the same recombinant RNAs were detected again in the multiple passage plants, when the initial inoculum concentration was changed (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The 2b gene determines the source of the recombinant 3&#x02032; terminus and crossover site</title><p>The observation that recombinant RNAs were detected when the 2b gene of Q-CMV was substituted by that of TAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 9), and not when the 2b gene of Q-CMV was present in the interspecific hybrid virus C1C2T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 11) suggested that the 2b gene has some role in the generation and/or selection of the recombinant viruses. However, as the replacement of the 2b sequence also changed the sequences encoding the C-terminal 41 amino acids of the 2a protein, it cannot be ruled out that the C-terminal 41 amino acids of the 2a protein might play a role in the recombination and/or selection. Therefore, to determine whether the C-terminal 41 amino acids of the 2a protein encoded by the overlapping TAV 2a gene sequence had such a role, we introduced a stop codon upstream of the TAV 2b gene in C2<sub>T2B</sub> to prevent the expression of the C-terminal 41 amino acids of the 2a protein (see C2<sub>T2B</sub><italic><sub>C2a</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Moreover, the recombinant RNA 3 generated was the same as that derived from C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3 (data not shown). Therefore, the C-terminal 41 amino acids of the 2a protein encoded by the TAV 2b sequence had no role in the recombination and/or selection, indicating that the TAV 2b gene was required for the recombination and/or selection.</p><p>That the 2b protein rather than the 2b RNA sequence itself affected the generation and/or selection of recombinant RNA 3s could not be established conclusively, since expression of the 2b gene was shown to be necessary for the cell-to-cell movement, but not the replication of the pseudorecombinant virus C1C2T3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, if the 2b protein was actually involved in the recombination/selection process, then at a minimum the 2b protein should be capable of binding viral RNA. To determine whether there was some interaction between TAV RNA 3 and the 2b protein, we performed an RNA&#x02013;protein-binding assay.</p><p>The TAV 2b protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 3) purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) was able to bind to the T7-transcribed (+) sense TAV RNA 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, lanes 2&#x02013;4) as well as to the T3-transcribed (&#x02212;) sense TAV RNA 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, lane 3). The binding ability increased with an increasing amount of the 2b protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, compare lanes 1&#x02013;4). By contrast, comparable amounts of GST alone, which was expressed and purified under the same conditions as the TAV 2b protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 2), did not bind to TAV RNA 3 (data not shown). This demonstrated that RNA-binding activity was not due to a co-purified, contaminating protein from <italic>E. coli</italic>. The significance of the more efficient binding of the 2b protein to (+) versus (&#x02212;) sense RNA is unknown. The different binding abilities probably are due to different sequences and/or structures between RNA 3(+) and RNA 3(&#x02212;). Since the 2b protein was designated a movement protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and was shown to be required for the movement of pseudorecombinant viruses containing C1C2T3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), the 2b protein probably also binds to TAV RNA 3 <italic>in vivo</italic>. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>TAV 2b protein expression, purification and RNA 3 binding.

To this end, we replaced the whole 2b gene of (the subgroup II strain) Q-CMV with that from a subgroup IA strain of CMV, WAII-CMV, generating the hybrid virus C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 (see C2<sub>W2B</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The WAII-CMV 2b gene and the Q-CMV 2b gene are only 53.4% identical at nucleotide level and the WAII-2b protein is 10 amino acids longer than the Q-2b protein.</p><p>Co-inoculation of C2<sub>W2B</sub>, C1 and T3 onto <italic>N. glutinosa</italic> plants followed by multiple passages at 1&#x02013;2 weekly intervals showed that C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 induced symptoms as severe as those induced by C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3, which were much more severe than those induced by either of the parental viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Northern blot hybridization showed that RNA 3 derived from C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 also had recombined with a CMV sequence in the passage plants, but not in the inoculated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C and D, compare lanes 27 and 34, and lanes 29 and 36). This was supported by RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). These data strongly indicate that the 2b protein was required for recombination and/or selection or the recombinant RNA 3s, and that this process was not TAV 2b protein-specific.</p><p>To determine the nature of the recombinant RNAs derived from C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3, the recombinant RNA 3 was subjected to RT-PCR, cloning and sequence analysis. Surprisingly, the RNA 3 recombinants derived from C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 differed from those derived from C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3 or C1C2<sub>T2B</sub><italic><sub>C2a</sub></italic>T3 in the following respects: First, the recombinant RNA 3 derived from C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 was 22 nt longer than that derived from C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3 or C1C2<sub>T2B</sub><italic><sub>C2a</sub></italic>T3 (2392 versus 2370). Second, the 3&#x02032; terminal NTR of the recombinant RNA 3 derived from C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 contained a Q-CMV RNA 2 NTR sequence, rather than the Q-CMV RNA 1 NTR sequence (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A right and B right). Third, the crossover sites on RNA 2 and on RNA 3 were different in the recombinant RNA 3 derived from C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 versus either C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3 or C1C2<sub>T2B</sub><italic><sub>C2a</sub></italic>T3 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). And fourth, the recombinant RNA 3 derived from C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 contained an imperfect repeat of 19 nt near the crossover site preceded by an A between the TAV RNA 3 sequence and the 3&#x02032; CMV RNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Moreover, the recombinant RNA 3 derived from C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 also was missing the second 163-nt repeat. These similarities on one hand and differences on the other suggested that the recombinant RNA 3s derived from C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3 and C1C2<sub>T2B</sub><italic><sub>C2a</sub></italic>T3 versus C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 might be generated using different templates, but occurred via a similar mechanism. Taken together, the above results indicate that the 2b protein determined either the RNA species participating in the recombination and the crossover site, or selected for particular recombinant RNAs generated at random that have the above characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>The 2b protein and a 163-nt tandem repeat on RNA 3 both affect the rate of recombinant selection while a single nucleotide within the repeat determines the crossover site on RNA 3</title><p>Both the TAV 2b protein and WAII-CMV 2b protein were able to promote the recombination and/or selection of RNA 3 in the passage plants, but not in the inoculated plants. To determine when the recombinant RNA 3s could first be detected, a time-course experiment was done involving three viruses: C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3, C1C2<sub>T2B</sub><italic><sub>C2a</sub></italic>T3 and C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3. The appropriate plasmid combinations were inoculated onto 10 <italic>N. glutinosa</italic> plants and sap was then passaged onto healthy <italic>N. glutinosa</italic> plants for 10 passages, at 6-day intervals. The inoculated leaves of the passage plants were detached 3 days after inoculation, total RNAs were extracted and the RNAs were analysed by northern blot hybridization. These analyses showed that the recombinant RNAs were only detected from the fourth passage and onwards in plants infected with C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3 or C1C2<sub>T2B</sub><italic><sub>C2a</sub></italic>T3, or from the sixth passage and onwards in plants infected with C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 (Supplementary Figure 1A, data not shown). These results indicated that selection of the recombinant RNA 3s is a slow process and therefore it seems more likely that the 2b proteins were selecting for specific recombinants, rather than being involved in the generation of the recombinant RNA 3s. This is also consistent with the different subcellular localization of the replication proteins and the 2b protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49 B50 B51">49&#x02013;51</xref>) and the lack of detectable interaction of the replicase proteins with the 2b protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). In addition, virus containing the TAV 2b protein showed selection of the recombinant RNA 3s two passages earlier than did virus containing the WAII-CMV 2b protein. Therefore, it seems likely that the source of the 2b protein also affected the rate of selection.</p><p>To examine the role of the two 163-nt repeats in the recombination and/or selection, we deleted each repeat independently in C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3. The resultant deletion mutants were designated C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(A)</sub> and C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(G)</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), where the subscripts &#x00394;163(A) and &#x00394;163(G) represent the first 163-nt repeat deletion and the second 163-nt repeat deletion, respectively.

Northern blot hybridization analysis showed that neither deletion affected the presence of recombinant RNA 3s in the multiple passage plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 8 and 19, data not shown). However, both deletion mutants yielded recombinant RNA 3s in both the inoculated plants and the passage plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B, compare lanes 4 and 15, and lanes 8 and 19, data not shown). Repeated inoculation and northern blot hybridization analysis gave the same results as earlier.

The sequences of the recombinant RNA 3 derived from C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(A)</sub> contained the 5&#x02032;-proximal 2082 nt from TAV RNA 3 and the 3&#x02032; proximal 310-nt 3&#x02032; NTR of CMV RNA 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The CMV RNA 1 NTR sequence was identical to that present in the recombinant RNA 3 derived from C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3.

All of the RT-PCR products derived from C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(G)</sub> also were exactly the same in sequence, having 878 nt from TAV RNA 3 and 326 nt from CMV RNA 2 including the 19-nt repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D; data not shown). The sequence of the RT-PCR products also were the same as those from the passage plants, or those derived from C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3 in both the inoculated plants and passage plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B; data not shown). These results indicate that the recombinant RNA 3s accumulating in the infected plants did not contain a detectable intermediate, and that the crossover sites on both donor and acceptor RNAs occurred at the same position.</p></sec><sec><title>The conserved 23-nt sequence and the 3&#x02032; NTR of RNA 3 are critical for infection</title><p>The conserved 23-nt sequence at the beginning of the 3&#x02032; NTR has been implicated in the recombination and nucleotides 1&#x02013;20 of the 23-nt sequence also have been suggested to be an internal subgenomic promoter site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). This sequence also was always near the crossover sites in the recombinant RNA 3s observed here, and the 19-nt imperfect repeat also comes from this sequence. Therefore, we examined the requirement for this sequence in infection. Three deletion mutants were constructed: C1<sub>&#x00394;23</sub>, C2<sub>T2B&#x00394;23</sub> and T3<sub>&#x00394;163(A)&#x00394;23</sub>, where the conserved 23-nt sequence was deleted from each of C1, C2<sub>T2B</sub> and T3<sub>&#x00394;163(A)</sub>, respectively.

Correspondingly, the TAV RNA 3 sequence in the same recombinant RNA 3s lacked the second 163-nt repeat and the rest of the 3&#x02032; NTR (which together corresponds to the TAV RNA 5 sequence). To determine whether CMV RNA 5 itself or the 3&#x02032; NTR of CMV RNAs 1 and/or 2 could be used as a template for the synthesis of the recombinant RNA 3, we prepared the appropriate templates that would be expressed transiently in inoculated plants and assessed these for the presence of recombinant virus. In the templates, we deleted 326 nt from the 3&#x02032; NTR of T3 to make T3<sub>1&#x02013;2060</sub>, and deleted the first 163-nt repeat plus 141 nt from the 3&#x02032; NTR of T3 to make T3<sub>&#x00394;163(A)&#x00394;141</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These two deletions had the same length of the TAV RNA 3 sequence as in the recombinant RNAs. In addition, we also made four RNA 5-like cDNA clones, C1<sub>3081&#x02013;3390</sub>, C2<sub>W2B2757&#x02013;3065</sub>, T3<sub>1902&#x02013;2386</sub> and T3<sub>2065&#x02013;2386</sub>. The former two were based on the CMV RNA 1 and C2<sub>W2B</sub> sequences in the recombinant viruses, respectively, while the latter two were based on the sequence of TAV RNAs 3B and 5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). All of these clones were placed into the pCass1 vector, under transcriptional control of the CaMV 35S RNA promoter and terminator sequences. The infectivity results of the various plasmid mixtures tested on <italic>N. glutinosa</italic> and <italic>N. clevelandii</italic> plants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The combinations C1, C2<sub>T2B</sub>, T3<sub>1&#x02013;2060</sub>, versus C1, C2<sub>T2B</sub>, T3<sub>&#x00394;163(A)&#x00394;141</sub>, versus C1, C2<sub>W2B</sub>, T3<sub>&#x00394;163(A)&#x00394;141</sub> all showed no infectivity. The addition of the plasmids expressing the 3&#x02032;-terminal NTRs C1<sub>3081&#x02013;3390</sub>, C2<sub>W2B2757&#x02013;3065</sub>, T3<sub>1902&#x02013;2386</sub> or T3<sub>2065&#x02013;2386</sub> into each mixture did not result in infectivity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These results indicate that the sequences containing the 3&#x02032; NTR are essential for the viral infection and could not be separated functionally from the rest of the TAV RNA 3 sequence. In addition, the results also indicate that the recombination observed in other experiments did not occur during the synthesis of (&#x02212;) sense RNA from (+) sense templates, since there was no repair of the 3&#x02032; NTR from synthesis initiated on either genomic RNAs 1 or 2, or subgenomic RNAs 3B or 5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and template switching to TAV RNA 3 lacking the 3&#x02032; NTR. Such repair recombination is common among tombusviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) and occurs with the related brome mosaic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54 B55 B56">54&#x02013;56</xref>). Therefore, an alternative explanation is that the recombination occurred during (+) sense RNA synthesis on the (&#x02212;) sense RNA templates, with recombination occurring as a result of template switching of the viral replicase from the donor (TAV RNA 3) strand to the acceptor (CMV RNA) strand.</p></sec><sec><title>A model for the generation of the various recombination products</title><p>Based on putative secondary structures for the 3&#x02032; NTRs of CMV and TAV, models have been proposed to account for the generation of some of the other recombination products previously observed to occur between CMV and TAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). These models are based on template switching of the viral replicase on a stem-loop structure present in the (&#x02212;) RNA 3 (L1/L2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) that may be the promoter for the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs 3B and 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Similar structures can be used to explain the various recombinant products obtained here and the effect of the 163-nt repeats and the single G to A substitution on the recombination event. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Proposed secondary structure of RNA 3 sequences complementary to the 3&#x02032; NTR of TAV RNA 3.

Therefore, generation of TAV RNA 3 progeny with deletion of one of the 163-nt repeats is more likely to occur than recombination between TAV RNA 3 and another viral genomic RNA. That is, if one repeat is missing, then only intermolecular recombination can occur, which may explain why the recombinants were seen to accumulate more rapidly in the plants directly inoculated with virus containing only one repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). On the other hand, loss of a repeat was not a prerequisite for intermolecular recombination, since intramolecular recombination would involve loss of the first repeat [163(A)], while the recombinants formed from the full-length T3 all retained the first repeat. Intramolecular recombination would be expected to occur during (+) TAV RNA 3 synthesis, if the polymerase jumped from the beginning of the first repeat in stem-loop L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) to the beginning of the second repeat in stem-loop L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). These sequences also contain the putative RNA 5 subgenomic promoter sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) that would facilitate this recombination and those described previously that involved this &#x02018;hot spot&#x02019; for intermolecular recombination between TAV and CMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The presence of another stem-loop structure (K1/K2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) immediately adjacent to the putative subgenomic promoter may slow the polymerase down sufficiently to stutter and in some cases switch templates. In the case of the first TAV-CMV RNA 3 recombinant described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), this occurred just before another stem-loop structure in the first repeat (J2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A; see arrow), but in that instance, the polymerase jumped to the putative RNA 5 subgenomic promoter of (&#x02212;) CMV RNA 2, leading to an initial recombinant that had a duplication of the two, putative subgenomic RNA promoters, which then led to a second recombination event, with the intervening TAV RNA 3 sequences deleted, giving the final, stable recombinant RNA 3 described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>The full-length TAV RNA 3, as well as the T3<sub>&#x00394;163(G)</sub> variant gave rise to similar recombination products, with the exact switchover position on the donor RNA of the recombinant determined by the 2b gene present (T2B versus W2B), while the switchover position on the receptor RNA is the beginning of the RNA 5 sequence in either CMV RNAs 1 or 2, again determined by the specific 2b gene present. In the case of C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3 and C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(G)</sub>, the recombination occurred immediately after nucleotide 2060. For C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3, switchover would have had to occur at the base of stem-loop L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B), while for C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(G)</sub>, switchover would have had to occur within stem-loop G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B and C), since the sequences comprising stem-loop L1 (plus stem-loops K1 to H1) would not exist in C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(G)</sub>. Since stem-loops L1 and G are quite different in most of their sequence and structure, as well as stability (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> = &#x02013;1.3 kcal/mol for stem-loop G and &#x02212;6.9 kcal/mol for stem-loop L1), it seems likely that the common structures preceding these stem-loops (J2-I2-H2 versus J1-I1-H1; &#x00394;<italic>G</italic> = &#x02212;3.8, &#x02212;4.8 and &#x02212;2.9 kcal/mol, for each stem-loop structure) may have slowed the polymerase sufficiently to allow it to pause at nucleotide 2060, in either stem-loop L1 or G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B).</p><p>In the case of C1C2W<sub>2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(G)</sub>, switchover occurred following nucleotide 2064 in stem-loop G, but did not immediately proceed to the (&#x02212;) CMV RNA 2 as the receptor RNA. Rather, the polymerase jumped back to the subgenomic promoter stem-loop (L2) and copied this through the A residue in the gap between stem-loops L2 and K2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), before pausing and jumping to the same subgenomic promoter sequence on (&#x02212;) CMV RNA 2. The small difference in &#x00394;<italic>G</italic> between the 6 bp stem-loop K2 in (&#x02212;) TAV RNA 3 (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> = &#x02212;2.7 kcal/mol) and a weaker 3 bp stem-loop (K&#x02032;) structure adjacent to the subgenomic promoter in (&#x02212;) CMV RNA 2 (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> = &#x02212;2.1 kcal/mol) may be sufficient to prevent the polymerase from pausing at the base of stem-loop K&#x02032; in (&#x02212;) CMV RNA 2. This explains the duplication of the 19 nt seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D, following the A residue (from copying the first nucleotide, U-1902 of the RNA 5/3B promoter). In the case of C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3, the same recombinant progeny RNA 3 is seen, but it must have been generated from a different starting point, since the second repeat is present in the template but missing in the recombinant progeny RNA 3. Here, template switching occurred either immediately after nucleotide 2084 (the A residue in the gap between stem-loops L1 and K1), again leading to a partially duplicated subgenomic promoter with the 19 nt repeat, or it occurred at nucleotide 2064, in the lower region of stem-loop L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B), and then proceeded as described above for C1C2<sub>W2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(G)</sub>.</p><p>In contrast to C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(G)</sub>, C1C2<sub>T2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(A)</sub> and C1C2W<sub>2B</sub>T3<sub>&#x00394;163(A)</sub> underwent recombination 22 nt further along the TAV RNA 3 molecule after nucleotide 2245, adjacent to stem-loop E (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C), regardless of the nature of the 2b protein. Therefore, while the nature of the receptor RNA and the apparently slow selection of the recombinants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) were determined by the 2b gene, the generation of recombinants at position 2245 was determined by the absence of the first repeat. Since the first and second repeats differ by only one nucleotide (underlined blue letters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A and B, at positions 1966 and 2129), we propose that there must be a difference in structure between the virus containing only one repeat, when this is the second repeat versus the first repeat, and that this difference in structure affects pausing by the polymerase, leading to switchover to another template. This difference could be the presence (or absence) of a weak pseudoknot structure formed between the three A residues in the loop of stem-loop G and the three U residues in the non&#x02013;base-paired region between stem-loops K2 and J2 (see blue letters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref>). This pseudoknot would not be stable in T3<sub>&#x00394;163(A)</sub>, since it would only contain two A:U base pairs. This weak pseudoknot structure may be sufficient to affect pausing by the polymerase in the T3<sub>&#x00394;163(G)</sub> variant, if it can re-form after the polymerase has gone through it the first time and then transcribed through the various, following stem-loop structures (stem-loops J, I and H in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), leading to template switching in stem-loop G. However, as this pseudoknot is absent in T3<sub>&#x00394;163(A)</sub>, the polymerase would continue through stem-loop G until it pauses at the base of stem-loop E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C; &#x00394;<italic>G</italic> = &#x02212;6.8 kcal/mol), before switching to the receptor RNA.</p><p>It would seem likely that the polymerase is as equally able to use RNA 1 as RNA 2 for the receptor RNA, since the polymerase is essentially the same in all cases, and the presence or absence of the 2a protein C-terminal sequences (where the recombinant polymerases showed some differences in sequence) did not affect the nature of the recombinant RNAs. However, since only one type of recombinant progeny was observed in each case, this demonstrates that there must have been selection for a particular progeny RNA, which depended on the source of the 2b gene and its encoded protein.</p><p>How could the nature of the 2b protein affect the selection of recombinant RNAs? It is conceivable that the selection of recombinant RNAs is a manifestation of the RNA silencing suppression-related functions of the 2b proteins, since some of these also vary between strains of CMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). However, based on the spatial separation of the 2b protein from the replication machinery within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49 B50 B51">49&#x02013;51</xref>), it is difficult to envision how different 2b proteins provide the selection observed through their RNA silencing suppressor functions. In the case of the tombusvirus cucumber necrosis virus, inhibition of expression of the 20-kDa protein now known to be the RNA silencing suppressor of this virus, led to the rapid appearance of defective-interfering RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Thus, in that, the absence of the silencing suppressor led to enhanced generation or selection of recombinant RNAs, while in the case of CMV, the source of the 2b protein determined the nature of the recombinant RNAs selected and pseudorecombinant viruses could not be selected in its absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Moreover, in the case of influenza virus, where the NS1 gene encodes an RNA silencing suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>), mutation in a different gene (NS2) led to the rapid appearance of defective interfering particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). At the time it was thought that the influenza NS2 protein might be involved in replication. In fact, the NS2 protein is involved in selecting ribonucleoprotein complexes for transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and is now called the nuclear export protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>).</p><p>Based on previous observations that the 2b protein is also a movement protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), that the presence of the 2b protein was necessary for the cell-to-cell movement of pseudorecombinants viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), and that the 2b protein is a viral RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), it seems likely that the 2b binds to and selects specific recombinant viral RNAs for cell-to-cell movement. The different forms of recombinant RNAs generated may have different affinities for the various 2b proteins, leading to selection of one recombinant form over another by a particular 2b protein, which leads eventually to selection of the recombinant RNA over the parental RNA. Since selection to reach detectable levels was only observed after several weeks, the recombinant viral RNAs do not appear to be under strong selection pressure, although there is clearly a gradual selection for the recombinant RNAs over the parental RNA 3. This was seen in the slow appearance of the recombinant RNAs in both sets of time course experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1). The rate of selection could be tested further by direct competition experiments. The Q-CMV 2b protein did not select for any recombinants, while the TAV and WAII-CMV 2b proteins selected for different recombinants, possibly reflecting differences in their RNA-binding properties. It would also be interesting to determine whether various 2b mutants would show differences in their selection of different recombinants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm1036_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm1036_nar-01947-c-2007-File009.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="nar_gkm1036_nar-01947-c-2007-File010.ppt"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Xiang-Ming Li for her valuable technical assistance.
