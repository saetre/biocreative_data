In preclinical models, K-Ras mutations are necessary for tobacco carcinogen-driven lung tumorigenesis and are sufficient to cause lung adenocarcinomas in transgenic mice. Because these mutations confer resistance to commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapies and targeted agents, effective therapies that target K-Ras are needed. Inhibitors of mTOR such as rapamycin can prevent K-Ras-driven lung tumorigenesis and alter the proportion of cytotoxic and Foxp3&#x0002b; regulatory T cells, suggesting that lung-associated T cells might be important for tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Lung tumorigenesis was studied in three murine models that depend on mutant K-Ras; a tobacco carcinogen-driven model, a syngeneic inoculation model, and a transgenic model. Splenic and lung-associated T cells were studied using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Foxp3&#x0002b; cells were depleted using rapamycin, an antibody, or genetic ablation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Exposure of A/J mice to a tobacco carcinogen tripled lung-associated Foxp3&#x0002b; cells prior to tumor development. At clinically relevant concentrations, rapamycin prevented this induction and reduced lung tumors by 90&#x00025;. In A/J mice inoculated with lung adenocarcinoma cells resistant to rapamycin, antibody-mediated depletion of Foxp3&#x0002b; cells reduced lung tumorigenesis by 80&#x00025;. Likewise, mutant K-Ras transgenic mice lacking Foxp3&#x0002b; cells developed 75&#x00025; fewer lung tumors than littermates with Foxp3&#x0002b; cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Foxp3&#x0002b; regulatory T cells are required for K-Ras-mediated lung tumorigenesis in mice.

Lung cancer remains a daunting problem that is mostly related to smoking, with over 215,000 new cases and 160,000 deaths expected in the US in 2008 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Jemal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Smoking is associated with resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapies and targeted therapies in lung cancer patients, and over 90 million current or former smokers in the United States are at permanent increased risk to develop lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-IARC1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, there is great need to understand and mitigate the effects of smoking as it relates to the development and treatment of lung cancer.</p><p>Activating mutations in K-Ras have been identified in approximately 25&#x00025; of human lung adenocarcinomas that are primarily associated with smoking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Westra1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Mills1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In preclinical models, K-Ras mutations are observed in over 90&#x00025; of lung tumors induced by the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-methylnitrosamino-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). Oncogenic K-Ras stimulates activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway, which contributes to the development of lung tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-West1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Wislez1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The FDA-approved immunosuppressant, rapamycin, as well as its analogues, are mTOR inhibitors, and this class of drugs decreases K-Ras induced lung tumorigenesis in mice. We recently reported that rapamycin, when administered to achieve physiologically relevant trough levels, reduced NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice by 90&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Granville1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These results are consistent with studies of transgenic models of prostate, breast and lung cancer, where treatment with rapamycin or rapamycin analogues prevented or reversed premalignant lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Wislez1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Liu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Majumder1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, early steps of tumorigenesis in many mouse models of cancer are reliant on mTOR activation. Despite the promise of mTOR inhibition as a preventive approach, little is known about the mechanisms underlying its efficacy.</p><p>Activation of K-Ras in the mouse lung generates an inflammatory process. In A/J mice, inflammation is highly associated with susceptibility to NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis. In mice genetically engineered to express mutant K-Ras, mTOR inhibition has been shown to reduce inflammatory processes in the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Wislez1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The immunosuppressive properties of mTOR inhibitors, coupled with their efficacy for tumor prevention in mouse models, suggested that modulation of the immune system is important for mutant K-Ras mediated lung tumorigenesis. Regulatory T cells (Treg) suppress autoreactive T cells, and thus prevent autoimmunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Sakaguchi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Treg are a subset of CD4&#x0002b; T cells and express the transcription factor, Foxp3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Hori1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Preclinical studies suggest that Treg may play an important role in limiting the development of an effective immune response against cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Zou1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Tumor-associated Treg have been observed in lymphomas and human cancers of the lung, ovary, breast, prostate, and colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Ishibashi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Petersen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In lung cancer, Treg are increased in tumor tissue relative to surrounding normal lung tissue and are associated with an increased risk of recurrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Petersen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Treg also regulate the ability of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-II to decrease lung tumorigenesis in xenograft and viral models of lung tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Sharma1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Because rapamycin can alter T cell function and prevent the development of NNK-induced lung tumors that are associated with K-Ras mutations, we hypothesized that modulation of immune function might be an important determinant of lung tumorigenesis. Our studies show that rapamycin unexpectedly counteracts an increase in lung-associated Treg by NNK that precedes the detection of tumors. Depletion of Treg using an antibody or genetic deletion also greatly diminished lung tumorigenesis in other K-Ras driven mouse models, suggesting a new strategy that might have utility for lung cancers characterized by mutations in K-Ras.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mice</title><p>A/J and Foxp3<sup>sf/&#x0002b;</sup> mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) at 5 weeks of age and housed according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

One week after completion of three weekly doses of NNK, NNK decreased splenocyte number but not function (data not shown), and caused a 21&#x00025; relative increase in splenic CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b;Foxp3&#x0002b; regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005061-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>, left panel). Because regulatory T cells are associated with tumor tolerance, we hypothesized that a similar increase in Foxp3&#x0002b; regulatory T cells in lung tissues may be associated with tobacco carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess Foxp3&#x0002b; cells and CD3&#x0002b; cells in lung tissues from NNK-treated mice. One week after administration of either a single dose or three doses of NNK (and prior to the development of tumors), the fraction of lung associated Foxp3&#x0002b;/CD3&#x0002b; cells increased 2- and 4-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005061-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>, right panel). Lung-associated Foxp3&#x0002b; cells correlated with NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis, because 16 weeks after administration of NNK, there was a trend between the number of tumors per lung and the number of Foxp3&#x0002b; cells in surrounding lung tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005061-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). Induction of lung tumors and tumor-associated Foxp3&#x0002b; cells by NNK was also dose-dependent.

To assess whether this observation is related to lung-associated Foxp3&#x0002b; cells, A/J mice were treated with NNK, and lungs and spleens were harvested at various time points after administration of rapamycin or vehicle. Consistent with earlier studies, rapamycin markedly decreased the size and multiplicity of NNK-induced lung tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005061-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). mTOR was inhibited in tumor cells and normal airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005061.s002">Fig. S2a</xref>), and steady state rapamycin levels were constant throughout the study. Rapamycin rapidly reversed the induction of lung-associated Foxp3&#x0002b; cells by NNK, and maintained depletion of Foxp3&#x0002b; cells throughout the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005061-g002">Fig. 2c&#x02013;d</xref>), even though splenic CD4&#x0002b;CD25&#x0002b;Foxp3&#x0002b; cells were increased at 12 wk by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005061.s002">Fig. S2b</xref>), consistent with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Vuillemenot1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The depletion of lung-associated Foxp3&#x0002b; cells preceded tumor development because the number of Foxp3-expressing cells was decreased by 84&#x00025; after 1 week of treatment (when tumors were not visible). Although rapamycin also reduced the overall number of CD3&#x0002b; T cells (data not shown), the Foxp3&#x0002b;/CD3&#x0002b; ratio was depleted to levels observed in non-NNK exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005061-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>).

Because long-term depletion of lung-associated Foxp3&#x0002b; cells by anti-CD25 antibodies was not achievable, we developed a short-term assay, and performed a series of studies using syngeneic lung adenocarcinoma cell lines derived from NNK-induced tumors in A/J mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Vuillemenot1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Treatment of IO33-injected mice with rapamycin had no effect on tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005061-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>) and did not affect the number of tumor-associated Foxp3&#x0002b; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005061-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>), despite inhibition of mTOR in normal bronchial epithelium and IO33 tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005061.s003">Fig. S3d</xref>).

The tissue specific induction of Foxp3&#x0002b; cells in lung tissues prior to tumor development suggests that NNK-induced Foxp3&#x0002b; T cells provide a permissive environment for the development of K-Ras-driven lung tumors. Such an environment may also be important for the development of lung metastasis, because smoking can double the metastatic burden in lungs in preclinical models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Murin1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A common feature linking smoking induced K-Ras mutations in human lung cancer and preclinical models driven by tobacco carcinogens that cause K-Ras mutations is inflammation. In both cases, the presence of Foxp3&#x0002b; cells is likely important for limiting the extent of inflammation and tissue damage, albeit at a potential cost of promoting tumorigenesis. Smoking causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is an independent risk factor for lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Skillrud1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with COPD or smokers contains increased Treg compared to BAL fluid from healthy never smokers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Smyth1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, smoking is also associated with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity, and increased Foxp3&#x0002b; cells have been observed in SCC compared to non-cancerous epithelial tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Schwarz1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. NNK, the most prevalent tobacco carcinogen, alters many components of inflammation, including cytokine expression and cellular immunity, and the susceptibility of different mouse strains to NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis has been linked to differences in lung immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-RazaniBoroujerdi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. One important alteration caused by NNK is induction of cyclooxygenase II (COX-2) activity. Inhibitors of COX-2 can decrease NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Rioux1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and Sharma <italic>et al.</italic> have shown that the ability of COX-2 inhibitors to decrease lung tumorigenesis (in models not related to tobacco) is dependent upon decreasing Foxp3&#x0002b; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Sharma1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Inflammation is also associated with lung tumorigenesis in transgenic mice that express mutant K-Ras in lung tissues. Our studies showed that the ratio of Foxp3&#x0002b;/CD3&#x0002b; cells was not statistically different between the NNK model and the K-Ras<sup>LA2</sup> model, but the total numbers of each cell type was increased in the tobacco carcinogen model. Eliminating Foxp3&#x0002b; cells by crossing K-Ras<sup>LA2</sup> mice to scurfy mice nonetheless decreased lung tumorigenesis, which shows that even though fewer tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were induced in the K-Ras<sup>LA2</sup> model, Foxp3&#x0002b; cells still played a critical role. The increased inflammatory response in lungs from scurfy mice that occurred as a result of loss of Foxp3&#x0002b; cells may have decreased tumor growth through elimination of nascent tumors. Wislez <italic>et al.</italic> previously showed an important role for alveolar macrophages in mediating inhibition of tumor growth by high doses of a rapamycin analogue in a transgenic model of lung cancer similar to K-Ras<sup>LA2</sup> (K-Ras<sup>LA1</sup>). However, alterations in Foxp3&#x0002b; cells were not reported in this study. Because activated macrophages and tumor cells can recruit Foxp3&#x0002b; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Curiel1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Savage1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that the role attributed to alveolar macrophages was mediated through activation of Foxp3&#x0002b; cells. Together, these studies show that Foxp3&#x0002b; cells provide a critical link between inflammation and cancer in multiple models of lung tumorigenesis driven by mutant K-Ras, and highlight the possibility that careful titration of lung- associated Foxp3&#x0002b; cells might allow effective anti-tumor immunity without tissue damage from unabated inflammation.</p><p>Although these studies provide rationale to target Foxp3&#x0002b; cells for the prevention or treatment of K-Ras-driven lung tumors, the responsiveness of Foxp3&#x0002b; cells may depend on the agent utilized to target Foxp3&#x0002b; cells and the transformation status of the cells that bear K-Ras mutations. For example, rapamycin selectively reduced the number of Foxp3&#x0002b; cells induced by NNK in lung tissues prior to tumor development, thereby providing a reciprocal relationship with NNK, but had no effect when fully transformed IO33 adenocarcinoma cells were injected. Similar results were observed when rapamycin was administered after NNK-induced lung tumors were allowed to develop in A/J mice for 26 wk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Granville1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. When administered from week 26 to week 32, rapamycin decreased tumor size by 50&#x00025; but did not affect tumor multiplicity, and the number of tumor infiltrating Foxp3&#x0002b; cells was not decreased (data not shown). The clinical experience with analogues of rapamycin that have been tested as cancer therapeutics is consistent with these preclinical observations, in that mTOR inhibitors only have modest activity as single agents in patients with advanced lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-ODonnell1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Mita1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these data suggest that rapamycin, which is an FDA-approved oral agent with a high therapeutic index, might be most effective as a preventative strategy primarily for smokers with premalignant lesions or carcinomas in situ that bear occult K-Ras mutations.</p><p>Aggressive and invasive K-Ras-induced adenocarcinomas (IO33 and K-Ras<sup>LA2</sup>) remained sensitive to more direct targeting of Foxp3&#x0002b; cells through a neutralizing anti-CD25 antibody or genetic deletion. This indicates that direct Treg cell depletion strategies that are being evaluated clinically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005061-Curiel2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> could have therapeutic value in more advanced stages of K-Ras driven lung cancer. However, the fact that long-term administration of an anti-CD25 antibody was effective in splenocytes but not in lung tissues suggests that there may be tissue specificity for the ability of antibodies to deplete Foxp3&#x0002b; cells and/or that compensatory mechanisms such as increases in CD25-/Foxp3&#x0002b; cells occur with long-term use. Therefore, other therapeutic approaches may need to be developed to selectively deplete Foxp3&#x0002b; cells in advanced K-Ras driven lung cancers. The development of multiple therapies that deplete Foxp3&#x0002b; cells at different stages of K-Ras induced tumorigenesis might eventually provide new options for lung cancer treatment and prevention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005061.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Foxp3 is expressed in CD3&#x0002b; lymphocytes, but is not detectable in murine lung epithelium or lung epithelium-derived cultured cell lines.
