Interleukin-6 is a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine with an important role in the inflammatory cascade, such as up-regulation of C-reactive protein (CRP). The interleukin-6 &#x02013;174-G/C promoter polymorphism appears to influence levels of inflammatory markers, which have been shown to be associated with arterial stiffness. We studied the association of this polymorphism with levels of interleukin-6 and CRP and with arterial stiffness. The study (n = 3849) was embedded in the Rotterdam Study, a prospective, population-based study. Analyses on the association between the &#x02013;174-G/C polymorphism and pulse wave velocity, distensibility coefficient, and pulse pressure were performed using analyses of variance. Analyses on the levels of inflammatory markers and arterial stiffness were performed using linear regression analyses. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, known cardiovascular risk factors, and atherosclerosis. We found pulse wave velocity to be 0.35 m/s higher for CC-homozygotes vs. wildtype GG-homozygotes (p = 0.018) with evidence for an allele-dose effect (p trend = 0.013), and a similar pattern for pulse pressure (p trend = 0.041). No apparent consistent association with the distensibility coefficient was found. CRP levels were associated with pulse wave velocity (p = 0.007). In conclusion, the interleukin-6 &#x02013;174 G/C polymorphism is associated with increased arterial stiffness and pulse pressure.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>IL-6</kwd><kwd>CRP</kwd><kwd>arterial stiffness</kwd><kwd>pulse wave velocity</kwd><kwd>distensibility coefficient</kwd><kwd>pulse pressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Arterial stiffness increases with age and has been associated with hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-vhrm-4-0863">Avolio et al 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-vhrm-4-0863">Roman et al 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-vhrm-4-0863">Girerd et al 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-vhrm-4-0863">London et al 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-vhrm-4-0863">Wada et al 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-vhrm-4-0863">van Popele et al 2001</xref>).

During the first phase of this study (1990&#x02013;1993), all inhabitants of a Rotterdam suburban area (Ommoord) aged 55 years and over were invited to participate in this study. The response rate was 78%. The third examination phase took place from 1997&#x02013;1999, during which measures of arterial stiffness were performed. Approval of the Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus University Rotterdam was obtained for the Rotterdam Study. From all participants written informed consent was acquired.

Genotypes were determined using Taqman allelic discrimination assay. The Assay-by-Design service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.appliedbiosystems.com">www.appliedbiosystems.com</ext-link>) was used to set up a Taqman allelic discrimination assay for the IL-6 &#x02013;174 G/C polymorphism (Primers: Fw. GACGACCT AAGCTGCACTTTTC, Rv. GGGCTGATTGGAAACCT-TATTAAGATTG. Reporter 1 sequence VIC CTTTAGCAT-GGCAAGAC and reporter 2 sequence FAM CTTTAGCA TCGCAAGAC). The PCR reaction mixture included 2 ng of genomic DNA in a 2 &#x003bc;l volume and the following reagents: FAM and VIC probes (200 nM), primers (0.9 uM), 2x Taqman PCR master mix (ABgene, Epsom, UK). Reagents were dispensed in a 384-wells plate using the Deerac Equator NS808 (Deerac Fluidics, Dublin, Ireland). PCR cycling reactions were performed in 384 wells PCR plates in an ABI 9700 PCR system (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and consisted of initial denaturation for 15 minutes at 95 &#x000b0;C, and 40 cycles with denaturation of 15 seconds at 95 &#x000b0;C and annealing and extension for 60 seconds at 60 &#x000b0;C. Results were analyzed by the ABI Taqman 7900HT using the sequence detection system 2.22 software (Applied Biosystems Inc.). To confirm the accuracy of genotyping results, randomly selected samples (5% of total sample) were re-genotyped using the same method. No inconsistencies were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of IL-6 and CRP plasma levels</title><p>Levels of IL-6 and CRP were determined in samples obtained at baseline during the first phase of the Rotterdam Study.

Blood pressure was measured twice on the right arm using a random-zero sphygmomanometer. The average of the two blood pressure values was used in the analyses. Length and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated. Serum total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol values were determined by an automated enzymatic procedure (Boehringer Mannheim System).

Pulse pressure measurements could be determined for all subjects participating in the third phase (3833 successfully genotyped). For 2545 genotyped subjects, complete data on both PWV, distensibility coefficient and pulse pressure were available.

Missing data in clinical characteristics were imputed using Expectation-Maximization algorithms available in SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For serum measurements all values above mean plus three times the standard deviation were excluded, as correction for outliers. Natural-log transformed (ln-transformation) values of IL-6 and CRP levels were used to normalize the distribution of these variables. The association between genotypes and arterial stiffness was investigated using analyses of variance. Analyses on the association of IL-6 and CRP levels and arterial stiffness were performed using linear regression. All analyses were adjusted for age and sex, and (if applicable) additionally for mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, BMI, HDL and total cholesterol levels, smoking, DM. and measures of atherosclerosis (carotid IMT and aortic calcification).

Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-vhrm-4-0863">Kullo and colleagues (2005)</xref> found a relation between CRP levels and PWV in an American population (n = 214).</p><p>As CRP and IL-6 levels are associated with arterial stiffness, our findings of a significant association of the polymorphism and increased PWV is biologically plausible. Our significant findings for PP are in concordance herewith. We found no association between the polymorphism and the distensibility coefficient. PWV and the distensibility coefficient both reflect other anatomical regions (the aorta and carotids, respectively), which may contribute to discordances in findings on stiffness. It is also possible, however, that a small effect may have gone undetected due to limitations in sample size.</p><p>To assess the influence of age on the relation between the IL-6 polymorphism and arterial stiffness, we also performed analyses stratified by age. However, apart from significance (significance was preserved for PWV in the &#x02265;73 years group and for PP in the &#x0003c;73 years group), the analyses yielded the same findings in the same direction and patterns as in the &#x0201c;age-combined&#x0201d; analyses. Therefore, differences in significance may be more likely due to the reduction in group sizes, than due to strong age-dependent influence on the relation between the IL-6 gene polymorphism and arterial stiffness.</p><p>We also found a significant association of CRP levels and PWV. The number of currently available CRP levels within the Rotterdam Study was more than three times larger than the number available at the time of our previous analyses; the results of our present study are in concordance with these earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-vhrm-4-0863">Mattace-Raso et al 2004</xref>). Our findings suggest IL-6 levels to be positively related to PWV, although this association was not significant. IL-6 has been described to be too unstable in time (plasma half-life of less than 2 hours) to be precisely measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-vhrm-4-0863">Riches et al 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-vhrm-4-0863">Waage et al 1989</xref>). This might explain the lack of a significant association between PWV and IL-6 levels. In addition we have to remark, that the number of subjects with IL-6 measurements (random sample) was very small.</p><p>Our study is based on a large ongoing population-based study in a relatively homogeneous population, as 98% of the participants in our study are Caucasian and are all living in the same suburb of Rotterdam. We adjusted all analyses for established cardiovascular risk factors. The distensibility coefficient has a strong correlation with MAP; a higher MAP in the artery stretches the elastin and collagen fibres in the arterial wall, making the arteries less distensible. Therefore, the analyses were adjusted for MAP.</p><p>To interpret the findings correctly, several methodological aspects of the measures of arterial stiffness need to be discussed. First, pulse waves in the carotid artery and the femoral artery travel in opposite directions, while measurements of carotid-femoral PWV is based on the assumption that the pulse wave travels from the carotid artery to the femoral artery. In this way, measuring the distance between the carotid and the femoral artery led to an overestimation of the distance between the sites of the pulse waves, resulting in overestimation of the velocity of the pulse waves. However, variations in anatomy are limited and this error may be considered similar for all subjects examined, therefore we do not think it has seriously biased our results. Second, the distance between the carotid and the femoral artery may be overestimated in (especially adipose) subjects when this distance is measured by tape. To avoid this error we adjusted the analyses for BMI. Third, in computing the carotid distensibility coefficient, we used the brachial PP rather than the carotid PP. Information on comparisons between the carotid and the brachial PP indicates that the carotid PP is lower than the brachial PP but the differences are relatively small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-vhrm-4-0863">Waddell et al 2001</xref>).</p><p>Some general remarks: data on measures of stiffness were not available for all subjects who visited the research center. However, missing information was primarily due to logistic reasons, which is likely to be random and thus will not have biased our results. Second, the cross-sectional design of our study limits the ability to infer a causal relationship between the IL-6 &#x02013;174 G/C polymorphism, inflammation, and arterial stiffness. Any associations do not necessarily imply causality and should be interpreted with reservation. Further, we interpreted our results also in the context of literature and (known) pathophysiology. However, we are also aware that some findings were not significant and may be chance findings. Finally, because our study was performed in a population of predominantly elderly Caucasian subjects, the generalizability of our findings to younger individuals or other ethnicities remains uncertain.</p><p>In conclusion, the C-allele of the interleukin-6 &#x02013;174 G/C promoter polymorphism is associated with increased PWV and PP. Our results consolidate the finding that CRP levels are associated with PWV in an elderly Dutch population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by NWO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research) under grant no. 904-61&#x02013;196 and under the ASPASIA grant no. 015.000.090, by the Center for Medical Systems Biology and by the European Commission under grant QLK6-CT-2002-02629 (GENOMOS).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Conflicts of interest</bold></p><p>APG Hoeks has received research grants (pressure wave analysis, pulse wave analysis, risk factor evaluation, molecular imaging).
