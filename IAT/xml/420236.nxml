Not even Delta overexpression activates Notch in neural precursor cells. It is possible that future neural cells are protected by cis-inactivation, in which ligands block activation of Notch within the same cell. The Delta-ubiquitin ligase Neuralized has been proposed to antagonize cis-inactivation, favoring Notch activation. Cis-inactivation and role of Neuralized have not yet been studied in tissues where neural precursor cells are resistant to nearby Delta, however, such as the R8 cells of the eye or the bristle precursor cells of the epidermis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overexpressed ligands could block Notch signal transduction cell-autonomously in non-neural cells of the epidermis and retina, but did not activate Notch nonautonomously in neural cells. High ligand expression levels were required for cis-inactivation, and Serrate was more effective than Delta, although Delta is the ligand normally regulating neural specification. Differences between Serrate and Delta depended on the extracellular domains of the respective proteins. Neuralized was found to act cell nonautonomously in signal-sending cells during eye development, inconsistent with the view that Neuralized antagonizes cis-inactivation in non-neural cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Delta and Neuralized contribute cell nonautonomously to Notch signaling in neurogenesis, and the model that Neuralized antagonizes cis-inactivation to permit Notch activity and specification of non-neural cells is refuted. The molecular mechanism rendering Notch insensitive to paracrine activation in neural precursor cells remains uncertain.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Notch family of transmembrane proteins are receptors for extracellular signals. During neural development Notch activation blocks neural fate specification, so that only cells lacking Notch activity can become neural precursor cells. Since Notch activity is necessary and sufficient to block neural fate, it follows that the pattern of neural precursor specification is determined by the pattern of Notch activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The pattern of Notch activity is not predicted well by the distribution of Delta, the activating ligand for Notch in neural development. Delta transcripts and protein appear homogenous in neurogenic regions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The neural precursor cells, where Notch activity is low, seem to be exposed to as much ligand as non-neural cells where Notch activity is high[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Consistent with this conclusion, endogenous Delta can be replaced by Delta transcribed ubiquitously from heterologous promoters without affecting primary embryonic neurogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recent study of R8 photoreceptor cells, a neural cell type specified by lateral inhibition in the retina, shows that even overexpression of Dl does not activate the Notch pathway in these neural precursor cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A similar conclusion has been reached for thoracic bristle precursors, where mutations that elevate Dl levels stimulate Notch activity in adjacent non-neural cells but not in neural bristle precursor cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The sensitivity of neural precursor cells to Dl can be affected by altered Notch glycosylation, but the mechanism is not known[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>One process that could render Notch insensitive is ligand-dependent "cis-inactivation". Whereas ligands activate Notch on the surface of neighboring cells, several studies show that ligands block Notch activity within the same cell. This raises the possibility that seemingly homogenous Dl protein levels might contribute more to cis-inactivation in neural precursor cells, but more to N activation in laterally-inhibited cells. Something further would be required to explain why Dl behaves differently in the two types of cells. This could be the Dl-ubiquitin ligase <italic>neuralized</italic>. Neur has been proposed either to reduce cis-inactivation in non-neural cells, or to promote N activation from neural cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>We sought to investigate the potential role of cis-inactivation in neural patterning, and its possible modulation by neur. One issue was that although cis-inactivation had been reported after ligand overexpression during wing margin specification, during fate acquisition within neural lineages, and in chick neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], only minor effects of ligand overexpression have been reported during bristle specification[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and no cis-inactivation had been reported during R8 specification[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus it was not certain that cis-inactivation occurred in the settings where insensitivity of neural cells to Dl has been demonstrated. The importance of cis-inactivation at normal ligand expression levels is even less well established, only having been proven in the specification of wing boundary cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Another issue is that although <italic>neur </italic>was proposed to counteract cis-inactivation in non-neural cells because of cell autonomous effects during bristle specification and eye development,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], other studies found that <italic>neur </italic>acted nonautonomously on wing margin sensilla and during fate acquisition within neural lineages, implying that <italic>neur </italic>promotes paracrine activation of Notch[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It was necessary to be certain of the cell autonomy of <italic>neur </italic>in a tissue where neural cells are known to be less sensitive to Dl.</p><p>We report that ligand overexpression can cis-inactivate N during eye neurogenesis and during specification of bristle precursor cells in the epidermis. Very high levels of ligand expression are needed, however, and the potential of Delta for cis-inactivation is lower than that of Serrate, a ligand that is not important for neural patterning. <italic>neur </italic>plays no detectable autonomous role in eye patterning, but is required nonautonomously for multiple fate specifications. Thus Neur does not antagonize cis-inactivation in non-neural cells, if any cis-inactivation occurs at normal ligand expression levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Dl and Ser are neurogenic when sufficiently overexpressed</title><p>The two-component Gal4/UAS system was used to overexpress Dl or Ser during eye and bristle development. In initial experiments some ectopic neurogenesis was seen on overexpression of a Ser cDNA but not of a Dl cDNA (not shown). Six sets of transgenes for targeted expression of Dl, Ser, or chimeras between the two were then established to investigate the basis for this difference(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These transgenes incorporated the 5'UTR from the <italic>Xenopus </italic>globin gene and the 3'UTR from SV40 T gene in place of the untranslated sequences from <italic>Dl </italic>or <italic>Ser</italic>cDNAs, both to boost expression and eliminate one source of variation between Dl and Ser constructs. The transgenes reproduced the properties previously described for overexpression and ectopic expression of Dl or Ser respectively, inducing ectopic margin specification in developing wings, and inhibiting photoreceptor R1&#x02013;R7 differentiation posterior to the morphogenetic furrow of developing eyes(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E,1F,1G</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Proteins containing extracellular and transmembrane portions of Dl but intracellular domain from Ser resembled Dl in activating N in dorsal wing cells but not ventral, and in promoting progression of the morphogenetic furrow during eye development(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Proteins containing extracellular and transmembrane portions of Ser but intracellular domain from Dl resembled Ser in activating N in ventral wing cells but not dorsal, so all these ligand properties seemed to map to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the proteins(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Ectopic expression of Dl and Ser </bold>A.

This resembled the effect of inhibiting Notch signaling and was quite different from the effect of activating Notch during bristle development. Expression from transgenes encoding Dl had modest effects leading to a few extra bristles(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,2B</xref>). The most active Dl line was D<sup>E</sup>S<sup>I</sup> line A10, henceforth referred to as UAS-Dl(A10) for short. Expression of many Ser transgenes had more effect than Dl; some appeared to replace entire proneural regions with bristles(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Thus both ligands appeared qualitatively similar but Ser was more active, in experiments where the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences were similar.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Neurogenic effects </bold>A-C.

The fact that scaGal4-driven E(spl) bHLH expression suppresses bristle specification confirms that scaGal4 is appropriate to affect lateral inhibition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Other drivers gave extra bristles only where they overlapped proneural regions (eg in the sternopleural and scutellar regions for dppGal4), consistent with the notion that changes within proneural regions were responsible(data not shown).</p><p>We used the <italic>h<sup>H10</sup></italic>driver to investigate eye development because <italic>h<sup>H10</sup></italic>&#x0003e;E(spl)m&#x003b4; inhibits R8 specification, confirming that <italic>h<sup>H10</sup></italic>is appropriate to affect lateral inhibition in the eye[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. <italic>h<sup>H10</sup></italic>&#x0003e;Ser led to large excesses in R8 differentiation for most transgenes, similar to the effects of reducing Notch signaling during lateral inhibition of R8 cells(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D,2E</xref>). There was also an increase in other photoreceptor cell types(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F,2G</xref>). As described previously, Dl transgenes expressed by <italic>h<sup>H10</sup></italic>accelerate morphogenetic furrow progression, due to Dl function ahead of the morphogenetic furrow[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Only the strong A10 insertion line appeared to affect lateral inhibition of R8 cells. Multiple R8 cells were seen in 4% of ommatidia(data not shown).</p><p>N target gene expression was evaluated to test directly whether N signaling had been affected as the phenotypes suggested. Targeted Ser expression greatly reduced E(spl) m&#x003b4; expression, a reporter for N activity during R8 specification(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I,2J</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This showed that ectopic Ser expression greatly reduced N signal transduction and expression of an endogenous effector of lateral inhibition.</p><p>If reduced N activity is the explanation for excess R8 cells, this should be reversed by activation of signal transduction downstream of Notch. Constitutive signaling can be achieved by expression of the truncated Notch intracellular domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Transient N-intra expression was epistatic over targeted Ser expression(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K,2L,2M,2N</xref>). This confirmed that ligand expression inhibited Notch signaling upstream of Nintra, and suggested that ligand expression had no effect on photoreceptor differentiation except through the N pathway.</p><p>One trivial explanation for the effect on N signaling would be if overexpressed ligands were unable to reach the cell surface or prevented N from doing so. Both transgene encoded ligands and endogenous Notch protein were present on cell surfaces, however, even under the most neurogenic influence of the strongest ligand transgenes(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O,2P,2Q,2R</xref>).</p><p>Together the data show unequivocally that both Ser and Dl inhibit N signaling when sufficiently overexpressed during bristle and R8 specification, although to different degrees.</p></sec><sec><title>Autonomous cis-inactivation</title><p>Genetic mosaics were used to investigate cell autonomy. FLP-mediated site-specific recombination was used to generate proneural regions mosaic for ectopic ligand expression. scaGal4 was not useful because many mosaic flies died in pharate adulthood when incomplete cuticle tanning prevented scoring the <italic>y </italic>phenotype being used to identify clones. Instead the Gal4 transgene 109-68 was used to target expression to thoracic proneural regions. 109-68&#x0003e;Ser expression led to extra scutellar bristle differentiation consistent with viability(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,3B,3C</xref>). Mitotic recombination before 72 h gave clones of cells that never experienced ectopic Ser expression, since 109-68 drives transcription later than 96 h after egg laying, in the whole proneural region(not shown). Nonautonomy might be revealed by recruitment of cells not expressing Ser into the bristle patches. In nearly all cases where mosaic patches of bristles formed, only one of the bristles derived from a cell lacking 109-68(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,3B,3C</xref>). Rather than nonautonomy, we interpret this to indicate that one cell in each region can undergo neural differentiation without the transgenic ligand (as would happen in normal development), but that ectopic Ser was required cell autonomously for supernumerary bristles. The data also suggest that selection of the favored neural cell is unaffected by large differences in Ser expression between cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Mosaic analysis of ligand-induced neurogenesis </bold>A-C.

The <italic>abx </italic>driver seems to drive higher level expression that 109-68 does, because clones of cells overexpressing Dl(A10) differentiated ectopic bristles. Single bristles formed from cells lacking Dl(A10) overexpression, but ectopic bristles always overexpressed Dl(A10)(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). As for Ser, it appears that one cell in each region can undergo neural differentiation without additional ligand, but that ectopic Dl was required cell autonomously for supernumerary bristles, and that selection of the favored neural cell is unaffected by large differences in Dl expression between cells. Expression of Ser in response to this <italic>abx </italic>driver led to even more ectopic bristles but bristle morphology was affected, making it difficult to score the <italic>forked </italic>genetic marker that identified bristles with and without <italic>abx</italic>Gal4 (data not shown).</p><p>These experiments show that the inhibition of N signaling when Ser and Dl(A10) are overexpressed is autonomous cis-inactivation.

Since R8 specification was only increased by 4 % by our strongest UAS-Dl(A10) insertion, and less by others, it seems that high expression levels must be required for cis-inactivation of non-neural cells.</p><p>The results raised the possibility that Dl expression levels during normal development might be too low for cis-inactivation to be significant. A caveat is that our studies address cis-inactivation of non-neural cells, but it is possible that neural cells might be cis-inhibited by lower levels of endogenous ligands.

Only a single example was found(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). If <italic>neur </italic>activates N signaling by antagonizing cis-inactivation, then one would expect that <italic>neur </italic>would be required in cells where N is active, but dispensable where N is inactive. On this basis <italic>neur </italic>should not be required in R8 cells. By contrast our data suggested that R8 is where <italic>neur </italic>was most important. Previously we found that <italic>Dl </italic>was also required in R8 cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We exclude the possibility that either <italic>neur </italic>or <italic>Dl </italic>is required directly in the execution of the R8 differentiation pathway because many ectopic R8 cells differentiate in large <italic>neur </italic>or <italic>Dl </italic>mutant clones, or when the whole eye is mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Instead the data suggest that ommatidia with <italic>neur </italic>or <italic>Dl </italic>mutant R8 cells could not develop normally because <italic>neur </italic>acts in R8 to promote Dl-mediated activation of N in neighboring cells.</p><p>To explore further when <italic>neur </italic>acts autonomously or nonautonomously, other aspects of retinal N signaling were also examined. During ommatidial development, Notch signaling breaks the symmetry of the R3/R4 pair. Dl from R3 activates N in R4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. <italic>neur </italic>mutant cells were five times as likely to take R4 fate as R3 fate. Thus <italic>neur </italic>was important for the nonautonomous signaling activity of Dl from the R3 cell but not required autonomously for activity of N in the R4 cell. Only rarely can a <italic>neur </italic>mutant R3 cell activate N in a neighboring R4 cell, but <italic>neur </italic>R4 cells can be activated in response to wild type R3 cells.</p><p>Further data from abnormally constructed ommatidia that were not included in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> support the importance of <italic>neur </italic>in R3. These were ommatidia where the R3/R4 pair remained symmetrical. 17 symmetrical ommatidia were found with two R3 cells in place of R3/R4(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In 3 such ommatidia both R3-like cells were mutant for <italic>neur </italic>(another ommatidium with <italic>neur </italic>mutant R3 and R4 cells developed asymmetrically and is included in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In 13 of the other 14 cases the cell in the location that should normally have become R3 was <italic>neur </italic>mutant; in a single case the cell positioned to become R4 was <italic>neur </italic>mutant. These symmetrical ommatidia indicate that when R3 cells lack <italic>neur </italic>function, the neighboring cell receives insufficient Dl signaling to take R4 fate and instead is transformed into a second R3.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Mosaic analysis of <italic>neur </italic></bold>A,B show phase-contrast micrographs of sections through eyes containing <italic>neur </italic>homozygous cells. The mutant cells lack pigment granules, which in photoreceptor cells are normally seen as dark bodies at the base of the rhabdomere.

N is activated in R7 precursors by Dl from neighboring R1 and R6 cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. R1 and R6 act redundantly but if both R1 and R6 are <italic>Dl </italic>mutant then the R7 precursor adopts R1/6-like morphology. R7 was frequently <italic>neur </italic>mutant in normally-constructed ommatidia, so <italic>neur </italic>was not essential in the R7 precursor cell (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). R1 and R6 were never both mutant for <italic>neur </italic>in normal ommatidia. One ommatidium was found in which both R1 and R6 were <italic>neur </italic>mutant. In this ommatidium the cell in the R7 position was wild type for <italic>neur </italic>but had R1/6-like morphology(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>neur</italic>, like <italic>Dl</italic>, is not required for N activity in the R7 cell itself. <italic>neur </italic>may be required nonautonomously in R1 and R6 for proper R7 specification.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that cis-inactivation can occur during specification of bristle precursor cells in the epidermis and of R8 cells in the eye, as has been observed during Notch function in other settings. Overexpression of either Dl or Ser causes neurogenic phenotypes by inhibiting N signaling cell autonomously in cells that would otherwise take non-neural fates. Ser had greater effect than Dl, even when transcriptional and translational controls were similar. This quantitative difference depended on the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the proteins, as did other ligand properties such as compartmental specificity during wing development and movement of the morphogenetic furrow. The intracellular domains appeared not to confer any specificity. Previous work had already shown that lack of Ser paracrine activity in the dorsal wing compartment depended on the N-terminal DSL domain and was overcome by replacing the DSL with comparable Dl sequences, but other differences between Dl and Ser had not been mapped to internal or external domains[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>It is notable that no loss of bristles or R8 cells was observed when Dl or Ser were overexpressed. The favored bristle precursor cell even seems able to differentiate in genetic mosaics where nearby cells overexpress ligands but the bristle precursor cell does not(see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This supports the view that Notch ligands are not sufficient for N activation, at least in neural cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Insensitivity of neural cells to lateral inhibition may be a factor in their specification[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. (We have recently found a particular UAS-Dl transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] that does lead to loss of some R8 precursor cells when overexpressed in the eye posterior to the morphogenetic furrow; thus the sensitivity of R8 cells to Dl may be greatly reduced but not zero).</p><p>Cis-inactivation might be the mechanism by which particular cells escape N activity and take neural fate. During eye development <italic>Dl </italic>function is required in the neural R8 cell[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and we confirm here that both R8 and bristle specification are susceptible to cis-inactivation if ligand expression is high enough.</p><p>Two observations challenge the notion that neural cells are protected by cis-inactivation. One is that Ser appears a much more potent cis-inactivator of eye and bristle development than Dl does. Only the strongest of 52 transgenic lines with the Dl extracellular domain cis-inactivated consistently (as does a UAS-Dl line from another laboratory). Yet Dl, not Ser, is the more important ligand during normal bristle and R8 specification[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The second, related point is that the levels of Dl protein that begin to cause cis-inactivation are much higher than those expressed during normal development(see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2S,2T</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that cis-inactivation is important in some tissues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] but only occurs in others as an overexpression phenomenon.</p><p>An important caveat is that our experiments assess cis-inactivation in cells taking non-neural fates, where N is normally active, and may not reflect the situation in future neural cells, where cis-inactivation would be hypothesized to occur in normal development. Several studies already show that neural cells are less sensitive to paracrine N activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>](this work). Perhaps neural cells are also more sensitive to cis-inactivation.</p><p>One difference between future neural and non-neural cells that might render neural cells more sensitive to cis-inhibition may be activity of the Dl-ubiquitin ligase encoded by <italic>neuralized</italic>. If <italic>neur </italic>antagonized cis-inactivation in non-neural cells, as one view suggested[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], then one would expect <italic>neur </italic>to be dispensable in neural R8 cells but required in the R8 cells' inhibited neighbors. By contrast we found that <italic>neur </italic>was required by the neural R8 precursor cells, just as Dl is[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Our result suggests that <italic>neur </italic>and Dl are required in R8 to promote N activity in the surrounding cells. One caveat to our conclusion is that we cannot track the adult fates of all the cells surrounding R8 at the time of R8 specification, so it is formally possible that <italic>neur </italic>might play an autonomous role in some non-neural cells, as well as the nonautonomous role we demonstrate in R8 cells. <italic>neur </italic>is not required for Dl expression (or for N), although in the absence of <italic>neur </italic>more Dl protein levels are elevated and predominantly at the cell surface[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Our sections also allowed us to determine the role of <italic>neur </italic>in R3/4 specification and in R7 specification, and in both cases we again found that <italic>neur </italic>acted nonautonomously, like Dl. A subtle distinction was noted between the requirement for <italic>neur </italic>and the requirement for <italic>Dl</italic>. Both are required in R3 for R4 specification. Whereas loss of either <italic>Dl </italic>or <italic>neur </italic>from R3 causes the presumptive R4 cell to adopt the default R3 cell fate, <italic>Dl </italic>mutant R3 cells are then directed to R4 fate by their newly-transformed R3 neighbor, creating a chirally-reversed ommatidium. In contrast some <italic>neur </italic>mutant R3 cells are not directed to R4 fate, leading to symmetric ommatidia with two R3-like cells. It is unlikely that <italic>neur </italic>is required directly for R3 cells to take R4 fate, since <italic>neur </italic>is not required autonomously for R4 to take R4 fate. One possibility is that in addition to <italic>neur </italic>and <italic>Dl </italic>being required in R3 to make R4 into R4, <italic>Dl </italic>but not <italic>neur </italic>is also required in R3 to prevent R3 becoming R4. Arguing against this model, <italic>Dl </italic>overexpression in both R3 and R4 leads to ommatidia with two R4 cells, not two R3 cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. An alternative explanation makes use of the observation that <italic>neur </italic>is not required for all <italic>Dl </italic>signaling[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>](eg although neur mutant cells take R4 fate at much reduced frequency, single <italic>Dl </italic>mutant cells never do). When R3 is <italic>neur </italic>mutant, residual <italic>Dl </italic>signaling may permit the R3-like cell developing in place of R4 to retain the R4-property of not activating N in R3.</p><p>Our results indicate that during eye development <italic>neur </italic>and Dl are required nonautonomously to promote N activity in the surrounding cells, as is thought to occur around wing margin sensilla and during fate acquisition within neural lineages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The zebrafish gene <italic>mindbomb </italic>similarly encodes a Dl-ubiquitin ligase that acts cell nonautonomously in neurogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. These findings do not support the notion that <italic>neur </italic>antagonizes cis-inactivation to promote N activity in non-neural cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Neur expression predominantly in neural bristle precursor cells is also more consistent with the nonautonomous role promoting paracrine signaling by Dl. During eye development <italic>neur </italic>is more generally expressed in most cells of the R8 proneural group[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, our results raise significant challenges to the hypothesis that neural and non-neural fates are distinguished by ligand-dependent cis-inactivation that blocks N activity in neural precursor cells. High overexpression levels were required to achieve cis-inactivation in tissues where neural cells are insensitive to paracrine Notch activation, and we showed that this was not due to <italic>neur </italic>antagonizing cis-inactivation in non-neural cells, as had been proposed. Our data do not rule out the possibility that cis-inactivation does occur at endogenous ligand expression levels, if some mechanism exists to promote this specifically in neural cells. Other genes that modulate the specification of R8 cells and bristle precursors seem poor candidates for such a mechanism, however. For example proteins encoded by the <italic>scabrous </italic>and <italic>gp150 </italic>genes act to promote N signaling, but do so through the endosomes of non-neural cells, and so could not contribute directly to cis-inactivation or <italic>neur </italic>function in neural cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The Ser cDNA clone was a gift of R.
