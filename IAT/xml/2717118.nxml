In accordance with this, proteases were mostly thought of as promoters of carcinogenesis. However, clinical trials where cancer patients were treated with broad-range protease inhibitors have shown that proteases can act as tumour suppressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Studies using loss-of-function animal models have further confirmed the existence of extra-cellular proteases with anti-tumour properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Prostasin is a relatively unknown extracellular serine protease suspected to play a role as tumour suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Prostasin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored trypsin-like protease expressed in most epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is to some degree shed from the membrane and found as a soluble enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The proteolytical activity of prostasin can be inhibited by protease nexin-1 (PN-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] also known as glia-derived nexin (GDN) or serpin E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and by the two isoforms of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1), probably originating from two mRNA splice variants of <italic>HAI-1</italic>, here denoted <italic>HAI-1A</italic>, and <italic>HAI-1B </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. HAI-1B differs from HAI-1A by a 16-amino acid insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Prostasin is part of the matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade regulating terminal epidermal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Matriptase is thought to be the first protease in the cascade due to its ability to auto-activate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and because prostasin is activated by a matriptase-catalysed cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The downstream target for prostasin is unclear but the matriptase-prostasin cascade eventually regulate the processing of the differentiation marker filaggrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and is essential for establishment of epidermal integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It has furthermore been shown that prostasin can activate the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and cleave the epidermal growth factor receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] but may very well also have other substrates. Matriptase and prostasin share the same inhibitors, as both are inhibited by HAI-1A, HAI-1B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and PN-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Using transgenic mice it has been shown that deregulated matriptase causes carcinogenesis. Even a modest over-expression of matriptase in the skin of transgenic mice caused spontaneous squamous cell carcinoma in 70% of the mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Simultaneous over-expression of the matriptase inhibitor HAI-1 completely negated the oncogenic effects of matriptase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although not known it is unlikely that the oncogenic properties of matriptase are exerted via activation of prostasin as prostasin over-expression has been shown to cause reduced <italic>in vitro </italic>invasiveness in both prostate and mammary cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and high <italic>prostasin </italic>mRNA levels correlates with longer survival for gastric cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Prostasin is expressed in most epithelial cells and could potentially play a role in most types of cancer. Prostasin has been shown to be down-regulated in gastric cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The enzymatic activity of prostasin may be regulated by several mechanisms one of them being by regulating the mRNA expression levels of its inhibitors PN-1, HAI-1A, and HAI-1B. Elevated PN-1 levels have been found in pancreatic, breast and oral cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. PN-1 does not seem to be a specific inhibitor for prostasin and matriptase as it also inhibits thrombin, trypsin, plasmin and plasminogen activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and functions as a neurite growth promoting factor in neuroblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. HAI-1A and HAI-1B are also non specific inhibitors for prostasin and matriptase as they also inhibit hepatocyte growth factor activator and trypsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. No physiological difference between HAI-1A and HAI-1B has been found. We have previously observed that the <italic>HAI-1 </italic>mRNA levels are decreased during colorectal cancer carcinogenesis in both normal and affected tissue from individuals with colorectal cancer adenomas and carcinomas as compared to healthy individuals using an assay that does not differentiate between <italic>HAI-1A </italic>and <italic>HAI-1B </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Likewise HAI-1 has been shown to be down-regulated in renal cell carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and in gastric and colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we have investigated the mRNA levels of <italic>prostasin </italic>and its inhibitors <italic>PN-1</italic>, <italic>HAI-1A</italic>, <italic>and HAI-1B</italic>, during colorectal cancer carcinogenesis in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subject population</title><p>The KAM cohort (Kolorektal cancer, Arv og Milj&#x000f8;) is based on the screening group of the Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention study (the NORCCAP study) in the county of Telemark, Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Additionally, a series of colorectal cancer cases were recruited to the KAM cohort from routine clinical work at Telemark Hospital in Skien and Ulleval University Hospital in Oslo. The ID number for the NORCCAP study at Clinicaltrials.gov is NCT00119912 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the NORCCAP study a total of 20,780 men and women, age distribution 50&#x02013;64 years, drawn randomly from the population registries in Oslo (urban) and the county of Telemark (mixed urban and rural) were invited to have a flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening examination with or without (1:1) an additional faecal occult blood test (FOBT). 777 (4%) individuals were excluded according to exclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The KAM biobank currently consists of 234 colorectal cancer cases, 1044 cases with adenomas (229 high-risk, 762 low-risk and 53 hyperplastic polyps) and 400 controls. Controls were defined as individuals with normal findings at the time of FS. The KAM study is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics and the Norwegian Data Inspectorate. In the present study we have analyzed cases with carcinoma (n = 116), cases with adenoma (n = 106) and controls that were polyp-free at time of FS (n = 23). Each case was classified according to the degree of malignancy in the lesion. For individuals with adenoma a sample of control tissue was collected 30 cm from the anus. Control samples from healthy individuals were taken from individuals, where no adenomas or carcinomas could be identified with FS. The histology of the adenomas was examined independently by two histopathologists to categorize the degree of dysplasia as either mild/moderate (n = 93) or severe (n = 13). They reached consensus in all cases. Cases of dysplasia were also classified as either low- or high-risk according to the size and/or differentiation state of the adenoma. A high-risk adenoma is defined as an adenoma measuring more than 10 mm in diameter and/or with villous components or showing severe dysplasia. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].

There was also a significant difference when normal and affected tissue from the same individual were compared for individuals with mild/moderate dysplasia (p &#x0003c; 0.001), severe dysplasia (p &#x0003c; 0.01), and for colorectal cancer both compared to the normal distant (p &#x0003c; 0.05) and to the normal adjacent sample (p &#x0003c; 0.01).

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were immunohistochemically co-stained for prostasin and HAI-I. In normal colorectal tissue, prostasin was detected mainly on the apical plasma membrane &#x02013; with only minor staining of the basolateral plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). HAI-1 was found mainly on the basolateral plasma membrane mostly not co-localizing with prostasin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). This is consistent with previous findings which showing that prostasin is located primarily on the apical plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and mostly secreted from the apical side of polarized epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Likewise previous findings show that HAI-1 is located primarily on the basolateral plasma membrane of a range of polarized epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In some colorectal cancer tissue specimens we found a similar polarized apical staining of prostasin and basolateral staining of HAI-1 as seen in histologically normal tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E, F, G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>). In contrast prostasin and HAI-1 were co-localizing in other colorectal cancer tissue specimens all along the cell periphery suggesting that the polarization of the cells has been lost during carcinogenesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4L, J, K</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4L</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Prostasin and HAI-1 are located on the apical and the basolateral side, respectively in normal tissue and some colorectal cancer tissue specimens whereas they are co-localized in other colorectal cancer tissues specimens</bold>.

It has previously been shown that over-expression of prostasin in mammary and prostate cancer cells reduces the invasive properties of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and that high prostasin expression in gastric tumours is associated with longer survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It could thus be speculated that the transition from severe dysplasia to cancer is accompanied by a transcriptional decrease in prostasin expression and/or a down-regulation of prostasin activity via up regulation of one or more enzymatic inhibitors of prostasin. In the present study we found modest but significantly lower levels of <italic>prostasin </italic>mRNA in mild/moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia and colorectal cancer tissues combined as compared to corresponding normal tissues from healthy individuals. In a previous study a similar minor but significant down-regulation was seen when comparing normal and affected tissue from gastric cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our results do not show any transcriptional down-regulation of <italic>prostasin </italic>accompanying the transition between severe dysplasia and colorectal cancer. However, the mRNA levels of the inhibitor of prostasin, <italic>PN-1 </italic>increase at both the transition between normal tissue and mild/moderate dysplasia and again at the transition between severe dysplasia and colorectal cancer.</p><p>For PN-1 to be a physiologically relevant inhibitor of prostasin it is required that PN-1 and prostasin have physical access to each other. PN-1 belongs to the serpin family of secretory proteins. We have previously shown that five other members of the serpin family are secreted to both the apical and the basolateral side of the polarized epithelial cell line, MDCK, albeit at different ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Similar results were obtained for the Caco-2 cell line, derived from a human colonic adenocarcinoma (Vogel et al., unpublished results). There are therefore no indications that PN-1 in the extracellular fluid has restricted access to plasma membrane-bound prostasin. Consequently, it is possible that PN-1 plays an important role in down-regulating the enzymatic activity of prostasin in cancer tissue resulting in more invasive cell behaviour.</p><p>Prostasin is inhibited not only by PN-1 but also by HAI-1A and HAI-1B. We have previously shown that the level of <italic>HAI-1 </italic>mRNA is decreased by 3-fold during colorectal cancer carcinogenesis using an assay that does not distinguish between <italic>HAI-1A </italic>and <italic>HAI-1B </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the present study we have shown that <italic>HAI-1A </italic>and <italic>HAI-1B </italic>have expression patterns virtually identical and indistinguishable from the expression pattern of <italic>HAI-1 </italic>previously found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and that the ratio of <italic>HAI-1A/HAI-1B </italic>remains the same in all tissues investigated during colorectal cancer carcinogenesis. Therefore, the splicing of <italic>HAI-1 </italic>mRNA is not regulated during carcinogenesis. In the present study we found limited co-localization of prostasin and HAI-1 in normal tissue, as HAI-1 is located mainly on the basolateral plasma membrane and prostasin is located on the apical plasma membrane. This probably does not mean that their interactions is limited due to physical separation as we have previously shown that HAI-1 is transcytosed from the basolateral plasma membrane to the apical plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is thus possible that HAI-1 interacts with prostasin at the apical plasma membrane.</p><p>The enzymatic activity of prostasin is influenced both by the levels of PN-1, HAI-1A and HAI-1B and probably also by the expression levels of other as yet undiscovered inhibitors of prostasin. The relative physiological importance of PN-1, HAI-1A and HAI-1B as inhibitors of prostasin is at present unclear. PN-1 is an inhibitor of not only prostasin, but also of uPA, tPA, thrombin, plasmin, trypsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and matriptase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and it forms an essentially non-reversible binding to its target protease like most other serpins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Apart from physical accessibilities, the relative abundances of other target proteases may become an important issue as an abundant target for PN-1 may "quench" a large amount of PN-1 by forming a non-reversible complex with it. However, the co-purification of prostasin in complex with PN-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] suggests that PN-1, at least to some degree plays a role as an inhibitor of prostasin <italic>in vivo</italic>. Likewise prostasin-HAI-1B complexes have been purified from a cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], suggesting that it is a physiologically relevant inhibitor of prostasin. Further knowledge about the binding kinetics between the proteases and their inhibitors is needed to clarify the relative importance of PN-1 and HAI-1 isoforms as inhibitors of prostasin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Proteases have for a long time been thought to play an important role in the growth of cells both during tissue remodelling and invasive growth. However, the action of proteases may be regulated not necessarily by the expression of the protease but by regulating the expression of its inhibitors. Our data shows that elevated mRNA levels for prostasins inhibitor, <italic>PN-1</italic>, coincides with acquisition of malignant properties, whereas the mRNA level of <italic>prostasin </italic>is relative stable during colorectal cancer carcinogenesis. However, further investigations are necessary to understand the role of prostasin, PN-1, HAI-1A and HAI-1B for invasive growth and malignant progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LV conceived the idea of the study.
