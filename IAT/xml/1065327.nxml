The cells were isolated from human articular cartilage obtained at surgery and were cultured in the absence or presence of ET-1 with or without inhibitors of protein kinase or LY83583 (an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase and of cGMP). MMP-1, MMP-13 and NO levels were then measured by ELISA and Griess reaction, respectively. Additionally, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and phosphorylated forms of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, p44/42, stress-activated protein kinase/Jun-N-terminal kinase and serine-threonine Akt kinase were determined by western blot. Results show that ET-1 greatly increased MMP-1 and MMP-13 production, iNOS expression and NO release. LY83583 decreased the production of both metalloproteases below basal levels, whereas the inhibitor of p38 kinase, SB202190, suppressed ET-1-stimulated production only. Similarly, the ET-1-induced NO production was partially suppressed by the p38 kinase inhibitor and was completely suppressed by the protein kinase A kinase inhibitor KT5720 and by LY83583, suggesting the involvement of these enzymes in relevant ET-1 signalling pathways. In human osteoarthritis chondrocytes, ET-1 controls the production of MMP-1 and MMP-13. ET-1 also induces NO release via iNOS induction. ET-1 and NO should thus become important target molecules for future therapies aimed at stopping cartilage destruction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>endothelin-1</kwd><kwd>metalloproteases</kwd><kwd>nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>signalling pathways</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis constitutes a major structural change in the joint, which may severely impair its function and cause pain and disability. This degradation is accompanied by the release in the synovial fluid of degraded matrix constituents that primarily result from an increased matrix catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Various factors are directly involved in this process. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor and promitogen peptide for many cell types, including chondrocytes, was recently identified as one such factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>ET-1 binds to the specific endothelin A or endothelin B receptors expressed on chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and triggers a cascade of intracellular events, including phospholipase C activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], an increase in intracellular calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], prostaglandin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and nitric oxide (NO) release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The effect of ET-1 on DNA and protein synthesis in chondrocytes is biphasic. The potent initial stimulatory effect of ET-1 decreases progressively with time and is followed by an inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The inhibitory effect seems to be mediated by NO and cGMP, both produced in response to ET-1 stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Additionally, we have recently demonstrated that ET-1 is significantly increased locally in OA cartilage and synovial membrane when compared with normal tissues. In OA cartilage, ET-1 is involved in cartilage catabolism through metalloprotease (MMP) regulation and the induction of type II collagen breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>MMPs are a family of structurally related zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases classified into subgroups of collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, membrane-type MMPs and other MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. When activated, MMPs degrade a broad spectrum of substrates, including collagens and other matrix macromolecules. As a whole, MMPs play an important role in the extracellular matrix remodelling that occurs under physiological and pathological conditions. Among all the MMPs, we have recently demonstrated an induction in the synthesis, secretion and activation of two collagenases (MMP-1 and MMP-13) by ET-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These MMPs play an active role in the progression of OA pathology as they are the most effective at initiating collagen destruction during the inflammatory process and the remodelling phase of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Another deleterious agent in joint cartilage is the NO radical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which downregulates DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and matrix synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and upregulates matrix degradation via increased MMP synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Indeed, inhibition of NO production was shown to slow down the progression of OA. It has been demonstrated that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, NO could also upregulate MMP synthesis and activity in joint chondrocytes and cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. <italic>In vivo </italic>in an OA animal model, selective inhibition of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) provides a protective effect on OA joint tissues more specifically in regard to the degradation of the extracellular matrix and the downregulation of MMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was to further investigate the role of ET-1 in human OA chondrocytes, focusing on NO, MMP-1 and MMP-13 production as well as the relevant signalling pathways activated by ET-1 in human OA chondrocytes in regard to these factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Specimens</title><p>Human cartilage was obtained with the consent of 12 OA patients (mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean age, 58 &#x000b1; 6 years) undergoing total knee replacement.

Tissue specimens were embedded in paraffin, were sectioned and stained with Safranin O and fast green, and were evaluated using the Mankin histological/histochemical scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Only tissues corresponding to a moderate degree of OA severity (Mankin 3&#x02013;7) were included in this study.

The ELISA assay (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Baie d'Urf&#x000e9;, QC, Canada) for MMP-1 specifically detected the total human MMP-1 (i.e. active MMP-1, the latent enzyme and the enzyme complexed with inhibitors such as tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 1). The sensitivity of this assay is 1.7 ng/ml, and there is no significant cross-reactivity or interference with MMP-3, MMP-2 and MMP-9. The MMP-13 ELISA assay (R&#x00026;D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) is a monoclonal polyclonal-based assay specific for both the active and latent MMP-13.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> shows that ET-1 greatly stimulated NO production and was released in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubation with increasing concentrations of ET-1, from 0.1 to 100 nM, augmented almost 12-fold the linear accumulation of NO. To determine the mechanism involved in the ET-1-induced NO production, the effects of the major intracellular signalling pathways were investigated. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> shows that the ET-1-induced NO release was significantly inhibited by p38 inhibition and prevented by KT5720, a PKA inhibitor. No significant effect was noted for MEK1/2 inhibition by PD98059 and by Wortmannin. Moreover, the guanylate cyclase inhibitor LY83583 reduced the NO production as significant differences were found when compared with either the ET-1 stimulation (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) or with the control (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05), and this inhibitor also decreased both the endogenous and ET-1-induced iNOS level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). The ET-1-induced NO release occurs via iNOS as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>: complete inhibition of iNOS by 50 &#x003bc;M allosteric iNOS inhibitor L-NIL, as expected, almost completely inhibited NO release. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref> shows the effects of various inhibitors on iNOS expression, as determined by western blot analysis of cell extracts. The 24-hour incubation of cells with ET-1 results in an increase of iNOS protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>, lane 2).

ET-1 at 10 nM induced p38, Akt, p44/42, and SAP/JNK phosphorylation in a time-ordered manner. For p38, the maximal effect following cell exposure to ET-1 was obtained at 10 min. For Akt, the maximal effect was observed at 2 min of cell exposure and this effect persisted during 30 min, followed by a decline at 45 min. At this time (45 min), both p38 kinase and Akt phosphorylated forms were diminished. The maximal effect was obtained at 15 min for p44/42 kinase and at 45 min for SAP/JNK.

This result goes beyond previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which showed that human OA synovial tissue and joint cartilage express the ET-1 gene and overproduce ET-1, resulting in an excessive synthesis of MMP-1 and MMP-13 in the same tissues. In addition, the result goes beyond these findings and enlightens on the mechanism by which ET-1 accomplishes this action. Strong evidence was obtained for the key role played by NO, whose production and release were also upregulated by ET-1.</p><p>NO induces smooth muscle cell relaxation by activating soluble guanylate cyclase and by increasing the intracellular concentration of cGMP. LY83583 suppresses the effect of NO by inhibiting this NO-dependent production of cGMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the present study, LY83583 was also shown to strongly inhibit MMP-1 and MMP-13 production by unstimulated and ET-1-stimulated OA chondrocytes, showing the key role of cGMP for the synthesis of these enzymes. This finding confirms a previous observation that cGMP is necessary for protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and brings further evidence that an excess of NO is harmful to cells.</p><p>It is generally accepted that progressive tissue destruction in rheumatoid arthritis and in OA results from an excessive breakdown mediated by various proteolytic enzymes and other catabolic agents such as free radicals and NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our results suggest that ET-1 should also be added to the list of potential deleterious agents that may account for articular cartilage destruction in rheumatic diseases. The action of ET-1 seems to be dual via an increase in MMP and NO production. ET-1-induced stimulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13, as well as the induction of iNOS gene expression with subsequent NO overproduction by OA chondrocytes, may interfere with the proinflammatory cytokine pathways. Indeed, we and other workers have shown that IL-1&#x003b2; upregulates the synthesis of ET-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], which in turn can induce IL-1&#x003b2; gene transcription and consequently the production of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] that MMP-13 expression was induced similarly by ET-1 and IL-1&#x003b2;; however, although they both enhanced MMP-1 expression, the effect of IL-1&#x003b2; was more potent on this enzyme. Interestingly, using a specific immunoassay measuring the C telopeptide of type II collagen fragments on OA cartilage explants, we also found that the level of the cleaved collagen fragments were significantly increased in the presence of both IL-1&#x003b2; and ET-1 with a more potent effect observed for ET-1. This could be explained by a putative synergy between ET-1 and IL-1&#x003b2; as ET-1 induces IL-1&#x003b2; and as IL-1&#x003b2; has a positive feedback on ET-1 synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>NO is an important signalling molecule at physiological concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but when overproduced via iNOS gene activation it is toxic to cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. NO triggers the transcription of several proinflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], interacts with the cysteine residues of many proteins (S nitrosylation) and may alter their structure and function. In the presence of the superoxide anion, NO generates peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radicals that are cytotoxic, inducing peroxidation of lipids and damaging other molecules, such as DNA, and matrix macromolecules. This finally results in the inhibition of many cellular processes that impair the capacity of the cells to synthesize matrix macromolecules and to repair damaged tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the findings already discussed, the present study sheds more light on the major signalling pathways involved in the ET-1-induced MMP-1 and MMP-13 production and in NO production. In OA chondrocytes, ET-1 seems to stimulate the production of these enzymes through activation of, at least, two kinases, p38 MAP kinase and PKA. As shown by western blot analysis of the cell extracts, incubation of cells for a short period of time with ET-1 results in the phosphorylation of p38 MAP, p44/42, SAP/JNK and Akt kinases. This effect occurs within minutes following a challenge with ET-1, and disappears after 45 and 60 min for the p-38 and SAP/JNK kinases, respectively. The activation of these kinases is probably necessary for the induction by ET-1 of MMP-1 production and MMP-13 production. The inhibition of p38 kinase is associated with a suppression of the ET-1-induced stimulation of both enzymes, whereas the inhibitions of adenyl cyclase-dependent PKA kinase is associated with a partial suppression of the ET-1-induced stimulation of MMP-13 production only. This suggests that these inhibitors are specific for the ET-1-activated pathways since they do not affect the basal levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13.</p><p>Another point also deserves consideration. Tardif and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] have described two OA chondrocyte populations distinctive by their MMP-13 content and their response to IL-1&#x003b2;. One population contains small amounts of MMP-13 protein and is highly sensitive to IL-1&#x003b2; stimulation; the other population is enriched in MMP-13 protein but poorly responds to the cytokine. The cell heterogeneity of OA cartilage may explain some variability of the results observed in our study, particularly in the case of using low doses of the MEK1/2 inhibition followed by ET-1 stimulation. In fact, when MAP kinase pathways (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, JNK and p38) are activated in chondrocytes, their inhibition is dependent of the inhibitor concentration used, particularly for SB 203580 and PD 98059 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. PD 98059, which had no effect in the present study at the concentration of 10 &#x003bc;M on ET-1-induced iNOS expression and NO production, was demonstrated in other studies to suppress NO induction in human chondrocytes, as shown by Gemba and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase by ET-1 was also described in osteoblast-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and in cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], while in chondrocytes overproducing MMP-1 and MMP-13 this MAP kinase was shown to be phosphorylated principally by IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Activation of PKA was shown to be required for the upregulation of iNOS, and for the subsequent production and release of NO by several cell types such as vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and human macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It is also associated with the cytokine-induced NO production in human OA articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our results suggest that the activation of PKA is also required for the ET-1-induced upregulation of iNOS and for subsequent production of NO by human OA chondrocytes. However, PKA activation seems to be less required for the ET-1-induced upregulation of MMP-13 and not at all necessary for the upregulation of MMP-1 since the inhibition of PKA with KT5720 does not affect the ET-1-induced overproduction of this enzyme. In the present study, subtle differences are shown in the pattern of inhibition of the ET-1-induced overproduction of MMP-1 and MMP-13. The effect of ET-1 on MMP-13 production was more sensitive to the inhibitors of protein kinases than on MMP-1 production. As suggested earlier, these variable responses point to possible different cell populations producing these two enzymes or to relevant signalling pathways eliciting the ET-1-induced stimulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>We also tested the hypothesis that ET-1 may act in OA through induction of apoptosis. This was based on the findings that cells of the superficial layer disappear during cartilage degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], that ET-1 is preferentially produced in this layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and that NO may induce apoptosis and cell death at high concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Indeed, chondrocyte death may represent one of the contributing factors in cartilage destruction. However, as shown in the present study, ET-1 does not appear to induce chondrocyte apoptosis or cell death. Using the TUNEL technique (which was recently shown to detect both apoptosis and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]), and using Bcl2 and Bad protein determination, no differences were found between ET-1-treated cultures and control cultures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study shows that ET-1 causes an overproduction of NO, MMP-1 and MMP-13 in human OA chondrocytes. The signalling pathway used by ET-1 in these cells was also demonstrated. The fact that ET-1 possesses the biological properties described acknowledges this peptide as an important catabolic factor contributing to the cartilage destruction via induction of the deleterious molecules such as MMPs and NO. NO seems to be a key molecule that is produced in parallel with the ET-1-induced overproduction of the MMPs. Blocking the effects of ET-1 may thus become a useful therapeutic approach aimed at stopping cartilage destruction in rheumatic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ET-1 = endothelin-1; FCS = foetal calf serum; IL = interleukin; iNOS = inducible nitric oxide synthase; L-NIL = L-N<sup>6</sup>(1-iminoethyl)lysine; MAP = mitogen-activated protein; MEK1/2 = mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2; MMP = metalloprotease; NO = nitric oxide; OA = osteoarthritis; PKA = protein kinase A; SAP/JNK = stress-activated protein kinase/Jun-N-terminal kinase; TUNEL = terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-medulated dUTP nick end labelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare there are no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CAM executed the study, contributed to the preparation of the manuscript and performed statistical analysis.
