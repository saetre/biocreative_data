To detect Lewis y/CIC and MUC1/CIC, ELISA tests were developed; serum samples containing MUC1 were previously selected by Cancer Associated Serum Antigen (CASA). Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed in 9 malignant, benign and normal samples and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Lewis y and MUC1 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

In order to decrease mortality and to improve treatment, prevention and early detection biomarkers are object of study. In this sense, it is very important to increase knowledge about tumor biology, which includes studies on risk factors, tumor development, dissemination and metastasis.</p><p>There is sufficient evidence that blood group related Lewis antigens are tumor-associated molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Changes in the structure of glycan chains covalently attached to glycoproteins and glycolipids are a common feature of progression to malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In O-linked glycosylation, the glycans are added to serine and threonine hydroxyl groups. Initiation of O-glycosylation in the mammary gland begins in the Golgi apparatus, is catalysed by a family of enzymes which transfer N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from UDP-GalNAc (UDP-GalNAc polypeptide glycosyltransferases) to selected serine or threonine residues in protein chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. After the addition of GalNAc, various core structures are formed by the addition of different sugars. The terminal epitopes of the O-glycans on mucins are probably the most important determining whether the molecule plays a role in cell adhesion phenomena. The epitopes recognized by antibodies related to the ABO and Lewis blood group antigens are found in this region. Terminal sugars added in alpha linkage include sialic acid, fucose, galactose, GalNAc and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Some sulphation of sugars in terminal structures may also occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Lewis y antigen is a difucosylated oligosaccharide with the chemical structure:</p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="1756-9966-28-121-i1.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>This molecule is expressed predominately during embryogenesis while in adults, expression is restricted to granulocytes and epithelial surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Lewis y and Lewis b antigens are over-expressed by breast, lung, colon, pancreas, prostate and ovarian cancers, either at the plasma membrane as a glycolipid or linked to surface receptors such as Erb-B family receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Sialyl-Lewis x and sialyl-Lewis a are complex carbohydrates which have been also found in breast carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Breast cancer cell glycans changes are related to glycoprotein antigenic differences between carcinoma and normal mammary gland cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This phenomenon has been extensively studied on MUC1 mucin where the aberrant glycosylation found in tumor cells indicates the appearance of novel glycan epitopes (e.g. STn) as well as the unmasking of peptide sequences (rev. in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). Lewis y oligosaccharides may be part of mucin glycoproteins, which have characteristic core peptide structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. MUC1, which is overexpressed in breast cancer, may contain Lewis y. This mucin has been involved in immune regulation, cell signaling, inhibition of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Glycan changes may be important to the induction of a humoral response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Cell-surface antigens (mainly carbohydrate antigens) have proved to be unexpectedly potent targets for immune recognition and attack against human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In a variety of different clinical settings, correlation of antibodies naturally acquired or vaccine induced with prognosis improvement is one of the bases for cancer vaccines designed primarily for antibody induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In tumor patients sera, it has been frequently found the occurrence of variation in circulating immune complexes' (CIC) levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although the overall composition of CIC varies quantitatively even for patients with the same malignancy, MUC1 has been described as a part of CIC associated with cancer including breast carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

In a previous report we found that Lewis &#x000d7; antigen was highly expressed by normal epithelial tissues of mammary gland and digestive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In order to continue the study of blood group related Lewis antigen involvement in breast cancer, we have focused this research on the difucosylated Lewis y antigen; this carbohydrate specifically belongs to the ABH Lewis blood group family which is overexpressed on the majority of carcinomas including ovary, pancreas, prostate, breast, colon and non small cell lung cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>We performed immunoprecipitation of MUC1 from breast cancer, benign and normal serum samples with HMFG1 MAb, directed against MUC1 peptide core (DTR) and isolated the glycoprotein. SDS-PAGE and Western blot assays were performed with the samples obtained by IP; nitrocellulose membrane incubation with C14 MAb showed the same MW band as incubation with HMFG1 MAb in breast cancer, benign and normal samples. These results indicate that Lewis y could be involved in MUC1 structure. Sikut et al. found that sialyl Lewis a and sialyl Lewis &#x000d7; epitopes were attached to MUC1 in breast cancer patients serum samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>During many years, the functions of Lewis y were mostly unknown although it was described as a differentiation and onco-developmental antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Basu et al. found that in colon and vulval carcinoma cell lines, sialylated Lewis a and Lewis y were present in the EGF receptor glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In the last decades, further information was achieved; in breast cancer cell lines, Hellstr&#x000f6;m et al. probed that MAbs reactive against Lewis y could be internalized and mediated tumor cell killing by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, sialylated Lewis a and Lewis y were related with apoptosis; in this sense, Rapoport and Le Pendu found in colon carcinoma cell lines such as HT29 in which apoptosis was induced by UV irradiation, TNF&#x003b1; and anti-Fas, a major decrease of this antigen as well as Lewis x [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. On the other hand, in Jurkat human T cell line, the expression of Lewis x and Lewis y was enhanced in the cell surface during apoptosis induced by different agents including anti-Fas antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Lewis y is attached to components of the CD66 cluster which is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (<underline>CEA</underline>) family and of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The activation-increase in Lewis y attached to CD66 adhesion molecules implicates a role of the Lewis y determinant in cytoadhesive properties of granulocytes on trafficking and inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>In cancer cells, Miyake et al have observed that MAbs which bind to Lewis y antigen, although cross-reacted with H and Lewis b, inhibited cell motility and tumor cell metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>We employed C14 MAb which recognizes circulating antigen in serum and tumor sections of patients bearing a variety of malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In this study by IHC, with this MAb, we found a positive reaction in 47.5% of breast tumor samples, showing a different pattern of expression among malignant, benign and normal samples; nevertheless; no statistically significant difference in percentage of expression was found. In cancer samples, we did not find any significant difference among different stages. Our results are in agreement with Madjd et al since they found that Le<sup>y/b </sup>is expressed in 44% of breast cancer samples, employing SC101 MAb although this MAb reacts with both Lewis y and Lewis b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, as it was not surprising, MUC1 was detected in all samples employing many anti-MUC1 antibodies (16); in consequence, correlation analysis was not necessary.</p><p>Klinger et al confirmed that the majority of cancer cells derived from epithelial tissue express Lewis y type difucosylated oligosaccharides on their plasma membranes; they have also found that ABL 364 MAb against this carbohydrate which is present in erbB receptor side chains are capable of inhibiting erbB receptor mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Other authors found a novel function for soluble Le<sup>y</sup>/H as an endothelial-selective and cytokine inducible as well as a potent angiogenic mediator in both in vitro and in vivo bioassays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Cancer antigens expressed at the cell surface are generally glycolipids or glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] which may express in their molecules blood group related Lewis antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The non appropriate biosynthesis or processing of carbohydrate structures may contribute to the disordered behaviour of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Lewis y carbohydrate may participate in natural humoral immune response; antibodies are ideally suited for eradicating pathogens from bloodstream and early tissue invasion. With regard to cancer cells, passively administered and vaccine induced antibodies have accomplished this concept, limiting tumor cells and systemic or intraperitoneal micrometastases in a variety of preclinical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Many protocols developing anti-Lewis y vaccines have been performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we found that Lewis y/IgM/CIC levels correlated with Lewis y/IgG/CIC levels and MUC1/CIC (IgG and IgM) levels and also that Lewis y/IgG/CIC levels correlated with MUC1/IgG/CIC levels. These correlations may be related with the fact that MUC1 may be a carrier of Lewis y epitope. Von Mensd&#x000f6;rff-Pouilly et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] found that naturally occurring MUC1 antibodies seem to check disease spread in breast cancer patients, possibly by destroying blood-borne isolated disseminated tumor cells (micrometastases) which eventually could lead to metastatic disease and death. Silk et al found significantly higher anti-MUC1 IgG levels in abnormal versus normal colorectal location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Correlation of antibodies, naturally acquired or vaccine-induced, with improved prognosis in a variety of different clinical settings is one of the bases for cancer vaccines designed for antibody induction. It is essential to ensure that immune responses against tumor antigens can destroy tumor cells but not normal ones. An important immune response against a tumor specific antigen would be irrelevant if a tumor cell mutates in such a way that it no longer expressed its specific antigen avoiding cells destruction by the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Therefore, it is remarkably outstanding to study the natural humoral immune response through immune complexes detection. With the aim of enhancing immune response in breast cancer patients, vaccines constructed with glycolipids or glycoproteins derivatives as immunogens are being developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>By IHC, tumor and tissue Lewis y and MUC1 expression was evaluated; although we did not find any statistically significant difference among malignant, benign and normal samples, the pattern of expression differed. Besides, no correlation between clinical pathological parameters (age, type, stage or grade) and IHC expression was found.</p><p>On the other hand, humoral immune response was studied measuring Lewis y/IgM/CIC levels and a statistically significant difference among breast cancer serum samples versus normal and benign specimens was found, being lower in cancer samples.</p><p>Our findings also support that, in breast cancer, Lewis y may be part of circulating MUC1 glycoform structure and that Lewis y/CIC do not correlate with Lewis y expression. This lack of correlation may be related to a limited humoral immune response against these molecules in cancer patients which could be due to the escape from the immunosurveillance of the host.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CIC: Circulating immune complexes; MUC1: Mucin 1; MAb: Monoclonal antibody; PBS: sodium phosphate buffer; PBST: sodium phosphate buffer/0.1% Tween 20; ELISA: enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; SDS-PAGE: sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; WB: western blot; IP: Immunoprecipitation</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MIL designed and constructed the ELISA and performed the manuscript.
