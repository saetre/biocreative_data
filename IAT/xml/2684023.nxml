Several RNAi screens have identified previously uncharacterised genes that are implicated in mammalian cell division. The molecular function for these genes needs to be investigated to place them into pathways. Phenotypic profiling is a useful method to assign putative functions to uncharacterised genes. Here, we show that the analysis of protein localisation is useful to refine a phenotypic profile. We show the utility of this approach by defining a function of the previously uncharacterised gene <italic>C13orf3</italic> during cell division. C13orf3 localises to centrosomes, the mitotic spindle, kinetochores, spindle midzone, and the cleavage furrow during cell division and is specifically phosphorylated during mitosis. Furthermore, C13orf3 is required for centrosome integrity and anaphase onset. Depletion by RNAi leads to mitotic arrest in metaphase with an activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and loss of sister chromatid cohesion. Proteomic analyses identify C13orf3 (Ska3) as a new component of the Ska complex and show a direct interaction with a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase PP2A. All together, these data identify C13orf3 as an important factor for metaphase to anaphase progression and highlight the potential of combined RNAi screening and protein localisation analyses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>esiRNA</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>shugoshin</kwd><kwd>Ska</kwd><kwd>spindle checkpoint</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell division and mitosis of eukaryotic somatic cells require the coordinated function of many proteins in a temporally and spatially well-orchestrated process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Nigg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Nasmyth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Varetti and Musacchio, 2008</xref>). Mitosis can be subdivided into different phases mainly depending on morphological features. The purpose of early mitosis from prophase to metaphase is the establishment of a bipolar spindle with all kinetochores attached amphitelic to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). Proper attachment and the creation of tension at the kinetochores are believed to be the key factors for silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Silencing of the SAC leads to the activation of the E3 ubiquitin&#x02013;protein ligase, APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sullivan and Morgan, 2007</xref>). The APC/C is a multiprotein complex composed of at least 12 subunits, of which, among others, the subunits Cdc16 and Cdc27 are crucial for its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Peters, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Thornton <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>); it promotes execution of anaphase by polyubiquitylation of its main substrates cyclin B1 and securin, thereby targeting them for destruction by the proteasome. Degradation of cyclin B1 results in a decrease in Cdk1 activity that is required for entry into the late phases of mitosis. Loss of securin allows activation of separase required for sister chromatid separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sullivan and Morgan, 2007</xref>). In vertebrate cells, arm cohesion is largely lost during prophase and prometaphase in a separase-independent pathway requiring polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and aurora kinase B (AurkB) activity to facilitate sister chromatid resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Waizenegger <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Watanabe, 2005</xref>). In contrast, centromeric cohesion is preserved until anaphase by the protein shugoshin-like 1 (SGOL1), which recruits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to centromeric cohesion, thereby counter-acting phosphorylation by Plk1.</p><p>Although parts of the genes and the mechanisms that guard mammalian cell division have been identified, others remain elusive. The complexity of mammalian cell division calls for a systems-level approach to understand the sophisticated interaction and regulation of proteins involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kittler <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Loss-of-function screening by RNAi is a valuable strategy for the systematic analysis of genes implicated in cell-cycle regulation, and different methods to carry out RNAi experiments in mammalian cells are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Sachse and Echeverri, 2004</xref>). We and others have developed and successfully utilised endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs (esiRNAs) as mediator for RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kittler <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Galvez <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Fazzio <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). As esiRNAs are highly specific, they are well suited for RNAi experiments, especially for large-scale RNAi screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kittler <italic>et al</italic>, 2007b</xref>). We conducted previously a genome-scale esiRNA screen on cell-cycle progression in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kittler <italic>et al</italic>, 2007a</xref>), which identified many previously uncharacterised genes implicated in this process. The use of multiparametric analysis in combination with hierarchical clustering allowed the placement of some of these genes into pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kittler <italic>et al</italic>, 2007a</xref>). However, it remains challenging to interpret multiparametric phenotypic data to build valid biological hypotheses, and for many uncharacterised genes the molecular role during cell division remains elusive.</p><p>Localisation is an independent indicator of gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2008b</xref>), which may provide valuable information in addition to loss-of-function data. Antibodies are useful to determine the localisation pattern of proteins, and are commercially available for many known cell-cycle proteins. However, generating antibodies for uncharacterised genes is time-consuming and cost-intensive. Tagging of genes with fluorescent proteins is a rapid and cost-effective alternative to antibodies, which also allows the dynamic localisation of proteins in living cells, and collections of tagged genes based on cDNA constructs have been assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Pepperkok and Ellenberg, 2006</xref>). However, expression of tagged genes from cDNA constructs can be problematic because the genomic context of the gene is not preserved. As a consequence, the gene is often expressed at nonphysiological levels, which can lead to mislocalisation of the protein. Recently, the TransgeneOmics approach has been developed to allow rapid tagging of many genes that preserves the genomic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Poser <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Using recombineering technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Muyrers <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) to tag genes, encoded on a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), allows the expression of genes close to the endogenous level. As a BAC usually contains all <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of the promoter, 3&#x02032;-UTR, and the coding region, the transgene maintains its physiological expression levels and splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Poser <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), a feature especially interesting for genes implicated in cell-cycle control.</p><p>To test whether localisation data help to refine phenotypic profiles, we exemplified the analysis of a subcluster derived from two RNAi screens that were enriched for known regulator proteins of mitosis by using the TransgeneOmics approach. We nominated the previously uncharacterised protein, C13orf3 (also known as Rama1), to exhibit a similar localisation pattern and phenotypic features to the protein Ska1 (spindle and kinetochore associated protein 1). A detailed characterisation identified a direct interaction of C13orf3 with members of the Ska complex, described as a two-component complex, composed of Ska1 (C18orf24) and Ska2 (Fam33a), with a critical role in the maintenance of the metaphase plate and progression through mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). We show here that C13orf3 (Ska3) is an integral part of the Ska complex and localises to the mitotic spindle, kinetochores, and cleavage furrow during mitosis. In addition, we show that C13orf3 is required for the maintenance of a bipolar spindle. Depletion of C13orf3 leads to an arrest in a metaphase-like state with an activation of the SAC and sister chromatid separation. These findings underline the importance of C13orf3 in the mitotic progression of mammalian cells and show that the combination of phenotypic profiling and localisation data improves the predictive power helping to identify pathways for genes with important roles during cell division.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Combining phenotypic profiling with protein localisation</title><p>To predict functions of previously uncharacterised genes, we started with a data set from a cell-cycle esiRNA screen carried out previously in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kittler <italic>et al</italic>, 2007a</xref>). In this screen, a genome-wide analysis of genes implicated in cell-cycle progression was carried out using DNA content analysis combined with laser-scanning cytometry providing statistical scores (<italic>z</italic>-scores) for cell-cycle progression phenotypes (i.e., cells in G1, S, G2/M phases and 8 N) for each knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kittler <italic>et al</italic>, 2007a</xref>). To refine this data set, we carried out a genome-wide RNAi viability screen in the same cell line providing <italic>z</italic>-scores for viability of 16,363 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Both data sets were combined for hierarchical clustering. All <italic>z</italic>-scores were converted into percentile ranks and these variables were used to build a hierarchical tree with an Euclidean metric, sorting the phenotypic data by similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). We chose a subcluster from this phenotypic tree, which was enriched for genes with well-established mitotic functions for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). This subcluster included known genes with important mitotic functions such as <italic>polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1)</italic>, <italic>wee1-like protein kinase (Wee1)</italic>, shugoshin-like protein 1 (SGOL1), <italic>centromere protein E (CENP-E)</italic>, <italic>kinetochore associated protein 2 (Kntc2, NDC80)</italic>, <italic>kinesin family member 11 (Eg5)</italic>, <italic>spindle and kinetochore associated protein 1 (Ska1)</italic>, and several tubulins, such as <italic>tubulin alpha 3 (TUBA1A)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The enrichment of mitosis-associated genes suggested that uncharacterised genes within this cluster might have an important role during cell division. To further refine the profile within this cluster, we determined the protein localisation in mitotic cells for known cell-cycle genes and previously uncharacterised genes using the BAC-based TransgeneOmics approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kittler <italic>et al</italic>, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Poser <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). BAC constructs maintain the genomic context of a gene and usually contain all <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements for gene expression. Furthermore, they typically integrate at low copy number, thereby allowing physiological expression of the tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kittler <italic>et al</italic>, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Poser <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). A modified version of the &#x02018;localisation and affinity purification' (LAP) tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cheeseman and Desai, 2005</xref>) consisting of an EGFP and an S-peptide sequence was used. The analysis of images from these BAC-transgenic HeLa cell lines during mitosis confirmed the known localisation of cell-cycle-relevant proteins such as CENP-E (kinetochores), SGOL1 (centromeres), Eg5 (centrosomes, mitotic spindle), and Ska1 (kinetochores, mitotic spindle) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), showing the utility of the TransgeneOmics approach. To improve the phenotypic profiling, we determined the localisation of 52 known and uncharacterised BAC-tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) from the subcluster comparing their localisation with each other to identify proteins with similar localisation patterns. Interestingly, the analysis of the uncharacterised protein, C13orf3, showed a spindle and kinetochore localisation during mitosis, most similar to the localisation pattern of Ska1 in the subcluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rines <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Although the phenotypic data alone were insufficient to link C13orf3 to Ska1, the combination with the localisation data predicted that Ska1 and C13orf3 might physically and/or genetically interact. To test this hypothesis, C13orf3 was selected for an in-depth analysis. Comparative sequence analysis identified putative <italic>C13orf3</italic> orthologues in mammals, birds, amphibians, and bony fish (e.g., mouse: ENSMUSG00000021965, chicken: ENSGALG00000017128, frog: ENSXETG00000009595, and zebrafish: ENSDARG00000067746, respectively), but not in invertebrates. Structure-based bioinformatics analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Sippl and Flockner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Godzik, 2003</xref>) identified a Gle2-binding sequence motif (GLEBS motif) at the C-terminal region of C13orf3 (aa 345&#x02013;382) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Interestingly, an additional putative GLEBS motif has been proposed in the N-terminal region (aa 17&#x02013;51) of C13orf3 by Gaitanos <italic>et al</italic> (E Nigg, personal communication, 2008). GLEBS motifs are present in Bub1 and BubR1 and have been structurally characterised to mediate binding to Bub3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Larsen <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), substantiating a potential role of C13orf3 in mitosis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>C13orf3 localises to prominent structures during mitosis</title><p>To analyse the dynamic localisation of C13orf3 during cell division and to substantiate the overlapping localisation with Ska1 observed in the profiling study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), we used the C13orf3 BAC-transgenic HeLa cell line and imaged dividing cells using fluorescence time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie S4</xref>). The protein was predominantly cytoplasmatic during interphase, with a noticeable concentration around the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2Aa, j</xref>). In prophase, just before the nuclear envelope breakdown, an accumulation of C13orf3 at the centrosomes was readily detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2Ab and B</xref>). During prometaphase and metaphase, C13orf3 localised to the mitotic spindle as well as to the kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2Ac, d and B</xref>). Upon entry into anaphase, the fusion protein was enriched at the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2Ae and B</xref>) and at the spindle midzone in late anaphase and telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2Af, g, and B</xref>). During cytokinesis, C13orf3 was found at the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2Ah, i, and B</xref>). The localisation to important mitotic structures and the overlap with the localisation pattern of Ska1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) underlines a potential interaction of these proteins.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>C13orf3 is required for anaphase onset</title><p>The prominent localisation of C13orf3 prompted us to carry out a more detailed phenotypic analysis. To confirm and validate findings from the genome-wide RNAi screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), we first repeated the DNA content analysis by flow cytometry with two independent esiRNAs targeting C13orf3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). For both esiRNAs, a significant cell-cycle arrest in the G2/M phase was observed 42 h post transfection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6A</xref> and data not shown). To ensure efficient knockdown of the intended target genes by RNAi, we conducted Q-PCR and western blot analyses. For all esiRNAs, a knockdown of at least 80&#x00025; was achieved at the mRNA level 24 h post transfection and a knockdown of at least 85&#x00025; at the protein level 42 h post transfection, showing the efficacy of the employed esiRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7A and B</xref>). As the DNA content for cells in G2 phase and mitosis is 4 N, it is not possible to distinguish these two phases by DNA content measurements. To distinguish between a G2- and M-phase arrest, we depleted C13orf3 by RNAi and determined the mitotic index 42 h post transfection by staining for the phosphorylation of serine 10 of histone H3, a mitotic marker for chromatin condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Goto <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed an increase in the mitotic index to 26.2&#x00025; upon C13orf3 depletion (3.6&#x00025; for mock control), of which 80.5&#x00025; of the cells were arrested in a metaphase-like state (36.1&#x00025; for mock control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A and C</xref>). These data suggest that C13orf3 is required for anaphase onset. In addition to the metaphase arrest, we observed a significant increase in cells with tripolar and tetrapolar spindles (19 versus 2&#x00025; for mock-transfected cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D and E</xref>), indicating that C13orf3 might also have a function in centrosome duplication or maintenance. To obtain a dynamic description of the phenotypic consequences upon C13orf3 depletion, we carried out time-lapse microscopy analyses in a cell line expressing a histone(H2B)&#x02013;GFP fusion protein. These analyses showed an apparently normal chromosome congression and a proper establishment of the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S11</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S23</xref>). However, as early as 30 h post transfection, cells failed to maintain the metaphase plate, with individual chromosomes exiting from the aligned chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S10</xref>) causing a mitotic arrest, which ultimately led to cell death through caspase-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>). Closer analysis of the first mitosis after C13orf3 depletion in the histone(H2B)-GFP cell line showed that affected cells first form a straight metaphase plate, indicative of a bipolar spindle with two centrosomes. At later stages, the metaphase suddenly became kinked, indicating that the bipolar spindles had reverted to a tripolar spindle, likely through fragmentation of one centrosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie S10</xref>). This observation confirms the results from the phospho-histone H3 (pS10) and anti-pericentrin immunofluorescence stains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A, C, D, and E</xref>) and provides a possible explanation for the frequent appearance of tripolar and tetrapolar spindles. Staining of C13orf3-depleted cells with antibodies against the mitotic checkpoint proteins, Bub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3G</xref>) and Mad2 (data not shown), showed that the detached kinetochores were positive for both proteins, suggesting that the mitotic arrest is caused by the activation of the SAC. Other kinetochore proteins such as CASC5, Mis12, or NDC80 did not loose their localisation, showing that the overall structure of the kinetochores is not affected upon C13orf3 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>). Co-depletion of Mad2 together with C13orf3 rescued the mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B, C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6B</xref>), showing that the activation of the SAC is indeed the primary cause of the mitotic arrest. Together, the comparison of the RNAi phenotype with the described Ska1 RNAi phenotype, that is, mitotic arrest in metaphase, SAC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hanisch <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), and mitotic centrosome fragmentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S15</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Rines <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>)), substantiated a possible functional link between these two proteins.</p><p>Next, we wanted to investigate whether C13orf3 is required for chromosome segregation. Onset from metaphase to anaphase with chromosome segregation during anaphase requires, among others, the inhibition of the kinase activity of Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sullivan and Morgan, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, Cdk1 activity is necessary for mitotic entry and maintenance of the mitotic state in early mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Vassilev <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Consequently, an inhibition of Cdk1 kinase activity during early mitosis, for example, by the small molecular inhibitor, RO-3306, results in mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie S16</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S17</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Vassilev <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In contrast, inhibition of Cdk1 activity in interphase prevents mitosis entry and induces an arrest in the G2 phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie S16</xref>). Accordingly, mitotic arrest in prometaphase by nocodazole could be released by RO-3306 treatment, leading to mitotic exit without chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie S17</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Vassilev <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>)). To investigate possible differences of RO-3306-induced mitotic exit in metaphase, we arrested cells through RNAi against the APC/C subunits Cdc16 and C13orf3. After treatment with RO-3306, we imaged the exiting cells by fluorescence time-lapse microscopy. Although Cdc16 depletion leads to a metaphase arrest with the formation of a metaphase plate and a bipolar spindle, the release by RO-3306 treatment does not result in chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie S18</xref>), inter alia because sister chromatids are still held together at the centromeres by cohesin. In contrast, a release from the metaphase arrest after C13orf3 depletion by RO-3306 resulted in anaphase onset and chromosome segregation with high statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3I, J</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie S19</xref>). Consequently, C13orf3 is not <italic>per se</italic> required for anaphase execution or chromosome segregation. To exclude effects caused by tagging with GFP and Cherry, we repeated these assays with unlabelled cells leading to the same conclusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies S16</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S20</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S21</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S22</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data identify C13orf3 as an essential protein to satisfy the SAC but not for chromosome segregation during anaphase. Beside the inhibition of Cdk1 activity, the separation of sister chromatids is an important step before execution of anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sullivan and Morgan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Yamagishi <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether cells arrested in metaphase after C13orf3 depletion have intact sister chromatid cohesion. The protein SGOL1 is implicated in the protection of centromeric sister chromatid cohesion during early mitosis mainly by recruiting PP2A to the centromeric region of chromosomes. Hence, knockdown of SGOL1 leads to mitotic arrest due to premature sister chromatid separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Waizenegger <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Riedel <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). We analysed chromosome spreads prepared from cells arrested by nocodazole treatment or RNAi against Cdc16, C13orf3, and SGOL1. As expected, X-shaped chromosomes were observed in the cases of Cdc16 RNAi and nocodazole treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3K</xref>), indicating that the sister chromatid cohesion is still intact. In contrast, single sister chromatids were observed with high statistical significance for RNAi of C13orf3 and SGOL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3K and L</xref>), indicating that the phenotypic consequences of the depletion of these two proteins may be similar. Interestingly, on closer inspection of the RNAi phenotype of SGOL1, other striking similarities to the C13orf3 depletion were seen, for example, exiting chromosomes from the metaphase plate and centrosome fragmentation without alteration on timing of early mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Nakajima <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2008a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies S23</xref>). Similar to the C13orf3 knockdown, the RNAi depletion of SGOL1 does not alter the localisation of kinetochore proteins such as CASC5, Mis12, or NDC80, showing that the overall kinetochore structure stays intact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>). To further investigate a potential connection of SGOL1 and Ska complex, we depleted Ska1 and SGOL1 in the C13orf3 BAC-tagged HeLa cell line and monitored possible changes in C13orf3 protein levels by western blot analysis. Strikingly, both knockdowns greatly reduced protein levels of C13orf3 in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3M</xref>), corroborating the link between C13orf3, Ska1 and SGOL1 and indicating that C13orf3 requires Ska1 and SGOL1 for its stability. To test whether the loss of sister chromatid cohesion phenotype upon C13orf3 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3K</xref>) might be due to loss of SGOL1 protein or mislocalisation, we depleted C13orf3 in a BAC transgenic HeLa cell line expressing LAP-tagged SGOL1. No significant loss in SGOL1 protein level or mislocalisation was observed upon C13orf3 depletion compared with the mock control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3N</xref>). These results suggest that there is no mutual dependency of C13orf3 and SGOL1 protein levels and places C13orf3 downstream of SGOL1.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>C13orf3 is differentially phosphorylated during mitosis</title><p>Western blot analysis of lysates isolated from asynchronously growing LAP-tagged C13orf3 cells identified a single band of the predicted size. However, cell extracts prepared from mitotic cells showed an additional band of higher molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that C13orf3 is modified in mitosis. Treatment of mitotic extracts with calf intestine phosphatase led to the disappearance of the slower migrating band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>), showing that C13orf3 is phosphorylated during mitosis. Furthermore, the mass spectrometry analysis identified a C13orf3 peptide that was specifically phosphorylated at threonine 190 or 193 during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S24A and B</xref>). To study phosphorylation of C13orf3 during mitosis in more detail, we depleted the protein Eg5 (kinesin 11, depletion produces monopoles and causes a prometaphase arrest) and the APC/C subunit Cdc27 (depletion of important APC/C subunits cause a metaphase arrest) by RNAi. Protein extracts isolated from these cells showed that C13orf3 is phosphorylated during prometa- and metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). To identify potential kinases implicated in C13orf3 phosphorylation, we depleted selected kinases with prominent roles during mitosis by RNAi in the LAP-tagged C13orf3 BAC-transgenic HeLa cells and analysed mitotic cell lysates by western blot. This analysis showed that depletion of AurkB, but not Plk1, abolished phosphorylation of C13orf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that C13orf3 phosphorylation is AurkB-dependent. Interestingly, in addition to the reduced protein levels, no band of higher molecular weight was visible in mitotic extracts upon Ska1 RNAi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3M</xref>), indicating that C13orf3 phosphorylation was also dependent on Ska1. Given the differential phosphorylation of C13orf3 in interphase and mitosis, it appeared likely that C13orf3 is dephosphorylated by a protein phosphatase at the end of mitosis. To test this hypothesis, we released HeLa cells stably expressing LAP-tagged C13orf3 from nocodazole arrest and treated the cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of the phosphatase activity of PP2A and PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mailhes <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). The phosphorylation of C13orf3 persisted in the presence of okadaic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>), indication that either PP2A or PP1 activity is required to remove C13orf3 phosphorylation at the end of mitosis. We conclude that C13orf3 is differentially phosphorylated during the cell cycle, with AurkB and PP2A or PP1 being potential candidates that phosphorylate and dephosphorylate the protein, respectively.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>C13orf3 forms a complex with Ska1, Ska2 and PPP2R2B</title><p>To identify protein interaction partners of C13orf3 we performed immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry using the LAP-tagged C13orf3 HeLa cell line. These analyses showed interactions of C13orf3 with the Ska complex proteins Ska2 (Fam33A) and Ska1 (C18orf24) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). Mass spectrometry analyses utilising LAP-tagged BAC-transgenic Ska1 and Ska2 cell lines validated the physical interaction of these three proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). Hence, these studies identify C13orf3 as a new member of the Ska complex. Based on this data we propose to rename <italic>C13orf3</italic> into <italic>Ska3</italic>. In contrast to the Ska protein interactions, we did not detect a direct interaction of C13orf3 with SGOL1 by mass spectrometry. However, a global proteomic study with subunits of PP2A showed a physical interaction of C13orf3 and Ska1/-2 with PPP2R2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Glatter <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). The interaction with PPP2R2B indicates that PP2A is the phosphatase that dephosphorylates C13orf3 at the end of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>) and also provides a possible link to SGOL1 through the regulation of PP2A activity. To map the interaction domains of Ska proteins, we tested different protein fragments in yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Boxem <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). These analyses showed an interaction of the N-terminal part of C13orf3 (aa 1&#x02013;159) with the N-terminal part of Ska1 (aa 1&#x02013;84) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), as well as with Ska2 at the two terminal regions of C13orf3 (aa 1&#x02013;87 and aa 303&#x02013;412). In addition, these assays defined a minimal motif for binding of Ska1 and Ska2 at the N-terminal side of Ska1 (aa 1&#x02013;63) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Hence, all Ska complex proteins interact directly with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Bioinformatic analysis (threading) of Ska1 predicts a three-helical bundle at the N-terminus that is structurally homologous to a Spectrin repeat-like fold (SCOP-ID: 46965), followed by a KEN box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S25</xref>), a short motif found in many proteins involved in cell-cycle regulation and mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Michael <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Three helical bundles are known to mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Fridmann-Sirkis <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Hence, we propose that the observed interaction of Ska1 with C13orf3 might be mediated through the three-helical bundle region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S25</xref>). In summary, the two-hybrid assays validate the observed interaction of C13orf3 with Ska1 and Ska2, and define the minimal motifs for these interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our data on <italic>C13orf3</italic> show that the combination of phenotypic profiling with protein localisation data is a useful approach to predict functions of uncharacterised genes. Large-scale tagging of proteins at endogenous expression levels is possible in yeast, and comprehensive protein localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Huh <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and protein interaction network studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gavin <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Krogan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) have been carried out in this organism. To broaden this approach, systematic BAC tagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Poser <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) of most proteins would allow similar studies in mammalian cells. In a test study, applying this technology in small scale, we identified C13orf3 as a new interaction partner of the Ska complex. This study provides a first link between the Ska complex and regulation of sister chromatid cohesion possibly through SGOL1 and PP2A pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phenotypic profiling</title><p>esiRNAs were synthesised as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kittler <italic>et al</italic>, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2007b</xref>) and, after normalisation, arrayed into 384-well plates. Briefly, esiRNAs are silencing triggers for RNAi in mammalian cells prepared by enzymatic digestion (bacterial RNase III) of long dsRNA (300&#x02013;600 bp, derived from target mRNA). esiRNAs were chosen in this study in favour of chemically synthesised siRNAs because they were shown to produce less off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kittler <italic>et al</italic>, 2007b</xref>).

For viability analysis, the cell culture medium was supplemented with AlamarBlue dye (Serotec) and after 3 h incubation the fluorescence intensities (excitation: 535 nm; emission: 590 nm) were measured using a plate reader (GENiosPro, Tecan).

The input variables were <italic>z</italic>-scores of cells in G1, S, G2/M phase, 8 N cells, and viability. To normalise variables, all scores were converted into percentile ranks. The percentile rank of a score is the percentage of scores, which are lower or equal to it; they were chosen for hierarchical clustering because they are more robust towards skewed distributions. Distances between genes were calculated with a weighted Euclidean metric. Weights were chosen to ensure equal influence of both experiments in the calculated distance (1/2 for viability variable and 1/8 for each of the four cell-cycle variables). The final tree was constructed using clustering with the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>BAC TransgeneOmics</title><p>BACs harbouring the genes of interest were obtained from the BACPAC Resource Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://bacpac.chori.org">http://bacpac.chori.org</ext-link>; BAC-IDs see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).
