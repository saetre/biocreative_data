Expression of non-cleavable PrP<sup>C</sup> mutants in transgenic mice correlates with neurotoxicity, suggesting that &#x003b1;-cleavage is important for PrP<sup>C</sup> physiology. To gain insights into the mechanisms of &#x003b1;-cleavage, we generated a library of PrP<sup>C</sup> mutants with mutations in the region neighbouring the &#x003b1;-cleavage site. The prevalence of C1, the carboxy adduct of &#x003b1;-cleavage, was determined for each mutant. In cell lines of disparate origin, C1 prevalence was unaffected by variations in charge and hydrophobicity of the region neighbouring the &#x003b1;-cleavage site, and by substitutions of the residues in the palindrome that flanks this site. Instead, &#x003b1;-cleavage was size-dependently impaired by deletions within the domain 106&#x02013;119. Almost no cleavage was observed upon full deletion of this domain. These results suggest that &#x003b1;-cleavage is executed by an &#x003b1;-PrPase whose activity, despite surprisingly limited sequence specificity, is dependent on the size of the central region of PrP<sup>C</sup>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prion protein is necessary for the development of prion diseases, also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Beler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Brandner1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the BOM6 construct we mutated to neutral alanine residues the two charged amino acids of the &#x003b1;-cleavage site, whereas in BOM3 we mutated the positive charges into anionic aspartate residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Because &#x00394;F and C1 were previously found to display similar electrophoretic mobility, &#x00394;F was used as a molecular size marker for identifying C1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Baumann1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Shmerling1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cell lysates of lines transfected with PrP<sup>C</sup> and its mutants were collected, and PrP<sup>C</sup> glycosylation and processing were assessed before and after treatment with PNGase. BOM6, BOM3, and the deletion mutant &#x00394;F all underwent glycosylation similarly to PrP<sup>C</sup> in both cell lines. Therefore, charge inversion or large deletions in the flexible N-proximal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> did not exert any appreciable impact onto PrP<sup>C</sup> glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). This observation is in agreement with reports suggesting that large alterations in the region of the CC and HC have no measurable impact in the distribution of the mutants between various cellular microdomains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Baumann1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Christensen1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The N1 fragment is released into the medium, whereas C1 retains its GPI anchor and its membrane localization. Furthermore, N1 encompasses the unstructured domain of PrP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Riek1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and is unstable. Because of these circumstances, we reasoned that the degree of cleavage of the various PrP<sup>C</sup> mutants would be more reliably assessed by measuring C1 rather than N1. Therefore, we quantitated the C1 band and compared it to the integrals of the band corresponding to uncleaved PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In both Hpl and Npl cells the degree of &#x003b1;-cleavage of BOM6 and BOM3 was comparable to, or &#x0003c;25&#x00025; lower than, that of wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Hence removal, or even inversion, of the positive charges at the &#x003b1;-cleavage site did not result in a remarkable inhibition of &#x003b1;-cleavage. The values for cleavage inhibition of the mutants varied &#x0003c;7&#x00025; between Hpl and Npl cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), indicating that the pattern of proteolytic processing of PrP<sup>C</sup> in these two cell lines was qualitatively and quantitatively similar. For this reason we focused on the Hpl cell line for most of the studies described in the following.</p><p>To further test the possibility that &#x003b1;-cleavage is independent of the charges and sequence of the cleavage site, we designed the BOM8 mutant in which all five basic histidine and lysine residues neighbouring the &#x003b1;-cleavage site were mutagenized into uncharged alanines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We also asked whether swapping the position of the &#x003b1;-cleavage site would alter the proteolytic processing of PrP<sup>C</sup>. For this the mutant BOM7 was elaborated, whose &#x003b1;-cleavage site was shifted downstream by two amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We found that the cleavage efficiency of BOM6, BOM8 and BOM7 was between 95 and 100&#x00025; of the cleavage of wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup>. Hence, as with the previously assessed constructs, BOM8 and BOM7 generated C1 with a similar efficiency to that of wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p>Having established that the above modifications had little impact onto the &#x003b1;-cleavage, we assessed the impact of stronger alterations of the CC region. For this purpose we analyzed BOM8 together with two constructs bearing charge inversions. FBOM3 had all six cationic residues of the CC mutated into anionic glutamate residues, resulting in complete inversion of all charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In FBOM1 the positive charges of four lysines were inverted into anionic glutamate residues, but these acidic residues were interspersed with two cationic histidines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Constructs C39 and C40 (which carries a large deletion of the region 100&#x02013;129) were analyzed in parallel and used as &#x0201c;molecular milestones&#x0201d; for assessing moderate and extensive cleavage inhibition, respectively. Quantitation of the C1 fragment generated in these constructs and in wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup> confirmed that removal of the five positive charges around the &#x003b1;-cleavage site and in the neighbouring region did not affect the proteolytic processing of PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2D,F</xref>). Even extremely drastic modifications, such as the polarity inversion of four or even six positive charges (FBOM1 and FBOM3), resulted in only about 38&#x00025; &#x003b1;-cleavage impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2D,F</xref>). On the basis of these results it is unavoidable to conclude that the charges surrounding the &#x003b1;-cleavage site are largely irrelevant for the proteolysis of PrP<sup>C</sup>, with neutralization and even complete charge reversal of the CC region resulting in a surprisingly slight impairment of &#x003b1;-cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Role of the PrP<sup>C</sup> Palindromic Region (111&#x02013;120) in &#x003b1;-Cleavage</title><p>Next, we studied the residues located carboxy proximally to the cleavage site. This region contains a palindrome which is immediately adjacent to the N-terminal boundary of the HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). A previous study reported that substitution of all palindromic glycines with alanines, as in construct BOM9, abrogated C1 generation in N2a cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Wegner1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

To our surprise, quantification of C1 revealed that both constructs were processed by &#x003b1;-cleavage similarly to wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2D,F</xref>). In order to evaluate the robustness of these results, the palindromic mutants BOM9 and BOM11, the palindromic-deletion construct C39, and the charge-neutralized BOM8 were transfected into HeLa cells. Fragments were analyzed with antibody POM19 which recognizes the globular domain of murine, but not of human, PrP<sup>C</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Polymenidou1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The proteolytic processing of these mutants was indistinguishable in both HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) and Hpl cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2D,F</xref>) and was essentially identical to that of wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). In contrast, C39 displayed partial &#x003b1;-cleavage inhibition in both Hpl and HeLa cells, which is in agreement with the finding that a mutant bearing a deletion of the region 114&#x02013;121 is inefficiently cleaved in the brain of transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Baumann1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We conclude that, in contrast to published claims <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Wegner1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the substitution of the palindrome with a total or partial polyglycine chain does not have a measurable impact on &#x003b1;-cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The Impact of Hydrophobicity onto &#x003b1;-Cleavage</title><p>Another striking feature that might modulate &#x003b1;-cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup> is the strong hydrophobicity of the residues neighbouring the cleavage site. Since the HC may be associated to the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Hegde1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, we reasoned that &#x003b1;-cleavage may be affected by the distance between the cleavage site and the cell membrane. In this scenario, reduction of the hydrophobicity of the HC may modify its interaction with the cell membrane and thereby decrease the rate of &#x003b1;-cleavage.</p><p>To test the latter hypothesis, we designed three PrP<sup>C</sup> constructs in which we substituted hydrophobic residues with non-ionic hydrophilic analogues of roughly similar molecular size. Accordingly, we substituted alanine with glycine residues, whereas leucines and valines were replaced with glutamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The maximal deviation in primary sequence between each pair of constructs was four residues. Construct BOM26 displayed only a slight reduction of hydrophobicity and therefore was expected to be cleaved almost as efficiently as wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup>, whereas BOM27 had a stronger reduction of hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g003">Fig. 3A&#x02013;B</xref>). Finally, BOM25 bears almost no positive hydrophobic integral and was designed to stringently test whether hydrophobicity would play any role in &#x003b1;-cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g003">Fig. 3A&#x02013;B</xref>).

We even observed slightly increased proteolysis of PrP<sup>C</sup>, but this increase was similar for all three mutants and was therefore independent of the hydrophobicity.

Measurements of C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g003">Fig. 3D&#x02013;E</xref>) showed that &#x003b1;-cleavage was mildly inhibited in BOM24 and strongly inhibited in BOM23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g003">Fig. 3D&#x02013;E</xref>).

We firstly assessed the cleavage efficiency of C40, the construct with a 30-residue deletion encompassing most CC and HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Essentially no C1 was observed when the C40 construct was transfected into Hpl cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g004">Fig. 4B&#x02013;C</xref>), thereby establishing that the region encompassing residues 100&#x02013;129 is essential for modulating &#x003b1;-cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup>.

In contrast, BOM13, with deletion in the residues 105&#x02013;110, and C39, which lacks the domain 111&#x02013;120, showed about 50&#x00025; reduction in C1 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g004">Fig. 4B&#x02013;C</xref>). This suggests that the space occupied by residues 105&#x02013;120, but not necessarily the chemical identity of those residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), is important for &#x003b1;-cleavage. Surprisingly, although the removal of the region 100&#x02013;110 did not affect &#x003b1;-cleavage in BOM12, the shorter deletion of 105&#x02013;110 resulted in about 50&#x00025; inhibition of &#x003b1;-cleavage in BOM13. This suggests a negative modulation of cleavage by residues 100&#x02013;104 in this context. The sequence present in BOM13, but absent from BOM12, is KPSKP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and is highly conserved domain in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-vanRheede1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Kim1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

Perhaps the &#x003b1;-PrPase is partially blocked in BOM13, but not in BOM12, due to an entity interacting with the conserved region 101&#x02013;104. Alternatively, this constellation of prolines and charged residues may contribute to a decrease in the flexibility of this segment and, in turn, enhance the antagonistic effects of the deletion on the efficiency of &#x003b1;-cleavage.</p><p>Because the domain 105&#x02013;120 appeared to be important for &#x003b1;-cleavage, we set out to identify the minimal region within this domain that would affect the proteolytic processing of PrP<sup>C</sup>. For this purpose, we assessed the degree of C1 generation in the mutants BOM17, BOM15, and BOM16 bearing deletions of 14, 9, and 4 residues within the domain 105&#x02013;120, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

The extent of cleavage impairment was proportional to the size of the deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g004">Fig. 4B&#x02013;D</xref>), provided that said deletions encompassed the &#x003b1;-cleavage site and were situated within the domain 106&#x02013;119. When the domain 106&#x02013;119 was deleted, &#x003b1;-cleavage was only marginally higher than in C40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g004">Fig. 4B&#x02013;D</xref>). These findings suggest that &#x003b1;-cleavage is not controlled by a specific primary sequence, but rather by the length of the unstructured stretch encompassing residues 105&#x02013;120.

In contrast, the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> dominant negative PrP<sup>Q218K</sup> was cleaved in a similar fashion as normal PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g005">Fig. 5A,D</xref>), suggesting a link between toxicity of inherited human prion diseases, and inhibition of &#x003b1;-cleavage of PrP. However, secPrP<sup>C</sup> did not show any C1 generation in Hpl cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009107-g005">Fig. 5B,D</xref>), in contrast to a previous report using human SH-SY5Y cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Walmsley1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

This finding, in combination with results reported elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Baumann2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, suggests that the GPI anchor is necessary for the toxicity of uncleavable PrP<sup>C</sup> mutants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>&#x003b1;-cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup> occurs in many cell types and tissues at a well-defined site located in the unstructured portion of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Riek1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, generating a stable carboxy terminal fragment of ca. 15 kDa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Chen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Baumann1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-JimenezHuete1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and an N-terminal fragment of ca. 12 kDa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Vincent1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Harris1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The robust and stereotypic nature of these processing events suggests the existence of specific proteases which we term PrPases. However, we were surprised to find that PrP<sup>C</sup> proteolysis is remarkably tolerant of variations in the sequence surrounding the site of cleavage. A large number of manipulations had little or no effect in &#x003b1;-cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup>; some of these manipulations were very far-reaching and included removal of the canonical cleavage site, inversion of all charges, radical manipulations of the hydrophobicity, and alteration of the palindrome domain.</p><p>As the resolution of SDS-PAGE does not allow for detecting single amino-acid shifts in the cleavage site, it is possible that some of the PrP<sup>C</sup> mutants may have experienced subtle shifts in the &#x003b1;-cleavage site. Even if that were the case, all manipulations consistently preserved the generation of a C1 cleavage product whose abundance and electrophoretic motility was similar to bona fide C1 generated by proteolysis of wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup>. Conversely, deletion of residues 106&#x02013;119 strongly reduced &#x003b1;-cleavage, whereas shorter deletions within this region had only a moderate effect. The efficiency of cleavage was inversely proportional to the size of deletions centered onto the &#x003b1;-cleavage site.</p><p>The results described in this study allow drawing several surprising conclusions on the molecular preconditions for &#x003b1;-cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup>. Firstly, substitution of positively charged residues at the &#x003b1;-cleavage site has no major effect on the degree of PrP<sup>C</sup> proteolysis. This is in agreement with previous studies of N2a cells transfected with GFP-fused ovine PrP<sup>C</sup> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Tveit1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Secondly, replacement of all six positive charges of the CC with negative charges, including those of the &#x003b1;-cleavage site, resulted only in a partial inhibition of C1 generation. Thirdly, even total or partial substitution of the palindromic alanines flanking the &#x003b1;-cleavage site with glycines had little impact in the normal proteolysis of PrP<sup>C</sup>. This observation contradicts a previous report in murine N2a cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Wegner1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, yet was particularly robust in our experience and appears to be valid in both murine and human cells. Fourthly, amino acid substitutions reducing the hydrophobicity of the region surrounding the &#x003b1;-cleavage site failed to reduce the proteolysis of PrP<sup>C</sup>. However, impairment of &#x003b1;-cleavage was observed upon substitution of the charged residues within the cleavage site for two highly hydrophobic isoleucines. Fifthly, deletions in the vicinity of the &#x003b1;-cleavage site, as the domains 100&#x02013;110 and 121&#x02013;129, had no impact onto cleavage whereas deletions of the domains 105&#x02013;110 and 111&#x02013;120 resulted in about 50&#x00025; impairment on &#x003b1;-cleavage. The latter result is in agreement with our previous report that a PrP<sup>C</sup> mutant lacking residues 114&#x02013;121 undergoes inefficient &#x003b1;-cleavage in transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Baumann1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is somewhat counterintuitive that deletion of residues 100&#x02013;110 had no apparent effect whereas the shorter deletion 105&#x02013;110 partially blocked &#x003b1;-cleavage. This finding points to the importance of the 100&#x02013;104 KPSKP residues. This region is highly conserved in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Kim1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Lysek1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and has been suggested to be important for protein binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Kay1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the domains indentified in the consensus sequence in vertebrates is PxxP, which is an SH3-binding motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Lysek1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Kay1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Mayer1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. All of the above suggests the existence of a macromolecule that interacts with the domain 100&#x02013;104 and may occlude the &#x003b1;-cleavage site. This putative macromolecule may not necessarily be a protein. Alternatively, a proline kink at the &#x003b1;-cleavage site may impair the function of the &#x003b1;-PrPase in <italic>cis</italic>.</p><p>In our experiments, the C1 fragment was suppressed below detectability only when the entire segment 106&#x02013;119, or major portions thereof, was removed. However, shorter deletions within the domain 106&#x02013;119 centered in the &#x003b1;-cleavage site region only partially inhibited proteolysis of PrP<sup>C</sup>. Assuming that the efficiency of cleavage is linearly dependent on the length of this segment, a 50&#x00025; blockage of &#x003b1;-cleavage would be obtained with a six-residue deletion.</p><p>In summary, &#x003b1;-cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup> has a strong tolerance towards sequence degeneration. Such tolerance may underlie evolutionary pressure, since PrP<sup>C</sup> mutants that do not undergo &#x003b1;-cleavage are neurotoxic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Baumann1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Shmerling1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Li1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

This suggests that the relevant &#x003b1;-PrPases are functionally conserved and present in many tissues. What might underlie the surprising resilience of &#x003b1;-cleavage to sequence variation? Maybe several distinct proteases display redundant &#x003b1;-PrPase activity. If that were the case, alterations of the cleavage site may affect the recognition by some&#x02013;but not all&#x02013;proteases, resulting in unhindered global &#x003b1;-PrPase activity. Alternatively, PrP<sup>C</sup> may be processed by a single &#x003b1;-PrPase with high plasticity of its substrate specificity. Examples of such proteases are the desintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAM) 10 and 17 (also known as TACE, or &#x003b1;-secretase of APP). These proteins have been reported to cleave a broad range of basic, acidic, or zwitterionic substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Edwards1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> with no common consensus sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Edwards1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Baumann3">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Black1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, and have therefore been also termed &#x0201c;sheddases&#x0201d;.

Analogously, the &#x003b1;-cleavage site of PrP<sup>C</sup> is localized in an unfolded region and is flanked by a hydrophobic domain which may associate with the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Hegde1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Analogously to various substrates of ADAM 10 and 17, the cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup> appears to tolerate charge removal or inversion. Indeed, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 have been suggested to act as &#x003b1;-PrPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Vincent2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-AlfaCisse1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, yet this assertion is not entirely uncontroversial.

In this context it may be interesting to assess the degree of cleavage of these constructs in transgenic mice before the onset of the disease.</p><p>Through the study of a large panel of transgenic mice expressing many different PrP<sup>C</sup> mutants, we found that the toxicity of PrP<sup>C</sup> deletion mutants was abolished by removal of the GPI anchor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009107-Baumann2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding argues that toxicity is exerted through some process that occurs at the membrane, such as interaction with signal-transducing molecules.
