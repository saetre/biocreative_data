We investigated the role of transferrin in glial protection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We generated transgenic mice (Tg) carrying the complete human transferrin gene on a C57Bl/6J genetic background. We studied human (hTf) and mouse (mTf) transferrin localization in Tg and wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6J mice using immunochemistry with specific antibodies. M&#x000fc;ller glial (MG) cells were cultured from explants and characterized using cellular retinaldehyde binding protein (CRALBP) and vimentin antibodies. They were further subcultured for study. We incubated cells with FeCl<sub>3</sub>-nitrilotriacetate to test for the iron-induced stress response; viability was determined by direct counting and measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Tf expression was determined by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR with human- or mouse-specific probes. hTf and mTf in the medium were assayed by ELISA or radioimmunoassay (RIA), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>mTf was mainly localized in retinal pigment epithelium and ganglion cell layers in retina sections of both mouse lines. hTf was abundant in MG cells. The distribution of mTf and hTf mRNA was consistent with these findings. mTf and hTf were secreted into the medium of MG cell primary cultures. Cells from Tg mice secreted hTf at a particularly high level. However, both WT and Tg cell cultures lose their ability to secrete Tf after a few passages. Tg MG cells secreting hTf were more resistant to iron-induced stress toxicity than those no longer secreted hTf. Similarly, exogenous human apo-Tf, but not human holo-Tf, conferred resistance to iron-induced stress on MG cells from WT mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>hTf localization in MG cells from Tg mice was reminiscent of that reported for aged human retina and age-related macular degeneration, both conditions associated with iron deposition. The role of hTf in protection against toxicity in Tg MG cells probably involves an adaptive mechanism developed in neural retina to control iron-induced stress.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>First eX pass</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>f1-style</meta-name><meta-value>two-column</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>f2-style</meta-name><meta-value>two-column</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All cells require iron for survival and as a cofactor for a variety of enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. However, iron is also highly toxic due to its ability to generate free radicals via the Fenton reaction. Homeostatic mechanisms maintain iron levels by regulation of the proteins involved in iron import, storage, and export, thus preventing deleterious consequences of either iron overload or deficiency.</p><p>Diseases such as aceruloplasminemia and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and conditions such as siderosis bulbi and subretinal hemorrhage are associated with increased intraocular iron levels, contributing to subsequent retinal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. The eye is particularly iron-dependent. For instance, the extensive membrane biogenesis necessary to replenish shed photoreceptor outer segments (OS) requires iron as an essential cofactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Isomerization of all-trans-retinal within the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the visual cycle requires iron for activation of RPE65, an enzyme involved in the visual cycle pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Moreover, being part of the blood-retinal barrier, the RPE regulates the flow of iron and other nutrients between the choroidal vasculature and the outer retina. The highest levels of iron are found in the choroid, RPE, and photoreceptor inner segments (IS) and OS in normal adult rat and human retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Accumulation of iron has been observed in Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats, in which phagocytosis of OS by RPE is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], and in ceruloplasmin and hephaestin double knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. The study of the roles of iron-handling proteins in the retina will allow the normal mechanisms of iron detoxification to be understood.</p><p>The major pathway for iron import involves the binding of transferrin (Tf) to its receptor on the cell surface and subsequent endocytosis. Tf is an extracellular protein, binding and transferring iron within and across tissues. It is a ubiquitous protein with a crucial role in iron transport and iron homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. This protein is found in the biologic fluids of vertebrates, mainly synthesized in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>], and secreted into the blood. In adults, Tf synthesis is also found in other cell types including oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], choroid plexus epithelial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>], Sertoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>], mammary epithelial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>], and retinal cells (including RPE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Tf may protect the retina from the potentially toxic effects of unbound iron; indeed, iron bound to Tf does not cause oxidative stress. Finally, Tf seems to be essential for proliferation-promoting activity of non-neuronal cells and survival of neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>].</p><p>We used a transgenic mouse (Tg) carrying the complete human transferrin (hTf) gene to study the protective effect of Tf against oxidative stress. In Tg mice, hTf mRNA has been found in hepatocytes, oligodendrocytes, and Sertoli cells of the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. In testis and brain, mouse Tf (mTf) is upregulated when compared to control mice. It has been shown that myelination and maturation of oligodendrocytes in Tg mice induce behavioral improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Sixteen-month-old Tg mice have low testicular sperm reserves without consequence on fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>].</p><p>In the present work, we first examined the retinal distribution of hTf and mTf in Tg mice and found that hTf is produced in RPE and M&#x000fc;ller glial (MG) cells. Second, we isolated and cultured MG cells from Tg and wild-type (WT) mice and examined the potential role of hTf over-production in protecting Tg MG cells exposed to FeCl<sub>3</sub>-nitrilotriacetate (FeCl<sub>3</sub>-NTA). Finally, we compared its action to the effects of exogenous human apo-Tf and holo-Tf on MG cells from WT mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Tg mice carrying the long hTf gene (80 kb) comprising its long 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-regulatory sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>] were generated from the 803 line previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] backcrossed in the C57Bl/6J background.

Unlike human holo-Tf, WT MG cells survival against iron treatment is correlated to the capacity of human apo-Tf to catch iron in excess. Human holo-Tf, which probably is not fully saturated with iron, seemed to be protective at the lowest concentrations (2.5 and 5 ng/ml). At the highest concentrations (10 and 20 ng/ml), it seemed to be toxic because its iron loads were higher.</p><p>We quantified the levels of Tf protein and mRNA in serum-free medium to assess the effects of iron-induced stress on hTf and mTf metabolism in MG cells. As expected mRNA levels were slightly lower for mTf and markedly lower for hTf in the presence than absence of iron. The molecular basis for the lower levels of hTf following iron administration has not been extensively studied. In humans, anemia resulting in iron deficiency is associated with high plasma Tf levels whereas conditions resulting in excess iron stores are associated with low plasma Tf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. The low plasma Tf concentration associated with increased iron stores in humans may be due to the effects of negative feedback on Tf synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>].</p><p>Tf gene transcription is induced by a variety of factors in a tissue-specific manner. In rats and chickens, nutritional iron deficiency activates Tf gene transcription specifically in the liver, resulting in a several-fold increase in Tf synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. In human hepatoma HepG2 cells lines, iron treatment suppresses Tf synthesis demonstrating regulation of intact endogenous Tf synthesis by iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. Previous studies on transgenic mice have identified a 50 nucleotide region in the 5&#x02032;UTR of hTf mRNA involved in hTf iron regulation. Within this region, an an iron responsive element (IRE)- homologous sequence (&#x0201c;the putative hTf IRE&#x0201d;) was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>].</p><p>The high level of hTf in the medium of hTf Tg MG cells may be a protective mechanism against the labile iron pool. Tf sequestrates iron from the FeCl<sub>3</sub>-NTA added to the medium, preventing iron toxicity. The use of FeCl<sub>3</sub>-NTA permits direct entry of iron into the MG cells where it is stored by ferritin. Iron excess inhibits activation of Tf transcription. Very low levels of hTf mRNA may result from transcription factors binding specific hTf promoter sequences. hTf can regulate its transcription directly or indirectly in an autocrine manner. hTf is an autocrine factor for the development and maturation of oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>]. In humans, Tf produced by T cells can function in an autocrine manner rather than a paracrine manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>]. Tf synthesis in small cell lung cancer cells also acts as an autocrine regulator of cellular proliferation, allowing these cells to continue proliferating under transferrin-free conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>].</p><p>In our study, isolated MG cells from Tg mice expressing hTf were protected against iron-mediated stress. We believe that hTf regulates its transcription in an autocrine manner to control intracellular iron levels. These findings are consistent with a potential protective role for Tf in retina, which is related to the capacity of Tf to bind iron. Thus, therapeutic targeting of retinal Tf may be beneficial in pathological conditions involving iron accumulation such as aging, AMD, and inflammation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank F.
