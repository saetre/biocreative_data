Catalytic activity of the histidine kinase sensor protein PhoQ is activated by low extracellular concentrations of divalent cations such as Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and subsequently the response regulator PhoP is activated in turn through a classic phosphotransfer pathway that is typical in such systems. The PhoQ sensor domains of enteric bacteria contain an acidic cluster of residues (EDDDDAE) that has been implicated in direct binding to divalent cations. We have determined crystal structures of the wild-type <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> PhoQ periplasmic sensor domain and of a mutant variant in which the acidic cluster was neutralized to conservative uncharged residues (QNNNNAQ). The PhoQ domain structure is similar to that of DcuS and CitA sensor domains, and this PhoQ-DcuS-CitA (PDC) sensor fold is seen to be distinct from the superficially similar PAS domain fold. Analysis of the wild-type structure reveals a dimer that allows for the formation of a salt bridge across the dimer interface between Arg-50&#x02032; and Asp-179 and with nickel ions bound to aspartate residues in the acidic cluster. The physiological importance of the salt bridge to <italic>in vivo</italic> PhoQ function has been confirmed by mutagenesis. The mutant structure has an alternative, non-physiological dimeric association.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>The atomic coordinates and structure factors (codes 3BQ8 and 3BQA) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/">http://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>).</italic></p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grants AI41566 (to C.

In bacteria and some lower eukaryotes, two-component signaling systems couple extracellular stimuli to an intercellular adaptive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Such systems allow a signal to be transduced across the cell membrane by employing a set of two proteins, a histidine kinase sensor and a response regulator, which interact in tandem. The typical histidine kinase is a transmembrane protein containing an N-terminal extracellular sensor domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic kinase transmitter domain. The activity of the cytoplasmic catalytic domain is modulated by a signal transduced across the membrane from the sensor domain. In its active state, the histidine kinase sensor phosphorylates a conserved histidine residue in the cytoplasmic domain, and subsequently the phosphoryl group is transferred from the histidine kinase to a conserved aspartate residue in the N-terminal receiver domain of the cytoplasmic response regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Receiver domain phosphorylation, in turn, activates the C-terminal effector domain, which mediates an adaptive response, usually by either modulating transcription or flagella rotation. In some cases, sensor stimulation promotes dephosphorylation.</p><p>The PhoP-PhoQ regulatory pair is a widely studied two-component system that has been implicated in the virulence of several Gram-negative plant and animal pathogens, including <italic>Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, and <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic>. It appears that PhoQ may be a sensor for periplasmic concentrations of divalent cations. Both i<italic>n vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have shown that the PhoQ sensor is modulated by extracellular levels of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, where low concentrations promote activation and high concentrations result in repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). The role of divalents as a signal for PhoQ is also supported by crystal structure of the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> PhoQ sensor domain, which show Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites on an acidic surface of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). It has also been suggested that host antimicrobial peptides may also serve as a signal for PhoQ, and that the competition between divalent ions and such peptides may be a means by which the invading cell can determine its subcellular environment during the infection cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Transcription of specific virulence factors is then regulated accordingly.</p><p>PhoQ is also found in non-pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> where it controls a regulon that includes several of the same genes that are regulated in <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and many that are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). The role of PhoQ in <italic>E. coli</italic> appears to be to regulate a physiological response to Mg<sup>2+</sup> starvation and is involved in acid resistance but not virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Previous experiments on soluble sensor domain constructs of <italic>E. coli</italic> PhoQ have suggested a possible direct binding of divalent cations to a cluster of acidic amino acid residues in the sensor domain. In the presence of divalents, higher thermal stability is conferred in wild-type constructs but not in mutant constructs that lack the acidic cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).</p><p>We have crystallized the <italic>E. coli</italic> PhoQ periplasmic sensor domain, and we present the structures of a wild-type and a response-impaired acidic cluster mutant at atomic level resolution. Analysis of the structures reveals potential ligand binding sites and dimeric arrangements of subunits. The biological relevance and importance of the dimer interface in the wild-type structure is supported by mutational analysis and provides clues toward understanding transmembrane signaling by this molecule.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Bacterial Strains and Plasmids</italic>&#x02014;pLPQ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) is a pSC101-derived plasmid in which expression of the <italic>E. coli phoP-phoQ</italic> operon is driven by the <italic>lacUV5</italic> promoter. pNL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) is a pBR322-derived reporter plasmid for assaying PhoP-mediated transcriptional activation that contains the <italic>phoN</italic> promoter fused to <italic>lacZ</italic>. pAED4Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) is a pUC19-derived plasmid in which the PhoQ sensor domain (residues 43&#x02013;190) is expressed from the phage T7 &#x003c6;10 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>)<italic>.

Two molecules were found in the asymmetric unit in space group P4<sub>1</sub>. As for the wild-type structure, these molecules are related by a quasi-diad axis of symmetry, but the arrangement is very different in this case (see below). Residues at positions 43&#x02013;188 and 45&#x02013;190 of molecule A and B, respectively, were found to be ordered. A total of 292 residues, 336 water molecules, and 1 sulfate ion was refined to <italic>R</italic> and <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> values of 16.8% and 23.0%, respectively, at a resolution of 2.0 &#x000c5; against data collected from a single native crystal (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>).</p><p>Both the wild-type and acidic cluster mutant PhoQ 43&#x02013;190 structures adopt a mixed &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-fold containing a central five-stranded anti-parallel &#x003b2;-sheet flanked by a long N-terminal &#x003b1;-helix and additional loops and helices on each side. This type of fold has been reported previously in the structures of other histidine kinase sensor domains such as DcuS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) and CitA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) in addition to the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> PhoQ sensor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). All four wild-type and acidic cluster mutant PhoQ 43&#x02013;190 molecules are similar. Pairwise superimposition of all molecules using LSQMAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), based on a structurally invariant core of 47 C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> positions determined at the 5&#x003c3; level of ESCET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) comparison, yields r.m.s.d. values ranging from 0.25 to 0.42 &#x000c5;. Small differences in the rest of the structure may be attributed to differences in crystal packing and a certain amount of intrinsic structural lability that may be related to protein function. The <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> sensor domains are very similar in sequence (81.3% identity), and their structures are also similar. Pairwise superimposition of the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> molecules with those of the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> PhoQ yield r.m.s.d. values ranging from 0.89 to 0.97 &#x000c5; over an average of 129 C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> positions, and matches for acidic cluster mutant PhoQ likewise yield r.m.s.d. values from 0.85 to 1.07 &#x000c5; over an average of 131 C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> positions.

The PhoQ sensor domain begins with N-terminal helix H1 (residues 46&#x02013;62), located on the backside of the central &#x003b2;-sheet. Helix H1 connects up to a pair of short antiparallel &#x003b2;-strands S&#x02032; (residues 64&#x02013;66) and S&#x02033; (residues 69&#x02013;71) that loop above the sheet. The peptide backbone then runs back down through helix H2 (residues 76&#x02013;79) and connects into the first strand S1 (residues 85&#x02013;89) of the sheet. Edge strand S2 (residues 95&#x02013;98) follows S1 and connects into helices H3a (residues 103&#x02013;108) and H3b (residues 111&#x02013;113), which cross over the front of the central sheet to join the other edge strand, S3 (residues 118&#x02013;125). Strand S3 runs down the far side of the sheet and leads to helices H4 (residues 126&#x02013;133) and H5 (residues 137&#x02013;148), which are angled below the sheet. Strand S4 (residues 154&#x02013;164), the longest strand in the structure, follows H5, and runs up the length of the central sheet. The peptide backbone then loops back down into the middle strand S5 (residues 173&#x02013;178) of the sheet, and the structure ends with helix H6 (residues 183&#x02013;185), which follows S5 and continues to the C-terminal end.</p><p>Electron-density features corresponding to non-protein moieties were found in both the wild-type and acidic cluster mutant PhoQ 43&#x02013;190 structures. In the wild-type structure, nickel ions were found associated in a similar manner with each subunit. One nickel ion is coordinated by carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp-151 and Asp-152 from the acidic cluster of subunit A and by Asp-128 from symmetry mate B&#x02032;, and the other nickel ion is coordinated by Asp-151 and Asp-152 of B and Asp-128 of A&#x02032;. Asp-128 is located on H4, and Asp-151 and Asp-152 are located in the &#x0201c;EDDDDAE&#x0201d; acidic cluster in the loop between H5 and S4, which had previously been implicated in divalent cation binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). The presence of nickel at the two sites was confirmed in a Bijvoet difference Fourier synthesis generated from a dataset collected above the nickel K-edge but below the selenium K-edge. An additional feature of nonprotein density was found in a pocket formed between the two molecules of the asymmetric unit; this was modeled as an acetate ion coordinated by side chains of residues Gln-81 of molecule A, and Arg-53 and Asn-117 of molecule B. Arg-53, Gln-81, and Asn-117 are found in H1, in the loop between H2 and S1, and in the loop between H3b and S3, respectively. Nickel was a necessary component in the crystallization buffer to obtain crystals of wild-type PhoQ 43&#x02013;190, and the addition of acetate was found to improve crystal size and appearance. In the acidic cluster mutant structure, a single region of unexpected electron density was modeled as a sulfate ion, which is complexed with water molecules coordinated by guanidinium groups of Arg-50 and Arg-53 from H1 of molecule A, and Arg-169 from the loop between S4 to S5 of molecule B. Ammonium sulfate was the main precipitant in the crystal buffer used to grow the acidic cluster mutant PhoQ 43&#x02013;190 crystals.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Structure-based sequence alignments.</bold> Structure-based sequence alignments comparing PDC to PAS domains.

We have defined the criteria for the alignments such that corresponding structurally aligned segments have at least three contiguous C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> positions lying within 2.5 &#x000c5; of each other. Pairwise sequence identities between PhoQ and these PAS domains range from 6% to 8%, and structural alignments are very restricted (30&#x02013;39 C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> positions, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). In all cases, more residues can be superimposed in alignments between different sensor domains or between different PAS domains than in alignments between sensor domains and PAS domains. Only the &#x003b2;-sheets are in common between PAS domains and the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; sensor domain; differences primarily lie in residues between the second and third &#x003b2;-strands and in the N-terminal helix, present only in sensor domains. These structural differences distinguish these sensor domains from PAS domains and have led us to term this the PDC (PhoQ-DcuS-CitA) domain.

The dimer is quasi-symmetric about an interface formed primarily by interactions between the H1 helices of each protomer that include hydrophobic contacts, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions. There are also additional interactions between residues on helix H1 and residues in the loops between S4 and S5, H2 and S1, H3b and S3, and H2 and S1. The structure reveals a salt bridge formed between Asp-179 of molecule A and Arg-50 of molecule B in which the corresponding C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> positions are separated by 11.3 &#x000c5;. A symmetrically related salt bridge between Arg-50 of molecule A and Asp-179 of molecule B is not formed due to the asymmetric nature of the dimer, which places those C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> positions 16.9 &#x000c5; apart.</p><p>The orientation of the wild-type PhoQ monomers is such that both the N-terminal H1 and C-terminal H6 helices are aligned in the same direction in a manner where the ends would be poised to enter into the transmembrane segments TM1 and TM2 of a full-length molecule. The roughly parallel arrangement of the N- and C-terminal helices in the wild-type PhoQ 43&#x02013;190 dimer is similar to that observed in the dimeric structure of the aspartate receptor Tar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). Two acid mutant molecules interact in their crystal environment through similar surfaces as those in the wild-type dimer, and they bury a substantial interface (2350 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>), but orientations are radically different. This seems to be a non-physiological arrangement, because N- and C-terminal helices point in opposite directions and the Arg-50&#x02032; &#x02192; Asp-179 salt bridge, seen below to be functionally important, does not form.</p><p><italic>Measurements of Activity in Vivo</italic>&#x02014;To examine the importance of the dimer interface, and in particular the Arg-50&#x02032; &#x02192; Asp-179 salt bridge, to the function of PhoQ, R50D and D179R single mutants, which would disrupt the salt bridge, and an R50D/D179R double mutant, which could recreate the salt bridge in the opposite direction, were constructed. An additional G54D mutant was constructed in which we reasoned the insertion of a charged residue in the hydrophobic interface would be disruptive. The abilities of such mutants to activate PhoP-mediated transcription of a <italic>phoN-lacZ</italic> reporter gene <italic>in vivo</italic> were compared with the wild-type protein. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>phoN-lacZ</italic> expression is induced to roughly 3400 units by MgCl<sub>2</sub> limitation when wild-type PhoQ protein is present, but it is only induced to only &#x0223c;900 and 245 units, respectively, when the PhoQ-R50D and PhoQ-D179R mutants are present. The effect of the double mutant is indeed compensatory rather than additive; reporter expression is activated to 2225 units for PhoQ-R50D/D179R, &#x0003e;50% of the wild-type level. The effect of the dimer-disrupting PhoQ-G54D mutant results in reporter gene induction to roughly 142 units in the magnesium limiting condition, an effect that most closely matches that of the PhoQ-D179R mutant. The mutations do not significantly affect the relative expression levels of PhoQ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). These results indicate that the salt bridge observed in the crystal structure is physiologically important in the function of the protein and suggest that the integrity of the interface is crucial for the formation of the active state.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vivo</italic> activity and relative expression levels of PhoQ.</bold><italic>A, E. coli</italic> strain CSH26&#x00394;Q/<italic>F</italic>&#x02032;<italic>lacI</italic><sup>Q</sup><italic>kan</italic>, containing the pNL3 reporter plasmid and pLPQ2 for expressing the wild-type and mutant PhoQ proteins, were assayed for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity following growth in N-media (0 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>) or as supplemented with 40 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> or 10 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

This PhoQ-DcuS-CitA (PDC) fold represents a different structural class (&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) of sensor domains from the all-helical sensor domain classes such as Tar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>) and NarX.<sup>6</sup> The PDC domain fold characteristically begins with a long N-terminal &#x003b1;-helix that leads into a central &#x003b2;-sheet core flanked by short helices on both sides. The central five-stranded antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet has the same topology as that of PAS domains, and this feature dominates in structure similarity searches. This, in turn, has led others to identify PDC sensor domains as PAS domains; however, there are no actual similarities outside the &#x003b2;-sheet, whereas PDC and PAS domains each have their own distinguishing characteristics.</p><p>The functionally important N-terminal helix is unique to PDC domains, and the segment connecting the two &#x003b2;-strands at the edges of the sheet is distinctive for PDC and PAS domains. In PDC domains, the residues between the second and third strands transverse across the front of the sheet in a single span, often helical. PhoQ residues in this region align with those in CitA and in other x-ray structures of PDC sensor domains, such as DcuS, LisK, and DctB.<sup>6</sup> In PAS domains, the segment between the second and third strands takes a longer and more tortuous path than in PDC domains, comprising multiple helices and typically ending in a helix running antiparallel to the third strand. Such differences between PDC domains (DcuS and CitA) and PAS domains were also noticed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). Certain sequence similarities have been established among PAS domain family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>), but PAS-conserved sequences are not found in the PhoQ sensor domain. It appears that, despite sharing topologically identical five-stranded &#x003b2;-sheets, PDC and PAS domains do nevertheless belong to separate protein superfamilies.</p><p>In the wild-type structure, the N-terminal helices that form the dimer interface lie in a parallel orientation, and we believe that the dimer interface observed in the wild-type PhoQ structure is biologically relevant. The orientation of the PhoQ protomers allows for the formation of the Arg-50&#x02032; &#x02192; Asp-179 salt bridge, and the physiological importance of the salt bridge to function was confirmed by our mutagenesis studies (see above). Other studies characterizing PhoQ mutants (D179A or D179L) are also consistent with importance of the salt bridge to PhoQ function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>); however, the difference in phenotypes obtained between the two sets of mutational studies on the same location may be a result of differences in charge and size of the mutant residues. Such results suggest that normal PhoQ function is dependent and sensitive to the energetics of the dimer interface.</p><p>It is believed that histidine kinase transmembrane regions form four-helical bundles as observed in the structure of the <italic>Natronobacterium pharaonis</italic> phototaxis SRII-HtrII complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). The structures of the NarX sensor domain<sup>6</sup> and the aspartate receptor Tar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>) have parallel N- and C-terminal helical regions that would be compatible with connection to such membrane-spanning regions in an intact molecule. The arrangement of the wild-type PhoQ protomers orients the N- and C-terminal helices in a parallel manner also suitable for connection with a four-helical bundle membrane-spanning region, and a similar orientation of terminal helices has also been observed in a DcuS dimer.<sup>6</sup></p><p>It must be noted that, in contrast to the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> PhoQ sensor domain, the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> PhoQ sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) shows a different putative dimeric arrangement. Distances between the two N- and C-terminal residues within the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> PhoQ dimer are reported to be 27 and 55 &#x000c5;, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), whereas the distances between N- and C-terminal residues within the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> PhoQ are each 18 &#x000c5; apart, as measured between C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> positions corresponding to residues 45 and 186 in each protomer. We believe that the dimeric arrangement of protomers in the <italic>E. coli</italic> PhoQ structure places the N- and C-terminal ends in a position more suitable for connection into a putative four-helical bundle arrangement of transmembrane helices.</p><p>The physiologically relevant Arg-50&#x02032; &#x02192; Asp-179 salt bridge observed in the wild-type PhoQ dimer is not present in the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> PhoQ dimer, which places the C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> positions of residues Arg-50 and Asp-179&#x02032;, and Arg-50&#x02032; and Asp-179, 28.1 and 27.5 &#x000c5; apart, respectively. In order for the salt bridge to form, a large rearrangement would be required at the dimer interface of the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> PhoQ structure. Asp-179 in the structure of the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> PhoQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) sensor domain participates in hydrogen bonding with the side chains of Thr-48 and Lys-186 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), and mutations of Asp-179 and Lys-186 result in impaired PhoQ function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Equivalent residues in the <italic>E. coli</italic> PhoQ sensor domain are within weak van der Vaals contact distance but are not hydrogen-bonded. It is possible that these differing arrangements of residues along the interface between the C-terminal helix and the central sheet in the two PhoQ structures may reflect different conformational signaling states. Such residues may be involved in mediating conformational changes between regions of the protein involved with ligand binding to the membrane-spanning helices. Additional experiments will be required to address such possibilities.</p><p>In an attempt to learn more about the role of the acidic cluster in PhoQ function, we solved the PhoQ 43&#x02013;190 structure containing the EDDDDAE to QNNNNAQ mutations (amino acid residues 148&#x02013;154), which render the protein defective in divalent cation binding and activation. These crystals were obtained in a buffer that lacked divalent cations, and nothing is bound to the replacement sequence, although it adopts essentially the same conformation as for the wild-type structure. The acidic cluster mutant also forms a quasi-diad dimer in the crystal; however, unlike in the wild-type dimer, here the N-terminal helices lie in an antiparallel orientation at the dimer interface and the Arg-50&#x02032; &#x02192; Asp-179 salt bridge does not form. We believe this arrangement to be non-physiological, because the N- and C-terminal pairs are too far apart to connect to the putative membrane-spanning four-helix bundle.</p><p>Self-association propensities of membrane proteins are diminished by orders of magnitude when freed from membrane tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). Thus, even though sensor domains are expected to be functionally dimerized <italic>in situ</italic> on the membrane, they may exhibit quite low dimer affinity when isolated in solution. The <italic>E. coli</italic> PhoQ sensor domain has been shown to be monomeric in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation with a lower limit of 600 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> measured for the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), and likewise both the CitA and DcuS sensor domains have also been reported to be mostly monomeric in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). It follows that a certain lability may exist in the manner by which sensor domains self-associate, and therefore dimeric interactions within in a crystal-lattice environment may not necessarily be biologically relevant. Such lability has been observed in studies involving the CitA sensor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) and in our unpublished studies<sup>6</sup> of the DctB and LisK sensor domains. In such cases, non-physiological interactions between sensor domain protomers can be found in the crystal lattice, sometimes mediated by required ions in crystallization buffers. We suggest that the &#x0201c;dimers&#x0201d; formed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> acid mutant PhoQ and <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> PhoQ structures may simply be the result of crystal packing interactions that have overridden the relatively weak affinity for the formation of a physiologically relevant dimer.</p><p>The alternative subunit association of the acid mutant PhoQ &#x0201c;dimer&#x0201d; does suggest that alteration of the acidic cluster by mutagenesis, and perhaps by divalent cation binding as well, might also affect the energetics of the dimer interface. If such effects are applicable to the intact membrane-bound molecule, then signal transduction mediated by cation binding at the acidic cluster would seem to employ a mechanism that involves a dynamic dimer interface and may not require quaternary interactions with additional proteins or with the membrane.</p><p>The PhoP-PhoQ system is activated by limiting concentrations of extracellular divalent cations. Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are thought to act in part as physiologically relevant signaling ligands by directly binding the PhoQ sensor domain and producing a conformational change that influences the enzymatic activities of the cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Although we were unable to obtain suitable crystals in the presence of either Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, the crystallization buffer contained 5 m<sc>m</sc> NiCl<sub>2</sub>, which was required for the formation of crystals. The structure of wild-type PhoQ 43&#x02013;190 contains two Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions, each associated with one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, forming lattice contacts between the side chains of Asp-151 and Asp-152, and Asp-128&#x02032; of a symmetry mate. Asp-151 and Asp-152 are part of the acidic cluster (<sup>148</sup>EDDDDAE<sup>154</sup>) that had previously been implicated in divalent cation binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Divalent cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are also associated with acid clusters of two of four <italic>Salmonella</italic> PhoQ sensor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), but that site is displaced from our Ni<sup>2+</sup> site and coordinated peripherally by Asp-149. There do not seem to be ion-associated conformational distinctions in these two structures.</p><p>Divalent cations thermodynamically stabilize the sensor domain fragment to denaturation in a fashion expected for a direct binding model, and this mode of binding requires the presence of the acidic cluster. In addition, substitution of the cluster with uncharged isosteres (QNNNNAQ) results in a protein that is defective for <italic>in vivo</italic> activation when extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations are low; however, substitution of the cluster with alanine residues (AAAAAAA) results in a protein that functions normally in response to extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8">7</xref> One possible explanation for these paradoxical results is that the sensor domain possesses one or more additional ligand binding sites, and neutralization of the acidic cluster site by conservative substitution with non-charged isosteres mimics divalent cation binding at this site to favor formation of the repressed state. When the acidic cluster site is substituted with alanines, the side chains necessary to form the repressed state are absent, and the protein can respond normally to binding at the other site(s). Interaction between a Ni<sup>2+</sup> ion and Asp-128 in the crystal structure suggests that this residue might be part of such an additional physiologically relevant divalent-cation binding site. But the D128A mutation, both in the context of the wild-type acidic cluster and the alanine-substituted cluster, results in a protein that still responds normally to extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (data not shown). Perhaps Asp-128 is not absolutely necessary for binding at the second site, Asp-128 either may not interact with Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, or such interactions do not affect protein function. Close inspection of the structure does not reveal any other potential divalent cation binding sites.</p><p>The acidic cluster resides in the lobe of PhoQ formed by the connection from H5 to S4. Alignment of PhoQ from various organisms indicates that the cluster and lobe are present in the enteric versions of PhoQ but not in non-enteric versions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>), suggesting that the acidic cluster may play a specialized role in enteric bacteria. The position of the lobe with respect to the dimer interface and the rest of the structure suggests that it might lie very close to the membrane in the intact molecule. It has been suggested that from the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> PhoQ structure that acidic regions may interact with the membrane phospholipids in a manner to allow chelation of divalent ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>); however, such a mechanism has not been established <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further research may be required to elucidate the specific role of the acidic cluster in its relation to divalent binding and signaling, and any involvement of membrane phospholipids in biological function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jbc_M710592200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jbc_M710592200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Craig Ogata and Randy Abramowitz for help with synchrotron data collection.
