Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that participate in the elimination of tumors. We report the identification of a tumor cell surface molecule that binds NKp30, a human receptor which triggers antitumor NK cell cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. This previously unannotated gene belongs to the B7 family and, hence, was designated B7-H6. B7-H6 triggers NKp30-mediated activation of human NK cells. B7-H6 was not detected in normal human tissues but was expressed on human tumor cells, emphasizing that the expression of stress-induced self-molecules associated with cell transformation serves as a mode of cell recognition in innate immunity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>NK cells are large granular lymphocytes that produce chemokines and cytokines and, so, participate in the shaping of the inflammatory and adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vivier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yokoyama, 2008</xref>). They are also an important part of the innate immune system as they directly kill transformed and virally infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smyth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lanier, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yokoyama, 2008</xref>). NK cells survey potential targets for expression of MHC class I via cell surface inhibitory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Parham, 2005</xref>). Engagement of these inhibitory receptors by MHC class I prevents NK cell activation, thereby protecting the target cells from NK cell attack. NK cell effector function thus arises in part from recognition of &#x0201c;missing self&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">K&#x000e4;rre et al., 1986</xref>). The discovery of NK-activating receptors, including the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) family, NKG2D, and DNAM-1, revealed that in addition to an absent inhibitory signal, activating signals were also necessary for NK activation and tumor cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pende et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Moretta et al., 2001</xref>). The NCR family includes NKp46 (<italic>NCR1</italic>, CD335), NKp44 (<italic>NCR2</italic>, CD336), and NKp30 (<italic>NCR3</italic>, CD337). NCR association with CD3&#x003b6;, KARAP/DAP12, and Fcr&#x003b3; immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif&#x02013;bearing transducing polypeptides is reminiscent of the architecture of other pivotal immune receptor complexes, such as the T, B, and Fc receptors, and makes them very potent activating receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bryceson et al., 2006</xref>). Although multiple ligands for NKG2D and DNAM-1 have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bottino et al., 2005</xref>), tumor cell surface ligands for the NCR family have remained elusive, hindering a complete understanding of their role in tumor surveillance. For example, despite the involvement of NKp30 in the lysis of various tumor cell lines and primary tumor cells, including carcinomas, neuroblastomas, and myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pende et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sivori et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castriconi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nowbakht et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrd et al., 2007</xref>), its tumor ligands are still unknown. The HLA&#x02013;B-associated transcript 3 (BAT3) and the pp65 proteins have been shown to bind NKp30, but they do not correspond to tumor cell surface ligands because pp65 is a human cytomegalovirus tegument protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnon et al., 2005</xref>) and BAT3 is a nuclear protein released upon heat shock treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pogge von Strandmann et al., 2007</xref>). In this paper, we report that human NKp30 directly interacts with a novel member of the B7 family that we refer to as B7-H6. Using NKp30 reporter cells, human IL-2&#x02013;driven NK cell lines, and freshly isolated human blood NK cells, we show that the expression of B7-H6 on tumor cells induces NKp30-dependent cell activation and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, B7-H6 was absent from all normal cells tested but was selectively expressed on tumor cells. These results show the first instance of a tumor-specific B7 family member that can directly trigger NK cell activation.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Identification of B7-H6 as a ligand for NKp30</title><p>The human NK-92 cell line expresses surface NKp30 (not depicted) and mediates killing of the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To search for molecules that bind to NKp30 and trigger NKp30-mediated cytolysis in NK cells, we generated soluble NKp30-Fc fusion proteins. Soluble NKp30-Fc proteins bound to K562 cells, and this binding was abolished by blocking anti-NKp30mAb (AZ20) but not by blocking control anti-NKp46 mAb (BAB281; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In addition, soluble NKp30 reduced the ability of NK-92 cells to kill K562 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Collectively, these experiments revealed K562 cells and soluble NKp30-Fc proteins as practicable tools for the identification of a cell surface ligand for NKp30.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Soluble NKp30-Fc inhibits NK-92 cytolysis and binds K562 cells.</bold> (A) Soluble NKp30-Fc inhibited the killing of K562 cells by NK-92 cells.

Biotinylated NKp30-Fc was used as a probe in chemical cross-linking studies to K562 cells. Proteins cross-linked to the NKp30-Fc protein were precipitated, separated by gel electrophoresis, and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. The resulting peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Substractive proteomic analysis was used to identify candidate NKp30 binding proteins that were unique to K562 cell lysates and were identified by two or more peptides. Two of these candidates were predicted to have transmembrane domains, and their complementary DNAs were obtained for subsequent studies. A recombinant Fc fusion form of one of these candidates (hypothetical protein DKFZp686O24166) gave specific binding to soluble NKp30 as judged by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). NKp30 interaction with DKFZp686O24166 was inhibited by anti-NKp30 mAbs (1849 and AZ20) that block NKp30-dependent NK cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of B7-H6.</bold> (A) Direct interaction of B7-H6 with NKp30 using SPR.

Interestingly, this intracytoplasmic domain also contains various signaling motifs, such as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (SaYtpL), an SH2 (Src homology 2)-binding domain (YqlQ), and an SH3-binding motif (PdaPilPvsP), suggesting the possibility that DKFZp686O24166 could provide signals when engaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). A BLAST query revealed that two of the most related proteins are members of the B7 family (B7-H1 and B7-H3). Like all known B7 family members (B7.1, B7.2, B7-DC, and B7-H1 to B7-H4/B7h.5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zou and Chen, 2008</xref>), DKFZp686O24166 has two Ig domains with adjacent phase 1 introns in the extracellular region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). TPSNR (tapasin-related protein), PVR (poliovirus receptor; CD155), CADM3 (cell adhesion molecule 3), and CXADR (Coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor) also showed amino acid similarity, but their gene and predicted domain organization were different from those of DKFZp686O24166. Further protein homology analysis revealed that the percentage of DKFZp686O24166 identity with other B7 family members is comparable to the percentages of identity observed within this group of distantly related molecules (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090681/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>). In addition, a BLAST query revealed that the closest homologue of NKp30 was CTLA-4, a receptor for B7.1 and B7.2. Like other members of the CD28 family, NKp30 has a single predicted IgV domain in its extracellular region, whereas nearly all other Ig domain&#x02013;containing immunoreceptors have multiple Ig domains. Moreover, the gene structure of the extracellular region is identical between NKp30 and all other CD28 family genes. Specifically, there is an exon containing the leader peptide, followed by a phase 1 intron, then the exon containing the IgV domain, and another phase 1 intron, followed by a short exon containing the transmembrane region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The only other proteins identified to date that have this exact gene structure are the known members of the CD28 family including CD28, CTLA-4 (CD152), BTLA (CD272), ICOS (CD278), and PD-1 (CD279). NKp30 could thus be considered as a member of the CD28 family whose members do not share significant sequence similarity to each other but do share a similar gene structure. Thus, because DKFZp686O24166 had a gene and protein structure similar to that of other members of the B7 family, two of its closest homologues were members of that group, and its putative counter structure, NKp30, is related to the CD28 family, we designated the gene B7-H6. B7-H6 was present in genomic clone AC124798 (available at GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ) which maps to chromosome region 11p15.1. A short region corresponding to the first exon of human B7-H6 was found in the mouse genome (near bp 47,000 of AC146610.4, available at GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ), but a full-length gene sequence was not evident. This mouse exon appears to have intact splice sites at either end, but no other nearby regions of the mouse genome have other exons related to B7-H6. Finally, this isolated exon from the mouse does not have any related ESTs from mouse libraries, and we conclude that the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> genome is missing a full-length gene corresponding to human <italic>B7-H6</italic>.</p><p>Given the structure of B7-H6, we also tested it for possible interactions with the other known CD28 family members but only observed binding with soluble NKp30 (unpublished data). Moreover, B7-H6 did not bind to other NK-activating receptors including NKp44, NKp46, and NKG2D (unpublished data). No binding of NKp30-Fc to B7.1, B7-DC, B7-H3, 4IgB7-H3, or B7-H1 could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). These results indicated that the extracellular domain of NKp30 directly and selectively interacts with the extracellular domain of B7-H6, a novel member of the B7 family.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional significance of B7-H6 surface expression</title><p>The IL-2&#x02013;producing DO11.10 mouse T cell hybridoma expressing a chimeric receptor formed by NKp30 extracellular domain fused to CD3&#x003b6; (DOMSP30 cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schleinitz et al., 2008</xref>) was used as a reporter cell system to evaluate whether B7-H6 was able to induce signaling directly through NKp30. DOMSP30 reporter cells were activated by plate-bound anti-NKp30 mAbs, which is in contrast to DOMSP46 reporter cells expressing a NKp46-CD3&#x003b6; chimeric receptor which were selectively responsive to NKp46 cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). DOMSP30 reporter cells produced IL-2 in the presence of P815 expressing B7-H6 (P815.B7-H6), whereas P815 expressing a control protein (P815.B7-H1) failed to elicit such a response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Parental DO11.10 cells and DOMSP46 reporter cells were unresponsive to P815.B7-H6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). IL-2 production was markedly reduced by addition of either blocking anti-NKp30 mAb F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> or affinity-purified B7-H6 antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). No inhibition was observed with blocking anti-NKp46 mAb F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> controls. Together, these results show that B7-H6 engagement of the NKp30/CD3&#x003b6; chimera leads to cell activation. To further examine the functional significance of the interaction of NKp30 with B7-H6, parental P815 cells and P815.B7-H6 cells were used as targets for the NK-92 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Although parental P815 cells were lysed poorly by NK-92 cells, P815.B7-H6 cells were lysed effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). This susceptibility to cytolysis was impaired by addition of soluble NKp30-Fc but not by addition of soluble B7-H3-Fc control proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). P815.B7-H6 cells were also lysed by IL-2&#x02013;activated primary human NK cells and this cytotoxicity was blocked by addition of soluble NKp30-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). These data indicate that B7-H6 expression on tumor cells can confer sensitivity to NKp30-specific cytolysis. Consistent with these data, freshly isolated blood NK cells were activated by P815.B7-H6 cells but not by P815.B7-H1 cells, as assessed by cell surface expression of CD107a (LAMP-1) and intracytoplasmic detection of IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). That a tumor ligand for the activating receptor NKp30 was a member of the B7 family was an unexpected finding. Indeed, recent studies have shown that human and rodent cancer cells up-regulate expression of B7 molecules, such as B7-H1, 4IgB7-H3, and B7-H4, but this expression has been proposed to contribute to tumor immune evasion by engaging inhibitory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castriconi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zou and Chen, 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>B7-H6 cell surface expression triggers NKp30-dependent cell activation.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) DO.11.10, DOMSP30, and DOMSP46 cells were stimulated using the indicated plate-bound mAbs (A) or P815.B7-H1 versus P815.B7-H6 cells in the absence (B) or presence of indicated F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> mAbs or B7-H6 mouse antiserum (C).

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of B7-H6 messenger RNA (mRNA) on a normal tissue array showed no detectable expression in any of the 48 normal tissues assayed (unpublished data). This paucity of B7-H6 mRNA in normal tissues was consistent with microarray analysis of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shyamsundar et al., 2005</xref>; and not depicted). Collectively with the fact that few expressed sequence tags for B7-H6 have been identified, these data suggest that B7-H6 is not abundantly expressed in any normal tissues examined. This was also supported by the failure to detect B7-H6 at the surface of freshly isolated PBMCs from all donors tested using affinity-purified B7-H6 antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) or mAbs directed against B7-H6 (not depicted).

It is of note that although NKp30 has a role in NK cell&#x02013;DC cross-talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferlazzo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vitale et al., 2005</xref>), no B7-H6 mRNA or protein expression was detected when assaying resting or activated DCs generated from PBMCs with IL-4 and GM-CSF (unpublished data). It is therefore possible that BAT3 serves as a ligand for NKp30 on DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Simhadri et al., 2008</xref>), indicating that NKp30 might interact with several ligands, as this is the case for NKG2D and DNAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Raulet, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Soriani et al., 2009</xref>). Along this line, it has been shown that NKp30 and other NCRs can recognize heparan sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hecht et al., 2009</xref>). Heparan sulfates are found in the commonest linkage type with xylose O-glycosidically linked to serine. No potential O-glycosylation sites could be found in B7-H6. There are also studies where heparan sulfate has been generated as N-glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sundblad et al., 1988</xref>), and the extracytoplasmic domain of B7-H6 harbors nine potential N-glycosylation sites. It thus remains to be tested whether the glycosylation of B7-H6 might contribute to its interaction with NKp30, although we could not alter DOMSP30 cell activation by addition of heparan sulfate (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>B7-H6 is not detected on blood cells but is expressed on tumor cells.</bold> (A and B) Assessment of B7-H6 cell surface staining on PBMCs, P815 cell transfectants, and tumor cells was performed by flow cytometry using anti&#x02013;B7-H6 mouse antiserum.

In preliminary experiments, no induction of B7-H6 cell surface expression was detected under various conditions of cellular stress such as heat shock, genotoxicity (&#x003b3; radiation or sodium butyrate treatment), or inhibition of proteasomal degradation (MG-132 treatment). In contrast, B7-H6 was expressed at the surface of several tumor cell lines including T and B lymphomas, myeloid leukemias, melanomas, carcinomas, and large T SV40 antigen-transformed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In a broader survey, B7-H6 expression was detected on 24 of 119 cancer cell lines (unpublished data). The surface expression of B7-H6 was also tested on primary tumor blood and bone marrow cells obtained at diagnosis from 43 individuals with a variety of hematological malignancies, including acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL; <italic>n</italic> = 20), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; <italic>n</italic> = 11), and non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma (<italic>n</italic> = 12). B7-H6 expression was observed on circulating tumor cells from three patients with ANLL, two patients with T-ALL, and one patient with marginal zone lymphoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). B7-H6 cell surface expression correlated with the binding of NKp30-Fc to the cell surface and with the capacity of tumor cell lines to activate resting blood NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>). Collectively, these data indicated that B7-H6 is a major NKp30 ligand on tumor cells of various origins, including K562, a prototypical model of tumor NK cell target.</p><p>The absence of B7-H6 mRNA in normal tissues, coupled with its relative abundance among tumor cells, indicates that its expression is up-regulated by tumor transformation. These findings highlight the role of tumor-induced self-molecules in alerting innate immunity and prompt further investigations on whether B7-H6 expression correlates with tumor prognosis in a large cohort of patients and on the regulation of B7-H6 expression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Soluble recombinant proteins.</title><p>In-frame fusion proteins of the extracellular domains of NKp30 (aa 1&#x02013;132) or of B7-H6 (aa 1&#x02013;267) and an effector-negative version of the mouse IgG2a Fc region (aa 216 through the C-terminal lysine) were constructed in a mammalian expression vector (NKp30-mFc).
