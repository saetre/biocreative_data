In this study, we show that CERT is an essential gene for mouse development and embryonic survival and, quite strikingly, is critical for mitochondrial integrity. CERT mutant embryos accumulate ceramide in the ER but also mislocalize ceramide to the mitochondria, compromising their function. Cells in mutant embryos show abnormal dilation of the ER and degenerating mitochondria. These subcellular changes manifest as heart defects and cause severely compromised cardiac function and embryonic death around embryonic day 11.5. In spite of ceramide accumulation, CERT mutant mice do not die as a result of enhanced apoptosis. Instead, cell proliferation is impaired, and expression levels of cell cycle&#x02013;associated proteins are altered. Individual cells survive, perhaps because cell survival mechanisms are activated. Thus, global compromise of ER and mitochondrial integrity caused by ceramide accumulation in CERT mutant mice primarily affects organogenesis rather than causing cell death via apoptotic pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>R.P.

Several intermediates of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway are known as second messengers that mediate processes such as angiogenesis, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merrill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haberkant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). Ceramide is a precursor for the synthesis of several sphingolipids. In addition to being an obligate intermediate in the de novo sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway, ceramide has been implicated as a mediator of stress responses, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hannun and Obeid, 2008</xref>). Its involvement in apoptosis is clinically significant: many chemotherapeutic agents for cancer appear to induce ceramide-dependent apoptosis, and some of the associated enzymes and proteins, including ceramide transfer protein (CERT), are being investigated as targets for cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ogretmen and Hannun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Savtchouk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swanton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zeidan and Hannun, 2007</xref>). Many of the fundamental questions pertaining to the study of ceramide and sphingolipid-mediated cell regulation remain unresolved.</p><p>Sphingolipids are vectorially synthesized in the cell. The de novo biosynthesis begins with the condensation of serine and a fatty acyl Co-A; a series of reactions follow that leads to the generation of ceramide in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Menaldino et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanada, 2006</xref>). The subsequent steps of sphingolipid biosynthesis, including those of sphingomyelin and complex sphingolipids, require ceramide to be transported from the ER to the Golgi complex. Because ceramide is highly insoluble, an energy barrier impedes the movement of ceramide from one membrane to another, and cells accumulate pools of ceramide in different subcellular compartments. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanada et al. (2003)</xref> demonstrated that CERT, a member of the signal transduction and activation of the RNA family of proteins, is responsible for the bulk of the ceramide transport from the ER to the Golgi complex. It localizes to the ER and the Golgi complex. CERT has three functional domains known to be involved in ceramide transport. An amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain recognizes phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and targets CERT to the Golgi. An FFAT motif near the middle of the molecule is thought to interact with vesicle-associated membrane protein&#x02013;associated protein to recruit CERT to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawano et al., 2006</xref>). The C-terminal steroidogenic acute regulatory protein&#x02013;related domain extracts ceramide from the ER membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Isolation of CERT-deficient (<italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic>) mice.</bold> (A) The genomic organization of <italic>Cert</italic> is shown, and the location of the gene trap vector in the ES cell line RRF047 is depicted in the middle panel.

We found that CERT is essential for embryonic survival, at least in part because of defects in proliferation and organogenesis with underlying ER and mitochondrial defects. Strikingly, this study also suggests that defects in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway that lead to ceramide accumulation can cause severe developmental disruption without inducing apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of <italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> mice</title><p>The mouse <italic>Cert</italic> gene is on chromosome 13 and is encoded by 18 exons. The transcript has a short and a long form, with the short form containing 2,668 bp and the long form containing 2,746 bp. The respective proteins contain 624 and 598 amino acids. To generate a mouse mutant of <italic>Cert</italic> (affecting both forms), we used the gene trap embryonic stem (ES) cell line RRF047 from BayGenomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stryke et al., 2003</xref>). We obtained the ES cell line and confirmed the insertion of the gene trap vector (pGT2Lxf) by RT-PCR and sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The vector carries a splice acceptor sequence upstream of a galactosidase reporter gene, <italic>&#x003b2;-geo</italic> (a fusion of &#x003b2;-galactosidase and neomycin phosphotransferase II). A PCR genotyping strategy differentiated the mutant and wild-type alleles from DNA extracted from embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The deleted allele was null or severely hypomorphic because embryos homozygous for this allele, <italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> (labeled &#x02212;/&#x02212; in figures) embryos, did not generate full-length RNA as determined by RT-PCR, and there was little or no CERT detectable by Western analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). In contrast, CERT was clearly expressed in heterozygotes, <italic>Cert<sup>&#x0002b;/gt</sup></italic> (&#x0002b;/&#x02212;), although the amount was lower than in the wild type, <italic>Cert<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;). Because the expression of the inserted &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene is under the control of the endogenous <italic>Cert</italic> promoter, we expected &#x003b2;-galactosidase to be expressed in all of the tissues that normally express CERT. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase staining of embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) embryos showed strong staining in homozygous mutant embryos, intermediate staining in heterozygotes, and none in wild-type embryos (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807176/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807176/DC1</ext-link>).

Because ceramide transport from the ER to the Golgi is compromised in the CERT mutants, the wild-type levels of total ceramide in the mutant could be explained if the ceramide level were lower than normal in the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane and higher than normal in the ER. Therefore, we measured the ceramide levels in these organelles from E10.5 wild-type and mutant embryos by MS.

In many instances, these engorged ERs were accompanied by the accumulation of lipoid bodies in their vicinity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, bottom right, white arrow).

To address this, we examined the cells of the developing optic cup, an easily identifiable area of the developing embryo, by TEM. Mitochondrial changes similar to the ones seen in the heart were predominant in these optic cup cells in the mutant E10.5 embryos (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807176/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807176/DC1</ext-link>).

Although not as abundant as at E10.5, ER engorgement, vesiculation, and mitochondrial changes were visible in the E9.5 embryos in differentiating cells of both the optic cup and the heart, including the myocardial cells (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807176/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807176/DC1</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Chronic ER stress in <italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> embryos</title><p>The morphological features of <italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> mutant cells are reminiscent of cells undergoing ER stress. ER stress manifests in cells as ER proliferation, dilation, and vesiculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scheuner and Kaufman, 2008</xref>). ER distension is a hallmark for cells that have defective protein folding in the ER lumen and is observed in response to the pharmacological induction of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ermonval et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Umebayashi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scheuner et al., 2005</xref>). The ER is responsible for the synthesis of roughly a third of the proteins generated in a cell. Several hundred proteins, including those involved in lipid biosynthesis, are up-regulated when the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway is activated in yeast upon ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Travers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Anken and Braakman, 2005</xref>). It has become increasingly clear that components of the UPR are also up-regulated during development and differentiation in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reimold et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertolotti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). The defective transport of ceramide in vivo may therefore stress the ER and affect the viability of the cell and of the organism as a whole. Although it has been proposed that the accumulation of ceramide in the ER could cause stress, this has not been demonstrated experimentally.</p><p>We used Western blot analysis to compare the steady-state levels of a panel of proteins implicated in the ER stress response, i.e., BiP, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), IRE1-&#x003b1;, protein kinase&#x02013;like ER kinase (PERK), eIF2-&#x003b1;, and C/EBP homologous protein, in E10.5 <italic>Cert<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

These proteins collectively monitor the quality of the proteins synthesized in the ER. Activation of these three proteins either in isolation or in concert when unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER or the ER is subjected to stress is thought to initiate a transcriptional and translational program. Acute or low-level chronic stress of the ER will initiate protective responses, and the cells adapt by regulating the induction of chaperones and modulating the capacity of the ER to synthesize and properly fold new proteins. However, severe or persistently toxic ER stress that cannot be resolved can activate components of the cell death pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> embryos exhibit evidence of ER stress.</bold> (A) Western blot analysis of cell extracts of E10.5 wild-type and <italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> embryos probed for proximal sensors such as phosphorylated PERK, IRE1-&#x003b1;, and ATF6 showing no or a slight increase in levels, a situation not different from cells in states of chronic stress.

In addition, phosphorylated eIF2-&#x003b1;, which is implicated in cell cycle arrest and attenuates the translation of general proteins under ER stress, leading to adaptation, was significantly up-regulated in the <italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). It is worth noting that the phosphorylation of eIF2-&#x003b1; has been reported to increase significantly during the G2/M phase in Ba/F3 cells and at the G2/M boundary in human osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Datta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tinton et al., 2005</xref>).

To evaluate whether the growth defects began in early embryogenesis, we examined the outgrowth of <italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> blastocysts. E3.5 blastocysts were outgrown in ES media for 3 d, and no obvious developmental defect was found (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807176/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807176/DC1</ext-link>).

Gross examination of the mutant embryos at E10.5 did not reveal any major developmental defects, except in the heart.

MAPK and Akt/PKB signaling play critical roles in cell survival during stress. Therefore, we evaluated the steady-state levels of these proteins in wild-type and mutant embryos by Western blotting.

Also, the total level of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, a key molecule released from mitochondria into the cytosol in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, was clearly decreased in the <italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> embryos. In contrast, the level of apoptosis-induced factor was not affected (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Because the <italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> embryos showed no sign of apoptosis, it was clear that several factors influenced the survival of the CERT-deficient cells, although the compensation was not vigorous enough to overcome the growth delays imposed on cells under chronic ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rutkowski et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggested that although activators of apoptosis were initiated in the CERT-deficient cells, the effectors were not deployed to execute apoptosis. One reason for the lack of deployment could be the low level of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> in the mutant embryos. In addition, the predominant activation of proteins in the cell survival pathways of the MAPKs could contribute to this effect. We have also confirmed that CERT deficiency does not inherently compromise the apoptotic potential of the mutant cells. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) can be derived and cultured from the mutant E9.5 embryos. Although they are slightly growth inhibited compared with similarly derived wild-type MEFs, they are capable of undergoing actinomycin D&#x02013;induced apoptosis ex vivo (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807176/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807176/DC1</ext-link>). A very high ADP/ATP charge ratio, an indicator of the inability to undergo apoptosis, was also not a contributing factor in the mutant embryos because these ratios were similar in the wild-type and the mutant embryos. Also, total ATP levels were comparable between the wild-type and mutant embryonic extracts, implying that insufficient ATP was not responsible for the failure to undergo apoptosis (unpublished data).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we showed that CERT, a protein that transports ceramide from the ER to the Golgi, is essential for survival in mice. Mice lacking CERT die at E11.5 because of cardiac abnormalities manifesting as a result of underlying structural and functional defects in ER and mitochondria. The in vivo significance of ceramide transfer from the ER to the Golgi was studied recently using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rao et al., 2007</xref>). Flies lacking a functional CERT protein are viable and fertile but die prematurely as a result of accelerated aging. The different outcomes in these organisms stem not only from the differences in their developmental programs but also from differences in the underlying biochemical changes accompanying the CERT deficiency.</p><p>CERT mutants in both organisms have decreased sphingomyelin levels (CPE in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). Although there is a fourfold decrease in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult, there is slightly more than a twofold decrease in the mutant mouse embryos. This is probably because the mouse embryos, unlike <italic>Drosophila</italic>, developed within the uterus of a heterozygous mother, where sphingomyelin, a component of plasma lipoprotein fraction, can be delivered to the developing embryos through the amniotic fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Subbaiah and Liu, 1993</xref>). In an analogous situation, CERT-deficient CHO cells (Ly-A), when grown in the presence of serum, do not show changes in steady-state sphingomyelin levels because they can incorporate the metabolites from the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukasawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>). However, experimental evidence for this explanation of the differences in sphingomyelin levels is lacking. In any case, the effects of the decrease differ in mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic>: the very significant decrease in the CPE levels of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CERT mutants affects plasma membrane fluidity and initiates oxidative stress; the smaller decrease in sphingomyelin in the CERT-deficient mouse embryo did not alter plasma membrane fluidity. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, total ceramide levels decrease by 80%, whereas they remain unchanged in mice. However, in the mouse embryo, a 200% increase in ceramide levels in the ER instigates a series of pathophysiological changes and ultimately causes early embryonic lethality.</p><p>The most important finding of this study is the impact of deficient ceramide transport on mitochondrial structure and function in mice. Mass spectrometric data indicated increased levels of ceramide in the mitochondria and ER, and electron micrographic pictures showed progressive degeneration of the mitochondria. The changes in ceramide levels and in the structure and function of mitochondria that accompany the CERT deficiency in mice support the idea that ceramide is normally directly transferred from the ER to the mitochondria. Studies have demonstrated a close functional link between the ER and mitochondrial physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Copeland and Dalton, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruby et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morre et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meier et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eggens et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vance, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rizzuto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franzini-Armstrong, 2007</xref>). Several of these studies have even demonstrated a physical link between the ER and mitochondria. ER membranes called mitochondria-associated membranes are physically and functionally allied with mitochondria and have been implicated in the integration of several aspects of ER and mitochondrial function. Mitochondria-associated membranes are also involved in multiple mechanisms of the cooperative synthesis by the two organelles of the mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase and phospho- and glycerosphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shore and Tata, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vance, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Meer and Lisman, 2002</xref>). A recent electron tomography study demonstrated the existence of 10-nm and 25-nm tethers connecting smooth and rough ER, respectively, to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Csordas et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, although sphingolipid levels are low in mitochondria, some enzymes involved in the de novo steps of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway, including ceramide synthase and ceramidase, have been reported to localize to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bionda et al., 2004</xref>). Our data support the idea that some mechanism exists for the transfer of ceramide from the ER to the mitochondria, either by physical continuity between the organelles or by a transfer protein. Although delivering sphingolipid metabolites to the mitochondria may serve a useful function in healthy cells, it might also serve to mitigate the effect of the sphingolipids accumulating in the ER during stressful or pathological conditions.</p><p>In a recent study probing the mechanism of drug resistance in tumor cells, it was shown that down-regulation of CERT sensitized these cells to the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel and potentiated paclitaxel-induced ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swanton et al., 2007</xref>). However, in this study, we demonstrate that under physiological conditions, in vivo loss of CERT induces a state of chronic stress in the ER and, most importantly, compromises mitochondrial structure and function. The state of chronic stress in CERT mutant embryos is comparable with that of cells that are exposed to chronic ER stress but that have adapted to the stress. In a study of different states of ER stress, cells exposed to low concentrations of tunicamycin showed UPR activation and ER perturbation, but the cells still proliferated, although at a slower rate than untreated cells, and did not show any signs of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rutkowski et al., 2006</xref>). The chronically stressed cells achieved confluence and could be passaged for as long as their untreated counterparts (and they eventually achieved a near-normal growth rate) despite the continued presence of tunicamycin in the culture. Thus, the decreased proliferation of the tunicamycin-treated cells was caused by a growth delay, and chronic ER stress by exogenous pharmacological manipulation does not necessarily result in cell death, although death could be caused by a secondary mitigating event. Similarly, physiological activation of the UPR is observed in B lymphocytes as a result of increased demands of protein secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu and Kaufman, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The lack of CERT function in mice did not result in cell death. The biochemical data suggest that the cells mounted an adaptation response to the ER and mitochondrial stress in the mutant embryos. Because CERT performs a fundamental function in sphingolipid metabolism, it is present in all cells and tissues. Perhaps surprisingly, although none of the cells in the <italic>Cert<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> mice could transport ceramide, they could still divide at a compromised rate, and they progressed through a nearly normal developmental program until about E10&#x02013;11.5.</p><p>This stage is a remarkable period in mouse development. Beginning around E8 and lasting until around E11.5, there is a sudden increase in the growth and complexity of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Viragh and Challice, 1973</xref>). The sudden shift in the pace of division and differentiation imposed on the CERT mutant cells at these stages apparently outstrips the ability of these compromised cells to respond to developmental signals. This notion is partly supported by our EM data that showed at E9.5 the beginnings of changes to the mitochondria and ER that were much more obvious at E10.5. That the animals died of cardiovascular defects is very reasonable in this context. During the 24-h window between E8.0 and E9.0, the linear dimensions of the heart increase four- to fivefold, which apparently pushed the mutant cells beyond their capacity to adapt. Because a functional circulatory system is an early requirement for survival and growth, its developmental failure resulted in early death attributable to the lack of CERT function. However, the underlying pathology existed in all of the embryonic cells, as indicated by the similar mitochondrial and ER changes observed in the cells of the developing eye.</p><p>Our study clearly demonstrates that manipulation of sphingolipid flux in vivo and the consequent accumulation of ceramide within cellular compartments do not necessarily end in apoptotic cell death. In the present study, it leads to defects in cell cycle and differentiation caused by the stress imposed on the ER and mitochondria. In sum, our combined approach has identified the essential role of CERT in mammalian embryogenesis and provided molecular insight into the role of the de novo sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway in influencing the ER-dependent structure/function of mitochondria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of CERT knockout mice</title><p>The BayGenomics mouse (strain 129/Ola) ES cell line RRF047 was obtained and confirmed by RT-PCR.
