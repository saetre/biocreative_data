While wild type PARP-2 interacted with importin &#x003b1;3 and to a very weak extent with importin &#x003b1;1 and importin &#x003b1;5, the mutant PARP-2 (K36R) did not interact with importin &#x003b1;3, providing a molecular explanation why PARP-2 (K36R) is not targeted to the nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results provide strong evidence that lysine 36 of PARP-2 is a critical residue for proper nuclear targeting of PARP-2 and consequently for the execution of its biological functions.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Poly-ADP-ribosylation reactions occur both in multi- and unicellular organisms and play a major role in a wide range of biological processes, such as maintenance of genomic stability, transcriptional regulation and cell death (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). The enzyme responsible for the synthesis of poly-ADP-ribose was named poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). For a long time, PARP-1 was thought to be the only enzyme with poly-ADP-ribosylation activity in mammalian cells; however, primary cells derived from <italic>parp-1 </italic>knockout mice can still synthesize poly-ADP-ribose polymers after DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This led to the identification of five novel poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes, indicating that PARP-1 belongs to a family of at least six members ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). PARP-2 and PARP-1 can homo- and heterodimerize and display partially redundant functions as indicated by the embryonic lethality of the <italic>parp1-parp2</italic>-double gene disruption ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]).</p><p>Mouse PARP-2 was described as a 66 kDa nuclear protein with poly-ADP-ribosylating activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The amino-terminal region of PARP-2 (aa 1&#x02013;90), containing the DNA binding SAP domain, has no significant homology with any other PARP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, it is rich in basic amino acids (27% Lys or Arg), which are likely to be involved in DNA binding (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). On the other hand, these basic residues could be involved in the nuclear and/or nucleolar targeting of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Previous studies suggested that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of mPARP-2 is indeed located in the amino-terminal part between aa 1&#x02013;69 of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Meder et al. postulated a bipartite NLS for PARP-2, but did not provide further experimental evidences to support their hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, the amino-terminal region of human and mouse PARP-2 shows higher sequence variability compared to the highly conserved carboxy-terminal catalytic region (62% identity between the amino-terminus of mPARP-2 and hPARP-2). In cells, PARP-2 has been described to regulate different processes via protein-protein interactions mediated by its amino-terminal domain (aa 1&#x02013;208; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]).</p><p>Karyopherins, including both importins and exportins, consitute a conserved family of mobile targeting receptors that mediate the bidirectional trafficking of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Most karyopherins interact directly with cargo molecules that contain nuclear import and export signals. However, importin &#x003b1; functions as an adaptor that links classical NLS (cNLS)-containing proteins to importin &#x003b2;, which, in turn, docks the ternary complex at the nuclear-pore complex (NPC). The importin &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer is predicted to target hundreds of proteins to the NPC and facilitate their translocation across the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The importin &#x003b1; gene family has undergone considerable expansion during the course of eukaryotic evolution. Whereas the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genome encodes a single importin &#x003b1;, the human genome encodes six genes that fall into three phylogenetically distinct groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The nuclear targeting signal in the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen was characterized more than 20 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Since then, several pathways for nucleocytoplasmic transport have been described, of which the classical nuclear import pathway is the best characterized. cNLSs are typified by either a single cluster of basic amino acids (monopartite NLS) or two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a 10&#x02013;12 amino acid linker (bipartite NLS). The SV40 large T antigen (PKKKRKV) and nucleoplasmin (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK) cNLSs are the prototypic monopartite and bipartite cNLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Through alanine scanning of the Myc, monopartite SV40, and artificial bipartite SV40 cNLS, Hodel and colleagues found that the binding affinity of a cNLS for importin measured <italic>in vitro </italic>correlated with the steady state nuclear accumulation and import rate of the corresponding cNLS cargo <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that lysine 36 in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of PARP-2, which lies within a predicted cNLS motif, is required for complex formation with the importin proteins and subsequent nuclear import of PARP-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Lysine 36 and/or lysine 37 of PARP-2 are required for nuclear translocation of PARP-2</title><p>Previous experiments with GFP-fusion proteins revealed that the nuclear targeting signal of PARP-2 may be localized between aa 1&#x02013;69 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This region of the protein was previously postulated to contain a bipartite cNLS; however, this sequence would be an atypical bipartite cNLS as the linker separating the two basic regions is longer than the typical 10&#x02013;12 amino acid linker. This region does contain a predicted monopartite cNLS that closely matches the canonical SV40 cNLS sequence. To assess whether these sequences are important for nuclear translocation of PARP-2, mutant forms of PARP-2, K19/20R, K36/37R, and K19/20/36/37R, were generated by replacing the lysine residues with arginine residues to maintain the positive charge of the amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To exclude the possibility that these amino acid changes altered the stability of the mutated PARP-2, wild type and all mutant forms were expressed as HA-tagged proteins in 293T cells and detected by immunoblot using an anti-HA antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Immunoblot analysis revealed that all mutants were expressed at a level comparable to wild type PARP-2.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The putative NLS of PARP-2 contains several conserved lysine residues</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>Three lysines in the putative NLS of PARP-2 are conserved between different mammalian species.

To investigate whether substitution of K36 and K37 with other amino acids altered the localization of PARP-2, similar experiments were repeated with different amino acid susbstitutions.

In order to test whether PARP-2 interacts with importin &#x003b1;, we performed GST pull-down experiments with different recombinant purified GST-fusion proteins of human importin &#x003b1; (&#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;3, &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;7; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and cell extracts containing overexpressed wild type or different mutated PARP-2 proteins.

Here, we provide both biochemical and functional evidence that substitution of lysine residue 36 efficiently inhibits localization of PARP-2 to the nucleus. Functional analyses revealed that lysine 36 is important for complex formation with importin &#x003b1;3.</p><p>Lysine residues are central components of classical NLS motifs (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]) as their positive charge mediates the interaction with importin receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Here we provide evidence that K36 of PARP-2 is an important residue required for the nuclear translocation of PARP-2 and for complex formation with importin &#x003b1;3, as mutation of this residue was sufficient to disrupt association with the import machinery and subsequently alter PARP-2 nuclear localization. Interestingly, lysine 36 is conserved between mouse and human PARP-2, suggesting that the described findings might also apply for the human counterpart. Together, our data indicate that the nuclear import of human and murine PARP-2 is mediated by a conserved classical monopartite NLS but not through a bipartite NLS as previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The formation of the importin-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-cNLS cargo ternary complex is the first step in the nuclear transport of hundreds of different nuclear proteins, and, as such, is tightly regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The relationship of importin &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; with its cNLS cargo is by necessity bipolar, because it forms highly selective and tight complexes in the cytoplasm and then switches to an extremely low affinity state in the nucleus to release the cargo. When importin &#x003b1; is not bound to importin &#x003b2;, an autoinhibitory sequence within the amino-terminal domain apparently interacts with the NLS-binding pocket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This interaction is not exceptionally strong because cNLS cargos can still bind to importin &#x003b1; in the absence of importin &#x003b2;, albeit with significantly lower affinity. The order of importin &#x003b1; binding to cNLS cargo and importin &#x003b2; is not known. The observed lack of importin &#x003b1;3 binding by the PARP-2 mutant (K36R) clearly indicates that this lysine is required for the interaction with importin &#x003b1; and subsequently for nuclear translocation.</p><p>Recently, it has become evident that importin &#x003b1; receptors have independent roles in the assembly of macromolecular structures. Genetic analyses of yeast importin &#x003b1; mutants identified several alleles that confer defects in chromosome and nuclear segregation, altered mitotic spindle structure and deficits in the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Mechanistic studies on the roles of importin &#x003b1;s in mitosis, spindle assembly and nuclear envelope biogenesis point more directly to activities which are independent of the housekeeping roles of importin &#x003b1; in nuclear transport. The observed interaction of PARP-2 with importin &#x003b1; might thus not only be important for its nuclear translocation but might have an additional physiological function in maintaining the integrity of the genome. Inactivation of the <italic>parp-2 </italic>gene in mice revealed that PARP-2 may be involved in the surveillance and maintenance of genome integrity, indicated by the sensitivity of these mice to ionizing radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Others have reported that PARP-2 is enriched within the whole nucleolus and partially colocalizes with the nucleolar factor nucleophosmin/B23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Using partial cDNA fragments in-frame with the carboxy-terminus of EGFP the authors described a putative nuclear localization signal and a nucleolar localization signal within the amino-terminal domain of PARP-2 (aa 1&#x02013;69). Our studies revealed that overexpressed PARP-2 was only found equally distributed in the nucleus, but in contradiction to this previous report, was never observed in the nucleolus of the cell. This discrepancy could be explained by the different experimental approaches used. Meder et al. studied the nucleolar localization of PARP-2 with GFP-fusion proteins, while our studies were performed with non-GFP tagged full-length proteins. Remarkably, PARP-1 nucleolar accumulation was not observed when endogenous or overexpressed PARP-1 localization was analyzed by a conventional immunofluorecence protocol as described in Methods using specific anti-PARP-1 antibodies (data not shown). Only applying the fixation protocol described in Meder et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which led to the decomposition of the cell and loss of cytoplasm, revealed the reported nucleolar staining of PARP-1, suggesting that the fixation protocol influences the nucleolar localization of proteins or the detection of proteins within the nucleolus.</p><p>Recently, acetylation of lysine residues by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein) and PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor), has been proposed as a new mechanism for modulating cellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. HATs trigger the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue not only on core histones but also on about 40 transcription factors and on more than 30 other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].
