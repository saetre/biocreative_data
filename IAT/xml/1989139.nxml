Thus, IgA-expressing plasma blasts and plasma cells (IgA-ASC) are characterized by a number of surface receptor proteins, including CCR9, CCR3, and CCR10, that are ligated by specific chemokines. In particular, it has been shown that CCR9 ligates the CC chemokine CCL25 (also known as thymus-expressed chemokine, or TECK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Hieshima2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Williams1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas both CCR10 and CCR3 bind a second CC chemokine named CCL28 (also known as mucosae-associated epithelial chemokine, or MEC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Wang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Kunkel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Williams1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Eksteen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These interactions induce the migration and the recruitment of IgA-ASC in the MLP. CCL25 was shown in a mouse model to mostly attract a subpopulation of IgA-ASC associated with the small intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Hieshima2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Kunkel2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Williams1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. CCL28 is more widely expressed and potently chemoattracts IgA-ASC originating from diverse mucosal lymphoid organs, as well as from intestinal and extra intestinal tissues, in every studied mucosal effector site-including the mammary and salivary glands-both in mice and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Wang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Wilson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Ogawa1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Eksteen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Feng1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Oswald1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the CCL28-CCR10/CCR3 circuit is considered to be a unifying system that plays a major role in the homing of plasma blasts and plasma cells at mucosal effector sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Hieshima1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Kunkel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Nakayama1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, these chemotactic abilities are limited to IgA-ASC as the migration of neither IgM nor IgG ASC is stimulated by the CCL28-CCR10/CCR3 or the CCL25-CCR9 systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Wang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Nakayama1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The CCL28-CCR10/CCR3 circuit is also endowed with other interesting peculiarities. Thus, CCL28 has a potent antimicrobial activity directed toward both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Hieshima1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, this chemokine is expressed by bone marrow stromal cells, suggesting that the interaction of CCL28 with CCR10&#x0002b;/CCR3&#x0002b; B cells may contribute to the integration between the mucosal and the systemic immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Hieshima1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>High concentration of mucosal HIV-specific IgA have repeatedly been observed in HIV-infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Wu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Soderlund1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and have also been suggested to characterize HIV sexually-exposed but uninfected individuals (Exposed Seronegatives or ESN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Mazzoli1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Belec1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, HIV-specific IgA were described to be present in saliva, cervico-vaginal secretions, and breast milk from both HIV-infected and ESN individuals in Europe, Asia and Africa by most <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Mazzoli1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Lizeng1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, but not all <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Dorrel1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> authors. To investigate whether the presence of high concentrations of mucosal HIV-specific IgA could be explained by an upregulation of the chemokine circuits involved in mucosal homing of IgA-ASC, we first measured CCL25 and CCL28 in breast milk of a well-characterized cohort of HIV-infected breast feeding mothers from Zambia. Results showing a significantly augmented concentration of CCL28 in HIV IgA-positive milk encouraged us to analyze CCR3-, CCR9-, and CCR10-expressing cells as well as the mucosal concentration of CCL25 and CCL28 in ESN subjects and their HIV-infected partners. Results were compared to those seen in HIV-unexposed individuals. Finally, as it was recently shown that the privileged site of HIV replication during primary infection is the gastro-intestinal (GI) mucosa, and IgA could protect this mucosa, we verified whether the administration of CCL28 would result in a significant modulation of IgA in the GI tract using an animal model undergoing immunization with a VSV construct in the presence/absence of CCL28. Results herewith indicate a pivotal role for CCL28 in the modulation of mucosal immunity in HIV exposure and infection and suggest a usefulness of CCL28-containing adjuvants in the development of HIV vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>Breast milk samples were collected from 65 HIV-infected women enrolled in a breastfeeding study in Lusaka, Zambia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Kuhn1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The samples were selected to include 15 women who transmitted and 50 women who did not transmit HIV to their infant. Milk samples were collected by manual expression between 1 and 5 weeks post-partum. Milk samples from 9 uninfected Zambian women were included as controls. All women signed informed consent to participate.</p><p>Blood samples and saliva were collected from 39 HIV-exposed but uninfected heterosexual partners of HIV-infected individuals (ESN)(27 females; 12 males). The inclusion criteria for the ESN was a history of multiple unprotected sexual episodes (with the same HIV-seropositive partner) for &#x02265;4 years at the time of enrollment, with at least 8 episodes of at-risk intercourse within the 4 months before study entry, and an average of 30 reported unprotected sexual contacts per year (range 18 to &#x0003e;100). Forty age-matched HIV-infected patients (HIV&#x0002b;) and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteer controls (HC), without any known risk factor for HIV-infection, were studied as well. All ESN and HIV-infected patients underwent in-depth clinical and laboratory evaluation that did not reveal any concomitant infectious or gynecologic problems. All individuals (ESN, HIV&#x0002b;, and HC) had been longitudinally followed for &#x0003e;4 years before the study by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Santa Maria Annunziata Hospital, Florence. This allowed us to exclude from the study ESN and HC in whom sexually transmitted diseases or any other pathology was reported during that time period. Each subject signed an informed consent form that was approved by the Ethical committee of the S. M. Annunziata Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Breast milk preparation</title><p>All milk was processed within 4 hours of collection. Milk was centrifuged at 400g and the cell pellet removed.

In the attempt to verify whether a correlation does exist between augmented concentrations of mucosal IgA in HIV exposure/infection and increased quantities of CCL28, we measured CCL28, CCL25 and surface expression of CCL28 and CCL25-binding receptors in ESN, HIV-infected patients, and HC. Results shown here indicate that the CCL28-dependent, but not the CCL25-dependent chemotactic circuit is upregulated in HIV exposure and infection, therefore justifying the augmented mucosal concentrations of IgA seen in this condition.</p><p>CCL28 was measured in different mucosal secretions: breast milk and saliva. As CCL28 was repeatedly shown to play a role in the migration of IgA-ASC in mammary and salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Wang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Oswald1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> it is not totally unexpected that the concentrations of this factor were higher in both sites in HIV infection and exposure, two conditions characterized by increased IgA concentrations. It could apparently be more surprising that CCL28 was augmented in serum, and that circulating CD19&#x0002b; cells express more frequently, and at a higher density, CCR3 and CCR10. These results nevertheless become more clear considering that lymphocyte recirculation between tissues and blood compartments is a defining feature of the immune system. The up regulation of CCR3 and CCR10 observed on circulating CD19&#x0002b; lymphocytes could thus be dependent on the recirculation of lymphocytes between the mucosal and haematic compartments Analogously, the augmented concentrations of CCL28 observed in the mucosal tissues were reflected in the higher quantities of plasmatic CCL28, that, although one fold lower than what is observed in saliva, still showed significant differences when ESN and HIV individuals were compared to healthy controls. It remains to be determined whether the expression of CCR3 and CCR10 in CD19&#x0002b; lymphocytes isolated from mucosal secretions will be augmented as well in HIV infection and exposure.</p><p>IgA are the first and main defensive line used by adaptive immunity at the mucosal level.

In this light it seems important that CCL28 concentration in breast milk were positively correlated with better survival in Zambian breast-fed and vertically HIV-infected children. These children were enrolled in a protocol (Zambia Exclusive Breastfeeding Study; ZEBS) and randomized to either stop breastfeeding 4 months after birth or to continue breastfeeding. Recent analyses have shown that HIV-infected children who stop breastfeeding had a very high risk of dying shortly after interruption of breastfeeding (Sinkala, M., <italic>et al.</italic> No benefit of early cessation of breastfeeding at 4 months on HIV-free survival of infants born to HIV-infected mothers in Zambia: the Zambia Exclusive Breastfeeding Study. 14<sup>th</sup> Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.

It could be argued that this mortality is secondary to withdrawal from the positive effect of BM-containing IgA and CCL28 at a time of life when the immune response is still immature. Finally, the correlation between CCL28 and HIV-specific IgA in BM described herein could also justify the observation that children who acquire HIV through breastfeeding have a better prognosis than children who acquire it at delivery or during pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Marinda1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) contains the vast majority of T cells in the body, and that GALT is the preferential target for HIV replication during the acute phase of HIV disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Brenchley1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000969-Mattapallil1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

Based on the result shown here, we decided to verify whether immunization in the presence of CCL28 would have had a significant effect on mucosal IgA at the gastro-intestinal (GI) level. This hypothesis was indeed fulfilled by the observation that IgA-ASC were significantly increased in the GI lamina propria of mice that were immunized with VSV in the presence of CCL28. Although preliminary, these results suggest that the use of CCL28 as an adjuvant could result in a beneficial modulation of mucosal immunity. Experiments are in progress in which the biologic effect of CCL28 is further analyzed in animal models.</p><p>Tissue-specific migration of lymphocytes is tightly regulated by a complex network of chemokines.

The ability of the CCL28-CCR3/CCR10 circuit to chemoattract ASC into multiple mucosal sites has indeed been a founding element of the concept of a common mucosal immune system, and very recent results indicate that CCL28 has a broad and unifying role in the physiology of the mucosal IgA immune system. It might therefore not be surprising that the CCL28 but not the CCL25 circuit is upregulated in HIV infection and exposure.</p><p>The results herein confirm the hypothesis that CCL28 has a
