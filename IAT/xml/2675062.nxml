Recent findings suggest that Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3&#x003b2; (GSK-3&#x003b2;), a critical activator of neuronal apoptosis, is involved in the dopaminergic cell death. In this study, the role of GSK-3&#x003b2; in modulating MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death was examined <italic>in vivo</italic>, and in two neuronal cell models namely primary cultured and immortalized neurons. In both cell models, MPTP/MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> treatment caused cell death associated with time- and concentration-dependent activation of GSK-3&#x003b2;, evidenced by the increased level of the active form of the kinase, i.e. GSK-3&#x003b2; phosphorylated at tyrosine 216 residue. Using immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation techniques, we showed that GSK-3&#x003b2; partially localized within mitochondria in both neuronal cell models. Moreover, MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> treatment induced a significant decrease of the specific phospho-Tyr216-GSK-3&#x003b2; labeling in mitochondria concomitantly with an increase into the cytosol. Using two distinct fluorescent probes, we showed that MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> induced cell death through the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; activity using well-characterized inhibitors, LiCl and kenpaullone, and RNA interference, prevented MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-induced cell death by blocking mitochondrial membrane potential changes and subsequent caspase-9 and -3 activation. These results indicate that GSK-3&#x003b2; is a critical mediator of MPTP/MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-induced neurotoxicity through its ability to regulate mitochondrial functions. Inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; activity might provide protection against mitochondrial stress-induced cell death.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurological disorder characterized by motor and behavioral disturbances caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the <italic>substantia nigra pars compacta</italic> (SNc) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005491-deLau1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

We performed confocal microscopy analysis on intact primary cultured neurons in order to compare the kinetic and level of TMRM integration in mitochondria of control, MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and LiCl/MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-treated neuronal cells. In control neurons, TMRM rapidly entered within mitochondria where it accumulated in an inner-membrane potential dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005491-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), as illustrated by the rapid increase of mean fluorescence intensity of untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005491-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-treated cells, TMRM only minimally entered within mitochondria and almost no TMRM fluorescence was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005491-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>), indicating that MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> induced the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Interestingly, TMRM accumulated similarly in control cells and in LiCl/MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> co-treated neurons, suggesting that LiCl treatment prevented the MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005491-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). LiCl treatment alone didn't affect mitochondria morphology and distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005491-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) and strongly increased TMRM mean fluorescence intensity during the course of the experiment, indicating that LiCl changed mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005491-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). FCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler, was used as control because it induced a mitochondrial membrane potential collapse in intact cells. When FCCP was added to neurons, TMRM no longer accumulated inside mitochondria and became evenly distributed throughout the cytosol, as shown by the loss of TMRM fluorescence in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005491-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).Taken together,these results indicated that GSK-3&#x003b2; triggered a strong depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential in neuronal cells exposed to MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we examined the implication of GSK-3&#x003b2; in MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and the putative protective role of GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibition on MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-mediated neurotoxicity.</p><p>The role of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including PD, has been well documented.

Activated GSK-3&#x003b2;, which inhibits heat shock transcription factor (HSTF)-1 and activates the mitochondrial death pathway, results in increased cytochrome c release from mitochondria.

The best-characterized mechanism for the inactivation of GSK-3&#x003b2; occurs through the phosphorylation of its N-terminus at Ser9 by the kinase Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005491-Lizcano1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in our study, we show that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, MPTP treatment induces a progressive loss of TH-positive neurons concomitant with an increase of phospho-Tyr216 GSK-3&#x003b2; in remaining dopaminergic neurons, indicating that the activation of GSK-3&#x003b2; by specific phosphorylation of Tyr216 may be involved in the MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent neuronal cell death process. These <italic>in vivo</italic> results are in agreement with observations performed in immortalized TSM1 and primary cultured neurons. Indeed, in both neuronal cell types, the treatment with MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> induced an increase in the phosphorylation at Tyr216 of GSK-3&#x003b2; whereas only negligible decrease in the amount of phospho-Ser9 GSK-3&#x003b2; was observed. Thus, MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> does not appear to regulate the Akt-mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b2; on Ser9, a result that differs from previous studies using different cell models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005491-Wang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005491-Chen1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We demonstrated for the first time a cellular compartment-specifc regulation process of GSK-3&#x003b2; activity upon MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-treatment. Indeed, in MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-treated neurons, the active form of GSK-3&#x003b2; increases in the cytosol and concomitantly decreases in the mitochondrial fraction leading to a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The translocation of GSK-3&#x003b2; from the cytosol to mitochondria and its physical interaction with mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex has been previously suggested in an ischemia/reperfusion paradigm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005491-Nishihara1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the fact that the total GSK-3&#x003b2; amount and its distribution do not appear to be affected by MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> treatment, we cannot rule out the possibility of a translocation of the active form of GSK-3&#x003b2; from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Therefore, the active form of GSK-3&#x003b2; present in mitochondria could be determinant for the maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Consistent with this hypothesis, LiCl-treated neurons present higher mitochondrial membrane potential than untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005491-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, we showed that the regulation of GSK-3&#x003b2; activity triggers MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and subsequent mitochondrial-dependent activation of the caspase cascade. Taken together, our results suggest a dual role for active GSK-3&#x003b2; according to its subcellular location. MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> induces neuronal cell death through the mitochondrial dysfunction closely related to the down-regulation of mitochondrial GSK-3&#x003b2; activity and the up-regulation of active cytosolic form of the kinase.</p><p>Finally, to precisely evaluate the role of GSK-3&#x003b2; in PD-related cell death, we inhibited GSK-3&#x003b2; activity using two selective GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibitors, LiCl and kenpaullone, and gene silencing with a siRNA targeting GSK-3&#x003b2;.

However, we show that silencing the expression of GSK-3&#x003b2; by specific siRNA protected neurons against MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> toxicity and no synergistic neuroprotective effect of lithium can be observed, demonstrating that the neuroprotective effect of lithium actually involved GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibition.</p><p>In summary, we clearly demonstrated the central role of GSK-3&#x003b2; in MPTP/MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-mediated neuronal cell death and we showed that differential GSK-3&#x003b2; regulations take place within mitochondria and cytosol. Further investigations will be required to precisely determine the role of mitochondrial GSK-3&#x003b2; in physiological conditions. However, its activity may contribute to variation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Our results highlight differential regulation of GSK-3&#x003b2; activity according to its subcellular compartimentalization. Indeed, inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; activity with specific inhibitors or siRNA significantly protected neurons from MPP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-induced cell death. New therapeutic strategy for PD targeting GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibition deserves to be evaluated keeping in mind the specific regulation of the different GSK-3&#x003b2; subcellular
