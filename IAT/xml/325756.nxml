A general method for cloning sequence-specific DNA methylase genes was used to isolate the dam gene on a 1.14 kb fragment, inserted in the plasmid vector pBR322. Subsequent restriction mapping and subcloning experiments established a set of approximate boundaries of the gene. The nucleotide sequence of the dam gene was determined, and analysis of that sequence revealed a unique open reading frame which corresponded in length to that necessary to code for a protein the size of dam. Amino acid composition derived from this sequence corresponds closely to the amino acid composition of the purified dam protein. Enzymatic and DNA:DNA hybridization methods were used to investigate the possible presence of dam genes in a variety of prokaryotic organisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0285.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="837"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0286.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="838"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0287.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="839"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0288.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="840"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0289.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="841"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0290.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="842"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0291.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="843"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0292.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="844"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0293.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="845"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0294.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="846"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0295.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="847"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0296.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="848"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0297.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="849"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0298.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="850"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0299.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="851"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
