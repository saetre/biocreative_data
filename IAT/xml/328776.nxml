The putative acidic activation domain is only 11.5% homologous with ZFX, whereas the putative DNA binding domain shares 75% homology and shows the same organisation composed of a basic two fingered repeat unit. ZNF6 has an unusually large 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 1.2 Kb which contains 26 potential ATG initiation codons, only one of which is associated with a long open reading frame. Southern and Northern blot analysis has shown that this 5' UTR is shared with many other sequences in the genome and transcribed associated with a large range of mRNA species. In situ hybridisation, analysis of somatic cell hybrids and male individuals carrying deleted X chromosomes have mapped the gene to Xq21.1-q21.3. The gene is highly conserved amongst the primates, in the mouse and can be detected weakly in the genome of a metatherian mammal (possum). Dosage in male and female mice indicates that it is also X-linked in this species. Possible origins of ZFX, ZFY and CMPX1 from a common ancestral gene are discussed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0034-a" xlink:role="4838"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0035-a" xlink:role="4839"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0035-b" xlink:role="4839"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0031.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4835"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4836"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4837"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4838"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4839"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4840"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00098-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4841"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
