Elevated ACE levels may be associated with an increased risk for different cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, including asthma. Previously, a molecular mechanism underlying a 5-fold familial increase of blood ACE was discovered: Pro1199Leu substitution enhanced the cleavage-secretion process. Carriers of this mutation were Caucasians from Europe (mostly Dutch) or had European roots.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We have found a family of African-American descent whose affected members' blood ACE level was increased 13-fold over normal. In affected family members, codon TGG coding for Trp1197 was substituted in one allele by TGA (stop codon). As a result, half of ACE expressed in these individuals had a length of 1196 amino acids and lacked a transmembrane anchor. This ACE mutant is not trafficked to the cell membrane and is directly secreted out of cells; this mechanism apparently accounts for the high serum ACE level seen in affected individuals. A haplotype of the mutant ACE allele was determined based on 12 polymorphisms, which may help to identify other carriers of this mutation. Some but not all carriers of this mutation demonstrated airflow obstruction, and some but not all have hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We have identified a novel Trp1197Stop mutation that results in dramatic elevation of serum ACE. Since blood ACE elevation is often taken as a marker of disease activity (sarcoidosis and Gaucher diseases), it is important for clinicians and medical scientists to be aware of alternative genetic causes of elevated blood ACE that are not apparently linked to disease.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE, CD143) is a Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> carboxydipeptidase which plays key roles in the regulation of blood pressure and in the development of vascular pathology and remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Ehlers1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

The whole ACE gene (&#x0223c;24 Kb) was sequenced in two individuals; genomic DNA was isolated from index subject N1 and from patient DR, who has the Pro1199Leu mutation (DNA kindly provided by Dr. R. Stein, Penobscot Bay Medical Center, Rockport, ME) used as a positive control.</p><p>After the discovery of the mutation Trp1197Stop, genotyping of subjects N1 and DR was performed by another PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assessment. The 292 bp DNA fragment was amplified by PCR with primers Ex25_292Fw (<named-content content-type="gene">TCCGCACGGAGAACGA</named-content>, exon 25) and Ex25_292Rv (<named-content content-type="gene">CCTGCTGCGCATCCA</named-content>, exon 26) using genomic DNA from subjects N1, N3 (mother of N1), N2 (father of N1) and DR (an unrelated individual with Pro1199Leu mutation). The restriction endonuclease BsaHI (AcyI) cuts this 292 bp PCR product from individual with native, wild-type ACE (N3) into two fragments of 235 bp and 57 bp. Subject DR with Pro1199Leu substitution has mutated the last nucleotide in the recognition sequence of BsaHI (AcyI): GACGC<underline>T</underline>&#x0002a; vs. GRCGY<underline>C</underline>. Subject N1 (Trp1197Stop) has mutation of the first nucleotide in the recognition sequence of this endonuclease: &#x0002a;<underline>A</underline>ACGCC vs. <underline>G</underline>RCGYC. As a result, these two mutations (G-to-A mutation in the position 3699 (leading to Trp1197Stop substitution and C-to-T mutation at position 3705 - leading to Pro1199Leu substitution) both eliminate the BsaHI (Acy I) restriction site. Thus, restriction analysis with BsaHI can distinguish an individual with these two mutations from individuals with normal ACE, but cannot distinguish between these two mutations - Pro1199Leu (DR) and Trp1197Stop (N1 and N2).</p><p>However, the restriction endonuclease BsrI cuts the 292 bp PCR product from individuals with wild-type ACE (e.g., N3) in the same place as endonuclease BsaHI (AcyI) also creating two fragments of 235 bp and 57 bp. In contrast, mutation Trp1197Stop disturbs the recognition sequence of BsrI: ACTG<underline>A</underline>&#x0002a;A vs. ACTG<underline>G</underline>N. At the same time, mutation P1199L has no effect on BsrI digestion. Thus, restriction analysis with BsrI can distinguish individuals with mutation Trp1197Stop (N1, N2) from individuals with mutation Pro1199Leu (e.g., DR), but cannot distinguish between mutation Pro1199Leu and native ACE (N3). Both restrictases BsaHI (AcyI) and BsrI must be used to differentiate mutations Trp1197Stop and Pro1199Leu and native ACE.</p><p>Heterozygous reading was obtained from genomic DNA sequence of the patient N1 (&#x0223c;24 Kb) in the SNPs rs4331 (exon 15), rs4353 (exon 20), rs4359 (intron 23), rs4362 (exon 24) and rs4363 (intron 25).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Cladistic Analysis</title><p>To study similarities between the ACE haplotype of subject N1 and haplotype clusters (clades) that had been already found in human population, we used a computational method for minimizing the weighted sum of squares of the differences between observed and expected pairwise distances between samples and construction of the most parsimonious classification trees using routines DNAPARS and DRAWGRAM, programs included in the software package PHYLIP v3.67 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Felsenstein1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

Both the G3678A mutation (leading to W1197X; subjects N1-Lane 2, and father of N1 &#x02013;lane 3) and the C3683T mutation (leading to P1199L-Lane 4) eliminate the BsaHI (AcyI) restriction site.

Thus, mAb 1B3 recognizes an epitope on the C terminal part of the C-domain of somatic ACE and is very sensitive to the conformation of the C terminal end (39). We imagine that the much shortened C terminal end of the Pro1199Leu or Trp1197X mutants might unmask the epitope for 1B3, whereas the longer C terminal end as in the case of Gln1230X might shield the binding site. Besides changes in the immunoprecipitation of mutant Trp1197Stop ACE by mAbs 1B3, 1B8 and 3F10, which are directed to the region affected by this mutation, there are several others mAbs whose binding is also changed &#x02013; i1A8, i2H5, 5F1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008282-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).

We developed a convenient assay for the detection of this particular mutation based on analysis of the plasma ACE binding to mAb 1B3 (directed to the C-terminal part of soluble ACE) and binding to mAb 9B9 (on the N-terminal domain of ACE). The observed 1B3/9B9 binding ratio was 3-fold lower for affected individuals, thus allowing identification of this particular mutation in the stalk region of human somatic ACE with high sensitivity and specificity and without labor-time and cost-consuming sequencing or restriction analysis of the PCR products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Danilov5">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we identified a family in whom a novel mutation &#x02013; in which the codon TGG encoding Trp1197 is substituted in one allele by TGA (stop codon) &#x02013; results in 13-fold elevation of ACE level in the blood. As a result of this mutation, half the ACE expressed in heterozygous individuals had a length of 1196 amino acids and lacked the transmembrane anchor, which starts from Val1228 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Chubb1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.

A similar mechanism accounts for subject N1's high serum ACE level.</p><p>The novel mutation carried by N1 can be detected using the above mentioned antibody-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008282-g001">Figs. 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008282-g002">2</xref>). However, although this approach identifies carriers of this new mutation (W1197X), it does not allow one to distinguish this from a previously described (P1199L) mutation. Therefore, we exploited restriction site polymorphisms in the DNA sequence encoding these two mutant isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008282-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), implemented using PCR-amplified segments of DNA spanning these mutations.</p><p>The assays we developed &#x02013; an antibody-based assay (1B3/9B9 ratio) and a restriction analysis of the PCR product &#x02013; distinguish easily between elevation of blood ACE due to granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis in particular) or Gaucher disease and hyper-ACE-emia due to lack of transmembrane domain, thus preventing false diagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Despite the fact that patients with the Pro1199Leu mutation exhibit no clinical abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Kramers1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, the search for these mutations is of considerable clinical importance.

Individuals without any functional ACE may die <italic>in utero</italic> or within 24 h of birth as a result of profound developmental abnormality of proximal kidney tubules &#x02013; renal tubular dysgenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Gribouval1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Corvol2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. In one family, a stop codon was introduced after Arg236 and in another family the correct sequence of ACE was through Pro402 - mature somatic ACE numbering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Soubrier1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in both families affected homozygous individuals have no functional ACE. The same type of renal lesions was seen in fetuses that were exposed to ACE inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Barr1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>). Thus, it seems that for normal renal development it is necessary to have at least some minimum level of ACE, and as a consequence, a minimal level of Angiotensin II (Ang II) during development. Also, it is necessary to mention that mainly tissue ACE determines the conversion of Ang I to Ang II. When we found several Dutch families with the Pro1199Leu ACE mutation that leads to a 5-fold increase in blood ACE (due to increase in ACE shedding), we determined Ang I and And II levels in the affected subjects and in their unaffected relatives. Ang I level in patients with 5-fold elevated ACE tended to be only slightly (78&#x00025;) lower than in controls, and this trend was not statistically significant. Ang II in the &#x0201c;high-ACE&#x0201d; group was just double that of the control group (5.0&#x0002b;5.0 versus 2.2&#x0002b;1.4 pmol/L in control group, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.034) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Kramers1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we would not expect to see a dramatic (much more than double) increase in the blood level of Ang II of affected family members because the levels of ACE in the tissues are more than an order of magnitude higher than those in the blood. Therefore, an overall conversion of Ang I to Ang II (per gram of any tissue) should not be dramatically increased in the affected members of this family.</p><p>We believe that despite the fact that tissue ACE in N1 patient should be just half of that of non-affected individuals, the huge excess of blood ACE in this individual perhaps compensates for a diminished level of tissue ACE. This possibility is supported by the finding of Bernstein's group, who demonstrated that the blood pressure of mice lacking tissue ACE, but having 80&#x00025; of blood ACE, is indistinguishable from that of wild type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Cole1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, homeostasis can be maintained without the localized production of Ang II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Shen1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The demonstration of renal tubular dysgenesis in humans having no normal allele of ACE raises a serious question about the non-identity of mouse models and human pathologies. In mice a complete lack of ACE does not reproduce renal tubular dysgenesis; ACE knock-out mice are hypotensive and are unable to effectively concentrate urine. This functional renal defect accompanies structural kidney malformation typified by underdevelopment of renal medulla and papilla (59). However fetuses of ACE knockout mice did not die <italic>in utero</italic> and at birth the kidneys from ACE knockout mice are structurally indistinguishable from those of wild-type littermate controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Differences in the renal phenotype between humans and mice are not fully understood, though it has been suggested that differences in the timing of nephrogenesis explain the discrepancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Corvol2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Lacoste1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. We think that dramatic differences in ACE activity in organs and blood of mice and human also might play a role: ACE activity in mouse blood and tissues is 10-fold more that in human. Therefore in human with absence of ACE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Gribouval1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Lacoste1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, the level of Ang II might fall below some level critical for normal kidney development.</p><p>Our data indicate that W1197X mutation is not a spontaneous event that occurred <italic>de novo</italic> in subject N1, but rather it was inherited from earlier generations. Therefore, we hypothesized that cladistic analysis will help us to identify distant relatives of subject N1, which would allow the identification of additional individuals with N1's phenotype. For this purpose, we analyzed human populations of four different ethnic/geographic origins with representative set of 12 SNPs. Haplotypes clustering did not resolve ethnic groups in four independent clades, although significant correlation of ACE haplotypes with geographical origin was demonstrated. Most remarkably, we found a perfect match for patient N1 ACE haplotype with two individuals from Nigeria. Taking into account that N1 is an African American, we hypothesize that mutation W1197X occurred at least several hundreds years ago in Africa in a grand ancestor of N1 and Nigerians YRI-18517 and YRI-19111. If this is true, there is a good chance to find other carriers of the mutation in Nigeria. However, similarity between haplotypes of N1 and Chinese CHB-18577 might be attributable either to common origin of these haplotypes further back in human history or to spontaneous re-creation of haplotype L1-1 in Africa and China due to evolution convergence.</p><p>In all three populations, cladistic analysis shows that N1 fits into &#x0201c;D&#x0201d; type of Alu-I/D polymorphism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008282-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>), the type, as it was shown earlier, correlates with higher plasma ACE level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Farrall1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. On a more detailed scale, when a greater number of SNPs was employed, N1's haplotype also clustered with clades representing higher plasma ACE level. For instance, in the French population, clade &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; (members SA-43904, SC-11136, and SC-11104) was associated with as much as 70&#x00025; increase of z-score for ACE activity in plasma as compared to clade A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Soubrier2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008282-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). In the British population, N1 haplotype was closest to Alu-D-type clade &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; (C3, C4) from study of Keavney et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Keavney1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Individuals from clade &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; have plasma ACE level 68&#x00025; higher than patients from clade &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Keavney1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the African population, N1's haplotype was identical to three clades (I-1, I-2, I-7) found originally by Bourzekri with coauthors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Bouzekri1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. This supports the possibility that the Trp1197Stop mutation occurs with significant frequency in Nigeria. It was demonstrated that polymorphism rs4343 (ACE8 according to author's notation) was extremely highly associated (p&#x0003c;10<sup>-17</sup>) with elevated serum concentration of ACE. The best model to fit ACE polymorphisms (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) and plasma level in all studied populations (Nigeria, Jamaica, and US) showed the highest association in Nigerians. ACE8 SNP alone was attributed to as much as 21&#x00025; of the total ACE serum level variance in Nigerian individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Bouzekri1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Taking together data on association of higher ACE sera level with Alu-D-type polymorphism and with downstream rs4343 SNP, we address the question on possible linkage disequilibrium in the area of ACE flanked with these two polymorphisms. Indeed, linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis shows that recombinations in this area are rare (LD plot on the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008282-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). This implies that Alu-D-type might associate with higher ACE serum activity because of the tight linkage with functional polymorphisms, which belong to stalk domain of ACE. The novel Trp1197Stop mutation we found in subject N1 is one of the best examples of functional SNPs of this kind. Additionally, in the study of Bourzekri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Bouzekri1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, the highest association with high serum level of ACE was also demonstrated for the SNP located close to stalk region.</p><p>Thus, we can consider at least two different mechanisms for regulation of ACE activity in blood. One mechanism is reliant upon control of gene expression and genetically linked both to loci in promoter region of the gene and other loci in genome. A second way to control ACE level in blood is reliant on spontaneous alterations within stalk region of the gene/protein. The previously identified Pro1199Leu mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Kramers1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and the most recently discovered Trp1197Stop mutation (this study) are two examples of this mode of regulation of ACE activity.</p><p>Might very high level of blood ACE in subject N1 and in affected members of her family play a role in the mild airflow obstruction seen in affected individuals? There are plausible potential mechanisms by which elevated blood ACE might promote features of asthma pathology. Excessive accumulation of airway smooth muscle, due to hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Ebina1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, is a common occurrence in asthmatic airways. Ang II, generated through hydrolysis of Ang I by ACE, stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell growth both <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Naftilan1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Griffin1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Ang II promotes airway myocyte hypertrophy <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-McKay1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps high blood levels of Ang II (due to constitutively high level of blood ACE) might have a similar effect on airway myocytes in vivo. Ang II can also contract human bronchial rings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Millar1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, increased plasma levels of Ang II have been reported in acute severe asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-MillarEAAngus1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Ramsay1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>, and iv infusion of Ang II in mild asthmatics can cause bronchoconstriction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-MillarEAAngus1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, Ang II potentiates methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Millar1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it was also shown that locally generated Ang II causes bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Veerappan1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another theoretical mechanism by which subject N1's mutation might have contributed to her airflow obstruction could relate to accelerated bradykinin (BK) metabolism. BK is another substrate for ACE, perhaps the &#x0201c;best&#x0201d; with the highest Km <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Ehlers1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Corvol1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, and is a potent vasodilator that induces cough and bronchoconstriction in subjects with asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Barnes1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Ricciardolo1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps decreased ACE tissue levels increase local tissue concentration of BK and so promote asthma symptoms.</p><p>Additional implication of a potential role of ACE in asthma comes from analysis of an ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in different asthmatic populations. The homozygous deletion (DD) genotype is associated with minor elevation of serum ACE activity: individuals with this genotype have 60&#x02013;70&#x00025; more ACE in the blood than carriers of the II genotype and approximately 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; more than the whole population mean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Danilov3">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Rigat1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. In some but not all studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008282-Lue1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>), the DD genotype is associated with asthma. Although these findings might have suggested that the extremely high blood ACE levels in N1 and her family contribute to their asthma, in the limited population we studied we found no significant association between the presence of the W1197X mutation and asthma. Thus, if the mutation is at all contributory, it does not appear to be a dominant predisposing factor in N1's family.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a novel W1197X mutation that results in dramatic elevation of serum ACE, and which can occur in individuals of African American descent who have mild airflow obstruction. Because the constellation of airflow obstruction and elevated serum ACE in African American individuals is one that should raise the possibility of sarcoidosis to pulmonologists, it is important to recognize that mutations of the ACE gene that are not associated with disease &#x02013; including the novel W1197X mutation reported here &#x02013; can also lead to substantial blood ACE elevation. Thus, whenever very high serum ACE is found in the evaluation of potential sarcoidosis cases, we recommend that evaluation for the W1197X and P1199L mutations should be considered.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank subject N1 and her family for their cooperation.
