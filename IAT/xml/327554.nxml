It is based on the specific elution of the large-T ATPase activity from calf thymus DNA cellulose by recombinant DNA molecules including known sequences of the viral DNA. Using this assay, a high affinity binding site has been mapped on the early region side of the ori region. Binding requires the integrity of a sequence /AGAGGC/TTCC/AGAGGC/ (nucleotides 49 to 64 in the DNA sequence of the A2 strain). Similar repeats of a PuGPuGGC sequence within less than 20 bases are not found within the viral coding regions, but are strikingly common in the control regions of papovaviruses and other eukaryotic DNAs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5697"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5698"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5699"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5700"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5701"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5702"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5703"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5704"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5705"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5706"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5707"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5708"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5709"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00414-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5710"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
