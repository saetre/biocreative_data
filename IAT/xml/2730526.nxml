However, limited information is available regarding the regulation of miRNAs gene transcription. Microarray profiling and real-time PCR analysis revealed a marked down-regulation of miR-206 in nuclear receptor <italic>SHP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. To understand the regulatory function of SHP with regard to miR-206 gene expression, we determined the putative transcriptional initiation site of miR-206 and also its full length primary transcript using a database mining approach and RACE. We identified the transcription factor AP1 binding sites on the miR-206 promoter and further showed that AP1 (c-Jun and c-Fos) induced miR-206 promoter transactivity and expression which was repressed by YY1. ChIP analysis confirmed the physical association of AP1 (c-Jun) and YY1 with the endogenous miR-206 promoter. In addition, we also identified nuclear receptor ERR&#x003b3; (NR3B3) binding site on the YY1 promoter and showed that YY1 promoter was transactivated by ERR&#x003b3;, which was inhibited by SHP (NROB2). ChIP analysis confirmed the ERR&#x003b3; binding to the YY1 promoter. Forced expression of SHP and AP1 induced miR-206 expression while overexpression of ERR&#x003b3; and YY1 reduced its expression. The effects of AP1, ERR&#x003b3;, and YY1 on miR-206 expression were reversed by siRNA knockdown of each gene, respectively. Thus, we propose a novel cascade &#x0201c;dual inhibitory&#x0201d; mechanism governing miR-206 gene transcription by SHP: SHP inhibition of ERR&#x003b3; led to decreased YY1 expression and the de-repression of YY1 on AP1 activity, ultimately leading to the activation of miR-206. This is the first report to elucidate a cascade regulatory mechanism governing miRNAs gene transcription.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Small heterodimer partner (<italic>SHP</italic>, NROB2) is a well established nuclear transcriptional co-repressor.

For this we used a bioinformatics approach developed in our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006880-Song1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Expressed sequence tag (EST) and non-coding RNA database (mouse non-RefSeq RNA database from NCBI) analysis identified an EST sequence (AK031267, GenBank Accession number) ended before pre-miR-133b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006880-g002">Figure 2&#x02013;2</xref>, <underline>T</underline> in red), which was followed by the consensus polyadenylation signal. This suggested that the 3&#x02032;-end of this EST was complete. The 5&#x02032;-end of this EST ended close to the 3&#x02032;-end of the miR-206 hairpin sequences and did not contain miR-206, based on the genomic location of pre-miR-206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006880-g001">Figure 1d</xref>). This suggested that it did not contain the full length pri-miR-206. Sequence prediction suggested that miR-206 and miR-133b may arise from two separate, and possibly overlapping primary transcripts. This prediction is consistent with the report that pri-miRNA transcripts vary in length from a few hundreds of bases up to tens of kilobases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006880-Saini1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. To elucidate the transcriptional initiation site (TIS) of the primary transcript of miR-206 (pri-miR-206), we used Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) to determine the 5&#x02032;-end of the transcript. 5&#x02032;RACE produced one strong and two weak PCR products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006880.s003">Figure S1a</xref>).

The two weak bands appeared to be non-specific PCR amplification. In addition, the expression level of pri-miR-206, as detected using primers in the 5&#x02032;RACE amplified region, was about 50&#x00025; lower in <italic>SHP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice as compared to the wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006880-g001">Figure 1e</xref>), consistent with the expression pattern of the mature miR-206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006880-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). Because this TIS site has not been verified using additional experimental approaches such as primer extension assays, we considered this as a putative TIS site.

Unfortunately, we could not obtain satisfactory results with SHPRNAi due to the low SHP levels and knockdown efficiency in Nmuli cells.

Although miR-206 is less abundant in the liver, our study identified down-regulation of miR-206 in the liver of <italic>SHP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. These observations suggest a broader tissue specific expression and physiological function of miR-206 than originally anticipated.</p><p>Despite the important function of miR-206 in physiological regulation, how the expression of miR-206 is controlled at the transcriptional level remains unknown. To address this question, we first cloned the full length pri-miR-206 using a bioinformatics approach. Cloning of pri-miR-206 is significant, because only a few miRNAs have their full length primary sequences determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006880-Song1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006880-Cai1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006880-Chang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. It is noted that the identified transcriptional initiation site of pri-miR-206 is localized in a simple GGA/GAA sequence repeat region, with no identifiable core promoter elements. However, this feature is not unusual for the miRNA genes. Our previous studies identified (CT)n or (CTT)n simple sequence repeats in the promoter of the primary transcript of miR-127 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006880-Song1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006880-Song2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Genes encoding miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006880-Cai1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and in some cases RNA polymerase III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006880-Borchert1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. However, little is known about how transcriptional regulation affects miRNAs levels and function in cells and tissues. Using both an <italic>in vitro</italic> cell system and <italic>in vivo</italic> gene expression analysis, we show that several nuclear transcription factors and signaling molecules, including SHP, ERR&#x003b3;, YY1, and AP1, coordinately regulate the transcription of miR-206. Thus, SHP is identified as a transcriptional activator of miR-206 expression via a &#x0201c;dual inhibitory&#x0201d; mechanism. Because the expression of miR-206 is also markedly down-regulated in skeletal muscle of <italic>SHP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice compared to the wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006880.s006">Figure S4</xref>), where it is preferentially expressed, we propose that this transcriptional cascade that activates miR-206 by SHP may exist in muscle as well.

On the &#x003bc;Paraflo microfluidic chip, each detection probe consisted of a chemically modified nucleotide coding segment complementary to target microRNA (from miRBase, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/">http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/</ext-link>) or other RNA (control or customer defined sequences) and a spacer segment of polyethylene glycol to extend the coding segment away from the substrate.

Small RNAs (&#x0003c;300 nt) were 3&#x02032;-extended with a poly(A) tail using poly(A) polymerase. An oligonucleotide tag was then ligated to the poly(A) tail for later fluorescent dye staining; two different tags were used for the two RNA samples in dual-sample experiments (Labeling Protocol: LC Mir-Label Prtl-060518).
