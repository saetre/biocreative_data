Given its unique molecular composition, location, and physiology, the AIS is thought to maintain neuronal polarity. To identify the molecular basis of this AIS property, we used adenovirus-mediated RNA interference to silence AIS protein expression in polarized neurons. Some AIS proteins are remarkably stable with half-lives of at least 2 wk. However, silencing the expression of the cytoskeletal scaffold ankyrinG (ankG) dismantles the AIS and causes axons to acquire the molecular characteristics of dendrites. Both cytoplasmic- and membrane-associated proteins, which are normally restricted to somatodendritic domains, redistribute into the former axon. Furthermore, spines and postsynaptic densities of excitatory synapses assemble on former axons. Our results demonstrate that the loss of ankG causes axons to acquire the molecular characteristics of dendrites; thus, ankG is required for the maintenance of neuronal polarity and molecular organization of the AIS.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>K.L.

However, the molecular mechanisms maintaining neuronal polarity throughout life are unknown. The axon initial segment (AIS) functions as both a physical and physiological bridge between the somatodendritic and axonal domains. It is responsible for action potential initiation and modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kole et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2008</xref>) and is highly enriched in ion channels, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and cytoskeletal and scaffolding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hedstrom et al., 2007</xref>). Given its unique molecular composition, location, and physiology, the AIS is thought to maintain neuronal polarity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Winckler et al. (1999)</xref> demonstrated that membrane proteins have different lateral mobilities in the AIS as compared with the distal axon. Furthermore, they demonstrated that disruption of the actin-based cytoskeleton removed the AIS diffusion barrier and concluded that the AIS cytoskeleton regulates neuronal polarity.</p><p>Among the known AIS proteins, ankyrinG (ankG) is essential for AIS assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jenkins and Bennett, 2001</xref>) and may be important for its long-term maintenance. Alternatively, neurofascin (NF)-186, an AIS CAM that binds ankG, could function independently of ankG to retain voltage-gated Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (Nav) channels at the AIS because it interacts with both the unique AIS extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hedstrom et al., 2007</xref>) and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel &#x003b2; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ratcliffe et al., 2001</xref>). To test the hypothesis that the AIS contributes to the maintenance of neuronal polarity and to determine whether NF-186, ankG, or other AIS proteins mediate this function, we silenced AIS protein expression in fully polarized 10-d in vitro (DIV) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yang et al., 2007</xref>) using adenoviruses to transduce neurons with NF-186, Nav channel, &#x003b2;IV spectrin, or ankG short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression constructs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The silencing of NF-186 did not reduce the number of neurons with NF-186 at the AIS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and C</xref>, bars), and a control GFP adenovirus did not affect the AIS (Fig. S1, A&#x02013;C, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806112/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806112/DC1</ext-link>). However, by 14 d post infection (DPI; 14 DPI &#x0003d; 24 DIV), the mean NF-186 fluorescence intensity of infected (GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) neurons decreased by 45% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and C</xref>, red lines). Failure to eliminate NF-186 from the AIS was not a result of poor shRNA efficacy because the silencing of NF-186 expression during development blocked its AIS accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hedstrom et al., 2007</xref>). We confirmed that NF-186 protein is very stable at the AIS by labeling 10 DIV hippocampal neurons live for 30 min using a mAb (A12/18.1) we generated that recognizes NF-186's extracellular domain. Consistent with the NF-186 shRNA results, we found this antibody was retained at every hippocampal neuron's AIS for at least 14 d post treatment (DPT) with antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We observed only a gradual decrease in fluorescence intensity during this time that was similar to shRNA-treated neurons (33% decrease at 14 DPT; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, green line). These results, using two independent methods, suggest that NF-186 is a long-lived AIS component with a half-life of &#x0003e;2 wk. Similar to NF-186, Nav channels and &#x003b2;IV spectrin are long-lived components of the AIS because silencing their expression by adenoviral-delivered shRNAs resulted in only an &#x0223c;50% decrease in the targeted protein after 14 DPI (Fig. S1, D&#x02013;G).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Stability of NF-186 and ankG at the AIS.</bold> (A) NF-186 immunoreactivity (PAN NF, L11A/41.6) in NF-186 shRNA adenovirus&#x02013;infected (i.e., GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) cells at various DPI.

By 7 DPI, ankG immunoreactivity was undetectable in 40% of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neurons; in the remaining 60%, the mean AIS ankG fluorescence intensity decreased by 47% compared with noninfected controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). By 14 DPI, ankG immunoreactivity could not be detected in any infected neurons. The loss of ankG caused dismantling of the AIS; at 10 DPI (20 DIV), 99% of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (i.e., ankG shRNA transduced) neurons lacked immunostaining for Nav channels, 90% lacked &#x003b2;IV spectrin, 90% lacked NF-186, and 98% lacked neuronal CAM (NrCAM) immunoreactivity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, ankG is necessary for both the initial recruitment of AIS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hedstrom et al., 2007</xref>) and for their long-term stability and retention. Furthermore, long-lived AIS proteins like NF-186 are rapidly lost in ankG's absence, indicating that their interactions with other AIS proteins (e.g., NF-186's interactions with the extracellular matrix; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hedstrom et al., 2007</xref>) cannot stabilize them within this domain.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>AnkG is required for AIS maintenance.</bold> Control (A, C, E, and G) and ankG shRNA&#x02013;infected (B, D, F, and H) neurons immunolabeled for various AIS components: Nav channels (PAN Nav; A and B), &#x003b2;IV spectrin (C and D), NF (PAN NF; E and F), and NrCAM (G and H).

In 20 DIV control neurons, NF-186 immunoreactivity is highly enriched at the AIS with decreasing amounts in distal axonal locations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, yellow). In contrast, cytoplasmic MAP2 defines the somatodendritic domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, blue). Line scans at three locations along the axon demonstrate exclusion of MAP2, high levels of NF-186 near the cell body, and decreasing NF-186 immunoreactivity at progressively more distal locations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B&#x02013;D</xref>). In contrast, line scans through dendrites demonstrate uniform MAP2 immunoreactivity and a lack of NF-186 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E&#x02013;G</xref>). In GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neurons without ankG, all processes emanating from the soma were MAP2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref> and Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806112/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806112/DC1</ext-link>). Remarkably, one of these had features characteristic of both axons and dendrites: at sites far from the cell body, there was a transition from somatodendritic MAP2 to axonal NF-186 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref> and Fig. S3). In some neurons, we also used GFP immunostaining to identify the axon as the longest process; these too had increased levels of MAP2 immunoreactivity (Fig. S2). Similar to other dendrites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 I</xref>), line scans show a thick MAP2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> shaft (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, J&#x02013;L</xref>). However, this process, with the molecular characteristics of a dendrite, then transitions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 M</xref>) from MAP2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> immunoreactivity to NF-186<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> immunoreactivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 N</xref>), comparable with that seen at the distal axons of noninfected neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). Of the 103 GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neurons we examined, 41 had MAP2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> processes that also had distal NF-186 immunoreactivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref> and Fig. S3). The remaining 62 had no detectable NF-186 immunoreactivity, and all processes were MAP2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Thus, the loss of AIS ankG permits cytoplasmic MAP2 to enter the axon.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>AnkG is required for maintenance of neuronal polarity.</bold> (A) In 20 DIV control neurons, MAP2 (blue) defines somatodendritic domains, whereas PAN NF (yellow) defines the AIS and distal axon.

In contrast, GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neurons had both MAP2 and KCC2 immunoreactivity that extended into the process identified as the former axon based on distal NF-186 immunoreactivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 P</xref>, arrows). Thus, ankG and the AIS are required to exclude somatodendritic membrane proteins from the axon.</p><p>After silencing ankG expression in some anti-GFP immunolabeled cells where the identity of the axon was clearly determined based on morphology of the distal processes (i.e., longest and thinnest process; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, arrows), we also observed dendritic spines in the proximal region of the former axon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, inset). The presence or absence of spines correlated well with MAP2 immunoreactivity along the former axon: regions with high levels of MAP2 had spines, whereas distal segments with low levels of MAP2 did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). To further confirm that loss of ankG from the AIS resulted in the development of excitatory synapses, we used antibodies against the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95. In neurons infected with adenovirus to deliver NF-186 shRNA, the AIS remained intact (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>; and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>), and PSD-95 immunoreactivity could only be detected on dendrites; the axon and AIS never had punctate PSD-95 immunoreactivity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>, arrows). In contrast, the silencing of ankG and dismantling of the AIS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>) resulted in all GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neuronal processes having PSD-95<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> postsynaptic densities (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E and F</xref>).

Thus, besides the clustering of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007</xref>), ankG is required for maintenance of the AIS and axon identity.</p><p>The AIS has previously unappreciated degrees of plasticity in the kinds of ion channels expressed, their densities, and their position in the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Grieco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kuba et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>). Because most AIS proteins are long lived, we speculate that modulation of the action potential threshold might be regulated at the level of ankG transcription or through increasing/decreasing ankG turnover rates rather than the expression of ion channels.</p><p>Previous studies showed that the lateral mobility of lipids and axonal CAMs in the AIS plasma membrane was limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Winckler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nakada et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting a diffusion barrier at the AIS. The treatment of cultured neurons with actin-destabilizing agents disrupts the diffusion barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Winckler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kole et al., 2008</xref>), although the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not known. Our results indicate that this barrier role extends to somatodendritic membrane and cytoplasmic proteins and suggest that it is ankG based. Thus, the ankG-based AIS functions as a spatial barrier to maintain neuronal polarity by restricting the types of proteins that can enter the axon.</p><p>Axon injury has been associated with changes in neuronal polarity, conversion of dendrites to axons, and the development of supernumerary axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Havton and Kellerth, 1987</xref>). One recent study showed that transection of the axon at sites distal to the soma did not affect polarity, but transection of the axon close to the cell body (&#x0223c;35 &#x003bc;m from the soma and about the same location as the AIS) caused a fate switch and conversion of a dendrite into an axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Gomis-Ruth et al., 2008</xref>). Although this was attributed to altered microtubule stability in the distal axon, an alternative explanation consistent with the results presented here is that the AIS maintains neuronal polarity. We propose that diseases or injuries that disrupt ankG at the AIS may contribute to nervous system dysfunction through loss of neuronal polarity, loss of clustered ion channels, and inappropriate synaptic innervation of proximal segments of axons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>The PAN NF (L11A/41.6), PAN Nav channel, and &#x003b2;IV spectrin antibodies were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Schafer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ogawa et al., 2006</xref>).

The mean pixel intensity per unit area was measured for each AIS. We calculated the ratio of the mean infected neuron's AIS fluorescence to the mean fluorescence of noninfected neurons on the same coverslip. All camera exposure times were below saturation for noninfected neurons on the same coverslip. For antibody-labeled live neurons, measurements shown are the mean of the raw AIS fluorescence intensity over three experiments. All images were acquired using a subsaturating exposure time determined in 1 DPT neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows that control GFP adenovirus&#x02013;infected neurons have a normal AIS even at 10 DPI and that Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels and &#x003b2;IV spectrin are very stable after adenoviral-delivered shRNA knockdown. Fig. S2 shows a GFP-labeled axon that has high levels of MAP2 immunoreactivity after the silencing of ankG expression. Fig. S3 shows another example of distal PAN NF immunoreactivity and the invasion of MAP2 into the axon.
