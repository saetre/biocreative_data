Because CD40 is widely expressed on the surface of tumor cells in various B cell malignancies, deregulated CD40 signaling has been suggested to contribute to lymphomagenesis. In this study, we show that B cell-specific expression of a constitutively active CD40 receptor, in the form of a latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)/CD40 chimeric protein, promoted an increase in the number of follicular and marginal zone B cells in secondary lymphoid organs in transgenic mice. The B cells displayed an activated phenotype, prolonged survival and increased proliferation, but were significantly impaired in T cell-dependent immune responses. Constitutive CD40 signaling in B cells induced selective and constitutive activation of the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinases Jnk and extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase. LMP1/CD40-expressing mice older than 12 mo developed B cell lymphomas of mono- or oligoclonal origin at high incidence, thus showing that the interplay of the signaling pathways induced by constitutive CD40 signaling is sufficient to initiate a tumorigenic process, ultimately leading to the development of B cell lymphomas.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: Erk, extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase; ES, embryonic stem; GC, germinal center; HE, hematoxylin and eosin; LMP, latent membrane protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TD, T cell dependent.</p></fn><fn><p>C.

Upon interaction with CD40 ligand (CD40L), which is predominantly expressed on activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, CD40 promotes B cell activation, proliferation, survival, and up-regulation of surface molecules involved in antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). The finding that patients suffering from &#x0201c;X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome&#x0201d; have a defect in expression of CD40L was instrumental in the discovery that CD40&#x02013;CD40L interactions play a crucial role in T cell&#x02013;dependent (TD) immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), contributing to germinal center (GC) formation, memory B cell development, Ig isotype switching, and affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>The cytoplasmic tail of CD40, which lacks intrinsic catalytic activity, delivers signals to the cells by recruitment of TNF receptor&#x02013;associated factors 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. Interaction with its ligand leads to clustering of CD40 in lipid rafts and, finally, to the recruitment of TNF receptor&#x02013;associated factor molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). These events initiate downstream signaling, resulting in activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase, phospholipase C&#x003b3;, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Additionally, the Janus family kinase 3 (JAK3), which is associated with the cytoplasmic tail of CD40, undergoes phosphorylation, resulting in the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>The following three subfamilies of structurally related MAPKs are activated by CD40: extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (Erk1) and Erk2, the c-jun kinases Jnk1 and Jnk2, and the kinase p38/MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). MAPKs are serine/threonine protein kinases, which are activated by dual phosphorylation on a specific tyrosine and threonine residue, respectively. After activation, MAPKs phosphorylate nuclear substrates such as the transcription factors c-Jun, Elk-1, Egr-1, and Atf-2, which in turn bind to specific DNA sequences and thus modulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>CD40 signaling activates both the canonical and the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In mammals, the NF-&#x003ba;B family consists of five genes coding for NF-&#x003ba;B1 (p105/p50), NF-&#x003ba;B2 (p100/p52), RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In unstimulated cells, the DNA-binding activity of NF-&#x003ba;B dimers is inhibited through the interaction with proteins of the inhibitor of the NF-&#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B) family. The activation of the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway largely depends on ubiquitin-dependent degradation of small I&#x003ba;B proteins, leading to the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B heterodimers p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel. The liberated heterodimers are capable of binding DNA, and thereby activating gene expression. The noncanonical pathway depends on proteolytic cleavage of the precursor p100, liberating mainly p52/RelB heterodimers for nuclear translocation. Thus, canonical and noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways induce the formation and nuclear translocation of distinct NF-&#x003ba;B heterodimers that activate distinct target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>Whereas CD40 plays a decisive role in TD immune responses, aberrant CD40 signaling is suspected to play a critical role in the oncogenic processes of various cell types, including B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). CD40 is widely expressed in B cell lymphomas and in selected carcinomas. Additionally, aberrant CD40L expression, which may lead to constitutive CD40 engagement, has been observed in several malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Thus, a contribution of this receptor to tumor pathogenesis has been suggested.</p><p>However, it is unclear whether aberrant CD40 signaling is sufficient to drive lymphomagenesis or whether it is only involved in the maintenance of established malignancies. Adequate experimental systems to explore this question are still missing. To study the biological and potential pathological effects of a constitutive CD40 activation, we generated knock-in mice expressing in a conditional manner a chimeric protein consisting of the transmembrane domain of the Epstein-Barr viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and the intracellular signaling domain of CD40 (LMP1/CD40). This chimeric protein is able to deliver a ligand-independent constitutive CD40 signal by promoting self-aggregation in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Constitutive CD40 signaling in B cells led to a strong accumulation of follicular and marginal zone B cells in secondary lymphoid organs, accompanied by a significant enlargement of follicles. These B cells displayed an activated phenotype, but failed to form GCs in response to immunization with TD antigens. Ultimately, LMP1/CD40-expressing mice developed mono- or oligoclonal B cell lymphomas at high incidence, demonstrating that deregulated CD40 signaling is sufficient to initiate B cell transformation.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Generation of transgenic mice expressing a conditional LMP1/CD40 transgene</title><p>To study constitutive CD40 signaling in vivo, mice expressing a fusion protein comprising the signaling domain of the human CD40 and the transmembrane domain of LMP1 (LMP1/CD40) were generated.

Western blots were prepared from spleen lysates of LMP1/CD40;CD19-Cre (lanes 1 and 2) and control mice (lane 3). As control, protein lysates of 293 cells transiently transfected with a LMP1/CD40 expression vector were included in the analysis (lane 4). The 56-kD LMP1/CD40 chimeric protein was detected by an anti&#x02013;human CD40 antibody. ns, nonspecific band.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051317f01"></graphic></fig><p>The LMP1/CD40<sup>flSTOP</sup> mice were crossed to CD19-Cre and CD21-Cre mice to activate expression of the chimeric protein from earlier (pro&#x02013;/pre&#x02013;) or later (mature) stages of B cell development, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Because offspring of both crosses revealed the same immunological phenotype, results are presented for mice obtained from LMP1/CD40<sup>flSTOP</sup>;CD19-Cre crosses only. In all biochemical experiments, only LMP1/CD40<sup>flSTOP</sup>;CD19-Cre were analyzed. For simplicity, mice carrying one LMP1/CD40 knock-in allele and one CD19-Cre allele will be referred to as LMP1/CD40 mice. As controls, either LMP1/CD40<sup>flSTOP</sup> or CD19-Cre mice were used. These control strains had an identical phenotype. In LMP1/CD40 mice, deletion of the stop cassette could be detected in about half of BM and in almost all splenic B cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports showing a gradual increase in Cre-mediated recombination in CD19-Cre mice as B cells proceed through their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Expression of the LMP1/CD40 protein in splenic cells after removal of the stop cassette was analyzed by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). LMP1/CD40 protein expression was detected in splenocytes isolated from LMP1/CD40 mice, but not in control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), indicating that LMP1/CD40 is expressed after Cre-mediated recombination and confirming the tight control exerted by the stop cassette on transgene expression. To study whether the LMP1/CD40 fusion protein can substitute for CD40 in B cells, we tested its ability to promote Ig class switch recombination. We isolated splenic lymphocytes from LMP1/CD40 mice and stimulated them ex vivo with anti-CD40 agonistic antibody (&#x003b1;-CD40), IL-4, or &#x003b1;-CD40 plus IL-4. After 5 d, a distinct fraction of IgG1 class-switched cells could be detected in cultures of LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells upon stimulation with IL-4 only, whereas in the controls, IgG1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells appeared only after costimulation with &#x003b1;-CD40 and IL-4 (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080238/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080238/DC1</ext-link>). These data indicate that LMP1/CD40 induces Ig class switch recombination in the presence of IL-4, and thus constitutive CD40 signaling in murine B cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Increase of B and T cell numbers in LMP1/CD40 mice</title><p>Conditional expression of LMP1/CD40 in B cells resulted in a splenomegaly in 8&#x02013;16-wk-old mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

The splenomegaly was largely dependent on the increased number of B cells and, to a lesser degree, T cells. On average, eight times more B cells and three times more T cells were recovered from spleens of LMP1/CD40 mice compared with age-matched controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).

The cells were stained daily with the vital dye TOPRO-3, and then subjected to flow cytometric analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The percentage of living cells dropped dramatically in control culture in the absence of CD40 stimulation, whereas the same culture conditions only modestly affected the viability of LMP1/CD40-expressing cells. Furthermore, absolute numbers of living cells were determined for LMP1/CD40-expressing cells and controls over time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). An increase in the number of LMP1/CD40-expressing cells was observed even without additional stimulation, indicating not only better survival but also spontaneous cell division. Additionally, B cells of LMP1/CD40 mice and controls were labeled with CFSE, cultured with or without &#x003b1;-CD40, IL-4, &#x003b1;-CD40 plus IL-4, or LPS, followed by flow cytometric analysis after 5 d (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Compared with control cells, a higher percentage of LMP1/CD40-expressing cells proliferated in the absence of exogenous stimuli or after stimulation with IL-4. Triggering of CD40 resulted in increased proliferation of control B cells, which could be further increased by the addition of IL-4, whereas proliferation of LMP1/CD40-expressing cells was not increased upon CD40 cross-linking.

In gel retardation assays, both unstimulated LMP1/CD40-expressing and control B cells exhibited similar amounts of p50/p65 complexes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref> and Fig. S4 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080238/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080238/DC1</ext-link>). Stimulation of the endogenous CD40 receptor resulted in a robust induction of DNA-binding p50/p65 complexes in control cells. This extent of induction could be seen in neither unstimulated nor in &#x003b1;-CD40&#x02013;stimulated LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref> and Fig. S4 A). These data indicate that the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway is not constitutively activated in LMP1/CD40-expressing cells. The data were confirmed by Western blot analysis showing that I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; levels were comparable in control and LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells, and that I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; was not constitutively phosphorylated in unstimulated LMP1/CD40 B cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; was even less phosphorylated in unstimulated LMP1/CD40-expressing cells than in control B cells. Inhibition of de novo I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; synthesis by addition of cycloheximide excluded the possibility that pI&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; cannot be detected in the Western blots because of an increased high turnover rate of I&#x003ba;B in unstimulated LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells (Fig. S4 B). Upon CD40 stimulation, degradation of I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; in B cells expressing LMP1/CD40 was delayed in comparison to control cells, indicating that in mutant cells the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway can be activated, but to a lower extent than in control cells (Fig. S4 B). In contrast to control cells, we could detect a RelB-containing complex in LMP/CD40-positive B cells in gel retardation assays (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Furthermore, in Western blots, increased p52 protein levels could be detected in mutant B cells compared with control B cells, whereas p100 levels were comparable (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>), thus indicating constitutive activation of the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>LMP1/CD40 expression induces activity of the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway</bold>.

In accordance with the previous results, the levels of RelB and p52 were elevated, whereas p65 and c-Rel levels were similar in nuclear fractions of LMP1/CD40 and control cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). However, c-Rel levels were significantly decreased in the cytoplasm of LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells. Additionally, a significant increase in p50 levels was found in nuclear extracts of LMP1/CD40-expressing cells, which is most likely caused by the increased p105 levels found in the cytoplasm. The increased p50 level might lead to the formation of p50/p50 homodimers, lacking a transactivation domain. It has been shown that, in tumor cells, p50/p50 homodimers interact with Bcl3, resulting in transcriptional activation of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes. This is mostly correlated with elevated Bcl3 levels. However, in LMP1/CD40-expressing cells we could detect neither increased levels of p50/p50 homodimer formation in gel retardation assays (Fig. S4 A) nor elevated Bcl3 levels in the nuclear fraction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>), suggesting that most p50 is bound to RelB and thereby contributes to the activity of the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway.

Yet, the question of whether aberrant CD40 signaling is sufficient to promote tumorigenesis remains unresolved. To investigate biological and pathological roles of constitutive CD40 signaling in B cells, we used the transmembrane domain of LMP1 as a surrogate to induce ligand-independent aggregation of the CD40 intracellular signaling domain. We show that constitutive CD40 signaling in B cells leads to a significant increase in peripheral mature B cells and, ultimately, to the development of mature B cell lymphomas.</p><p>Previous in vitro experiments have shown that the LMP1/CD40 fusion protein acts similar to LMP1 in terms of self-aggregation and is able to mimic ligand-triggered CD40 signaling with respect to the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and stress-activated protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). In this study, we show that B cell&#x02013;specific LMP1/CD40 expression in transgenic mice can replace CD40&#x02013;CD40L interaction to promote immunoglobulin class switching, thus indicating that LMP1/CD40 indeed acts as a constitutively active CD40 receptor. B cell&#x02013;specific expression of LMP1/CD40 in mice caused splenomegaly with an accumulation of both follicular and marginal zone B cells. The expansion of transgenic B cells may depend on their prolonged survival and/or increased proliferation as demonstrated by our ex vivo studies and in vivo BrdU incorporation assays (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and unpublished data). Despite their activated status, transgenic B cells were strongly impaired in GC formation. This is in accordance with a previous study showing that LMP1/CD40 is able to down-regulate <italic>bcl6</italic>, which is a key regulator of the GC reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). We observed not only an accumulation of B cells but also of activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in young LMP1/CD40 mice. It is unlikely that this T cell expansion is caused by a leakiness of Cre recombinase expression because the same T cell expansion was observed in crossings with two independent B cell&#x02013;specific Cre lines (CD19-Cre and CD21-Cre). Additionally, deletion of the stop cassette in T cells of LMP1/CD40 mice could not be detected by PCR (unpublished data). Therefore, the observed T cell expansion might instead be caused by an antigen-independent bystander effect induced by LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells. It has been shown that production of cytokines, as well as cell surface molecules, expressed on antigen-presenting cells during an immune response can activate T cells nonspecifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), and that CD40-activated antigen-presenting cells promote the expansion of memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), suggesting that LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells may be able to generate an activating environment for T cells.</p><p>Deregulated CD40 signaling induced the development of lymphomas in &#x0003e;60% of mice older than 1 yr. Consistent with the B cell&#x02013;specific expression of LMP1/CD40 and the effects of constitutive CD40 signaling on B cell survival and proliferation, most of these tumors were of clonal B cell origin. Only 1 out of 11 lymphomas was T cell derived. In all other tumors, the expanded population carried clonal IgH rearrangements and expressed B cell markers. The nodular growth pattern of the lymphomas was reminiscent of follicular lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). However, in contrast to follicular lymphomas, the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes cloned from LMP1/CD40-expressing B lymphoma cells were unmutated, indicating a pre-GC origin. The late onset of tumor development, the heterogeneity in surface marker expression, and the activity of distinct signaling pathways suggest that multiple independent secondary oncogenic hits cooperate with CD40 activation to promote lymphomagenesis.</p><p>A role for CD40 signaling in the pathogenesis of human B cell lymphomas and carcinomas has previously been suggested. We provide strong evidence that constitutive CD40 signaling exerts transforming activity in vivo. The oncogenic property of constitutive CD40 signaling appears in contrast with the previously reported therapeutic effects of CD40 triggering in hematopoietic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Indeed, triggering the CD40 receptor can promote growth arrest and cell death of malignant CD40-expressing cells and can induce an autologous antitumor T cell response by up-regulating the costimulatory molecules B7.1 and B7.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Our data suggest that this therapeutic approach might not be risk free. The level and duration of the CD40 signal may critically influence the balance between the apparently contrasting biological effects triggered by CD40 signaling. Indeed, low-level constitutive engagement of CD40 was shown to induce proliferation of lymphoma cells, whereas treatment of malignant cells with high doses of agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies or CD40L resulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).</p><p>Our gel retardation and nuclear fractionation experiments revealed that, compared to control B cells, RelB-containing complexes are increased in the nuclei of LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells, indicating constitutive activation of the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. We suggest that in LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells, RelB dimerizes with either p50 or p52, which were both found to be increased in the nuclear fraction. This is in accordance with previous reports showing that the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway based on p100 processing leads to the nuclear translocation of not only RelB/p52 but also of RelB/p50 dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). In contrast to the noncanonical pathway, the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway was not found to be activated in LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells, as indicated by similar p65 and c-Rel levels in the nuclear fractions of unstimulated LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells and control B cells. The reduced basal phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; in LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells compared with control B cells suggests that the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is even less active in the mutant cells than in unstimulated control B cells. Additionally, in comparison to control B cells, p105 levels were increased, whereas c-Rel levels were decreased, in the cytoplasm of LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells. Whether this alteration is caused by the constitutive activation of CD40 or a direct consequence of the constitutively activated noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway remains to be determined. The question arises why LMP1/CD40 expression in B cells leads selectively to the activation of the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. In wild-type B cells, CD40 ligation results in a fast and robust activation of the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B activity, which is rapidly counteracted by multiple negative-feedback mechanisms, whereas the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway responds more slowly and appears to lack strong negative-feedback mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). This might explain the preferential chronic activation of the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells. Recently, two studies have provided compelling evidence that the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway plays a critical role in multiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Thus, 20% of patients with MM were found to carry mutations in essential NF-&#x003ba;B components, leading mainly to the activation of the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Of note, in some cases of MM, a strong up-regulation of CD40 was observed. As shown for CD30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), CD40 overexpression might lead to self-aggregation of CD40, resulting in ligand-independent constitutive CD40 signaling, and thus creating a primary oncogenic event similar to that seen in our experimental system.</p><p>In addition to the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, the MAPKs Erk and Jnk were constitutively phosphorylated in unstimulated LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells. The importance of Erk phosphorylation for the improved survival of ex vivo&#x02013;isolated LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells was supported by the fact that the survival advantage by LMP1/CD40 expression was abrogated in the presence of the Mek1/2 inhibitor UO126. The Ras&#x02013;Raf&#x02013;Mek&#x02013;Erk pathway has been implicated in malignant transformation of various cell types and has been associated with proliferation and survival of hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). A basal constitutive activity of Erk, which has been attributed to CD40, CD30, and RANK signaling, has also been described in the Hodgkin-Reed Sternberg tumor cells of Hodgkin disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Treatment of Hodgkin disease cell lines with the MEK inhibitor UO126 resulted in the inhibition of proliferation, underlining the importance of constitutive Erk phosphorylation for the proliferation of Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines. Unlike premalignant LMP1/CD40 B cells, constitutive Erk phosphorylation was not consistently detected in all independent primary tumors derived from LMP1/CD40-expressing B cells. This result suggests the existence of distinct oncogenic partners involved in CD40-driven lymphomagenesis, some of which may bypass the need for Erk activation.</p><p>Our results provide direct evidence that constitutive CD40 signaling leads to the selective activation of the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and the MAPKs Jnk and Erk. The concerted action of these signaling pathways ultimately leads to B cell lymphomagenesis. The mouse model described in this paper provides a tool to dissect the contribution of these signaling pathways to lymphomagenesis in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Generation of the transgenic mouse line LMP1/CD40.</title><p>The <italic>LMP1/CD40</italic> chimeric gene was isolated from the plasmid p1778.16 encoding aa 1&#x02013;190 from LMP1 fused to aa 223&#x02013;280 of human CD40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). The adenine at position 243 bp after the ATG of the LMP1 gene was replaced by a cytosine, introducing a silent mutation, to destroy a potential splice acceptor side.
