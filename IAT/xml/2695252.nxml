To test the efficacy of synthesized siRNAs targeting <italic>P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R</italic>, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT&#x02013;PCR) assays were performed. Migration assays were performed both in vitro and in vivo by wounding the epithelium with a pipette tip and n-heptanol, respectively.

Clear reduction of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R expression was observed at both the mRNA and protein levels in corneas treated with siRNA. In vitro and in vivo migration analysis showed that the silencing process has concomitantly reduced the ability of corneal cells to close the wounds in the presence of the Ap<sub>4</sub>A.

In the cornea, this physiologic process (corneal epithelial renewal) is essential to form a regular refractive surface and to form a barrier that contributes to corneal deturgescence and the prevention of pathogen invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. The renewal of the corneal epithelium is sustained by the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of stem cells present in the limbus.</p><p>Many substances present in tears or the aqueous humor or released from corneal nerves stimulate the wound healing process after ocular surface injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Since the corneal surface is frequently damaged by refractive surgery, chemical trauma, inflammation, or infection, mechanisms by which epithelial receptors and its ligands elicit control of corneal epithelial renewal/wound healing have been investigated.</p><p>Among the naturally occurring substances recently found to modify the rate of healing, nucleotides and dinucleotides present in tears have been shown to be very active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Nucleotides influence the corneal epithelial cells healing rate by either accelerating or decelerating the healing process. The way the wound healing process takes place depends on the metabotropic P2 receptors that are activated. It has been tentatively suggested that the activation of P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors accelerates the rate of corneal epithelial cell migration while the stimulation of a P2Y<sub>6</sub> does the opposite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. The positive role of the P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor (P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R) is a matter of interest in understanding how this receptor triggers the intracellular machinery that produces an increase in the rate of healing. However, due to the lack of selective antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], it is not possible to prove the involvement of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R in the corneal wound healing process.</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi) technology has proven to be an efficient tool to suppress the expression of targeted genes in vitro and, more recently, in vivo. In vivo assays have allowed us to evaluate the therapeutic potential of synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). For a review of in vivo use of siRNA, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Ocular delivery of siRNAs has also been performed for both basic biology research and to develop new treatments for ocular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>].</p><p>The lack of selective antagonists to block the action of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R as previously commented led us to investigate the role of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R in corneal wound healing by designing a siRNA capable to eliminate the expression of this protein in corneal cells. Therefore, in this experimental work, we describe the cloning of rabbit <italic>P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R</italic> and the design of a siRNA against <italic>P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R</italic> mRNA, which clearly demonstrates the importance of this receptor in the process of wound healing triggered by nucleotides and dinucleotides both in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male, adult New Zealand White rabbits were used in these studies.

For first-strand cDNA synthesis, 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g of total RNA was retrotranscribed using the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase and oligo(dT; Invitrogen.

Two sequences of nine (maximum GC content 60%) suggested candidates were selected. Nucleotide sequences of the siRNA target sites were as follows: <italic>P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R</italic> siRNA #1, 5&#x02032;-AAT GAG GAC TTC AAG TAC GTG-3&#x02032; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) and <italic>P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R</italic> siRNA #2, 5&#x02032;-AAC CTG TAC TGC AGC ATC CTC-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both siRNAs were obtained from Applied Biosystems in annealed and lyophilized forms and were suspended in RNase-DNase-free water or in 0.9% NaCl before in vitro or in vivo use. In addition, a Cy3-labeled non-silencing siRNA, used to determine optimal conditions for siRNA transfection, was also purchased from Applied Biosystems. Transfection complexes were prepared in an Opti-MEM serum free medium (Invitrogen) by mixing 3&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of siPORT NeoFX transfection reagent (Applied Biosystems) and 300 nM of <italic>P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R</italic> siRNA or just in RNase-DNase-free water (transfection reagent alone was the control). SIRC cells (50,000 cells per well) were plated in a 24 well format after the addition of transfection complexes. Cells were then incubated for 72 h and analyzed by migration assay. To evaluate transfection efficiency, SIRC cells were incubated for 24 h with 30 nM Cy3-labeled non-silencing siRNA, washed briefly in PBS, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Nuclei localization was analyzed using PicoGreen staining (1:200).

The involvement of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R and P2Y<sub>4</sub>-R in corneal wound healing has been previously suggested by our and other groups through pharmacological tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>].

To achieve high siRNA silencing efficacy in the in vivo models, it is critical not only to design specific siRNAs but also to choose the most appropriate route of delivery. Between the ocular routes of administration, we chose topical instillation because of our target tissue (cornea). Topical instillation is a noninvasive technique and lacks toxicity. Due to the corneal-protective characteristics, we performed frequent instillations. However, we did not observe changes in the cornea by slit-lamp biomicroscopy.</p><p>Efficiency of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R silencing was also confirmed in living animals by IHC and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. In addition, protein and mRNA reduction, ruled out a possible microRNA (miRNA)-related translational mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>].</p><p>Our IHC results reveal that after wounding, P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R staining in Ap<sub>4</sub>A-treated wounds is less intense than in control wounds. As with many other agonists (for example, insulin), when Ap<sub>4</sub>A binds to its receptor, P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R, on the surface of a cell, the Ap<sub>4</sub>A-P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R complex undergoes endocytosis and is subsequently attacked by intracellular lysosomal enzymes. The internalization of the Ap<sub>4</sub>A molecules provides a pathway for degradation of the Ap<sub>4</sub>A-P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R complex as well as for regulation of the number of sites that are available for binding on the cell&#x02019;s surface. The rate of synthesis of new receptors within the endoplasmic reticulum and their insertion in the plasma membrane does not keep pace with their rate of destruction. Over time, this self-induced loss of target cell receptors for Ap<sub>4</sub>A reduces the target cell&#x02019;s sensitivity to the elevated dinucleotide concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>].</p><p>In vivo corneal wound healing is a process that occurs in three main steps: lag phase (from 0 h to 10 h after the wound), migration phase (until 24&#x02013;36 h after the wound), and mitosis phase (lasting from 36 h after the wound to weeks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. In this manuscript, we have investigated the role of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R in the Ap<sub>4</sub>A acceleration of the migration rate after corneal wound healing both in vitro and in vivo. The tested siRNA performed its effect in the first 36 h after the wound, a period that correlates with the migration phase that we have investigated in this manuscript. Altogether, these results confirm the role of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R in corneal wound healing. As indicated in our results, a selective siRNA against <italic>P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R</italic> significantly blocked the ability of the dinucleotide Ap<sub>4</sub>A to accelerate the rate of re-epithelialization after corneal scratch.</p><p>Preliminary experiments performed in our laboratory established that the application of Ap<sub>4</sub>A induces an increase in the rate of migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. In our earlier study and according to our pharmacological profile, we suggested a P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R mechanism. In the present work, it seems clear that wound healing effect evoked by Ap<sub>4</sub>A is due to activation of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R.</p><p>Demonstrating the presence and the involvement of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-Rs in the corneal wound healing process will allow us to develop compounds for the treatment of corneal wounds and even for corneal repair after refractive surgery.</p><p>It is clear that selective and stable compounds are necessary to produce a positive and sustained wound healing process. This is even more relevant if we take into consideration the presence of enzymes cleaving nucleotides in the ocular surface and the presence of other P2 receptors delaying corneal wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. In this context, we suggested in a previous work possible P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R/P2Y<sub>6</sub>-R switches, which control the transition from wound healing phase 2 to phase 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. More experiments will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis and a possible approach is the use of multi/individual-target siRNA.</p><p>In summary, the cloning and the design of a <italic>P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R</italic> siRNA has allowed us to demonstrate the involvement of this receptor in a relevant process such as corneal wound healing. This demonstrates that the use of siRNA to silence proteins is an interesting tool for receptors that do not have selective antagonists to prove their participation in biochemical and physiologic processes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work has been supported by research grants from Comunidad de Madrid, NEUROTRANS-CM Ref.: S-SAL-0253&#x02013;2006, RETICS RD07/006/0004, and BSCHUCM (GR58/08).
