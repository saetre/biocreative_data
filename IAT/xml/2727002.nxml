We determine the importance of the Ccr4-Not complex for the levels of non-coding nuclear RNAs, such as mis-processed and polyadenylated snoRNAs, whose turnover depends upon the nuclear exosome and TRAMP. Consistently, mutation of both the Ccr4-Not complex and the nuclear exosome results in synthetic slow growth phenotypes. We demonstrate physical interactions between the Ccr4-Not complex and the exosome. First, Not5 co-purifies with the exosome. Second, several exosome subunits co-purify with the Ccr4-Not complex. Third, the Ccr4-Not complex is important for the integrity of large exosome-containing complexes. Finally, we reveal a connection between the Ccr4-Not complex and TRAMP through the association of the Mtr4 helicase with the Ccr4-Not complex and the importance of specific subunits of Ccr4-Not for the association of Mtr4 with the nuclear exosome subunit Rrp6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We propose a model in which the Ccr4-Not complex may provide a platform contributing to dynamic interactions between the nuclear exosome and its co-factor TRAMP.

In many cases the processing is accompanied by degradation of processed RNA fragments and degradation of aberrantly processed RNAs occurs through surveillance pathways. The exosome is a conserved multi-subunit 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exoribonuclease complex that plays a central role in a large number of the pathways related to RNA degradation. It also plays a major role in RNA processing pathways, both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006760-Butler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). The targets for the exosome are multiple since the exosome contributes to the turnover of cytosolic mRNAs, the normal processing of nuclear rRNAs and snoRNAs, and it participates in surveillance mechanisms leading to degradation of aberrant forms of different RNAs in the nucleus. The eukaryotic exosome is made up of 9 core subunits, with 6 subunits carrying the fold of bacterial RNase PH, a phosphorolytic RNase, namely Rrp41, Rrp42, Rrp43, Rrp45, Rrp46 and Mtr3, and 3 putative RNA-binding proteins, Csl4, Rrp4 and Rrp40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006760-Liu1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

TRAMP is composed of a poly(A) polymerase, either Trf4 or Trf5, a putative RNA binding protein, Air1 or Air2, and a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; RNA helicase Mtr4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006760-LaCava1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006760-Vanacova1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006760-Egecioglu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

The presence of Not5 in the purifications from the two mutants was confirmed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006760.s009">Table S2</xref>), and Not5 was not identified in the purification from the wild-type, supporting the analysis by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

This was investigated by glycerol gradient fractionation of total cell extracts followed by western blot analysis of the fractions with antibodies against the calmodulin binding peptide entity of the Tap-tag (CBP). In wild-type cells Rrp41 eluted with a very broad profile suggesting that it was present in complexes of very different sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), including very large complexes (fractions 17&#x02013;21 at the bottom of the gradient, in which both <italic>25S</italic> and <italic>18S</italic> rRNAs could be found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006760.s004">Fig. S4</xref>)). Not5 also eluted with a broad profile, consistent with previous studies using superose 6 gel filtration analyses of total protein extracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006760-Maillet1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, it was also present in fractions 17&#x02013;21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). The deletion of Not4 and Caf40 lead to a loss of Not5 in the fractions corresponding to these largest complexes (see fractions 17&#x02013;21 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). This was not surprising for Not5 in <italic>not4&#x00394;</italic>, since previous studies have already demonstrated a partial disruption of Ccr4-Not complexes in this deletion strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006760-Maillet1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006760-Azzouz1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, but it was new for Not5 in <italic>caf40&#x00394;</italic>, since the importance of Caf40 for Ccr4-Not complex integrity has not yet been studied. Surprisingly however, these mutations of the Ccr4-Not complex also had a great impact on the elution profile of Rrp41, since the largest Rrp41-containing complexes were disrupted in <italic>caf40&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>not4&#x00394;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, see fractions 13&#x02013;21). Thus the more efficient purification of Rrp41 in <italic>caf40&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>not4&#x00394;</italic> in one hand and the co-purification of Not5 with Rrp41 in other hand are correlated with the release of Rrp41 from large soluble structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>RNA limits accessibility of the Not5-interacting exosome to purification</title><p>These results are compatible with the idea that the Not5-associated Rrp41 that was affinity purified in the mutants might have been released from the larger Rrp41 complexes in <italic>not4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>caf40&#x00394;</italic>. However, it could also be that co-purification of Not5 with Rrp41 was detectable in the mutants simply because Rrp41 itself was more efficiently purified. Finally, the association of Not5 with Rrp41 could be an aberrant mutant phenotype resulting from the disruption of the Ccr4-Not complex.</p><p>To first exclude this latter possibility, and to additionally determine whether Not5 interacted with the entire exosome or only with Rrp41, we determined whether Not5 co-purified with any other exosome subunit in wild-type and mutant cells.

The purification of Tap-tagged Csl4 from total extracts of wild-type cells was generally more efficient than that of Rrp41 (data not shown) suggesting that the tag on Csl4 might be more accessible in the different exosome-containing complexes. In any event, these results indicate that Not5 is likely to interact with the exosome, and that this interaction occurs in wild-type cells. Indeed, Not5 could also be co-immunoprecipitated with several other Tap-tagged exosome subunits from wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006760.s005">Fig. S5</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0006760-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006760.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Not5 co-precipitates with Csl4 and Rrp41.</title><p>A.

In particular we wanted to determine whether they might contain RNA, since both the Ccr4-Not complex and the exosome are RNA-degrading machines. For this purpose, we prepared total protein extracts from wild-type cells expressing Tap-tagged Rrp41 that we treated or not with RNAse A prior to tandem affinity purification of Rrp41. In both cases the exosome was purified, as determined by western blot analysis with antibodies against CBP (to detect Rrp41), and against Rrp4 or Rrp43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Not5 co-purified with Rrp41 from wild-type cell extracts treated with RNAse A but not from untreated wild-type cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, in wild-type cell extracts RNA limits the accessibility of Not5-associated Rrp41. In good correlation with this finding, digestion of RNA in total cellular extracts prior to their separation by glycerol gradient centrifugation showed that the integrity of the largest Rrp41-containing complexes was indeed RNA-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006760.s006">Fig. S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The Ccr4-Not complex interacts with the exosome</title><p>The co-purification of Not5 with the exosome isolated via Rrp41 or Csl4 raised the question of whether the entire Ccr4-Not complex interacts with the exosome, or whether Not5 interacts with the exosome independently of the Ccr4-Not complex. Indeed to date it is still unclear whether Ccr4-Not subunits function outside the context of a complex or not. The improved recovery of the exosome by affinity purification of tagged Rrp41 when the Ccr4-Not complex was compromised supported the idea that the entire Ccr4-Not complex was involved, but its role could have been indirect. To address this issue, we first purified Tap-tagged Not5 itself and identified Not1, Not2, Not3, and Caf40, as well as Rrp41, as co-purifying proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006760.s010">Table S3</xref>). These results confirmed an interaction between Not5 and Rrp41, but did not clearly determine whether the Ccr4-Not subunits co-purifying with Not5 were within the same complex as Rrp41. We next tandem-affinity purified the Ccr4-Not complex through different subunits from wild-type cells or from the <italic>caf40&#x00394;</italic> mutant in which accessibility of the Not5-exosome complexes was improved (see above). Depending upon which subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex was tagged, the success in purifying intact Ccr4-Not complexes from wild-type cells was variable. For instance, purification of Tap-tagged Not4 led to isolation of complexes lacking Not2 and Caf130, purification of Tap-tagged Not2 led to isolation of complexes lacking Caf130, whereas purification of Tap-tagged Caf130 was inefficient, and only led to co-purification of Not1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). The deletion of Caf40 had a major impact in all cases. For Not2 or Not4, the co-purification of several subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex, namely Not3, Ccr4 and Caf1, was less efficient, suggesting that the core Ccr4-Not complex might be less stable in the absence of Caf40. In contrast, for Caf130 the co-purification of Not2 and Not5 was greater, suggesting that the tag on Caf130 within Ccr4-Not complexes might have become more accessible because of the Caf40 deletion. Most importantly, for the <italic>caf40&#x00394;</italic> strains, Rrp41 and Rrp42 co-purified with the Tap-tagged Ccr4-Not subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006760.s010">Table S3</xref>). Thus, the isolation of exosome subunits by purifying different Ccr4-Not subunits besides Not5 suggests that these exosome subunits most likely interact with the integral Ccr4-Not complex.</p><fig id="pone-0006760-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006760.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Subunits of the Ccr4-Not, exosome and TRAMP complexes co-purify.</title><p>2 g of total proteins extracted from (A) wild-type cells expressing Tap-tagged Not5 or (B) wild-type and <italic>caf40&#x00394;</italic> cells expressing Tap-tagged Not4, Not2, or Caf130 as indicated, were subject to tandem affinity purification.

We also observed the co-immunoprecipitation of other subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex (Ccr4, Not3, Not5 and Caf1) with Mtr4, using Tap-tagged Mtr4, and polyclonal antibodies against the Ccr4-Not complex subunits (data not shown). RNA degradation had no effect on the co-precipitation of Caf40 with Mtr4, whilst the co-precipitation of Not4 with Mtr4 was improved. Since Mtr4 was the bait protein each time, these results suggested that complexes containing Mtr4 and Caf40 might not entirely overlap those containing Mtr4 and Not4. We hence tested the association of Mtr4 with Not4 in <italic>caf40&#x00394;</italic>, and the association of Mtr4 with Caf40 in <italic>not4&#x00394;</italic>. The deletion of Not4 led to a reduced co-precipitation of Mtr4 with Caf40. In contrast, the co-precipitation of Mtr4 with Not4 was improved in the absence of Caf40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>) and the same was observed for the co-precipitation of Mtr4 with the other subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex mentioned above (not shown). Hence Not4 contributes to the interaction between Caf40 and Mtr4, but Caf40 seems to be in competition with the interaction between Mtr4 and other subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex. Interestingly, Caf40 co-immunoprecipitated with another subunit of the TRAMP complex, the Trf4 polymerase, and this co-immunoprecipitation was also decreased in cells lacking Not4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>).

Starting from our finding in a previous study of a very significant accumulation of polyadenylated snoRNAs in several mutants of the Ccr4-Not complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006760-Azzouz1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> we observed synthetic growth phenotypes when mutants of the Ccr4-Not complex were combined with the deletion of the nuclear exonuclease Rrp6, whose role in processing and degradation of aberrantly processed snoRNAs has been clearly established.

We could determine that these genetic and functional interactions correlate with physical interactions between the Ccr4-Not complex and the nuclear RNA degradation machinery provided by TRAMP and the nuclear exosome. Indeed, we demonstrated that Not5 co-purified with the exosome through Rrp41 or Csl4, that the purification of Ccr4-Not complexes through different subunits led to the co-purification of the Rrp41 and Rrp42 subunits of the exosome, and that the association of the exosome subunit Rrp41 in very large soluble structures was dependent upon subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex. We also provided evidence that the Ccr4-Not and exosome complexes are likely to be associated in RNA-containing structures. Finally, we showed that the Ccr4-Not complex was physically associated with the Mtr4 RNA helicase, a subunit of the TRAMP complex and co-factor of the nuclear exosome.</p><p>Though we did not demonstrate that Mtr4 and Rrp41 were a part of the same Ccr4-Not containing complex, it is interesting to note that Mtr4 and exosome subunits were purified together with the Ccr4-Not complex in the same affinity purifications.

However curiously, when purifying the Ccr4-Not complex in different ways, we only co-purified at most a couple of the exosome subunits and only Mtr4 of TRAMP, and similarly when purifying the exosome, we only co-purified Not5 of the Ccr4-Not complex. This raises the question of whether the partial entities that we isolated exist as such <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, we believe that this is highly unlikely and rather imagine that <italic>in vivo</italic> the Ccr4-Not complex interacts with the integral exosome and maybe also the integral TRAMP complex. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that the Ccr4-Not complex might serve as some form of a chaperone for TRAMP and/or the exosome <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that this explains why it can be isolated interacting only with certain subunits of these complexes. Alternatively, it could be that the interactions between these entities are highly dynamic and only stabilized in the largest structures where however the accessibility to purification of the different components is reduced. Hence, partial disruption of these structures required to access the different components may also disrupt or destabilize certain entities such that only the directly interacting partners are captured during purification. If this is the case, according to the different analyses that we performed, Not5 and Rrp41 would be the subunits within each complex that directly interact. Rrp42 was isolated in certain cases with Rrp41 and the Ccr4-Not complex and may be closely connected to Rrp41 within the exosome.

It will be interesting to see whether an interaction between Rrp41 and Not5 can indeed be recapitulated <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>In the case of the interactions between the Ccr4-Not complex and TRAMP, Mtr4, but none of the other subunits of TRAMP were identified by mass spectrometry in any of our purifications, suggesting that it is the most direct partner of the Ccr4-Not complex. Concerning which subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex may be the privileged partner of Mtr4, this is still an open question.</p><p>It is clear that none of our experiments have actually determined that the interactions between the Ccr4-Not complex and either the exosome or TRAMP are directly mediated by interactions between subunits of these different complexes. However we have no evidence for the presence of additional proteins in our purifications that might serve as adaptors and RNA is not required for the interactions. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments will nevertheless be required to determine this more precisely.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>A role for the Ccr4-Not complex in functional connection the nuclear exosome and TRAMP</title><p>This study has demonstrated an RNA-independent interaction between Not5 and the exosome, and between Mtr4 and the Ccr4-Not complex. It has also revealed the importance of certain Ccr4-Not complex subunits for co-purification of the nuclear exosome with its co-factor Mtr4. In parallel, non-coding nuclear RNAs whose turnover and/or processing needs the nuclear degradation machinery are also affected by the Ccr4-Not complex. An exciting implication of these findings is that the Ccr4-Not complex might be important to connect Mtr4 with the nuclear exosome for processing and/or degradation of their target RNAs.</p><p>Two subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex come out as particularly interesting in this functional association of the Ccr4-Not complex with the nuclear RNA degradation machinery. Not5, on one hand, co-purifies with the exosome, and its deletion is nearly lethal in cells lacking Rrp6. It might play a key role to bring the exosome to the Ccr4-Not complex. Caf40, on the other hand, is important for the integrity of the largest exosome-containing soluble structures and for the interaction between Rrp6 and Mtr4, but it competes for the interaction between Mtr4 and the other subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex. An exciting model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006760-g009">Fig. 9</xref>) is that the Caf40-Mtr4 interaction might be key to establish interactions between RNA-bound TRAMP, the Ccr4-Not complex and the nuclear exosome, but then also to transfer Mtr4 (and TRAMP) to the nuclear exosome, and to release it from the Ccr4-Not complex. In other words it might ensure dynamic interactions between all of these components. Our observation that the <italic>not5&#x00394; rrp6&#x00394;</italic> double mutant on one hand, and <italic>not5&#x00394; caf40&#x00394;</italic> double mutant on the other hand (unpublished data) have severe growth defects is compatible with the idea that Not5 and Caf40 might participate at different steps in the functional connection of TRAMP and the nuclear exosome.</p><fig id="pone-0006760-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006760.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Model for the connections between the Ccr4-Not, TRAMP and exosome complexes.</title><p>A large(s) structure(s) containing Ccr4-Not, TRAMP, the nuclear exosome and RNA, that may function to coordinate activity of TRAMP and the nuclear exosome, is suggested by our work. Not1, the scaffold of the Ccr4-Not complex is associated with Not5, Not2, Not4 and Caf40 (shown), as well as Caf1, Ccr4, Caf130, and Not3 (not shown). Mtr4 is a subunit of TRAMP that co-immunoprecipitates with Caf40 and Not4, and is co-purified with Tap-tagged Caf40 together with the Ccr4-Not complex. Its association with Not4 (and other subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex) increases in the absence of Caf40. In contrast, Caf40 is required for the interaction between Mtr4 and Rrp6, suggesting that maybe Caf40 contributes to release Mtr4 (and TRAMP) from the Ccr4-Not complex to the nuclear exosome. Rrp41 co-purifies with Tap-tagged Not5, and Rrp41, Rrp42 and Mtr4 co-purify with Not2-Taptag or Not4-Taptag when Caf40 is deleted, probably because the tagged proteins in association with the exosome and TRAMP become accessible to purification in this mutant. Finally, the nuclear exosome becomes more accessible to purification via Rrp41-Taptag when the integrity of the Ccr4-Not complex is compromised by deleting Caf40 or Not4, or when RNA is destroyed. Not5 co-purifies with Tap-tagged Csl4, and with Tap-tagged Rrp41 when it is more accessible to purification by RNA degradation or deletion of Caf40 or Not4.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006760.g009"/></fig><p>Obviously, at present the mechanism by which the Ccr4-Not complex may be contributing to nuclear RNA expression with the nuclear exosome remains to be determined. Whether it may serve strictly as a platform allowing the appropriate assembly of the different partners, namely precursor RNA, nuclear exosome and TRAMP, or plays roles after processing, or even plays more direct roles for instance through the Ccr4 deadenylase, or by connecting nuclear events to the cytoplasm, really needs to be addressed. It will be interesting in a next step to confirm the roles attributed to Not5, Rrp41, Caf40 and Mtr4 in our model, and determine whether disruption of the proposed interactions will have an impact on nuclear exosome function. Finally, because it is becoming increasingly clear that unstable transcripts degraded by the nuclear exosome machinery contribute to regulate transcription, it will also be interesting to determine how much of the transcriptional phenotypes attributed to the Ccr4-Not complex might be indirectly due to inappropriate nuclear exosome function.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains, plasmids and media</title><p>The strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006760-t001">Table 1</xref>.

After cross-linking of the RNAs to the membrane by UV radiation, the membrane was hybridized with radio-labelled probes specific for the different mature or 3&#x02032;extended snoRNAs or rRNA transcripts (sequences available upon request).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Tandem affinity purification</title><p>Large-scale tandem affinity purifications from wild-type or mutant cells were performed as previously described with 2 g of total protein extract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006760-Lenssen2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> except that the NaCl concentration was 150 mM. Small-scale purifications with Tap-tagged proteins were essentially done the same way except that only 2 l of cells were grown, and 60 mg of protein extracts processed with the volumes scaled down. Elution with TEV protease was performed with 1 ml, of which 200 &#x000b5;l were directly analyzed after TCA precipitation on SDS-PAGE followed by coomassie staining and 50 &#x000b5;l were analyzed for western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>For mass spectrometry analysis the sample preparation, gel separation and gel staining were performed according to the SWISS-2D-PAGE protocols. Briefly, the samples were separated on 4&#x02013;12&#x00025; SDS-PAGE gradient gels and stained using coomassie in keratin free conditions. The visualized bands were excised from the gel and treated for mass spectrometry fingerprint analysis as following: they were washed 15 min at RT with acetonitril 30&#x00025;, incubated 35 min at 56&#x000b0;C in 1,4,-dithioerythritol 10 mM, followed by 30 min incubation in iodoacetamid 55 mM at room temperature in the dark. After one wash for 10 min with ammonium biocarbonate 50 mM pH 8.0 and two other washes of 10 min with acetonitril 30&#x00025;, samples were then completely dried down in a vacuum centrifuge for 1 h. After sample rehydration in 20 &#x000b5;l of freshly prepared digestion buffer containing 6.25 ng/&#x000b5;l trypsin for 45 min on ice, digestion was allowed to proceed over night at 37&#x000b0;C. To extract the peptides from the gel digestion supernatant was recovered and pooled with two successive washes of 20 min using 40 &#x000b5;l trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) 1&#x00025; and one wash using TFA 0.1&#x00025;. The collected supernatants were lyophilized to remove salts and washed again with 35 &#x000b5;l TFA 0.1&#x00025; before sample concentration to 2&#x02013;5 &#x000b5;l. 1 &#x000b5;l was loaded on a MALDI plate and after matrix addition, sample acquisition was performed using the MALDI-Tof MS (VOYAGEUR CONTROL PANEL program) and peptides were submitted to fingerprinting analysis. The obtained spectra were finally analyzed using the DATA EXPLORER program and proteins were identified using the MASCOT SEARCH website.
