Stress resistance is a measure of the cell's ability to survive under conditions that are detrimental. Manipulations that extend lifespan often increase stress resistance at the cellular level, and a number of factors that play a role in the stress response have also been implicated in longevity. It is unclear if regulation of metabolism is a feature of cellular survival or how the metabolic state of the cell influences stress resistance. Mitochondria are the key organelle in substrate utilization and energy production. Transcriptional profiling studies demonstrate that genes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism are coordinately up-regulated in multiple tissues with calorie restriction (CR), suggesting a change in dynamic of the electron transport system and a role for this alteration in mitochondrial metabolism in the mechanisms of CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2002</xref>). Biochemical analysis suggests that mitochondria from restricted tissues are functionally different from their control counterparts in terms of metabolism and composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Bevilacqua <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Hepple <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Baker <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Faulks <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The factors involved in exerting these CR-dependent changes in mitochondrial function are unknown. Identification of these factors would provide insight into the mechanism of mitochondrial regulation in response to CR. Our understanding of the complexity of signalling pathways to and from the mitochondria is increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Horbinski &#x00026; Chu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Jazwinski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Schieke &#x00026; Finkel, 2006</xref>), describing a network through which mitochondria may communicate functional status to the nucleus to impact cellular function. Metabolic reprogramming by CR may be central to the mechanism of lifespan extension, where changes in mitochondrial function confer an energetic shift that is conducive to increased cellular fitness, resulting in the promotion of longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Anderson &#x00026; Weindruch, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The transcriptional co-activator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR-&#x003b3;) co-activator 1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;) plays a multifaceted role in the regulation of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Puigserver &#x00026; Spiegelman, 2003</xref>). PGC-1&#x003b1; regulates mitochondrial energy metabolism and biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Finck &#x00026; Kelly, 2006</xref>), and influences carbohydrate and lipid utilization through co-activation of members of nuclear receptor family [e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b1; (PPAR-&#x003b1;), PPAR-&#x003b3;, estrogen related receptor &#x003b1; (ERR&#x003b1;)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Corton &#x00026; Brown-Borg, 2005</xref>). PGC-1&#x003b1; is involved in skeletal muscle fibre type switching, responding to changes in oxidative demand in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), and is also induced with exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Baar <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), indicating that it is responsive to conditions of increased oxygen utilization. PGC-1&#x003b1;-deficient mice have defects in adaptive metabolism in that the metabolic response to hormonal stimuli, cold or the fasting state is dysfunctional in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Leone <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). These data suggest that PGC-1&#x003b1; is a key component in coordinating the animal's metabolic response to external stimuli including nutritional status. Consistent with this, CR increases levels of PGC-1&#x003b1; mRNA in multiple tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Nisoli <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) and is induced in cells treated with serum from restricted animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Lopez-Lluch <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), raising the possibility that PGC-1&#x003b1; is directly responsible for the mitochondrial changes induced by CR. We sought to identify factors involved in regulation of mitochondrial function, and determine if these factors could be connected with cellular survival or longevity pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of PGC-1&#x003b1; on mitochondrial function</title><p>We first examined PGC-1&#x003b1; function and regulation using a cell culture model. As shown, extra copies of PGC-1&#x003b1; conferred increased resistance to oxidative stress in mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>), in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Valle <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">St-Pierre <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In addition, over-expression of PGC-1&#x003b1; causes an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Valle <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). If the increase in stress resistance of the PGC-1&#x003b1; over-expressing cells were because of the difference in mitochondrial membrane potential, we would expect regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential to be a component of the stress response. As shown, live cell staining with MitoTraker Red indicated that mitochondrial membrane potential was elevated within 1 h following exposure to low-intensity oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). The increase in mitochondrial membrane potential with hydrogen peroxide treatment was confirmed using JC1 staining. JC1 aggregates fluoresce at a higher wavelength than free JC1 molecules; because JC1 accumulates in proportion to the membrane potential, the ratio of the higher (Fl2) to lower (Fl1) wavelength is an indicator of membrane potential. In agreement with the increase in membrane potential, there was an increase in protein levels of COX IV, a subunit of the mitochondrial electron transport system and a target of PGC-1&#x003b1; transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). Although the free radical scavengers MnSOD and catalase are known to be induced by PGC-1&#x003b1; 4 h following treatment with hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">St-Pierre <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), levels of both proteins were unaltered in this 1 h time period. This result suggests that the effect of PGC-1&#x003b1; in promoting survival in the early response to oxidative stress is not because of the induction of the antioxidant defence. Knock down of PGC-1&#x003b1; levels by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>) increased cellular sensitivity to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1E</xref>) and prevented the stress-mediated increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>PGC-1&#x003b1; regulates mitochondrial function in response to stress.

Antibodies against GFP or the N-terminal region of PGC-1&#x003b1; reveal that PGC-1&#x003b1; is localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1G</xref>). These data are confirmed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1H</xref>). The observed difference in nuclear distribution as seen by subcellular fractionation is possibly because of over-expression of GFP-tagged PGC-1&#x003b1;. By immunofluorescence, both antibodies detect nuclear accumulation of PGC-1&#x003b1; following exposure to oxidative stress. These data suggest that PGC-1&#x003b1; subcellular distribution is shifted to the nucleus in the early response to oxidative stress where it regulates mitochondrial function.</p><p>SIRT1 NAD-dependent deacetylase is a member of the sirtuin family that has previously been shown to play a role in the oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Longo &#x00026; Kennedy, 2006</xref>). SIRT1 functionally interacts with and deacetylates PGC-1&#x003b1;, promoting its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Nemoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Rodgers <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Baur <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lagouge <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). To test if SIRT1 is also regulating PGC-1&#x003b1; activity in response to stress, cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide in the absence or presence of nicotinamide, a potent sirtuin inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Bitterman <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Avalos <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Nicotinamide permits the immediate inhibition of SIRT1 activity and avoids the necessity to culture cells in the absence of SIRT1. As shown, stress resistance was impaired in wild-type cells in the presence of nicotinamide, but in cells over-expressing PGC-1&#x003b1;, the inhibitory effect was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). These data place PGC-1&#x003b1; downstream of SIRT1 in the stress response because elevated levels of PGC-1&#x003b1; can compensate for the negative effect of nicotinamide on cell survival.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>SIRT1 regulates PGC-1&#x003b1; subcellular localization and activity in response to stress.

Under normal conditions, PGC-1&#x003b1; was detected both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Following oxidative stress, SIRT1 and PGC-1&#x003b1; accumulated in the nucleus and were colocalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). This distribution pattern was transient and, 1 h after exposure to stress, PGC-1&#x003b1; localization returned to that of untreated cells. Subcellular fractionation revealed that in the presence of nicotinamide, PGC-1&#x003b1; failed to accumulate in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>), and this was confirmed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2D</xref>). Under these conditions, the stress-induced elevation of mitochondrial membrane potential was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2E</xref>). These data indicate that SIRT1 regulates a PGC-1&#x003b1;-dependent increase in mitochondrial membrane potential in response to stress, and that regulation of mitochondrial function is critical to survival. To test if SIRT1 regulation of PGC-1&#x003b1; was a direct or an indirect effect, we probed for acetylation of PGC-1&#x003b1; in immunoprecipitates from cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. As shown, PGC-1&#x003b1; acetylation was increased within 15 min of exposure to stress, with subsequent deacetylation by 45 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2F</xref>). In the presence of nicotinamide, PGC-1&#x003b1; was not deacetylated. The timing of modification coincides with PGC-1&#x003b1; accumulating in the nucleus, and when deactylation is prevented PGC-1&#x003b1; fails to localize appropriately. This suggests that the deacetylation of PGC-1&#x003b1; by SIRT1 is required to sequester it in the nucleus. These data demonstrate that PGC-1&#x003b1; activity is regulated by altering subcellular localization in response to stress in cells in culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear degradation of PGC-1&#x003b1;</title><p>The transient nature of PGC-1&#x003b1; accumulation in the nucleus led us to ask how stress subsequently resets PGC-1&#x003b1; distribution to the cytoplasm. There are two most likely explanations: (i) PGC-1&#x003b1; is sequestered in the nucleus and, following transcriptional activation of target genes, is released back to the cytoplasm; and (ii) PGC-1&#x003b1; is sequestered in the nucleus but now, following transcriptional activation, the nuclear pool is degraded, and the cytoplasmic pool is replenished by transcriptional activation of the PGC-1&#x003b1; gene. To test this, we looked for evidence of nuclear degradation of PGC-1&#x003b1;. Subcellular fractionation revealed lower molecular weight forms and reduced levels of PGC-1&#x003b1; in the nuclear pool 1 h following stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). One of the principal mechanisms for specific depletion of proteins is targeted degradation by the proteasome. In agreement with a recent study, PGC-1&#x003b1; levels are increased in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors PSI and lactacystin, indicating that it is a target of the proteasome under normal culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Sano <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>PGC-1&#x003b1; is targeted for GSK3&#x003b2;-dependent proteasomal degradation in response to oxidative stress.

Immunoprecipitation of GSK3&#x003b2; coprecipitated PGC-1&#x003b1;, and this association was impaired in the presence of GSK3&#x003b2; inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>). These data indicate that PGC-1&#x003b1; and GSK3&#x003b2; physically associate during the stress response in a manner that is dependent on GSK3&#x003b2; activity. Immunoprecipitation using phospho-specific antibodies indicated that PGC-1&#x003b1; is phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues in this time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4D</xref>). In the presence of GSK3&#x003b2; inhibitor, PGC-1&#x003b1; is co-immunoprecipitated using phosphoserine-specific antibodies, but not when using phosphothreonine-specific antibodies. In reciprocal experiments, a band was detected in PGC-1&#x003b1; immunoprecipitates using anti-phosphoserine- or anti-phosphothreonine-specific antibodies, but in the presence of GSK3&#x003b2; inhibitor anti-phosphothreonine did not detect PGC-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4E</xref>). The consensus site for GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylation is S/TxxxS/T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Fiol <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>); phosphorylation of the C-terminal residue of the consensus by a priming kinase is a requisite for GSK3&#x003b2;-dependent phosphorylation at the N-terminal residue. These data indicate that serine phosphorylation of PGC-1&#x003b1; is at least in part independent of GSK3&#x003b2;, and threonine phosphorylation is GSK3&#x003b2; dependent.</p><p>Based on these data, we propose a model for PGC-1&#x003b1; regulation in the early response to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4F</xref>). A key component of our model is its dependence on initial conditions prior to PGC-1&#x003b1; transcriptional activity. Upon exposure of the cells to hydrogen peroxide, GSK3&#x003b2; is activated and phosphorylates PGC-1&#x003b1;. As a result, PGC-1&#x003b1; is targeted for intranuclear proteasomal degradation. Now, when PGC-1&#x003b1; is deacetylated by SIRT1 and sequestered in the nucleus, a sustained effect on expression of target genes involved in the mitochondrial electron transport system is prevented. Overall levels of PGC-1&#x003b1; are not altered within this time frame as degradation of the nuclear pool is offset by increased transcription of PGC-1&#x003b1; gene.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> studies</title><p>We next looked for evidence of PGC-1&#x003b1; regulation by this mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice. Mice were exposed to the oxidative stressor paraquat, and tissue was harvested and processed for subcellular fractionation at the indicated time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>). PGC-1&#x003b1; accumulated in the nuclear fraction in mouse skeletal muscle following exposure to paraquat. Densitometric analysis revealed that cellular redistribution of PGC-1&#x003b1; was biphasic, with an initial increase in nuclear accumulation at 1 h and a second further increase at 5 h post-treatment. Western blot analysis demonstrated that GSK3&#x003b2; levels were not changed following stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>). However, after 1 h of treatment, phospho-GSK3&#x003b2; levels were reduced, indicating activation of GSK3&#x003b2;. After 5 h, levels of phospho-GSK3&#x003b2; were increased beyond basal levels observed in the untreated animals. SIRT1 levels were increased at 5 h following treatment. Consistent with our proposed model, the biphasic response of PGC-1&#x003b1; regulators was reflected in the pattern of accumulation of PGC-1&#x003b1; in the nucleus, and in the levels of COX IV and UCP3 which are targets of PGC-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>PGC-1&#x003b1; is regulated by SIRT1 and GSK3&#x003b2; during oxidative stress and calorie restriction (CR) in mice <italic>in vivo</italic>.

(E) Model describing regulation of PGC-1&#x003b1; that permits transient or sustained effects on PGC-1&#x003b1; activity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ace0007-0101-f5"/></fig><p>We next wished to determine if this mechanism of PGC-1&#x003b1; regulation was peculiar to the stress response or if these factors identified in the stress response could regulate PGC-1&#x003b1; in a more general manner. As shown, GSK3&#x003b2; and SIRT1 were both regulated by CR in white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5D</xref>). Protein levels of SIRT1 were increased in adipose tissue from restricted animals compared to controls. At the same time, GSK3&#x003b2; levels were reduced and the relative level of phosphorylation was increased, indicating that GSK3&#x003b2; is less active. SIRT1 positively regulates PGC-1&#x003b1; localization and transcriptional activity, and inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2; would stabilize PGC-1&#x003b1; against proteasomal degradation, consistent with the observed increase in PGC-1&#x003b1; levels and increased expression of multiple PGC-1&#x003b1; gene targets in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Higami <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). We next wished to determine if other factors associated with the stress response in cells in culture also play a role in CR. The stress-activated kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been linked to insulin resistance, and abnormally elevated JNK activity is associated with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hirosumi <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). The fact that CR confers increased insulin sensitivity and causes a 70% reduction in fat mass suggested JNK as a potential candidate regulated by CR. As shown, CR negatively regulated JNK activity (but not amount) in adipose tissue, as decreased levels of phosphorylation are indicative of reduced kinase activity. These data demonstrate that CR impacts stress response pathways and suggests that the link between longevity and stress resistance is through a shared mechanism.</p><p>The subcellular distribution of PGC-1&#x003b1; provides a mechanism for rapidly altering its transcriptional activity, and PGC-1&#x003b1; intranuclear stability determines the duration of transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5E</xref>). In the case of the acute stress response, changes in mitochondrial function occur rapidly. The mechanistic basis of this observation is that stress activates GSK3&#x003b2; and SIRT1 resulting in PGC-1&#x003b1; activation and subsequent degradation. In the case of CR (a chronic stress), induction of SIRT1 and inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2; activate and stabilize PGC-1&#x003b1;, resulting in a sustained increase in expression of genes involved in the mitochondrial energy metabolism.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Mitochondrial function declines with age in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Short <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), and a decline in the expression of components of the electron transport chain is a hallmark of aging across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Zahn <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). However, the extent of the contribution of mitochondrial function to the onset of age-related pathologies like diabetes and heart disease is not yet clear. Mitochondrial dysfunction has pleiotropic effects in mammals, and there is evidence to suggest that changes in mitochondrial function can implement large-scale metabolic changes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chan, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have shown that increased copies of PGC-1&#x003b1; are sufficient to exert an effect on mitochondrial function through increase in mitochondrial membrane potential, and that PGC-1&#x003b1; is required for the stress-induced increase in mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings indicate that PGC-1&#x003b1; plays a role in mitochondrial adaptation and that regulation of mitochondria is a component of the stress response. Why the cellular response to oxidative stress alters mitochondrial function is a matter of speculation: the changes in membrane potential could reflect (i) a response to increased energy demand as cellular survival pathways are induced; (ii) a change in flux of endogenous mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) implemented as a protective mechanism to minimize mitochondrial damage; or (iii) the alteration in mitochondrial function is itself a secondary signal in the response to stress. While studies in isolated mitochondria indicate that increased ROS causes a decrease in membrane potential, the experiments described here differ significantly in that the cells are intact upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide retaining the possibility for extra-mitochondrial signalling and nuclear response.</p><p>We describe a mechanism of PGC-1&#x003b1; regulation through post-translation modification by SIRT1 and GSK3&#x003b2;, that permits transient or sustained effects on mitochondrial function. In addition, we have provided evidence in support of our proposed model in animal studies where we demonstrate that the same regulators are involved in the <italic>in vivo</italic> stress response and in CR. In exploring the relationship between SIRT1 and PGC-1&#x003b1;, we utilized the inhibitors nicotinamide and sirtinol. These inhibitors are not specific to SIRT1, but also influence other members of the sirtuin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Denu, 2005</xref>). Given the established relationship between SIRT1 and PGC-1&#x003b1; and the colocalization of these proteins in response to oxidative stress, it is likely that the effect of these inhibitors on PGC-1&#x003b1; acetylation is because of inhibition of SIRT1. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other sirtuins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Michishita <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) play a role in the stress response and may contribute to the effect of these inhibitors on cellular survival.</p><p>We have shown that PGC-1&#x003b1; stability is regulated by GSK3&#x003b2;, which targets PGC-1&#x003b1; for intranuclear proteasomal degradation. We find that PGC-1&#x003b1; accumulates in bright foci in the nucleus in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors. The same staining pattern is also observed in the presence of GSK3&#x003b2; inhibitor. An independent study has shown that these bright foci costain with PML bodies and are associated with the insoluble nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Sano <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, in our over-expression study using GFP-tagged PGC-1&#x003b1;, the nuclear distribution of the over-expressed tagged PGC-1&#x003b1; differs from that of the endogenous protein. Nuclear GFP&#x02013;PGC-1&#x003b1; is detected in the soluble and insoluble fractions, whereas the endogenous protein is predominately found in the insoluble fraction. Immunofluorescence using either anti-GFP of anti-PGC-1&#x003b1; antibodies detected a similar staining pattern in untreated cells, but a subtle difference in the oxidative-stress-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The areas of nuclear exclusion are evident in cells probed with anti-GFP following stress, but not in the cells probed with anti-PGC-1&#x003b1;, raising the possibility that the tagged protein is not being processed in the same manner as the endogenous protein.</p><p>Regulation of transcription factor activity through subcellular localization and protein stability provides mechanism whereby the expression of key genes is facilitated for a specific duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kodadek <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). It is possible that transcription factor activation that is combined with degradation could influence the behaviour of the transcriptional activator, as in the case of the SAGA complex where activity is stimulated by proteasomal association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). We describe an initial transient activation of PGC-1&#x003b1; in response to stress, while a sustained increase in PGC-1&#x003b1; levels is detected at a later time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">St-Pierre <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The transcriptional targets appear to be specialized for either the early or later response, as COX IV levels are increased in the early response, but unlike the later time frame, the expressions of antioxidant scavengers MnSOD and catalase are not increased. The <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment described here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>) revealed a biphasic nature to the regulation of PGC-1&#x003b1; localization in skeletal muscle from mice treated with paraquat, and this was reflected in the difference in timing of induction of COX IV and UCP3 proteins. It will be interesting to determine how PGC-1&#x003b1; gene target specificity is regulated under these conditions, and if its association with the proteasome is a determining factor.</p><p>There is evidence to suggest that CR induces specific pathways that promote longevity. For example, in yeast, CR and numerous low-intensity stressors associated with longevity activate a common pathway to influence lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Here, we show that PGC-1&#x003b1; transcriptional activity is induced in the oxidative stress response and CR through a shared mechanism, suggesting that in mammals, regulation of mitochondrial function is a key element in both cellular survival and longevity. We propose that mitochondrial plasticity may be critical for maintaining cell viability and in orchestrating the program of aging retardation by CR, raising the possibility that loss of mitochondrial plasticity is an underlying cause of aging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Animal treatments</title><p>Wild-type male C57B16 mice were housed under controlled, specific pathogen-free conditions at the Shared Aging Rodent Facility at Madison VA Geriatric, Research, Education, and Clinical Center.
