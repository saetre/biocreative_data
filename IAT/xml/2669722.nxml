Other recent work suggests that Ser-168 of NS2 is a target of CK2 kinase&#x02013;mediated phosphorylation, and that this controls the stability of the genotype 1a NS2 protein. Here, we show that Ser-168 is a critical determinant in the production of infectious virus particles. Substitution of Ser-168 with Ala (or Gly) ablated production of infectious virus by cells transfected with a chimeric viral RNA (HJ3-5) containing core-NS2 sequences from the genotype 1a H77 virus within the background of genotype 2a JFH1 virus. An S168A substitution also impaired production of virus by cells transfected with JFH1 RNA. This mutation did not alter polyprotein processing or genome replication. This defect in virus production could be rescued by expression of wt NS2 <italic>in trans</italic> from an alphavirus replicon. The <italic>trans</italic>-complementing activities of NS2 from genotypes 1a and 2a demonstrated strong preferences for rescue of the homologous genotype. Importantly, the S168A mutation did not alter the association of core or NS5A proteins with host cell lipid droplets, nor prevent the assembly of core into particles with sedimentation and buoyant density properties similar to infectious virus, indicating that NS2 acts subsequent to the involvement of core, NS5A, and NS3 in particle assembly. Second-site mutations in NS2 as well as in NS5A can rescue the defect in virus production imposed by the S168G mutation. In aggregate, these results indicate that NS2 functions <italic>in trans</italic>, in a late-post assembly maturation step, perhaps in concert with NS5A, to confer infectivity to the HCV particle.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Worldwide, more than 200 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and thus at risk for fatal liver disease. New, virus-specific therapies are under development by the pharmaceutical industry that target aspects of virus entry and genome replication. However, the process of viral assembly and release from the cell remains cloaked in mystery and thus difficult to target for drug development. Here we describe studies that reveal a previously unrecognized role for the nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) of HCV during a late step in this process. We show that mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of NS2 disrupt a maturation step that is required to convert a viral assembly intermediate to a fully infectious virus particle. Additional genetic evidence suggests that this maturation step occurs in concert with another nonstructural protein, NS5A. This study thus sheds new light on the role of nonstructural proteins in assembly and maturation of infectious HCV particles and suggests new targets for drug development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Persistent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common cause of chronic liver disease, and may lead to clinically severe cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Alter1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Pawlotsky1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition to the roles expected of the structural proteins (core, E1, E2) in viral assembly, a number of recent studies suggest that nonstructural proteins, such as NS3 and NS5A as well as p7 and NS2, are also critically important in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Wakita1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Ma1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>NS2 is a small membrane-bound protein with one or more trans-membrane domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Santolini1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Yamaga1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

The resulting mutants were named JFH1(SA) and HJ3-5(SA), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Synthetic RNA derived from either of the parental cDNA clones efficiently produces infectious HCV following transfection into human hepatoma cells (FT3-7 cells, a Huh7 sub-clone). However, the S168A mutation completely abolished infectious virus production by the chimeric HJ3-5 RNA, and significantly reduced the yield of infectious virus released from cells 48 h post-transfection of JFH1 RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast to lysates of cells transfected with the parental RNAs, in which we could readily detect infectious virus, only a low titer of infectious virus was present in lysates of cells transfected with JFH1(SA) RNA; there was no infectious virus at all in lysates of cells transfected with HJ3-5(SA) RNA, which encodes the genotype 1a NS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicate that Ser-168 of NS2 is involved in a step in infectious virus production that occurs prior to the release of virus from cells. Similar results were obtained with viral RNAs mutated to encode a Gly residue at position 168 in NS2 (HJ3-5(SG) and JFH1(SG) mutants, respectively) (see below).</p><fig id="ppat-1000403-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000403.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A single mutation in NS2 disrupts infectious virus production without affecting viral RNA replication.</title><p>(A) Structure of the chimeric HJ3-5 and JFH1 HCV RNAs.

(E) Treatment with sub-toxic concentrations of the CK2 inhibitor DMAT does not reduce virus yields from JFH1 or HJ3-5-transfected cells. In addition to the presence or absence of the NS2 SA mutation, the RNAs transfected in this experiment each contained an S457D mutation in NS5A, which eliminates the need for CK2 phosphorylation of this viral protein. The inhibitor was added to the media from 4 to 24 h post-transfection; virus yields were determined by titration of supernatant fluids collected at 48 h.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1000403.g001"/></fig><p>The impaired production of infectious virus associated with the S168A mutation was not due to an effect on genome replication, since cells transfected with the S168A mutants accumulated HCV RNA at a rate similar to that of wt genomes over the first 48 h post-transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The abundance of the S168A mutant RNA declined after 48 h in transfected cells. In contrast, the increase in abundance of the wt JFH1 or HJ3-5 RNA was sustained beyond 48 h up to 96 h post transfection. This difference in the kinetic of HCV RNA accumulation over time between the S168A mutant and wt genomes is similar to that we have observed previously between an assembly-defective inter-genotypic chimeric RNA (HJ3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and its derivatives, such as HJ3-5, which are assembly competent due to a compensatory Q221L mutation in the NS3 helicase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Ma1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with these results, the S168A mutation did not impair polyprotein processing at the NS2-NS3 junction. This was assessed by determining the self-cleavage activity of an NS2-NS3-NS4A segment derived from the HJ3-5 chimera, with or without the S168A mutation, following its translation in vitro in a cell-free system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the S168A mutation results in a defect late in the virus life cycle, involving either the assembly and/or maturation of infectious particles prior to their release from the cell.</p><p>As discussed above, the NS2 S168 residue has been suggested to be targeted by the host cell kinase CK2 for phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Franck1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the results above indicate that removal of this putative CK2 target site ablates production of infectious virus, we determined whether pharmacological inhibition of CK2 would similarly prevent the release of infectious virus from cells transfected with viral RNA. However, since CK2 phosphorylation of NS5A Ser-457 is essential for infectious virus production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Tellinghuisen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, it was necessary to first eliminate the requirement for CK2 phosphorylation at this site. To accomplish this, we introduced an NS5A Ser-457 to Asp mutation in both the HJ3-5 and JFH1 genomes. This mutation has been shown to render the production of virus from a chimeric genotype 2a RNA insensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of CK2, or siRNA knockdown of CK2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Tellinghuisen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These mutated RNAs, HJ3-5/5A-S457D and JFH1/5A-S457D were transfected into FT3-7 cells, which were then treated with a range of concentrations of the CK2 inhibitor, DMAT (2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole), from 4 to 48 h post-transfection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, DMAT treatment up to 1 &#x000b5;M concentration had no effect on release of infectious virus by either RNA. While we observed a &#x0003e;50&#x00025; reduction of virus yield by cells treated with 10 &#x000b5;m DMAT, this concentration of the inhibitor causes nonspecific cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Tellinghuisen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These results are consistent with previous findings by Tellinghuisen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Tellinghuisen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. They suggest that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of NS2 Ser-168 residue is not essential for the production of infectious virus, and that there is an alternative explanation for the impact of the S168A (or S168G) mutation on this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Expression of NS2 from VEE vectors reveals a genotype-specific difference in NS2 stability that is partially reversed by MG132 inhibition of the proteasome</title><p>To characterize this defect in virus assembly, we designed a series of experiments aimed at determining whether the S168A assembly defect can be complemented <italic>in trans</italic> by wt NS2 expressed from an alphavirus replicon.

MG132 treatment of VEE replicon cell lines significantly enhanced the abundance of the wt H77 NS2 and, to a lesser extent, the related S168G mutant (lanes 3 versus 4 and 5 versus 6). This was the case with both N- and C-terminally Flag-tagged proteins, whether or not the upstream signal sequence was expressed with NS2 (lanes 1 versus 2). However, it had no effect on the abundance of the JFH1 NS2 protein (lanes 7 versus 8). Inclusion of the S168G mutation also did not enhance JFH1 NS2 abundance (data not shown).</p><p>Interestingly, MG132 treatment resulted in the appearance of a &#x0223c;14 kDa NS2 degradation product in cells containing the wt Flag-H77-NS2 replicon, while this was not observed with cells expressing wt JFH1 NS2 (lanes 4 versus 8). The H77 NS2 degradation product was derived from the N-terminus of NS2, since it was detected in Flag immunoblots only when Flag was fused at the N-terminus of NS2 (Flag-H77-NS2) and not the C-terminus (sig-H77-NS2-Flag) (lanes 4 versus 2). Moreover, it was not detected in MG132-treated cells expressing the H77 S168G mutant, Flag-H77-NS2(SG) (lanes 4 versus 6). A similar degradation product was not detected in cells expressing wt JFH1 NS2 upon MG132 treatment (lane 8). These results suggest that the H77 NS2 protein is intrinsically less stable than JFH1-NS2, probably because it is more prone to proteasome-mediated degradation. They also suggest the possibility that H77-NS2 undergoes a cleavage event leading to a &#x0223c;14 kDa fragment that is degraded by the proteasome. Importantly, the S168G mutation appears to prevent that cleavage and stabilize the H77 NS2 protein. While pulse-chase experiments and experiments to determine whether the H77 NS2 molecule is ubiquitinated are ongoing, these results indicate important differences in stability of the H77 and JFH1 NS2 proteins that may in part explain the difference in the impact of the S168A mutation on infectious virus production by the JFH1(SA) and HJ3-5(SA) RNAs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Wild-type NS2 <italic>trans</italic>-complements the S168A defect in virus production in a genotype-specific manner</title><p>To ascertain the potential for <italic>trans</italic>-complementation of the S168A-imposed defect in virus assembly, we transfected the JFH1(SA) and HJ3-5(SA) RNAs into the NS2-expressing cell lines shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g002">Figure 2</xref> and monitored release of infectious virus into the extracellular milieu.

Quantitative pixel analysis also suggested partial co-localization of NS2 with NS5A in these experiments, but to a lesser extent than with E2 (we used Myc-JFH1-NS2 replicon cells in this experiment, as this allowed simultaneous labeling of NS5A with rabbit antibody and NS2 with murine anti-Myc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>, lower panels). Taken together, these results suggest that NS2 and E2 localize to membranes of the peri-nuclear ER, distinct from core which strongly localizes to the lipid droplet. NS5A associates with core on the lipid droplet, but also is found in association with NS2, a fact that may be important in particle assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Second-site mutations in NS2 and NS5A rescue the NS2 S168G-mediated defect in production of infectious virus</title><p>To better understand how Ser-168 might function to confer infectivity on pre-assembled HCV particles, we transfected cells with the HJ3-5(SA) RNA and attempted to isolate revertants with second-site mutations capable of rescuing the ability of the HJ3-5(SA) RNA to produce infectious virus. In multiple transfection experiments, infectious virus began to be released from cells after 6&#x02013;7 cell passages. However, sequencing of RNA extracted from these viruses invariably revealed reversion of the S168A mutation to the wt sequence (a single nucleotide change is sufficient). Different results were obtained with HJ3-5(SG), in which two nucleotide substitutions are required to change the codon (&#x02018;GGG&#x02019;) from Gly back to Ser. We successfully isolated revertants in 4 independent transfection experiments, with release of infectious virus first detected between cell passages 7 to 11 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000403-t001">Table 1</xref>). Sequencing of these viruses revealed mutations at Leu-174 of NS2 in 3 out of 4 independent transfection experiments: this residue was changed to Val in 2 experiments, and to a mixture of Leu and Ile in the third experiment, in concert with a mixture of Trp and Arg at Arg-68 in the protease domain of NS3. (The HJ3-5(SG) clone used in these experiments was found subsequently to contain an adventitious NS5A mutation, Thr-115 to Ala; this had partially or completely reverted to the wild-type Thr sequence in virus from each of these 3 transfection experiments). The only mutation found in infectious virus recovered from the fourth transfection experiment was in NS5A, in which Val-464 was changed to Leu.

In the work described here, we have shown that a highly conserved amino acid residue within NS2 (Ser-168) is essential for the production of infectious virus particles, as the mutation of this residue to Ala or Gly either eliminated or substantially reduced the yield of infectious virus released by cells transfected with viral RNAs containing sequences encoding either genotype 1a or 2a NS2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, we show that the defect in infectious virus production that is caused by mutation of Ser-168 is within a late step in this process, one that occurs subsequent to the assembly of core-protein containing particles, as non-infectious, intracellular particles with sedimentation properties and buoyant densities similar to infectious virus still formed within cells transfected with the mutant RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Consistent with this, core and NS5A proteins were co-localized, as they normally are, on the surface of lipid droplets in HJ3-5(SG) transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, the defect imposed by the Ser-168 mutations appears be within a maturation step that confers infectivity on previously assembled particles. Since the non-infectious, core-containing particles that are assembled by these NS2 mutants are not released from the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), this maturation process may be required for their release from the cell. The data presented here thus reveal a novel role for NS2, most likely in cooperation with NS5A (see below), during the maturation of HCV particles late in the process of virus assembly and release.</p><p>Our focus on the Ser-168 residue in NS2 was prompted by the report of Franck <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Franck1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, who suggested that this residue (in the genotype 1a HCV-H strain of HCV) is targeted by the host kinase, CK2, for phosphorylation. However, although we found that both S168A and S168G mutations ablated production of infectious virus by HJ3-5 RNA (which contains NS2 sequence from H77) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), the lack of a specific effect of DMAT on production of infectious virus by this RNA strongly suggests that phosphorylation of Ser-168 by CK2 is not required for this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). These latter data are consistent with recent work by Tellinghuisen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Tellinghuisen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, who identified a CK2 phosphorylation site in NS5A and reported that treatment with a CK2 inhibitor did not impair infectious virus release by a genotype 2a RNA (J6/JFH1 chimera) provided the NS5A residue targeted by CK2 was first mutated to Asp. Importantly, we found that mutations at NS2 Ser-168 significantly impaired infectious virus production by viral RNAs containing either the genotype 1a (HJ3-5) or 2a (JFH1) NS2A sequence. Taken together, these data suggest that the NS2 Ser-168 mutations are likely to inhibit the production of infectious virus by a mechanism other than interference with CK2 phosphorylation of this residue.</p><p>As described by Franck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Franck1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, we observed that the genotype 1a H77 NS2 protein was subject to proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g002">Figure 2</xref>). While Franck et al. suggested that CK2 phosphorylation of Ser-168 regulates the stability of the H77 NS2 protein, our data suggest that the protein is partially, but not completely, stabilized by a Gly substitution at this residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the wt genotype 2a JFH1 NS2 does not appear to be subject to proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), although it shares the same putative CK2 target site, Ser-168 in NS2, along with other HCV sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Franck1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The difference in the intrinsic stability of the NS2 proteins from these two distinct viral strains may account, at least in part, for the differences we observed in the magnitude of the impact of S168A or S168G mutations on infectious virus production by the HJ3-5 and JFH1 RNAs. The S168A mutation completely abolished infectious virus production by HJ3-5, while causing an incomplete loss of infectious virus yield from the JFH1 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). However, we also observed that the H77 NS2 could <italic>trans</italic>-complement the production defect in HJ3-5(SA) but not JFH1(SA) RNA, while the JFH1 NS2 can rescue virus production by either RNA (although with a greater effect on the JFH1(SA) defect) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). These differences in NS2 <italic>trans</italic>-complementation cannot be attributed simply to differences in NS2 stability, and suggest more fundamental differences in NS2-protein interactions required for particle maturation. Whether these differences are restricted to these two specific strains of HCV, or instead reflect broader, genotype-specific differences (genotype 1a versus 2a), will require further study.</p><p>Importantly, second site mutations involving either Leu-174 in NS2 (residue 938 in the polyprotein), or Val-464 in NS5A (residue 2440) were capable of rescuing the defect in virus production mediated by the S168G mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g009">Figure 9</xref>). An X-ray crystallographic reconstruction of the NS2 auto-protease domain suggests that both Ser-168 and Leu-174 are surface-exposed residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Lorenz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it seems reasonable to speculate that Ser-168 and Leu-174 may be involved in protein-protein interaction(s) required for the maturation of previously assembled particles and leading to the production of infectious virus. The fact that the V464L mutation in NS5A also rescues infectious virus production by the NS2 S168G mutant suggests the possibility that this putative NS2 interaction could involve NS5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g009">Figure 9</xref>). While other explanations are possible for the genetic interaction we observed between NS2 and NS5A, a close physical interaction is suggested by the partial co-localization of NS2 and NS5A identified by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Whether or not a direct interaction occurs between NS2 and NS5A, the rescue of the late NS2 defect in virus production by a second-site mutation in NS5A indicates that NS5A acts at multiple, temporally distinct points in the production of infectious virus particles. First, in an early step in virus assembly, NS5A is recruited to the core protein which decorates the surface of lipid droplets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Tellinghuisen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Appel1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This is a pre-requisite for particle assembly, but it is not sufficient, as we have recently described an NS3 defect in infectious virus production that ablates intracellular particle assembly but does not impair the association of NS5A with core on lipid droplets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Ma1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The data we have presented in this paper indicate that NS2 acts at a later step in the process of infectious particle production, in association with NS5A but subsequent to the earlier involvement of core, NS5A and NS3, to confer infectivity on previously assembled particles in a maturation step that appears to be required for release of virus to the extracellular environment. This hypothetical sequence for the contribution of individual nonstructural proteins to infectious particle assembly and release is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000403-g010">Figure 10</xref>.</p><fig id="ppat-1000403-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000403.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>A model for sequential involvement of non-structural proteins in HCV assembly, maturation, and egress.</title><p>Particle assembly follows the recruitment of core, followed by NS5A and NS3 to the surface of lipid droplets.

It is interesting to note that the NS2A proteins of YFV and Kunjin have also been implicated in virus assembly and release, and in both cases this function can be <italic>trans</italic>-complemented by expression of the wt protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Kummerer1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Leung1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, as we have shown here for HCV. Although the flavivirus NS2A proteins differ substantially from the NS2 protein of HCV both in sequence and functions within the viral life cycle, it is not unreasonable to suspect that they may share some mechanistic features in common during the process of virus assembly and release. In the case of the Kunjin NS2A protein, its role in infectious virus assembly and release appears to be closely linked to the production of specific virus-induced membrane alterations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Leung1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

E2 and NS2 were both prominently localized to membranes of the peri-nuclear ER, suggesting the possibility of an interaction between NS2 and E2 during the maturation process. NS2 may interact with E1 as well, since we showed recently that a mutation in E1 (Y170H) functions cooperatively with a mutation in NS2 (I30T), but not P7 (Y31C), to enhance the infectious yield of virus produced from a genotype 1a/2a chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Yi2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and Yi M, Lemon SM, unpublished data). One possibility is that NS2 might facilitate a rearrangement of the envelope proteins following assembly of the particle that confers or enhances infectivity. Such an envelope rearrangement would not be without precedent among the flaviviruses, and could be required for infectivity of the HCV particle. Additional studies of the HCV assembly and release process will be required to assess this possibility, as well as a detailed characterization of the structure of the infectious virus particle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The parental and chimeric HCV plasmids used in these studies have been described previously: pHJ3-5 (pH-(NS2/NS3)-J/YH/QL) was derived from pHJ3 (pH-(NS2/NS3)-J) by introducing two compensatory mutations, one located within E1 (Y361H) and the other in NS3 (Q1251L), that allow for assembly of infectious virus particles following transfection of Huh7 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Yi2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000403-Ma1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.
