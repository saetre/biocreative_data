We showed previously that <italic>Nfia</italic>-deficient mice exhibit agenesis of the corpus callosum and other forebrain defects; <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient mice have defects in lung maturation and show callosal agenesis and forebrain defects resembling those seen in <italic>Nfia</italic>-deficient animals, while <italic>Nfic</italic>-deficient mice have defects in tooth root formation. Recently the <italic>Nfix </italic>gene has been disrupted and these studies indicated that there were largely uncharacterized defects in brain and skeletal development in <italic>Nfix</italic>-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we show that disruption of <italic>Nfix </italic>by Cre-recombinase mediated excision of the 2nd exon results in defects in brain development that differ from those seen in <italic>Nfia </italic>and <italic>Nfib </italic>KO mice. In particular, complete callosal agenesis is not seen in <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice but rather there appears to be an overabundance of aberrant <italic>Pax6</italic>- and doublecortin-positive cells in the lateral ventricles of <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice, increased brain weight, expansion of the cingulate cortex and entire brain along the dorsal ventral axis, and aberrant formation of the hippocampus. On standard lab chow <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals show a decreased growth rate from ~P8 to P14, lose weight from ~P14 to P22 and die at ~P22. If their food is supplemented with a soft dough chow from P10, <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals show a lag in weight gain from P8 to P20 but then increase their growth rate.

There are 4 NFI genes in mammals (<italic>Nfia</italic>, <italic>Nfib</italic>, <italic>Nfic </italic>and <italic>Nfix</italic>) and single NFI genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Anopheles</italic>, Sea Urchin and other simple animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. No NFI genes have been found in plants, bacteria or single cell eukaryotes. In mammals, NFI proteins form homo- or heterodimers and the 4 NFI genes are expressed in complex, overlapping patterns during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. NFI proteins bind to a dyad-symmetric binding site (TTGGCN<sub>5</sub>GCCAA) with high affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and NFI proteins have been shown to either activate or repress gene expression depending on the promoter and cellular context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The presence of 4 NFI genes with possibly overlapping functions in mammals makes it a challenge to identify <italic>in vivo </italic>targets of individual NFI proteins and the roles of NFI genes in development.</p><p>Previous studies showed that NFI genes are essential for normal prenatal and postnatal mouse development. Disruption of <italic>Nfia </italic>causes multiple neuroanatomical defects including agenesis of the corpus callosum and hydrocephalus along with perinatal lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. More recent studies indicate that some of these brain defects may be due to altered formation of midline glial structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We also showed recently that NFIA and NFIB regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation in developing spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and that loss of <italic>Nfia </italic>can cause defects in kidney development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Targeted disruption of <italic>Nfib </italic>also results in callosal agenesis and other neuroanatomical defects, but <italic>Nfib</italic>-/- animals die at birth, apparently due to a severe delay in lung maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast, loss of <italic>Nfic </italic>has a more modest phenotype with no observed brain defects but major defects in postnatal tooth development, including aberrant incisor formation and greatly reduced molar root formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>Nfic</italic>-/- animals survive to adulthood and are fertile if their diet is supplemented with soft dough which presumably reduces the need for chewing. Here we have generated a conditional <italic>Nfix </italic>knockout (KO) mouse and analyzed the effect of germline loss of <italic>Nfix</italic>. As in <italic>Nfia </italic>and <italic>Nfib </italic>KO mice, loss of <italic>Nfix </italic>causes severe neuroanatomical defects including expansion of the cingulate cortex and the entire brain along the dorsal ventral axis, aberrant hippocampal development and the generation of excessive <italic>Pax6</italic>-expressing ventricular cells. These defects suggest that <italic>Nfix </italic>may function in the repression of neural stem cell proliferation or in cell migration. In addition, loss of <italic>Nfix </italic>causes delays in eye and ear opening and a decreased weight gain that appear related to the postnatal lethality seen in <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Growth phenotype of <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals</title><p>Initial breedings indicated that mice homozygous or heterozygous for the targeted Conditional Allele (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;D</xref>) had no obvious phenotypes (data not shown). Therefore the knockout allele (KO) was generated by Cre-mediated recombination and mice containing the KO allele were analyzed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). <italic>Nfix </italic>transcripts extending from exon 1 to exon 3 were detected in both wild-type (WT) and heterozygous <italic>Nfix</italic>-/+ mice, but no intact transcripts were detected in <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Since exons 2 and 3 are in different protein reading frames, no functional proteins should be generated from transcripts lacking exon 2. Mice heterozygous for the knockout allele had no obvious phenotype and upon breeding their progeny were born at a Mendelian ratio (1:2:1,+/+:-/+:-/-, 52:127:51, 32 litters). However, by postnatal day 8 (P8) <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- (KO) animals began to gain less weight per day than their <italic>Nfix </italic>-/+ (HET) and +/+ (WT) littermates and by P14 the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals began to lose weight (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In addition, <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals opened their eyelids and developed open ear canals ~3 days later than +/+ or <italic>Nfix</italic>-/+ animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), suggesting a general delay in epithelial development. In an effort to overcome the weight loss and lethality seen in the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals, the diet of the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals was supplemented with a soft dough feed that we showed previously could rescue lethality in <italic>Nfic</italic>-/- mice that have defects in tooth development. Surprisingly, while no tooth defects have been detected in the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals, supplementation with soft dough increased their weight gain and they survived longer than animals fed a standard lab diet (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The alleviation of some of the weight gain defect with soft dough addition indicates possible defects in the digestive tract, food sensing, or eating behavior in <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Disruption of the <italic>Nfix </italic>gene</bold>. <bold>A) <italic>Nfix </italic>targeting vector construction and predicted PCR products</bold>. Fragments including exon 2 of the wild type <italic>Nfix </italic>gene (Wild Type Allele) were used to construct the Targeting Vector. The Targeting Vector has one loxP site inserted ~400 nt 5' to exon 2 and a FRT-flanked PGK-Neo cassette (white arrow) with a second 3' loxP site ~600 nt 3' to the end of exon 2. Arrows show the location of PCR primers within genomic DNA used to detect the Wild Type Allele (WT PCR), the targeted Conditional Allele (CA PCR) and the Knockout allele (KO PCR); and primers from outside of and within the targeting vector used to verify correct genomic targeting at the 5' (5' PCR) and 3' (3' PCR) ends of the vector. Males with the Conditional Allele were bred with females expressing Cre recombinase in oocytes from the ZP3 promoter to generate the knockout allele (After Cre) lacking exon 2. <bold>B&#x00026;C) Nested PCR showing targeted integration at the 5' (B) and 3' (C) ends of the conditional allele</bold>. <bold>B) </bold>A gel of products from nested PCR reactions with primers from genomic DNA 5' to the 5' end of the targeting vector, and primers within the 5'-most loxP site that yield no product from WT DNA and a 2831 bp product (arrow) from the conditional allele (CA 5' PCR). ES clones 10, 22, 24, 25 and 38 were strongly positive while clones 27, 28, 36, 46 and 48 were negative. Marker sizes in kb are on the left.

Mice heterozygous for the CA allele were bred, tail samples of progeny were collected, and the DNA was subjected to PCR using primers that flank the 5' most loxP site yielding products of 214 bp for the wild type (WT) allele and 415 bp for the Conditional (CA) Allele.

RNAs containing exon 2 yield products of 606 bp while RNAs lacking exon 2 yield products of 75 bp.

In addition, a previous description of an <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mouse indicated some neuroanatomical defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We therefore examined the morphology of the brains of <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals. Our initial studies were performed on serial coronal sections of P22 brains of <italic>Nfix</italic>+/+ and <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice not maintained on supplemented diets. Gross examination of P22 <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- brains showed an apparent posterior extension of the cortical region that extended over the cerebellum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, double arrows in -/- versus +/+). This was the first indication of abnormalities in the brains related to cortical development. In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> the olfactory bulbs (OB) of the -/- animals appear somewhat smaller, but most or all of this size difference is due to accidental severing of portions of the bulb during brain removal. No major change in olfactory bulb size was seen in sections through the OB of 3 animals (not shown) but it is possible that subtle changes exist in some of the OB cell layers. We plan on examining OB structure in more detail in future studies. While WT and <italic>Nfix</italic>-/+ brains (not shown) exhibited the normal compact structure of the lateral ventricles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, +/+ arrow), the ventricles of <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice were expanded and filled with cells of an unknown origin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>. -/- arrow). These cells stained darkly with Cresyl violet, were tightly packed, and serial sections showed that they filled the most anterior regions of the lateral ventricles at P22. Additional studies showed that these cells were also present in the ventricles of dough-supplemented animals (not shown) and all subsequent analyses were performed on diet-supplemented animals. Analysis of brains at different ages indicated that these aberrant cells were present as early as P0 and they remained until at least P69 (not shown). Since the cells filled regions of the lateral ventricles, we performed immuno-staining with markers previously shown to stain ventricular and subventricular cells. <italic>Pax6 </italic>is a transcription factor that is expressed at high levels in prenatal ventricular zone cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and has previously been used as a marker for both prenatal and postnatal neural stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. At P12&#x02013;P16 (N = 3), <italic>Pax6 </italic>is highly expressed in both the normal ventricular zone cells in +/+ mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, +/+) and in the aberrant cells in the lateral ventricles of <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, arrow -/-). The expression of this marker of neural progenitor cells suggests that these cells could represent an aberrant type of neural stem cell in the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals. To determine whether any of these <italic>Pax6 </italic>positive cells were undergoing active proliferation we stained adjacent sections of brains with antibodies directed against <italic>Pax6 </italic>and phospho-histone H3 (pH3), a known marker of mitosis during cell proliferation. While 30&#x02013;50% of the aberrant cells stained with &#x003b1;-<italic>Pax6</italic>, only a few cells in the ventricular zone of both +/+ and <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice stained with &#x003b1;-pH3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, arrows in panel 4). Thus at most only a small fraction of these aberrant cells are actively proliferating.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Aberrant cortex depth and ventricular zone cells in <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice</bold>.

A few DCX expressing cells are seen in the +/+ brain, possibly representing migrating neurons destined for the rostral migratory stream (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, panels 1&#x02013;2, arrows) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Expansion of the cortex is most easily quantified by comparing the DV height of the cortex in coronal sections as measured from the dorsal brain surface to the most ventral region of the grey matter of the cortex and comparing this to the DV size of the ventral telencephalon and whole brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). From P22 to P69 both the cortex and septum showed an ~17&#x02013;20% increase in DV size in <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- versus WT animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). A similar DV expansion of the cingulate cortex and the septum was seen in postnatal brains from P7 to P69 as assessed by visual examination of serial coronal sections (RMG and JB, unpublished data). This dorsal-ventral expansion of the cortex is consistent with the anterior-posterior cortex expansion seen in gross brain images (for examples see Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>).

At P28 there were several major forebrain abnormalities. Dorsal views (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>) of the brains of P28 WT (+/+) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>) show that the overall shape of the two brains is different with the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- cortex more elongated in the anterior-posterior direction (A-P) compared to the +/+ brain. The extent of the exposed cerebellum is shorter in the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- brain. As noted above in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- brain is elongated in the dorso-ventral (D-V) direction; (compare Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>). The shape of the corpus callosum at this level is also different; it is more "u-shaped" in the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>) and the angle of junction of the fimbria and hippocampus is more oblique in the WT than in the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mouse. The shape of the hippocampus is also distorted in the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mouse, with a dorsal enlargement in CA1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>, arrows). The dentate gyrus is shorter in the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- brains (arrowheads in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>), and the angle of the "arrowhead" of the gyrus is larger. In addition, in some brains a slightly "wavy" appearance of the CA3/CA4 fields in posterior sections of the hippocampus are seen (<italic>e.g</italic>. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>), possibly indicating a change in cytoarchitecture of the pyramidal cell layer here. Finally, the A-P extent of the corpus callosum appears somewhat shorter in the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- than in the +/+ brain; it has just ended in 5D in the +/+ compared to 5G in the -/- brain. Such a change is consistent with the partial callosal agenesis noted in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; however, as discussed below these data are subject to interpretation due to the acallosal phenotype seen in 129 strain mice.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Nfix </italic>expression in developing brain</title><p>To determine whether the morphological changes seen in <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- brains might be cell-autonomous changes due to loss of <italic>Nfix </italic>expression in neurons or glia, we asked where <italic>Nfix </italic>is expressed during pre- and post-natal brain development. For these studies we performed immunohistochemistry using an NFIX-specific anti-peptide antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, &#x003b1;-NFIX). This antibody detects only NFIX and no other NFI family member as assessed by Western blot analysis of cells expressing each of the 4 NFI gene products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, compare left (&#x003b1;-HA) and right (&#x003b1;-NFIX) sides of panel A). Specificity of the antibody for immunohistochemistry was first tested by demonstrating loss of staining of WT brains upon preincubation of the antibody with the peptide used for its generation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, panels B&#x00026;B' vs. C&#x00026;C').

In addition, the poor weight gain and delayed eye and ear opening (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) indicate that <italic>Nfix </italic>may play an important role in the development of the gut and possibly the epithelial components of other organs. While this manuscript was in preparation another group generated and characterized mice containing a non-conditional <italic>lacZ</italic>-tagged <italic>Nfix </italic>disrupted allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Since there are both similarities and differences between the phenotypes of these two distinct mouse mutants we will discuss these in detail below.</p><p>The delayed eye and ear opening, poor weight gain, and lethality by ~P22 of <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, C&#x02013;D</xref>) are the most striking and earliest visible phenotypes due to loss of <italic>Nfix</italic>. We observed that supplementing the diets of <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals with a soft dough supplement helped alleviate the runting of the animals and allowed survival of most animals past P28 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Such supplementation had previously allowed us to rescue runting due to tooth defects in <italic>Nfic</italic>-/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, we have seen no tooth defects in <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice. Thus, this partial rescue of the lethality and runting with dietary supplement points strongly towards either a neurological defect that affects eating or digestion, or a defect or delay in gut development in the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals. Our preliminary data (not shown) indicate some changes in the timing of gene expression patterns in the small intestine. While the diet-supplemented <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals still have lower weights than their heterozygous or WT littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), the weight reduction is far less severe than is seen in non-supplemented animals and ~65% of diet-supplemented <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice survive past P40 and ~10% past P90. In one case, an <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- male has sired multiple litters, showing that <italic>Nfix </italic>is not essential for male fertility. A single adult <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- female has given birth to a small litter but failed to nurture it, resulting in death of the pups. Thus it appears that <italic>Nfix </italic>is not essential for reproduction <italic>per se</italic>, but may affect rearing behavior. The leg clasping phenotype seen previously in <italic>Nfix </italic>targeted mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] was also seen in our <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals maintained on soft dough, indicating that the neuroanatomical defects described below likely have behavioral consequences independent of the nutritional status of the animals. It will be of great interest to determine whether the observed failure to thrive is due to direct defects or delays in intestine development or function, or whether the neuroanatomical defects discussed below could influence food sensing or eating behavior. To distinguish between these possibilities it will be necessary to perform detailed analysis of intestine development and function, careful behavioral studies on the mutant mice, and to use the conditional allele described here to delete <italic>Nfix </italic>solely from brain or intestine cells and determine which region is responsible for the phenotype.</p><sec><title>Brain developmental changes in <italic>Nfix-/-</italic> mice</title><p>Previous studies showed that both <italic>Nfia </italic>and <italic>Nfib </italic>are essential for normal brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Loss of either gene results in agenesis of the corpus callosum although it is unclear whether the mechanisms leading to this loss are identical in the two mutants. Loss of <italic>Nfia </italic>also results in postnatal hydrocephalus in mice, while the P0 lethality seen in <italic>Nfib</italic>-/- mice precludes analysis of postnatal phenotypes in these animals. The changes seen in <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- brains are quite distinct from those seen with loss of either <italic>Nfia </italic>or <italic>Nfib</italic>. For example, callosal axons cross the midline in <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B&#x02013;C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). This differs markedly from the complete callosal agenesis seen in homozygous <italic>Nfia </italic>and <italic>Nfib </italic>knockouts. In a recently published study of a non-conditional <italic>Nfix </italic>disruption the authors conclude that loss of <italic>Nfix </italic>results in both hydrocephalus and partial callosal agenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. One possible explanation for this partial agenesis of the corpus callosum is the observation that virtually all 129 strain mice contain a recessive gene that results in callosal agenesis in ~25% of offspring and a reduced callosum size in 50% of progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To allow robust analysis of callosal defects, all mouse knockouts derived from 129 strain ES cells should be backcrossed at least 10 generations onto a strain that does not carry this trait (<italic>e.g</italic>. C57BL/6). Thus it will be important to determine whether callosal defects are evident when the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice are backcrossed to C57BL/6 for 10 or more generations.</p><p>Unlike the previous report, we have not detected hydrocephalus in our <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice, but instead find unusual <italic>Pax6</italic>- and DCX-positive cells within the lateral ventricles of the mice (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C&#x02013;E</xref>). These aberrant cells are present from at least P0 until past P69 although their abundance appears to decrease somewhat with age. These cells have been detected in every <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- brain sectioned (N = 10) and in no WT brains. While the nature and source of these cells is as yet unknown, it is intriguing that at P12&#x02013;16 they express <italic>Pax6</italic>, a marker for neural progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The normal expression of <italic>Nfix </italic>in the ventricular zone of postnatal animals at this age (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F&#x02013;H</xref>), together with the knowledge that ventricular zone progenitor cells express <italic>Pax6</italic>, strongly suggests that these cells are aberrant ventricular zone cells and may represent a hyperproliferation of these potential neural progenitor cells. Of possible relevance to this change in ventricular cell number, <italic>Nfix </italic>had previously been implicated in the etiology of glioblastoma formation in a mouse model system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. <italic>Nfix </italic>is a recurrent integration target in glioblastomas generated by intraventricular injection of retroviruses carrying the PDGF-B chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This system is used to identify oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that act in concert with PDGF-B chain to generate glioblastomas. Interestingly, <italic>Nfia</italic>, <italic>Nfib </italic>and <italic>Nfic </italic>were also shown to be integration targets in this system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus it will be of great interest to determine whether <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice are more prone to glioblastoma formation induced by PDGF-B retroviruses and other agents, and whether double mutants of <italic>Nfix </italic>with <italic>Nfia</italic>, <italic>Nfib </italic>or <italic>Nfic </italic>have additional neurological or oncological phenotypes. It is unclear why the previous study did not note these aberrant ventricular zone cells, since they have been seen in 100% of the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- brains from P0&#x02013;P69 (N = 10). Given that the phenotype is seen in 100% of the homozygous Cre-deleted animals, but not in any heterozygous or homozygous conditional allele-containing animals, this phenotype cannot be due to the presence of a linked or unlinked secondary mutation.</p><p>It is of interest that a fraction of these aberrant ventricular cells also express DCX, a marker of migratory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The presence of this marker could indicate the differentiation of aberrant ventricular zone cells into migratory neurons. However, an alternative explanation is that these aberrant ventricular cells represent migratory neurons destined normally for the rostral migratory stream (RMS), which fail to follow their normal migratory route to the olfactory bulb and instead populate the ventricle. In this case, these cells would be exhibiting a cell migration defect that could be related to the axonal guidance defects that cause callosal agenesis in <italic>Nfia </italic>and <italic>Nfib </italic>KO mice. Were the phenotype due to a failure of ventricular zone cells to enter the RMS, one might expect a decrease in the size of the olfactory bulb in the mutants as has been seen with some other mutations affecting cell migration or survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. While gross examination and preliminary data from sections of the olfactory bulb do not show major changes of structure as have been seen with some mutations affecting RMS migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], careful birthdating, cell marking, and migration studies must be performed to determine whether these aberrant ventricular cells are indeed migratory neurons. Should defects in olfactory bulb structure or function be detected, they could contribute to feeding defects in the animals and the observed failure to thrive.</p><p>Our current working hypothesis is that the expanded cortex (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), and the distortion of the hippocampus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), may be directly related to the process that produces these aberrant ventricular zone cells. Both the cortical expansion and aberrant ventricular cells have been seen in 100% of <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals (N = 10) in multiple sections along the anterior-posterior axis. Similar or even more dramatic expansions of the cortical surface area have previously been detected due to increased &#x003b2;-catenin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] or by deletion of the pro-apoptotic caspase, <italic>Casp9 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. While the cortical expansion seen here is less than that seen with these other mutations, it will be of interest to determine whether either of these pathways may be affected by loss of <italic>Nfix</italic>. In particular, it will be important to determine whether the cortical expansion is consistent with recent models of mechanisms regulating cortex development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. If the aberrant ventricular cells detected here indeed represent an increase in the neural stem cell population, it is possible that continued slow proliferation and differentiation of such stem cells could both expand the cortex and cause distortions of the hippocampus due to excessive cell production. We will test this hypothesis with cell-marking and birthdating studies and assessing neural stem cell numbers in WT and <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible differences in phenotype compared with previous studies</title><p>As noted above, previous investigators found postnatal lethality, partial callosal agenesis, severe hydrocephalus and skeletal defects in <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice which were either not seen or were significantly less severe in this study. Both studies deleted exon 2 of <italic>Nfix </italic>which as discussed above should generate a similar null allele. Some possible reasons for these apparent phenotype differences include mouse strain differences, nutritional differences, and subtle differences in the disrupted allele, each of which is discussed below. Different ES cells lines were used in the two studies and the mice analyzed were at differences stages of back-crossing to the C57BL/6 background. In the current study, animals were backcrossed from 3&#x02013;5 generations to C57BL/6 and thus should contain predominantly C57BL/6 genetic alleles. As discussed above, callosal agenesis is a known phenotype of 129 strain mice and it is necessary to backcross to a strain with normal callosum formation (<italic>e.g</italic>. C57BL/6) before assessing callosum formation. Hydrocephalus is also sometimes associated with callosal agenesis and thus these two apparent phenotypic differences may be linked. Any differences in these phenotypes between the two KO strains should diminish with further backcrossing if strain differences are significant.</p><p>In the current study, we were able to rescue substantially the postnatal lethality of the <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- mice by supplementation with a soft dough diet. Without this supplementation, all <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals lost over half their body weight from P10&#x02013;P22 and died, apparently of starvation. The previous study examined animals that were in the process of severe malnutrition and it is possible that such malnutrition could contribute to both hydrocephalus and skeletal defects. Given the normal cranial bones seen in our <italic>Nfix</italic>-/- animals (not shown), we feel it is unlikely that bone defects contribute in any way to the brain malformations seen here. It will be necessary to rear the two KO strains under identical nutritional conditions to assess whether this is a true difference in phenotype. Finally, the two strains differ in the structure of the final <italic>Nfix </italic>KO allele. The earlier KO allele, after Cre deletion of the neomycin-resistance marker, contained a fusion of a <italic>lacZ </italic>coding region to the first 4 coding residues of the 2nd exon, a deletion of the remainder of the 2nd exon and 32 residues of the adjacent intron, and addition of a loxP site 3' to the <italic>lacZ </italic>coding region. The current study generated a conditional allele with an insertion of a floxed 2nd exon and a neomycin-resistance gene within the adjacent 3' intron. This conditional allele was then bred to a ZP3-Cre transgenic strain resulting in deletion of the 2nd exon, ~1 kb of intron sequence 5' and 3' to exon 2 and the neomycin resistance marker, and retention of only a single loxP site. Thus the previous allele deleted all but 4 residues of exon 2 and some adjacent intron sequence and contains a <italic>lacZ </italic>coding region and loxP site, while the current allele deletes all of exon 2 and some adjacent intron sequence and contains a single loxP site. Thus it is possible that either the addition of the <italic>lacZ </italic>coding region or differences in the amount of intron sequence deleted between the two KO alleles could affect either the expression of adjacent genes or possible expression of downstream exons of either <italic>Nfix </italic>KO allele. The presence of termination codons at the 3' end of the <italic>lacZ </italic>sequence of the previous allele and early within the out-of-frame spliced exon1-exon 3 transcript of the current KO allele significantly reduces the probability of any translation of downstream exons from either locus. However it is possible that aberrant internal initiation of translation from exons downstream of the deleted exon 2 could occur with either allele. Since such unusual downstream internal initiation could occur theoretically at any initiation codon downstream of exon 2, to formerly test this hypothesis it would be necessary to generate antibodies to all of the potential in- and out-of-frame coding regions downstream of exon 2 to test for the presence of such peptides. This would be particularly difficult given the known alternative splicing of <italic>Nfix </italic>transcripts downstream of exon 2. Since all previous studies indicate that exon 2 codes for the DNA-binding and dimerization domains of NFI proteins, the current evidence makes it unlikely but not impossible that such aberrant downstream peptides could mediate some of the apparent differences in phenotype seen between the current and previous KO strains. We would reiterate that the lack of phenotype seen in the current conditional <italic>Nfix </italic>allele, combined with the highly penetrant phenotype of the Cre-deleted KO allele, strongly indicates that there are no unlinked or linked mutations that contribute to the observed phenotype in the current KO allele. Additional studies may be needed to reconcile the apparent differences seen between the previous and current <italic>Nfix </italic>KO alleles.</p><p>It has been noted that the temporal expression pattern seen here for NFIX protein in developing cortex may differ somewhat from the pattern seen previously for <italic>Nfix </italic>mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In previous studies <italic>Nfix </italic>mRNA was clearly detected in the dorsal VZ/SVZ region by E11.5 while here only weak expression of NFIX protein is seen in these regions at E12 and E13, with robust expression being seen at E17. Such differences may be due to differential translation of <italic>Nfix </italic>mRNA at these times, or to differences in the sensitivity and cellular resolution of <italic>in situ </italic>mRNA detection versus immunostaining. We are currently examining in more detail both the <italic>Nfix </italic>mRNA and protein expression patterns from E12&#x02013;E17 to resolve these possible discrepancies.</p><p>Given the high degree of sequence homology among NFI family members and the overlapping patterns of expression of the 4 mouse NFI genes, it is perhaps surprising that each of the mouse genes has been shown to have distinct roles in development. However, we are now beginning to see some similarities and possibly shared functions among the 4 mouse NFI genes. Loss of <italic>Nfia </italic>results in hydrocephalus, agenesis of the corpus callosum, defects in midline structures and changes in gene expression associated with a delay in oligodendrocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Many of these defects could be related to altered glial cell development in the brain. Similarly, loss of <italic>Nfib </italic>is also associated with midline glial cell defects and agenesis of the corpus callosum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The recent observation that either <italic>Nfia </italic>or <italic>Nfib </italic>can promote gliogenesis in the developing spinal cord also points to potential sharing of function during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We are currently testing for direct evidence of overlapping or shared functions between the 4 NFI genes by generating double-mutant mice in specific pairs of NFI genes.</p><p>Together with previous studies, these data indicate that 3 of the 4 NFI genes (<italic>Nfia</italic>, <italic>Nfib </italic>and <italic>Nfix</italic>) play important roles in brain development. In addition to their functions in brain development, at least 3 of the NFI genes also have essential roles in other organ systems including lung (<italic>Nfib</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], tooth (<italic>Nfic</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and intestine (<italic>Nfix</italic>). Since products of all 4 NFI genes appear to bind to the same DNA sequences with similar affinities, it will be of great interest to determine whether there are shared or distinct target genes for the different NFI isoforms in tissues affected by loss of individual NFI genes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Gene targeting and mouse strains</title><p>Genomic clones encompassing <italic>Nfix </italic>exon 2 were isolated from a mouse 129/Sv phage library as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A targeting vector was constructed with a 4.2 kb 5' homology arm containing all of exon 2 and 633 bp of intron 2, with a loxP site inserted 406 bp 5' to the start of exon 2. The 5' arm was followed by an FRT-flanked PGK-neo expression cassette in the opposite transcriptional orientation, a 3' loxP site, the contiguous 2.7 kb 3' homology arm and a PGK-diphtheria toxin A chain cassette in the opposite transcriptional orientation. Cre-mediated recombination deletes all of exon 2, 406 bp of intron 1 and 633 bp of intron 2.

Chimeras were bred with C57Bl/6 females and agouti progeny were screened for the presence of the targeted conditional KO allele by PCR with primers flanking the 5' loxP site.

Anti-NFIX was used at 1/20,000 for embryonic tissues and 1/12,500 for postnatal tissues, anti-<italic>Pax6 </italic>was used at 1/25,000, anti-DCX was used at 1/500 and anti-pH3 was used at 1/2000. Sections were incubated overnight at room temperature then washed several times in PBS and incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 to 2 hours at room temperature, followed by processing with a VECTASTAIN ABC kit for 1 hour at room temperature (A used at 1/500, B used at 1/500, PK6100, Vector Laboratories). Sections were processed for color reaction using nickel- 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB, D5905, Sigma) solution (2.5% nickel sulfate and 0.02% DAB in 0.175 M sodium acetate) activated with 0.01% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide or the glucose-oxidase modification thereof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], washed with 1X PBS multiple times, mounted on 3% gelatin-coated slides and coverslipped with DPX mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences, PA). Immunofluorescent staining was performed using a Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and DAPI (300 nM) staining of nuclei. Images were acquired on a PowerPhase digital camera (PhaseOne, Coppenhagen, Denmark), Zeiss AxioCam HRc (Zeiss, Germany) or a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope and were processed using Adobe Photoshop.</p></sec><sec><title>Western Blot analysis</title><p>Extracts of JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells transfected with vectors expressing N-terminal HA-tagged versions of NFIA, NFIB, NFIC and NFIX were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].
