Little is known about the functional capacity of these lymphocytes, which could provide insights into mechanisms of failure of viral control and liver damage in this setting. We compared the effector function of total circulating and intrahepatic CD8 T cells in CHB patients and healthy donors. We demonstrated that CD8 T cells from CHB patients, regardless of their antigen specificity, were impaired in their ability to produce interleukin-2 and proliferate upon TCR-dependent stimulation. In contrast, these CD8 T cells had preserved production of the proinflammatory cytokines interferon-&#x003b3; and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;. This aberrant functional profile was partially attributable to down-regulation of the proximal T cell receptor signaling molecule CD3&#x003b6;, and could be corrected in vitro by transfection of CD3&#x003b6; or replenishment of the amino acid arginine required for its expression. We provide evidence for depletion of arginine in the inflamed hepatic microenvironment as a potential mechanism for these defects in global CD8 T cell signaling and function. These data imply that polarized CD8 T cells within the HBV-infected liver may impede proliferative antiviral effector function, while contributing to the proinflammatory cytokine environment.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: ALT, alanine aminotransferase; CHB, chronic HBV infection; HBV, hepatitis B virus; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor cell.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Persistent infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a major global health threat, currently affecting over 350 million individuals worldwide and causing more than 1 million deaths annually. Immune clearance is thought to be mediated primarily through a strong virus-specific CD8 T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>); marked quantitative and qualitative defects in this response have been described in patients with chronic HBV infection (CHB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Patients with uncontrolled infection are distinguished from healthy HBV carriers by the presence of a large lymphocytic infiltrate in their livers, containing a high proportion of non&#x02013;antigen-specific CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Little is known about the characteristics of this generalized CD8 T cell population and its potential contribution to the failure of viral control and liver immunopathogenesis. In this study, we define the functional profile of non&#x02013;HBV-specific CD8 T cells in patients with CHB, and investigate aberrant expression of the proximal TCR-associated signaling molecules CD3&#x003b6; and CD28 as putative mechanisms contributing to the defects seen.</p><p>In other diseases of chronic inflammation and high-load antigenic persistence analogous to the situation in CHB, selective defects in global CD8 function have been associated with down-regulation of CD3&#x003b6; &#x000b1; CD28. These include autoimmune disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), and chronic viral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) and bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) infections. The CD3&#x003b6; chain is a proximal TCR-associated signaling molecule comprised of a disulphide-linked homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Upon TCR ligation, SRC family kinases phosphorylate the three ITAM residues on the intracytoplasmic domain of CD3&#x003b6;, and these then serve as docking sites for adaptor proteins such as ZAP-70, which potentiate further downstream signaling events. CD3&#x003b6; is structurally and evolutionarily unique from other CD3 components and plays a rate-limiting role in TCR&#x02013;CD3 complex assembly and efficient signal amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Along with CD3&#x003b6;, down-regulation of CD28, a proximal costimulatory molecule required for efficient signaling has also been described in viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) and associated with T cell anergy.</p><p>Selective defects in virus-specific CD8 T cell function have been described in several chronic viral infections and observed to be progressively lost in a predictable hierarchy according to the duration and strength of antigenic stimulation and availability of CD4 help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Loss of CD8-derived IL-2 is an early defect that has recently been found to result in poor viral control and disease outcome in HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Functional defects affecting nonantigen-specific CD8 would need to invoke factors other than excessive antigenic drive through MHC/peptide interactions. Bystander activation and effects of the large quantities of circulating HBV antigens are possible candidates. In addition, the liver microenvironment, where the nonantigen-specific CD8 T cells accumulate in HBV infection, has long been recognized to be immunotolerant. In active HBV infection, intrahepatic T cells would be exposed to a high level of production of HBV antigens and recurrent hepatic inflammation. Putative factors affecting non&#x02013;antigen-specific T cells include high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, hepatocyte expression of tolerizing ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), depletion of essential nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), or accumulation of toxic metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>In patients with CHB, we found a skewing of effector function in all CD8 T cells, regardless of their specificity. Compared with healthy donors, CHB patients had circulating and intrahepatic CD8 T cells with poor IL-2 production and proliferative potential. Our findings point to a dual pathogenic role for nonantigen-specific CD8 T cells within the liver, contributing to both liver inflammation and poor viral control. Investigation of the underlying signaling defects implicates a role for arginine deprivation triggering CD3&#x003b6; down-regulation and impairing T cell proliferation.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>CD8 T cells from CHB patients display reduced IL-2 and proliferative capacity upon stimulation through the TCR</title><p>To investigate the functional properties of the global CD8 T cell population in CHB, we performed a cross-sectional study comparing patients with different HBV disease profiles and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).

Similarly, TNF-&#x003b1; production and cytolytic potential (measured by surface expression of CD107) of global CD8 T cells were maintained in CHB, and tended to be higher in patients with active disease (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, a and b</xref>). Using PMA and ionomycin as a TCR bypassing signal, no differences in CD8 T cell effector function could be detected between CHB patients and controls (shown for IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>). This indicated that the functional biases noted could not be attributed to the increase in CD27<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD8 in CHB (unpublished data) because these &#x0201c;end-stage&#x0201d; effectors have impaired IL-2 production upon PMA/ionomycin stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Instead, it pointed to the skewed CD8 effector function resulting from aberrations within the TCR-associated signaling machinery. This was supported by the fact that cytokine skewing was maintained upon substituting anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3 alone or anti-CD3 in combination with irradiated APC.</p><p>CD8 T cells with this altered IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-2 ratio have recently been noted in other chronic viral infections, such as HIV and LCMV, and they were found to correlate with poor viral control and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). This impairment of IL-2 production would be expected to limit T cell clonal expansion potential, particularly within the liver, where CD4 help is restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). To test this, we measured the proliferative capacity of CD8 T cells upon mitogenic stimulation by CFSE dilution. Consistent with their impaired IL-2 production and/or a direct block of cell cycle progression, fewer CD8 T cells from patients with CHB divided, and those that did divide underwent fewer divisions than CD8 T cells from controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, a and b</xref>, bottom). The proportion of CD8 T cells able to undergo at least one division was significantly reduced in CHB patients with high viral load and expression of eAg, and showed a negative correlation with liver inflammation within the patient group (r<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 0.6; P &#x0003c; 0.04; unpublished data). Impaired CD8 division was seen upon stimulation of whole PBMCs, indicating that the available CD4 help could not compensate for the CD8 defect in these patients. Compatible with this, reduced IL-2 production by CD4 T cells was also noted in patients with HBV infection compared with healthy controls (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>Skewed IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-2 ratio in CD8 T cells from CHB patients regardless of specificity</title><p>HBV-specific CD8 T cells are markedly depleted in patients with CHB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), such that circulating responses are barely detectable, even when overlapping peptides covering the whole genome are applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Based on this finding, it is logical to assume that the majority of the CD8 T cells we are studying in the periphery of these patients are non-HBV specific. To confirm that the qualitative dysfunction we observed was not restricted to the HBV-specific CD8 T cells but also extended to other virus specificities, PBMCs from HLA-A2&#x02013;positive donors were stimulated directly ex vivo with peptides representing immunodominant HLA-A2&#x02013;restricted viral epitopes from CMV, EBV, and influenza A, in addition to HBV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>). Virus-specific CD8 from healthy donors produced predominantly IFN-&#x003b3;, but had a clear population of dual IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-2&#x02013;responding cells, whereas those from CHB patients only produced IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>). The percentage of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;positive to dual IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-2&#x02013;positive peptide-specific CD8 T cells was plotted as a ratio after subtraction of background readings from controls without peptide. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>, regardless of the virus specificity, there was a significantly higher IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-2 ratio in patients with active HBV infection compared with healthy donors (P &#x0003c; 0.01). Because CMV infection has also been reported to skew the repertoire of T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), and was therefore a potential confounding factor, we also compared exclusively CMV-specific responses in a subset of CHB patients and controls who were known to be CMV seropositive. The proportion of CD8 able to produce IL-2 in response to the immunodominant HLA-A2&#x02013;restricted NLV epitope from pp65 showed a stepwise reduction from healthy donors to low- and high-level CHB patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 c</xref>). These data further confirm that functional impairment is present in the generalized T cell population in patients with CHB, regardless of antigen specificity.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Determination of IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; production by CD8 T cells after stimulation with HLA-A2&#x02013;restricted viral peptides.</bold> (a) Representative flow cytometric dot plots to show distribution of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2&#x02013;positive responder cells after ex vivo stimulation with peptides (for IFN-A, CMV, HBV envelope pool) in a healthy donor and in a high-level carrier.

In each of the six CHB-infected donors, however, intrahepatic CD8 T cells almost exclusively produced IFN-&#x003b3;, resulting in a significantly raised mean IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-2 ratio compared with the non&#x02013;HBV-infected group (P &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>).

In other chronic infectious diseases such as HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), impairment in IL-2 production has been partially attributed to down-regulation of the CD3&#x003b6; chain, a proximal TCR-associated signaling molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). This molecule can be down-regulated independently of other CD3 signaling molecules, which maintain their expression on the cell surface. T cells with low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) or absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) CD3&#x003b6; maintain IFN-&#x003b3;, but not IL-2 production, and become refractory to TCR-induced proliferation. To determine whether CD3&#x003b6; down-regulation could be a factor contributing to the functional defects seen, we compared CD3&#x003b6; expression between controls (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 16) and patients with low (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 20) and high HBV load (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 12). CD3&#x003b6; expression was determined by intracellular staining after gating on CD3&#x003b5;, so that detected differences in the expression of CD3&#x003b6; would not be caused by down-regulation of the entire CD3 complex, but to isolated down-regulation of the CD3&#x003b6; homodimer (anti-CD3&#x003b5; binds an extracellular domain on the CD3&#x003b5; chain and does not interfere with binding of anti-CD3&#x003b6; to its intracellular determinant).

A tight lymphocyte gate and secondary gate over CD3&#x003b5;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8 cells has been applied. A marker was applied at the edge of the isotype control (solid black line) and the proportion of CD8 to the right of this line represented the CD3&#x003b6;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction.

Patients were classed as ALT high if their ALT was raised at the time of sampling or had been raised in the previous 6 mo to take account of patients with cyclical flares of liver inflammation. CD3&#x003b6; expression in CD8 T cells correlated inversely with each of the three parameters (P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 b</xref>). Patients with the most active HBV infection had the lowest CD3&#x003b6; expression in their CD8 T cells, with a mean reduction of 40% compared with controls. Expression of CD3&#x003b6; was also reduced in CD4 T cells from these patients, but to a lesser degree than the CD8 T cells (unpublished data), as noted previously in HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>CD3&#x003b6; down-regulation has been attributed to exposure to sustained inflammatory cytokines and antigenic stimulation; therefore, we hypothesized that it would be more pronounced in the intrahepatic compartment, which is the site of HBV replication and associated pathology. Intrahepatic lymphocytes were therefore isolated from six CHB patients and seven non&#x02013;HBV-infected patients undergoing diagnostic liver biopsies. For each patient, CD3&#x003b6; expression in intrahepatic and peripheral T cells was compared (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 c</xref>).

These data suggest that CD3&#x003b6; down-regulation may be potentiated by the combination of chronic viral-driven inflammation and other factors that are more pronounced in the CHB liver microenvironment.</p></sec><sec><title>CD28 is also down-regulated in CHB patients</title><p>Like CD3&#x003b6;, down-regulation of CD28 has been described in chronic viral infections such as HIV and CMV and has been associated with T cell anergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).

CD28 was significantly down-regulated in CD8 T cells from patients with high viral load, eAg expression, and liver inflammation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 c</xref>).

To confirm this functional association, we sought to specifically reconstitute levels of these two signaling molecules in CD8 T cells from CHB patients and assess the impact on their functional skewing. Freshly isolated, unstimulated CD3&#x003b6;CD28<sup>lo</sup> CD8 T cells from patients with CHB were transfected by electroporation with plasmid DNA encoding a chimeric receptor with intracellular CD3&#x003b6; and CD28 domains, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). These chimeric receptors had the human antibody P67 specificity for CD33 antigen; detection using fluorescent, soluble CD33Ag indicated a transfection efficiency of at least 60% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 a</xref>). After an overnight rest, transfected PBMCs were then stimulated with anti-CD3 and -CD28, which activated the cells through the TCR, with or without the addition of CD33Ag, which bound to the extracellular P67 domain of the chimeric receptor. The same experiments were repeated on untransfected cells that had also been passed through the AMAXA transfection protocol with PBS in place of DNA. When PBMCs or negatively selected CD8 T cells were stimulated through the TCR or through CD33 alone, low levels of IL-2 production were detectable by ELISA. Addition of both stimuli together substantially increased IL-2 production (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Production of IL-2 by the dual stimulus exceeded the combined additive effect of the TCR-dependent or transfection-specific stimuli separately. This suggests that the newly introduced CD3&#x003b6; and CD28 may not only be activated after the CD33Ag stimulus, but may also be recruited to TCR signaling after CD3/CD28 stimuli. Untransfected cells showed no increase in IL-2 production upon addition of CD33Ag stimulation. We were unable to exclude the possibility that some of the functional enhancement derived from increased signaling of &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; cells rather than recovery of the specific population of cells deficient in CD3&#x003b6;/CD28.

To investigate whether functional differences could be attributed to these altered levels of CD3&#x003b6; reconstitution, proliferative capacity of CD8 T cells was determined after 6 d of culture with a TCR-dependent stimulus in medium with or without <sc>l</sc>-arginine. PBMCs were rested in their respective mediums for 24 h before stimulation, to allow sufficient time for CD3&#x003b6; levels to be influenced by the extracellular <sc>l</sc>-arginine microenvironment at the point of triggering of proliferation. We observed that the proliferation of CD8 T cells taken from CHB patients and cultured in <sc>l</sc>-arginine&#x02013;free medium was lower than that for CD8 T cells cultured in medium with <sc>l</sc>-arginine (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 d</xref>). In the absence of arginine supplementation, CD8 T cells from CHB patients had a profound block in proliferation, and a partial block to proliferation persisted in serum supplemented with arginine in the physiological concentration range (unpublished data). These data suggest that the CD3&#x003b6; down-modulation and IL-2/proliferative deficiency observed directly ex vivo in CD8 T cells from patients with CHB may be partially attributable to deprivation of <sc>l</sc>-arginine.

To remove the problem of interpatient variability, we therefore compared changes in arginase activity within two individuals with eAg-negative CHB who we were able to sample repeatedly over periods of rapid disease fluctuation (spontaneous hepatic flares).

In this study, we demonstrated a functional bias of CD8 T cells in CHB, which could contribute to both the failure of viral control and the pathogenesis of the resultant liver inflammation. We found that the global CD8 population (including CD8 specific for HBV and for other chronic viruses), both in the circulation and the liver, were skewed toward IFN-&#x003b3;/TNF&#x003b1; production and impaired in their ability to produce IL-2 and proliferate. By scrutinizing the global CD8 T cells in CHB, we elucidated a mechanism that may contribute to the failure of virus-specific CD8 to survive and proliferate sufficiently to control HBV replication.</p><p>The study of HBV-specific CD8 has been restricted by the difficulty in detecting these cells in patients failing to control HBV infection. We have previously noted that the scanty populations detectable in patients with CHB have an impaired capacity for clonal expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>) and an enhanced propensity to Bim-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). In this study, we identify a mechanism that could contribute to both of these defects, resulting in an impairment of HBV-specific CD8 proliferation and a generalized intrahepatic T cell deficiency in IL-2 production in CHB. CD8 T cells have been shown to depend on autologous IL-2 production to drive their replication in settings of impaired CD4 help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), such as the CD4-depleted liver in CHB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). A local depletion in IL-2 could also contribute to the propensity of HBV-specific CD8 to undergo apoptosis through the IL-2-dependent Bcl-2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). The impairment in IL-2 production manifested by nonantigen-specific CD8 T cells could therefore impact upon the ability of the HBV-specific populations to both expand <italic>and</italic> survive. A generalized defect in the ability to mount efficient T cell responses in patients with CHB is supported by the long-standing clinical observation that these patients are significantly less likely to reject a liver transplant than patients with other chronic liver diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). It might also be expected to result in an impaired ability of CHB patients to control concurrent intrahepatic infections, particularly with other persistent noncytopathic viruses that are highly dependent on long-term T cell expansion and survival for their control. We suggest that the HBV-specific response, already depleted by other mechanisms such as PD-1&#x02013;induced anergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) and Bim-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), becomes more vulnerable to this additional global mechanism of intrahepatic T cell impairment than other more robust antiviral responses.</p><p>We observed that global CD8 T cells capable of IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; release are maintained in CHB patients with high viral load and liver inflammation. Although these two cytokines have the potential for noncytopathic inhibition of HBV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>), they may also potentiate hepatocyte damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; is a proinflammatory cytokine that induces chronic hepatitis when constitutively expressed in the liver of transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) and may also increase susceptibility to TNF-mediated liver damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). TNF-&#x003b1; has been demonstrated to mediate potent hepatocyte destruction, particularly when expressed in a cell-bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). This effect could be heightened in the HBV-infected liver, through the capacity of the HBx protein of HBV to sensitize hepatocytes to TNF-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; has been shown to stimulate the release of chemokines such as CXCL9 and CXCL10 from hepatocytes, driving chemotaxis of the nonantigen-specific hepatic infiltrate both in the transgenic mouse model of HBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>) and in human HCV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Similarly, lung pathology resulting from the failure of CD8 control of influenza and the subsequent infiltration of non&#x02013;antigen-specific lymphocytes can be prevented by blocking IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). A recent study has shown that TNF-&#x003b1; can also switch the liver from a site of immunoprivilege to one susceptible to immune destruction by the T cells it indirectly chemoattracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Thus, a propensity of bystander CD8 T cells in CHB to produce IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; could further drive the nonantigen-specific lymphocytic infiltrate and propagate liver inflammation.</p><p>Studies have shown that HBV-specific CD8 T cells are present at extremely low frequencies in the circulation and liver of patients with chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), even when overlapping peptides are used to screen for responses to the whole viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). The dysfunction we have observed, affecting all CD8 T cells, must therefore involve a &#x02018;bystander&#x02019; effect, and we have specifically shown that these defects extend to CD8 of unrelated specificities. Such a bystander defect, affecting all CD8 T cells regardless of specificity, has been attributed to down-regulation of the &#x003b6;-chain component of the CD3 signaling complex in several malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>]). These conditions are all characterized by chronic antigenic stimulation in the setting of persistent or recurrent inflammation, as is CHB. A mouse model of chronic bacterial infection dissected the mechanism whereby this combination led to global T cell &#x003b6; down-regulation and dysfunction, and confirmed the requirement for IFN-&#x003b3; together with sustained antigenic exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>), both of which are found in the HBV-infected liver. Because most of our CHB patients with high viral load also had liver inflammation, we could not distinguish whether HBV infection and/or the inflammatory milieu associated with chronic liver damage drove the signaling and functional defects we found.</p><p>High local levels of IFN-&#x003b3; are postulated to recruit myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), which mediate global down-regulation of CD3&#x003b6; in surrounding T cells, an effect that typically then extends from the infiltrating cells to affect circulating populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Whether there is an intrahepatic accumulation of MDSC in CHB needs to be investigated, but would be in keeping with the infiltration of the HBV transgenic mouse liver with many cell types, including granulocytes in response to IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). One of the mechanisms through which MDSCs may exert their effect is through the consumption of <sc>l</sc>-arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>); reduced levels of this conditionally essential amino acid have been associated with CD3&#x003b6; down-regulation and impaired proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Hepatocytes are also known to be a potent potential source of arginase I, which catabolizes arginine, and reduced <sc>l</sc>-arginine levels have been found after orthoptic liver transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). The capacity of macrophages to take up and catabolize arginine has been shown to be regulated by Th2 cytokines such as IL-10 and enhanced by an LPS-rich environment such as the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). We have recently found an increase in IL-10 in patients with flares of HBV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>), and there is a close temporal correlation between induction of IL-10 and the increases in arginase activity we noted with HBV disease activity (unpublished data). Whether enhanced arginase activity in these patients is dependent on the degree or type of liver inflammation and/or on HBV itself, and whether it is mediated by hepatocytes and/or infiltrating MDSCs or macrophages, remains to be determined.</p><p>We found a dependence on <sc>l</sc>-arginine for complete recovery of CD3&#x003b6; in T cells from HBV patients, consistent with it being a contributory factor. CD8 T cell proliferative capacity was more strikingly dependent on arginine replenishment, compatible with the recent observation that arginine depletion also causes G0-G1 phase growth arrest independently of CD3&#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). CD8 T cells from CHB patients showed some reconstitution of CD3&#x003b6; once they were removed from the source of antigenic stimulation and inflammation, even in the absence of arginine. Other factors are therefore likely to play a role in the inflamed liver environment, such as depletion of other essential nutrients, inflammatory or immunosuppressive cytokines, and accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates and other toxic metabolites. In particular, depletion of tryptophan and accumulation of tryptophan catabolites has also been shown to inhibit T cell proliferation via CD3&#x003b6; down-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). CD3&#x003b6; down-regulation and arginine deprivation have been noted to be most marked at the site of pathology (in the case of tumors for example), but to also extend to affect T cells in the periphery. In keeping with this, we found CD3&#x003b6; down-regulation and arginase induction to be most accentuated in the liver but also detectable in the periphery. It is possible that other persistent infections capable of triggering an analogous inflammatory milieu in the liver would similarly bias T cell signaling and function. Along these lines it is worth noting that HCV has been found to have a pervasive influence on non&#x02013;antigen-specific CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that CD8 T cells from patients with CHB have impaired IL-2 and proliferative capacity, regardless of their specificity. Such functional skewing could impair their survival and anti-viral potential, particularly for persistent noncytopathic viruses in the CD4-depleted liver environment. Their capacity for IFN-&#x003b3;/TNF-&#x003b1; production could contribute to the proinflammatory milieu, thereby exacerbating mechanisms underlying their dysfunction. The functional bias is corrected upon removal from the pathogenic environment and reversal of underlying signaling defects. Our data suggest that chronic exposure to the microenvironment of an inflamed liver could impair T cell effector functions critical to the control of this virus. A major limitation to the success of therapeutic vaccination in the setting of persistent virus infection such as HBV is thought to be the impaired T cell proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>). Approaches to remedy these T cell defects in patients with CHB could therefore form an important adjunct to future immunotherapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Subjects.</title><p>58 patients with CHB, 3 patients who had resolved acute HBV infection, and 28 healthy donors participated in the study. Informed consent was obtained, and the study was approved by the respective local ethical committees for the three participating clinics (Camden Primary Care Ethics Review Board, Royal Free Hospital and Medical School Research Ethics Committee, and Cambridge Research Ethics Committee). There was no significant difference in demographic variables (age/gender) between patient and control groups (Table I). 24 of the CHB patients were positive for HBeAg, and 19 of these also had raised ALT (&#x0003e;50 IU/liter) and high HBV DNA (&#x0003e;10<sup>6</sup> IU/ml) as quantified by an in-house PCR-based assay. All other patients were HBeAg negative, and positive for serum anti-HBe antibody. Two of the patients in this study who had spontaneous flares of eAg-negative CHB were followed up longitudinally and sampled repeatedly over several time points. Patients on antiviral therapy were excluded from the study. All patients were negative for antibodies to hepatitis C virus, delta virus, HIV-1, and HIV-2.</p><p>In addition, liver samples were obtained from 16 CHB-infected patients and from 15 patients with nonviral liver disease undergoing diagnostic liver biopsies or from resected tissue. Liver tissue was suspended in RPMI 1640 (Applied Biosciences) and macerated in a Petri dish. The cell suspension was then passed through a 70-&#x003bc;m filter, and intrahepatic lymphocytes were isolated.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Separation of PBMCs and detection of CD28 and intracellular CD3&#x003b6;.</title><p>PBMCs were isolated from fresh heparinized blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and resuspended in RPMI 1640 and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen).

To avoid any bias in arginase activity attributable to baseline differences in protein content of the liver sections, protein content for each sample was determined by the Biurret test. This allowed arginase activity to be standardized against protein content, expressed as IU/liter serum or IU/mg protein.</p><p><sc>l</sc>-arginine levels were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry.
